TI Research Progress in the Applications of Convolutional Neural Networks
   in Optical Information Processing
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB The explosive development of deep learning technology has led another wave of machine learning in recent years. Deep neural network, with the ability to recognize and extract abstract features, fit nonlinear relationships, against interference factors and generalization, is widely used in autopilot, target recognition, machine translation, speech recognition and other fields. The convolutional neural networks (CNN) are popular in optical information processing. In this paper, we introduce the basic concepts and structural components of CNN in detail, and review the applications in digital holography, fringe patterns analysis, phase unwrapping, ghost imaging, Fourier ptychographic microscopy, super-resolution microscopy, scattering medium imaging, optical tomography imaging, etc. We summarize the typical applications and existing shortages of CNN in optical information processing, and finally prospect the future development of convolutional neural networks.

SO REVISTA DE ESTUDOS DA LINGUAGEM
AB This paper presents a proposal for pedagogical use of MT in English for Specific Purpose (ESP) courses, aiming at investigating the efficiency of this technology as a support for reading scientific texts in English as a FL. The theoretical approach is on ESP, reading and comprehension and a proposal to use MT in ESP courses, aiming to understand the processing of MT and how this knowledge can raise benefits on reading comprehension for academic purposes. In addition, we discussed corpus linguistics and its relation to language teaching as well as its role in MT. The analysis shows that, due to the hybrid system that utilizes the rule-based system and the corpus-based system, Google Translate produces relatively understandable and readable texts. Despite its evident limitations, the tool can provide linguistic awareness when pedagogically explored by ESP teachers in academic context.

TI Quantum Generative Adversarial Network: A Survey
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Generative adversarial network (GAN) is one of the most promising methods for unsupervised learning in recent years. GAN works via adversarial training concept and has shown excellent performance in the fields image synthesis, image super-resolution, video generation, image translation, etc. Compared with classical algorithms, quantum algorithms have their unique advantages in dealing with complex tasks, quantum machine learning (QML) is one of the most promising quantum algorithms with the rapid development of quantum technology. Specifically, Quantum generative adversarial network (QGAN) has shown the potential exponential quantum speedups in terms of performance. Meanwhile, QGAN also exhibits some problems, such as barren plateaus, unstable gradient, model collapse, absent complete scientific evaluation system, etc. How to improve the theory of QGAN and apply it that have attracted some researcher. In this paper, we comprehensively and deeply review recently proposed GAN and QAGN models and their applications, and we discuss the existing problems and future research trends of QGAN.

AB As an increasing number of people embrace social media, mining data generated from the same has become an important task. Possible applications range from opinion mining, sentiment analysis to hate speech detection. More importantly, analyzing code-mixed multilingual text has gained popularity due to the reason that it holds important socio-cultural clues that may be lost in translation. Methods to effectively analyse code-mixed Hindi/English(Hinglish) text have been explored in this paper. Firstly, we generate a large scale code-mixed corpus that would aid in further research of code mixed text on social media. High-quality word embeddings are trained on this code-mixed text. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method by training machine learning models that improve upon the previous state-of-the-art using a much lighter and explainable architecture. Our main intention behind training the classifier model was not only high performance but also good model explainability and speed.

AB In this paper we propose an integrated framework of automatic bilingual subtitle generation for lecture videos, especially for MOOCs. The framework consists of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Sentence Boundary Detection (SBD), and Machine Translation (MT). Then we quantitatively evaluate the auto-generated subtitles, the manually produced subtitles from scratch, and the auto-generated subtitles with manual modification in term of accuracy and time expenditure, in both original and target languages. The result shows that the auto-generated subtitles in the original language (English) are fairly accurate already. By using them as the draft, human subtitle producers can save 54% of the working time and simultaneously reduce the error rate by 54.3%, which is a significant improvement. However, the effectiveness of machine translated subtitles (English to Chinese) is limited. In the end, if the proposed framework is applied, the total working time in preparing bilingual subtitles can be shortened by approximately 1/3, with no decline in quality.

TI The Sunspot Catalogues of Carrington, Peters and de la Rue: Quality

SO SOLAR PHYSICS
AB In the 19th century, several astronomers made observations of sunspots, recording their positions and sometimes their areas. These observations were published in the form of extensive tables, but have been unhelpful until now. Three of these observers were Richard C. Carrington, Christian H.F. Peters and Warren de la Rue (and their respective collaborators). They published, in various articles, the data corresponding to 26 641 sunspot positions (Carrington, Peters and de la Rue registered 4900, 14040 and 7701 sunspot positions, respectively). In this paper we present a translation of more than 400 pages of their printed numerical tables into a machine readable format, including an initial analysis targeted at detecting possible mistakes in the reading or in the original transcription. The observations carried out by these three astronomers have been made available at the Centre de Don,es Astronomiques de Strasbourg (http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/VizieR?-source=VI/138).

AB (i) There exists an NP-complete language L such that its unary coded version un-L is in ASpace(log log n). (ii) If P not equal NP, there exists a binary language L such that its unary version un-L is in ASpace(log log n), while the language L itself is not in ASpace(log n). As a consequence, under assumption that P not equal NP, the standard space translation between unary and binary languages does not work for alternating machines with small space, the equivalence L is an element of ASPACE(s(n)) = UN-L is an element of ASPACE(s(log n)) is valid only if s(n) is an element of Omega(n). This is quite different from deterministic and nondeterministic machines, for which the corresponding equivalence holds for each s(n) is an element of Omega(log n), and hence for s(log n) is an element of Omega(log log n).

AB The paper aims to propose a semantic representation of emotions for oral dialogues, based on an analysis of real-life conversations, telephone messages and recorded TV programmes, for the purposes of a speech to speech machine translation. Lexicon and phatics are one of important emotion eliciting factors as well as gestures, prosody and voice tone in oral dialogues. So, the semantic representation is made in a way where these factors are taken into account at the same time. Also, it's done within Universal Networking Language (UNL) formalism, where UW (universal word) plays an important role.

AB Persuasiveness is a creative art which aims at inducing certain set of beliefs in the target audience. In an e-commerce setting, for a newly launched product, persuasive descriptions are often composed to motivate an online buyer towards a successful purchase. Such descriptions can be catchy taglines, product-summaries, style-tips etc.. In this paper, we present PersuAIDE! - a persuasive system based on linguistic creativity to generate various forms of persuasive sentences from the input product specification. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, we have applied the technology to fashion domain, where, for a given fashion product like "red collar shirt" we were able to generate descriptive sentences that not only explain the item but also garner positive attention, making it persuasive.
   PersuAIDE! identifies fashion related keywords from input specifications and intelligently expands the keywords to creative phrases. Once such compatible phrases are obtained, persuasive descriptions are synthesized from the set of phrases and input keywords with the help of a neural language model trained on a large domain-specific fashion corpus. We evaluate the system on a large fashion corpus collected from different sources using (a) automatic text generation metrics used for Machine Translation and Automatic Summarization evaluation and Readability measurement, and (b) human judgment scores evaluating the persuasiveness and fluency of the generated text. Experimental results and qualitative analysis show that an unsupervised system like ours can produce more creative and better constructed persuasive output than supervised generative counterparts based on neural sequence-to-sequence models and statistical machine translation.

TI Semantic spaces for improving language modeling
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB Language models are crucial for many tasks in NLP (Natural Language Processing) and n-grams are the best way to build them. Huge effort is being invested in improving n-gram language models. By introducing external information (morphology, syntax, partitioning into documents, etc.) into the models a significant improvement can be achieved. The models can however be improved with no external information and smoothing is an excellent example of such an improvement.
   In this article we show another way of improving the models that also requires no external information. We examine patterns that can be found in large corpora by building semantic spaces (HAL, COALS, BEAGLE and others described in this article). These semantic spaces have never been tested in language modeling before.
   Our method uses semantic spaces and clustering to build classes for a class-based language model. The class-based model is then coupled with a standard n-gram model to create a very effective language model. Our experiments show that our models reduce the perplexity and improve the accuracy of n-gram language models with no external information added. Training of our models is fully unsupervised. Our models are very effective for inflectional languages, which are particularly hard to model. We show results for five different semantic spaces with different settings and different number of classes. The perplexity tests are accompanied with machine translation tests that prove the ability of proposed models to improve performance of a real-world application. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Some surfaces can only be inspected reliably, if they are observed under variable illumination. An automated inspection based on this principle requires taking and processing series of images in which each image shows the same surface's section with an illumination from a different angle. This paper presents a method to extract translation and rotation invariant features from such series of images. In our case, the invariant features are represented by fuzzy histograms and classified by an SVM (support vector machine). The robust performance of the method is demonstrated by the detection and classification of varnish defects.

AB Text generation systems are ubiquitous in natural language processing applications. However, evaluation of these systems remains a challenge, especially in multilingual settings. In this paper, we propose L'AMBRE - a metric to evaluate the morphosyntactic well-formedness of text using its dependency parse and morphosyntactic rules of the language. We present a way to automatically extract various rules governing morphosyntax directly from dependency treebanks. To tackle the noisy outputs from text generation systems, we propose a simple methodology to train robust parsers. We show the effectiveness of our metric on the task of machine translation through a diachronic study of systems translating into morphologically-rich languages.(1)

AB Sequence generation models trained with teacher-forcing suffer from issues related to exposure bias and lack of differentiability across timesteps. Our proposed method, Teacher-Forcing with N-grams (TeaForN), addresses both these problems directly, through the use of a stack of N decoders trained to decode along a secondary time axis that allows model-parameter updates based on N prediction steps. TeaForN can be used with a wide class of decoder architectures and requires minimal modifications from a standard teacher-forcing setup. Empirically, we show that TeaForN boosts generation quality on one Machine Translation benchmark, WMT 2014 English-French, and two News Summarization benchmarks, CNN/Dailymail and Gigaword.

During decoding, when candidates terminate or are pruned according to heuristics, our streaming approach periodically "refills" the batch before proceeding with a selected subset of candidates. We apply our method to variable-width beam search on a state-of-the-art machine translation model. Our method decreases runtime by up to 71% compared to a fixed-width beam search baseline and 17% compared to a variable-width baseline, while matching baselines' BLEU. Finally, experiments show that our method can speed up decoding in other domains, such as semantic and syntactic parsing.

AB This paper presents a new feature extraction method of Fourier descriptor based on the Zernike moments for pollen images recognition. Firstly, Zernike moments of the image are extracted in 3D spherical coordinates. Secondly, genetic algorithm based on probability is used to filter the Zernike moments to reduce redundant information. Finally the normalized Fourier transform coefficients are calculated as the last feature descriptor. The simulation results on Confocal dataset show that the descriptor can effectively describe the pollen images and is robust to the rotation, translation and scaling of the image.

AB This paper is an attempt to discover the main challenges in working with Baltic and Estonian languages, and to identify the most significant sources of errors generated by a SMT system trained on large-vocabulary parallel corpora from legislative domain. An immense distinction between Latvian/Lithuanian and Estonian languages causes a set of non-equivalent difficulties which we classify and compare.
   In the analysis step, we move beyond automatic scores and contribute presenting a human error analysis of MT systems output that helps to determine the most prominent source of errors typical for SMT systems under consideration.

AB The role of lexical resources is often understated in NLP research. The complexity of Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) poses special challenges to developers of NLP tools, especially in the area of word segmentation (WS), information retrieval (IR), named entity extraction (NER), and machine translation (MT). These difficulties are exacerbated by the lack of comprehensive lexical resources, especially for proper nouns, and the lack of a standardized orthography, especially in Japanese. This paper summarizes some of the major linguistic issues in the development NLP applications that are dependent on lexical resources, and discusses the central role such resources should play in enhancing the accuracy of NLP tools.

AB Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models have achieved tremendous success in text generation tasks. However, there is no guarantee that they can always generate sentences without grammatical errors. In this paper, we present a preliminary empirical study on whether and how much automatic grammatical error correction can help improve seq2seq text generation. We conduct experiments across various seq2seq text generation tasks including machine translation, formality style transfer, sentence compression and simplification. Experiments show the state-of-the-art grammatical error correction system can improve the grammaticality of generated text and can bring task-oriented improvements in the tasks where target sentences are in a formal style.

On a standard German-French test set, Vecalign outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method (which has quadratic time complexity and requires a machine translation system) by 5 F-1 points. It substantially outperforms the popular Hunalign toolkit at recovering Bible verse alignments in medium- to low-resource language pairs, and it improves downstream MT quality by 1.7 and 1.6 BLEU in Sinhala!English and Nepali!English, respectively, compared to the Hunalign-based Paracrawl pipeline.

The examined corpus contains 1020 articles that were accepted for full presentation in PACLIC along the last 18 years. The experimental results for 5 chosen domains (digital humanities, language resources, machine translation, sentiment analysis and opinion mining, and social media) suggest that development trends of domains and keyphrases can be efficiently measured. Top bigrams and trigrams were found as efficient to identify general trends in NLP domains.

Parts of speech tagging, pragmatic analysis, machine translation, discourse analysis etc are the different fields in NLP. Malayalam is the one of the important language in Dravidian family, where the difficult grammar structure will be the main problem. Pragmatics analysis of Malayalam sentences mainly represent how sentences are used in different situation or different context. In proposed system we can apply pragmatics for Malayalam sentence to understand the user intention about a particular sentence.

TI Laser-video scanner calibration without the use of frame stove
SO IEE PROCEEDINGS-VISION IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB A calibration method for a structured light surface scanner is presented. The method uses a model-based calibration, accounting for laser stripe and translation stage alignment, and the internal and external camera parameters. The inclusion of nonlinear radial distortion in the camera model improves its calibration accuracy over a linear model. The method has been designed for laser-video scanner systems that use hardware-based measurement of the illuminated line position, rather than a frame store. Standard camera-based calibration techniques cannot be used for such systems. However, the method is also applicable to systems that use software-based stripe segmentation.

AB Deep Learning has enabled remarkable progress over the last years on a variety of tasks, such as image recognition, speech recognition, and machine translation. One crucial aspect for this progress are novel neural architectures. Currently employed architectures have mostly been developed manually by human experts, which is a time-consuming and error-prone process. Because of this, there is growing interest in automated neural architecture search methods. We provide an overview of existing work in this field of research and categorize them according to three dimensions: search space, search strategy, and performance estimation strategy.

Thus, the field still remains focused on analysis of Western media, leading to misunderstanding the geopolitical impact of global media. The article explores emerging media monitoring technologies which have arisen out of developments in natural language processing and machine generated translation. Finally, the article explores innovative research programs that utilize these technologies for global media research and education.

AB We propose a large margin criterion for training neural language models. Conventionally, neural language models are trained by minimizing perplexity (PPL) on grammatical sentences. However, we demonstrate that PPL may not be the best metric to optimize in some tasks, and further propose a large margin formulation. The proposed method aims to enlarge the margin between the "good" and "bad" sentences in a task-specific sense. It is trained end-to-end and can be widely applied to tasks that involve re-scoring of generated text. Compared with minimum-PPL training, our method gains up to 1.1 WER reduction for speech recognition and 1.0 BLEU increase for machine translation.

We propose an end-to-end deep neural architecture for sentence alignment. In addition to one-to-one alignment, our aligner can perform cross alignment as well. We used three language pairs from Europarl corpus and an English-Persian corpus to generate an alignment dataset. Using this dataset, we tested our system both in isolation and in an SMT system. In both settings, we obtained significantly better results compared to two competitive baselines.

The feature values of the compared phones taken from the standard IPA charts are treated as independent parameters that give rise to corresponding Euclidean distances. As an illustration, the general phone set is mapped to Ukrainian phonemes. The proposed model agrees well with the historical linguistic facts and experimental phonetic data. The described approach may find its due applications in various fields of linguistics and speech technologies, including historical and typological linguistics, language acquisition, phonetic studies, computational phonology, machine translation, information retrieval, and text-to-speech conversion.

AB Reverse Engineering has been an extremely important field in software engineering, it helps us to better understand and analyze the internal architecture and interrealtions of executables. Classical Java reverse engineering task includes disassembly and decompilation. Traditional Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) based disassemblers and decompilers are strictly rule defined and thus highly fault intolerant when bytecode obfuscation were introduced for safety concern. In this work, we view decompilation as a statistical machine translation task and propose a decompilation framework which is fully based on self-attention mechanism. Through better adaption to the linguistic uniqueness of bytecode, our model fully outperforms rule-based models and previous works based on recurrence mechanism.

In this paper, we present an efficient context-dependent word alignment model based on maximum entropy (ME) approach. All knowledge sources are treated as feature functions in this model, such as source words, POS information and bilingual dictionary. This approach allows easy integration of more context-dependent information. We perform experiments on a Chinese-Japanese parallel corpus and the results are compared with a manually produced reference alignment:. We achieve good alignment accuracy in a very noisy environment using unsupervised train method. And the effects of different features are also evaluated.

TI Identification of Novel Antibacterials Using Machine Learning Techniques
SO FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
AB Many pharmaceutical companies are avoiding the development of novel antibacterials due to a range of rational reasons and the high risk of failure. However, there is an urgent need for novel antibiotics especially against resistant bacterial strains. Available in silico models suffer from many drawbacks and, therefore, are not applicable for scoring novel molecules with high structural diversity by their antibacterial potency. Considering this, the overall aim of this study was to develop an efficient in silico model able to find compounds that have plenty of chances to exhibit antibacterial activity. Based on a proprietary screening campaign, we have accumulated a representative dataset of more than 140,000 molecules with antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli assessed in the same assay and under the same conditions. This intriguing set has no analogue in the scientific literature. We applied six in silico techniques to mine these data. For external validation, we used 5,000 compounds with low similarity towards training samples. The antibacterial activity of the selected molecules against E. coli was assessed using a comprehensive biological study. Kohonen-based nonlinear mapping was used for the first time and provided the best predictive power (av. 75.5%). Several compounds showed an outstanding antibacterial potency and were identified as translation machinery inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. For the best compounds, MIC and CC50 values were determined to allow us to estimate a selectivity index (SI). Many active compounds have a robust IP position.

TI Semi Supervised Method for Detection of Ambiguous Word and Creation of
   Sense: Using WordNet
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB Machine Translation, Information Retrieval and Knowledge Acquisition are the three main applications of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). The sense of a target word can be identified from a dictionary using a 'bag of words', i.e. neighbours of the target word. A target word has the same spelling of the word but with a different meaning, i.e. chair, light etc. In WSD, the key input sources are sentences and target words. But, instead of providing a target word, this should automatically be detected. If a sentence has more than one target word, then the filtration process will require further processing. In this study, the proposed framework, consisting of buzz words and query words has been developed to detect target words using the WordNet dictionary. Buzz words are defined as a 'bag-of-words' using POS-Tags, and query words are those words having multiple meanings. The proposed framework will endeavor to find the sense of the detected target word using its gloss and with examples containing buzz words. This is a semi-supervised approach because 266 words of multiple meanings have been labelled from various sources and used based on an unsupervised approach to detect the target word and sense (meaning). After experimenting on a dataset consisting of 300 hotel reviews, 100 % of the target words for each sentence were detected with 84 % related to the sense of each sentence or phrase.

AB Among the well-known accessibility services for audiovisual media are subtitling for the deaf and hard-of-hearing, audio description, and sign language interpreting. More recently, automatic text simplification has emerged as a topic in the context of media accessibility, with research often approaching the task as a case of (sentence-based) monolingual machine translation. This approach relies on large amounts of high-quality parallel data, which is why monolingual sentence alignment has gained momentum. Alignment for text simplification is a complex task, with alignments often taking the form of n:m (in contrast to the standard case of 1:1 in machine translation). In this contribution, we evaluate the performance of different alignment methods against a human-created gold standard of standard German/simplified German sentence alignments created from a number of parallel corpora. Two of the corpora contain multiple levels of simplification.
   We employ a variety of alignment methods developed for monolingual tasks and bilingual sentence alignment. We explore strategies such as ensembling and score-based filtering to further improve the performance over these baselines. We show that combining multiple alignment methods with various hard voting strategies can outperform even the best individual methods and that we achieve similar results with score-based filtering of extracted alignments to find the most promising candidates. Our results motivate the notion that the overall task of sentence alignment for automatic simplification of German should be viewed as a two-step process that goes beyond the application of individual alignment methods.

TI Dependency-based syntax-aware word representations
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Dependency syntax has been demonstrated highly useful for a number of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Typical approaches of utilizing dependency syntax include TreeRNN and Tree-Linearization, both of which exploit explicit 1-best tree outputs from a welltrained parser as inputs. However, these approaches may suffer from error propagation due to the inevitable errors contained in the 1-best tree outputs. In this work, we propose a novel approach to integrate dependency syntax without using the discrete tree outputs. The key idea is to use the intermediate hidden representations of a welltrained encoder-decoder dependency parser, which are referred to as Dependency-based Syntax-Aware Word Representations (Dep-SAWRs). Then, we simply concatenate such DepSAWRs with the conventional context-insensitive word embeddings to compose input word representations, without requiring to modify the model architecture of the downstream tasks. We evaluate the proposed method on four kinds of typical NLP tasks, including sentence classification, sentence matching, sequence labeling and machine translation. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is highly promising. On the one hand, it can utilize dependency syntax effectively, bringing consistently better performance on the four tasks compared with baselines without using syntax. On the other hand, the proposed method can outperform the Tree-RNN and Tree-Linearization approaches in most settings, and meanwhile are highly efficient in syntax integration. In addition, the proposed method would be easily extendable to encoding other structural attributes of language. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Machine Translation tasks must tackle the ever-increasing sizes of parallel corpora, requiring space and time efficient solutions to support them. Several approaches were developed based on full-text indices, such as suffix arrays, with important time and space achievements. However, for supporting bilingual tasks, the search time efficiency of such indices can be improved using an extra layer for the text alignment. Additionally, their space requirements can be significantly reduced using more compact indices. We propose a search procedure on top of a compact bilingual framework that improves bilingual search response time, while having a space efficient representation of aligned parallel corpora.

AB A method of recognizing two-dimensional objects is proposed by using the concept of generalized incremental circle transform. The generalized incremental circle transform, which maps the boundary of an object into a circular disc, efficiently represents the shape of the boundary that is obtained from the object's digitized binary image. For this, a vector function is derived which is invariant under object translation, rotation and scaling using the generalized incremental circle transform. This function is used as feature information for recognizing two-dimensional objects of simple shape efficiently.

AB Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer an opportunity for the adoption of self-driving networks. However, network operators or home-network users still do not have the right tools to exploit these new advancements in AI, since they have to rely on low-level languages to specify network policies. Intent-based networking (IBN) allows operators to specify high-level policies that dictate how the network should behave without worrying how they are translated into configuration commands in the network devices. However, the existing research proposals for IBN fail to exploit the knowledge and feedback from the network operator to validate or improve the translation of intents. In this paper, we introduce a novel intent-refinement process that uses machine learning and feedback from the operator to translate the operator's utterances into network configurations. Our refinement process uses a sequence-to-sequence learning model to extract intents from natural language and the feedback from the operator to improve learning. The key insight of our process is an intermediate representation that resembles natural language that is suitable to collect feedback from the operator but is structured enough to facilitate precise translations. Our prototype interacts with a network operator using natural language and translates the operator input to the intermediate representation before translating to SDN rules. Our experimental results show that our process achieves a correlation coefficient squared (i.e., R-squared) of 0.99 for a dataset with 5000 entries and the operator feedback significantly improves the accuracy of our model.

   ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE
AB Interstitial lung disease (ILD), representing a collection of disorders, is considered to be the deadliest one, which increases the mortality rate of humans. In this paper, an automated scheme for detection and classification of ILD patterns is presented, which eliminates low inter-class feature variation and high intra-class feature variation in patterns, caused by translation and illumination effects. A novel and efficient feature extraction method named Template-Matching Combined Sparse Coding (TMCSC) is proposed, which extracts features invariant to translation and illumination effects, from defined regions of interest (ROI) within lung parenchyma. The translated image patch is compared with all possible templates of the image using template matching process. The corresponding sparse matrix for the set of translated image patches and their nearest template is obtained by minimizing the objective function of the similarity matrix of translated image patch and the template. A novel Blended-Multi Class Support Vector Machine (B-MCSVM) is designed for tackling high-intra class feature variation problems, which provides improved classification accuracy. Region of interests (ROIs) of five lung tissue patterns (healthy, emphysema, ground glass, micronodule, and fibrosis) selected from an internal multimedia database that contains high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) image series are identified and utilized in this work. Performance of the proposed scheme outperforms most of the state-of-art multi-class classification algorithms.

SO ACTA BALTICO-SLAVICA
AB This article is devoted to the manually aligned and tagged bilingual parallel CLARIN-PL-BIZ corpora of the Baltic and Slavic languages which are currently being developed. The study discusses the essential features of these corpora that make their applications go far beyond typical corpus analysis. Applications of these corpora include the design of cross-language models for the development of machine translation and artificial intelligence. The article also draws attention to the high potential of these resources as a model training base for testing natural language processing tools.

AB State-of-the-art methods for unsupervised bilingual word embeddings (BWE) train a mapping function that maps pre-trained monolingual word embeddings into a bilingual space. Despite its remarkable results, unsupervised mapping is also well-known to be limited by the dissimilarity between the original word embedding spaces to be mapped. In this work, we propose a new approach that trains unsupervised BWE jointly on synthetic parallel data generated through unsupervised machine translation. We demonstrate that existing algorithms that jointly train BWE are very robust to noisy training data and show that unsupervised BWE jointly trained significantly outperform unsupervised mapped BWE in several cross-lingual NLP tasks.

TI A Structured Review of the Validity of BLEU
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB The BLEU metric has been widely used in NLP for over 15 years to evaluate NLP systems, especially in machine translation and natural language generation. I present a structured review of the evidence on whether BLEU is a valid evaluation techniquein other words, whether BLEU scores correlate with real-world utility and user-satisfaction of NLP systems; this review covers 284 correlations reported in 34 papers. Overall, the evidence supports using BLEU for diagnostic evaluation of MT systems (which is what it was originally proposed for), but does not support using BLEU outside of MT, for evaluation of individual texts, or for scientific hypothesis testing.

AB Generative adversarial networks(GANs) coming from the game theory allow machines to learn deep representations without extra training data. By training two adversarial networks, including a generator and a discriminator, GANs could get the distribution of the real samples. This capability makes it a prospect learning method in image synthesis, image recognition, image translation etc. In this paper, we survey the state of the art of GANs by categorizing the GANs into four classifications on the basis of GANs' functions and list two application domains: vision computing & natural language processing(NLP) regarding to GANs' applications.

We provide a measure theoretic framework to extend the existing Cumulative Distribution Transform [29] to arbitrary (signed) signals on (R) over bar. We present both forward (analysis) and inverse (synthesis) formulas for the transform, and describe several of its properties including translation, scaling, convexity, linear separability and others. Finally, we describe a metric in transform space, and demonstrate the application of the transform in classifying (detecting) signals under random displacements.

AB We present two simple modifications for word-level perturbation: Word Replacement considering Length (WR-L) and Compositional Word Replacement (CWR). In conventional word replacement, a word in an input is replaced with a word sampled from the entire vocabulary, regardless of the length and context of the target word. WR-L considers the length of a target word by sampling words from the Poisson distribution. CWR considers the compositional candidates by restricting the source of sampling to related words that appear in subword regularization. Experimental results showed that the combination of WR-L and CWR improved the performance of text classification and machine translation.

The direct connection to output devices such as computer-numerically controlled routers, 3d printers and embedded electronics provide a unique opportunity for controlled variation and serial differentiation and seeks to exploit mass customization rather than standardization. Through a series of studies the process from design to machine file to finish product is explored. This connection to digitally driven fabrication equipment creates within the design process an opportunity to realize one's designs both digitally and material

AB One way to reduce network traffic in multinode data-parallel stochastic gradient descent is to only exchange the largest gradients. However, doing so damages the gradient and degrades the model's performance. Tranformer models degrade dramatically while the impact on RNNs is smaller. We restore gradient quality by combining the compressed global gradient with the node's locally computed uncompressed gradient. Neural machine translation experiments show that Transformer convergence is restored while RNNs converge faster. With our method, training on 4 nodes converges up to 1.5x as fast as with uncompressed gradients and scales 3.5x relative to singlenode training.

Other problems (Disambiguation) are almost solved or about to be solved. Many challenges (Natural language translation) still remain.

The history of NIT evaluation is long and checkered - the search for objective, measurable, resource-reduced methods of evaluation continues. A recent trend towards task-based evaluation inspires the question - can we use methods of evaluation of language competence in language learners and apply them reasonably to MT evaluation? This paper is the first in a series of steps to look at this question. In this paper, we will present the theoretical framework for our ideas, the notions we ultimately aim towards and some very preliminary results of a small experiment along these lines.

Applications (e.g. semantic understanding, machine translation, and information retrieval) are affected if metaphors can not be identified appropriately. This paper presents a three-phase method for recognizing Chinese metaphor phrases from a large-scale corpus. First, we acquire the context of every candidate phrase. Then hierarchical clustering is used to cluster the phrases based on their contextual information. Finally, heuristic rules are used on the clustering result to determine whether a candidate phrase is a metaphor phrase. Experimental results show the method achieves a satisfactory performance.

AB Present growth of silicon-based conventional computing is moving towards its saturation level. This fact has inspired researchers in the world to perform computation in non-conventional manner. This inspiration has given birth to several non-conventional computing technique viz. DNA Computing, Quantum Computing, Membrane Computing etc.. Each computing technique has their own advantages and disadvantages. Among these new computing techniques, biology has inspired DNA computing, Membrane computing etc. DNA computing has proven its power of computing computationally "hard" problem that requires to search large search space. But in general its efficiency is decreased because several manual intervention is required to perform DNA bio-molecular operations in DNA lab. This bio-molecular operations takes huge time to perform. On the other hand, another cell molecule Ribosome acts as a translator of genetic code, that can be used to overcome these shortcomings by properly controlling this translation procedure. Recently artificial ribosome has also been developed. This ribosome acts as close as possible to natural ribosome and translation can be controlled by proper mutations in rRNA. This mRNA-Ribosome system creates a computational pathway, where no manual intervention is necessary and hence speeds up computation procedure. In this work, first it has been shown that, mRNA-ribosome system behaving like conventional flip-flops can be designed. A possible design of Moore machine has also been proposed in this work. Hence using this combination, any sequential circuit can be designed using this system in an effective and convenient manner.

TI CODIT: Code Editing With Tree-Based Neural Models
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
AB The way developers edit day-to-day code tends to be repetitive, often using existing code elements. Many researchers have tried to automate repetitive code changes by learning from specific change templates which are applied to limited scope. The advancement of deep neural networks and the availability of vast open-source evolutionary data opens up the possibility of automatically learning those templates from the wild. However, deep neural network based modeling for code changes and code in general introduces some specific problems that needs specific attention from research community. For instance, compared to natural language, source code vocabulary can be significantly larger. Further, good changes in code do not break its syntactic structure. Thus, deploying state-of-the-art neural network models without adapting the methods to the source code domain yields sub-optimal results. To this end, we propose a novel tree-based neural network system to model source code changes and learn code change patterns from the wild. Specifically, we propose a tree-based neural machine translation model to learn the probability distribution of changes in code. We realize our model with a change suggestion engine, Codit, and train the model with more than 24k real-world changes and evaluate it on 5k patches. Our evaluation shows the effectiveness of Codit in learning and suggesting patches. Codit can also learn specific bug fix pattern from bug fixing patches and can fix 25 bugs out of 80 bugs in Defects4J.

Information is often not available about the language of representation of the personal name. Therefore, the problem of automated identification of the language by the structure of the name-and-surname group is actual. Another problem is the automation of rule creation processes for the transcription of personal names. This paper proposes an algorithmic approach to solve these problems using the methods of machine learning.

TI Query Rewriting for Nondeterministic Tree Transducers
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB We consider the problem of deciding whether a query can be rewritten by a nondeterministic view. It is known that rewriting is decidable if views are given by single-valued non-copying devices such as compositions of single-valued extended linear top-down tree transducers with regular look-ahead, and queries are given by deterministic MSO tree transducers. In this paper, we extend the result to the case that views are given by nondeterministic devices that are not always single-valued. We define two variants of rewriting: universal preservation and existential preservation, and discuss the decidability of them.

AB A rotation invariant texture classification algorithm based on dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) and support vector machines (SVM) is proposed. First, the texture image is transformed by Radon transform to convert the rotation to translation, the rotation invariant feature vector is composed of the energies of the subbands acquired by DT-CWT which is shift invariant to the transformed texture image, the SVM algorithm is used to the texture classification at last. This algorithm is compared with the classifier of probabilistic neural network (PNN) and other rotation invariant texture classification algorithm, the experiment results show that it can improve the classification rate effectively.

The principal gains of the system equations of the sprayer can be used as a reliable measure to quantify the mechanical performance of the sprayer. They describe how disturbances will be transmitted through the machine as a function of the frequency. The principal gains of a transfer function matric can also be utilized in a mathematical programming problem with which the mechanical performance of the sprayer is optimized.

TI Human-Machine Interface Degree of Freedom Effects on Performance in
   Space Telerobotics
SO AEROSPACE MEDICINE AND HUMAN PERFORMANCE
AB INTRODUCTION: There are many potential human-machine interfaces for controlling complex robotics. However, restrictions in hardware, software, or human capability may pose limits on the input device degrees-of-freedom (DOF). This study examined effects on operational performance and strategy when interface DOF were limited, hypothesizing that different limitations on interface DOF would affect operator performance and technique.
   METHODS: Experiments used a Canadarm2 simulator with a dual-joystick interface adapted to operate under limited DOF conditions. Four interfaces were compared: full multiaxis (FM), limited translation (TL), limited rotation (RL), and without simultaneous translation/rotation or "non-bimanual"(NB). Subjects were tasked with operating the Canadarm2 in a simulated ISS control scenario to approach and grapple a moving cargo vehicle within a 90-s time limit.
   RESULTS: No significant difference was seen between FM and RL in task time or grapple success, and both were significantly different from TL. NB exhibited significantly increased task time from FM and RL, but no significant difference in grapple success rate. When rotating, subjects decreased time spent using multirotation for NB over FM.
   DISCUSSION: Similar performance between FM and RL suggests that restricting rotation may be preferred for interfaces with DOF design limits. For the NB condition, there was increased task time combined with decreased multirotation, highlighting potential use for NB in training for rotation efficiency. Two different strategies were observed during TL to overcome inability to visually track, align with, and move toward the target simultaneously. Examination of these techniques provides insight on which strategic elements were most critical for success.

AB The process of stripping off affixes from a word to arrive at root word or lemma is known as Lemmatization. The usefulness of lemmatizer in natural language operations cannot be overlooked especially if the language is rich in its morphology. A lexicon cum rule based lemmatizer is built for Sanskrit Language. The Lemmatizer has profound applications in NLP main stream tasks like Information Retrieval, Morphological Analyzer ,POS taggers, Question-Answering Systems, Machine Translation Systems etc. Here the Sanskrit rule based morphological analyzer augmented with lemmatizer proved, analyzing Sanskrit word more precise and accurate to its morphological characteristics.

SO LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
AB Partial cognates are pairs of words in two languages that have the same meaning in some, but not all contexts. Detecting the actual meaning of a partial cognate in context can be useful for Machine Translation tools and for Computer-Assisted Language Learning tools. We propose a supervised and a semi-supervised method to disambiguate partial cognates between two languages: French and English. The methods use only automatically-labeled data; therefore they can be applied to other pairs of languages as well. The aim of our work is to automatically detect the meaning of a French partial cognate word in a specific context.

AB Recent years the task of incomplete utterance rewriting has raised a large attention. Previous works usually shape it as a machine translation task and employ sequence to sequence based architecture with copy mechanism. In this paper, we present a novel and extensive approach, which formulates it as a semantic segmentation task. Instead of generating from scratch, such a formulation introduces edit operations and shapes the problem as prediction of a word-level edit matrix. Benefiting from being able to capture both local and global information, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several public datasets. Furthermore, our approach is four times faster than the standard approach in inference.

AB Word sense disambiguation is essential for semantic analysis in many natural language-related applications, such as information retrieval, data mining, and machine translation. One of the effective models for word sense disambiguation is the word space model that represents context vectors and sense vectors in a word vector space. In this paper, we extend the word vector space model to reflect a more fine-grained meaning in context vectors by incorporating embedded senses. Using a large Korean sense-tagged corpus, we build an embedded sense space with supervised learning and evaluate the effectiveness of the sense embedding for word sense disambiguation.

AB In the French watt balance experiment, the translation and rotation functions must have no backlash, no friction, nor the need for lubricants. In addition errors in position and movement must be below 100 nm. Flexure hinges can meet all of these criteria. Different materials, profile shapes and machining techniques have been studied. The flexure pivots have been characterized using three techniques: 1) an optical microscope and, if necessary, a SEM to observe the surface inhomogeneities; 2) a mass comparator to determine the bending stiffness of unloaded pivots; 3) a loaded beam oscillating freely under vacuum to study the dynamic behavior of loaded pivots.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small RNAs that regulate the translation of thousands of message RNAs and play a profound role in mammalian biology. Over the past 5 years, significant advances have been made towards understanding the pathways that generate miRNAs and the mechanisms by which miRNAs exert their regulatory functions. An emerging theme is that miRNAs are both generated by and utilized by large and complex macromolecular assemblies. Here, we review the biology of mammalian miRNAs with a focus on the macromolecular complexes that generate and control the biogenesis of miRNAs.

TI Semi-Automatic Bilingual Corpus Creation with Zero Entropy Alignments
SO INFORMATICA
AB In this paper, we describe a model for aligning books and documents from bilingual corpus with a goal to create "perfectly" aligned bilingual corpus on word-to-word level. Presented algorithms differ from existing algorithms in consideration of the presence of human translator which usage we are trying to minimize. We treat human translator as an oracle who knows exact alignments and the goal of the system is to optimize (minimize) the use of this oracle. The effectiveness of the oracle is measured by the speed at which he can create "perfectly" aligned bilingual corpus. By "Perfectly" aligned corpus we mean zero entropy corpus because oracle can make alignments without any probabilistic interpretation, i.e., with 100% confidence. Sentence level alignments and word-to-word alignments, although treated separately in this paper, are integrated in a single framework. For sentence level alignments we provide a dynamic programming algorithm which achieves low precision and recall error rate. For word-to-word level alignments Expectation Maximization algorithm that integrates linguistic dictionaries is suggested as the main tool for the oracle to build "perfectly" aligned bilingual corpus. We show empirically that suggested pre-aligned corpus requires little interaction from the oracle and that creation of perfectly aligned corpus can be achieved almost with the speed of human reading. Presented algorithms are language independent but in this paper we verify them with English Lithuanian language pair on two types of text: law documents and fiction literature.

We propose a novel unsupervised method to derive multilingual sentence embeddings relying only on monolingual data. We first produce a synthetic parallel corpus using unsupervised machine translation, and use it to fine-tune a pretrained cross-lingual masked language model (XLM) to derive the multilingual sentence representations. The quality of the representations is evaluated on two parallel corpus mining tasks with improvements of up to 22 F1 points over vanilla XLM. In addition, we observe that a single synthetic bilingual corpus is able to improve results for other language pairs.

An elementary and efficacious method is to distill matching patterns from words, phrases and sentences to obtain the matching score. In this paper, Reconstructed Color Interaction Image (RCII) is proposed to convert text matching to color image recognition. First, two texts are reconstructed and similarity operations are adopted to generate Color Interaction Image (CII). Then CNN is applied to extract hierarchical and elaborate matching information. Finally, fully connected layers are employed to obtain the matching score. Experiments have proved the effectiveness of our method.

AB Polylingual Text Classification (PLC) is a supervised learning task that consists of assigning class labels to documents written in different languages, assuming that a representative set of training documents is available for each language. This scenario is more and more frequent, given the large quantity of multilingual platforms and communities emerging on the Internet. In this work we analyse some important methods proposed in the literature that are machine-translation-free and dictionary-free, and we propose a particular configuration of the Random Indexing method (that we dub Lightweight Random Indexing). We show that it outperforms all compared algorithms and also displays a significantly reduced computational cost.

AB In this paper we proposed a design of a Java co-processor for a 32-bit RISC system to improve its performance, as the software only Java interpreter is more time-consuming. Our work includes the hardware/software co-design of the Java Card Virtual Machine (JCVM) and the details of its hardware implementation. The JCVM translates the Java bytecodes (JBCs) into the native RISC instructions and then passes them to the RISC core. A 16-byte pre-fetch FIFO and the folding mechanism are applied to further speedup the translation.

AB In this paper we present a novel system for content-based retrieval and classification of cultural relic images. First, the images are normalized to achieve rotation, translation and scaling invariant similarity retrieval. After normalization, a combination of color and shape features is extracted from the images. In order to improve the retrieval efficiency, a modified version of principal component analysis is used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. Retrieval performance of the system is evaluated for three different distance functions using the normalized recall measure. A multi-class support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used for classification. The results demonstrate that the system is both effective and efficient.

AB Fault tolerant modeling constraints ai-e presented to reduce wafer test times attributed to sequential semiconductor measurement and testing (SMT) and to avoid product damage and deviation in quality during testing. The concept is expressed using the Unified Modeling Language Statecharts and is further reinforced with a mathematical Finite-State Machine. By adhering to constraints, translation of this object-oriented model to the solution space has been successfully applied to a Parametric In-line Testing System (PITS) resulting in significant reduction of test time. PITS statistical data is used to support our models by comparing previous sequential implementation to our new concurrent approach.

TI Feature-weighted AdaBoost classifier for punctuation prediction in Tamil
   and Hindi NLP systems
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS
AB Punctuation marks play a vital role in text representation and interpretation, and are useful in enhancing the performance of modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems such as voice input typing aids, machine translation, and speech synthesis systems. Punctuation marks, except period, are inherently not available in Indian languages such as Tamil and Hindi. However, some modern forms of writing such as news articles, blogs, stories, and so forth, incorporate user-defined punctuation marks in these languages. The current work proposes an automatic punctuation prediction system for texts in Tamil and Hindi using classification approach, where punctuation prediction is considered as a multi-class classification problem. Word-level text features are chosen and are analysed to validate their language-dependency and significance towards punctuation prediction. A Feature-weighted AdaBoost (FAda) classifier is proposed that defines a novel boosting factor to adjust the hypothesis weight of the weak classifiers, hence reducing the number of false classifications. It is observed that the proposed classifier outperforms the other classification techniques such as, AdaBoost, SVM, CART, CRF, and Bi-LSTM by a maximum difference of 50% and 16% in the macro F1-scores for Tamil and Hindi texts, respectively. The proposed classifier performs on par with the attention-based classifier for both Tamil and Hindi texts. Further, as a proof of concept, the proposed punctuation prediction system is applied to voice keyboard, machine translation, and speech synthesis systems, to validate the effect of the punctuation marks on the performance of these Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems.

AB Top-down tree transducers with epsilon-rules (epsilon tdtts) are a restricted version of extended top-down tree transducers. They are implemented in the framework TIBURON and fulfill some criteria desirable in a machine translation model. However, they compute a class of transformations that is not closed under composition (not even for linear and nondeleting epsilon tdtts). A composition construction that composes two etdtts M and N is presented, and it is shown that the construction is correct, whenever (i) N is linear, (ii) M is total or N is nondeleting, and (iii) M has at most one output symbol in each rule.

TI A specificity-enhancing factor for the ClpXP degradation machine
SO SCIENCE
AB Events that stall bacterial protein, synthesis activate the ssrA-tagging machinery, resulting in resumption of translation and addition of an 11-residue peptide to the carboxyl terminus of the nascent chain. This ssrA-encoded peptide tag marks the incomplete protein for degradation by the energy-dependent ClpXP protease. Here, a ribosome-associated protein, SspB, was found to bind specifically to ssrA-tagged proteins and to enhance recognition of these proteins by ClpXP. Cells with an sspB mutation are defective in degrading ssrA-tagged proteins, demonstrating that SspB is a specificity-enhancing factor for ClpXP that controls substrate choice.

TI Exploiting bilingual lexicons to improve multilingual embedding-based
   document and sentence alignment for low-resource languages
SO KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Neural machine translation systems trained on low-resource languages produce sub-optimal results due to the scarcity of large parallel datasets. To alleviate this problem, parallel corpora can be mined from the web. Two key tasks in a parallel corpus mining pipeline are web document alignment and sentence alignment. Effective approaches for these tasks obtained vector representations of the documents (or sentences) belonging to the two languages and determine the alignment between the documents (or sentences) based on a semantic similarity scoring mechanism. Recently, document or sentence representations obtained from pre-trained multilingual language models (PMLMs) such as LASER, XLM-R and LaBSE have significantly improved the benchmark scores in diverse natural language processing tasks. In this study, we carry out an empirical analysis of the effectiveness of these PMLMs of the document and sentence alignment tasks in the context of the low-resource language pairs Sinhala-English, Tamil-English and Sinhala-Tamil. Further, we introduce a weighting mechanism based on small-scale bilingual lexicons to improve the semantic similarity measurement between sentences and documents. Our results show that both document and sentence alignment can be further improved using our weighting mechanism. We have also compiled a gold-standard evaluation benchmark dataset for document alignment and sentence alignment tasks for the considered language pairs. This dataset (https://github.com/kdissa/comparable-corpus) and the source code (https://github.com/nIpcuom/parallel_corpus_mining) are publicly released.

AB Bandit structured prediction describes a stochastic optimization framework where learning is performed from partial feedback. This feedback is received in the form of a task loss evaluation to a predicted output structure, without having access to gold standard structures. We advance this framework by lifting linear bandit learning to neural sequence-to-sequence learning problems using attention-based recurrent neural networks. Furthermore, we show how to incorporate control variates into our learning algorithms for variance reduction and improved generalization. We present an evaluation on a neural machine translation task that shows improvements of up to 5.89 BLEU points for domain adaptation from simulated bandit feedback.

The selection of the speech units is done by constructing the syntax-phonology tree structure of the target sentence. The construction of the syntax-phonology tree is adapted from the example-based parsing of UTMK machine translation. In the process of constructing the syntax-phonology tree, we first identify the related trees from the speech corpus. Then, the generated subtrees based on the related trees are combined. The concatenation of the combined subtrees nodes is the synthetic utterance of the target sentence.

In this paper we propose a massively parallel object recognition system, which makes use of the multi polygonal approximation scheme for the extraction of rotation and translation invariant shape features, in connection with artificial neural networks for the parallel classification of the extracted features. The system has been successfully applied for recognizing aircraft shapes in different sizes, orientations, with the addition of noise distortion and occlusion. Timings on the Connection Machine 200 are also reported.

TI Contextual Urdu Lemmatization Using Recurrent Neural Network Models
SO MATHEMATICS
AB In the field of natural language processing, machine translation is a colossally developing research area that helps humans communicate more effectively by bridging the linguistic gap. In machine translation, normalization and morphological analyses are the first and perhaps the most important modules for information retrieval (IR). To build a morphological analyzer, or to complete the normalization process, it is important to extract the correct root out of different words. Stemming and lemmatization are techniques commonly used to find the correct root words in a language. However, a few studies on IR systems for the Urdu language have shown that lemmatization is more effective than stemming due to infixes found in Urdu words. This paper presents a lemmatization algorithm based on recurrent neural network models for the Urdu language. However, lemmatization techniques for resource-scarce languages such as Urdu are not very common. The proposed model is trained and tested on two datasets, namely, the Urdu Monolingual Corpus (UMC) and the Universal Dependencies Corpus of Urdu (UDU). The datasets are lemmatized with the help of recurrent neural network models. The Word2Vec model and edit trees are used to generate semantic and syntactic embedding. Bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU), bidirectional gated recurrent neural network (BiGRNN), and attention-free encoder-decoder (AFED) models are trained under defined hyperparameters. Experimental results show that the attention-free encoder-decoder model achieves an accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score of 0.96, 0.95, 0.95, and 0.95, respectively, and outperforms existing models.

TI TPrune: Efficient Transformer Pruning for Mobile Devices
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS
AB The invention of Transformer model structure boosts the performance of Neural Machine Translation (NMI) tasks to an unprecedented level. Many previous works have been done to make the Transformer model more execution-friendly on resource-constrained platforms. These researches can be categorized into three key fields: Model Pruning, Transfer Learning, and Efficient Transformer Variants. The family of model pruning methods are popular for their simplicity in practice and promising compression rate and have achieved great success in the field of convolution neural networks (CNNs) for many vision tasks. Nonetheless, previous Transformer pruning works did not perform a thorough model analysis and evaluation on each Transformer component on off-the-shelf mobile devices. In this work, we analyze and prune transformer models at the line-wise granularity and also implement our pruning method on real mobile platforms. We explore the properties of all Transformer components as well as their sparsity features, which are leveraged to guide Transformer model pruning. We name our whole Transformer analysis and pruning pipeline as TPrune. In TPrune, we first propose Block-wise Structured Sparsity Learning (BSSL) to analyze Transformer model property. Then, based on the characters derived from BSSL, we apply Structured Hoycr Square (SHS) to derive the final pruned models. Comparing with the state-of-the-art Transformer pruning methods, TPrune is able to achieve a higher model compression rate with less performance degradation. Experimental results show that our pruned models achieve 1.16x-1.92x speedup on mobile devices with 0%-8% BLEU score degradation compared with the original Transformer model.

TI Rock Particle Motion Information Detection Based on Video Instance
   Segmentation
SO SENSORS
AB The detection of rock particle motion information is the basis for revealing particle motion laws and quantitative analysis. Such a task is crucial in guiding engineering construction, preventing geological disasters, and verifying numerical models of particles. We propose a machine vision method based on video instance segmentation (VIS) to address the motion information detection problem in rock particles under a vibration load. First, we designed a classification loss function based on Arcface loss to improve the Mask R-CNN. This loss function introduces an angular distance based on SoftMax loss that distinguishes the objects and backgrounds with higher similarity. Second, this method combines the abovementioned Mask R-CNN and Deep Simple Online and Real-time Tracking (Deep SORT) to perform rock particle detection, segmentation, and tracking. Third, we utilized the equivalent ellipse characterization method for segmented particles, integrating with the proportional calibration algorithm to test the translation and detecting the rotation by calculating the change in the angle of the ellipse's major axis. The experimental results show that the improved Mask R-CNN obtains an accuracy of 93.36% on a self-created dataset and also has some advantages on public datasets. Combining the improved Mask R-CNN and Deep SORT could fulfill the VIS with a low ID switching rate while successfully detecting movement information. The average detection errors of translation and rotation are 5.10% and 14.49%, respectively. This study provides an intelligent scheme for detecting movement information of rock particles.

TI Deep learning for Arabic NLP: A survey
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE
AB The recent advances in deep learning (DL) have caused breakthroughs in many fields such as computer vision, natural language processing (NLP) and speech processing. Many DL based approaches have been shown to produce state-of-the-art results on various tasks that are of great importance to online social networks (OSN) and social computing such as sentiment analysis (SA) and pharmacovigilance. NLP tasks are becoming very prominent in OSN and DL is offering researchers and practitioners exciting new directions to address these tasks. In this paper, we provide a survey of the published papers on using DL techniques for NLP. We focus on the Arabic language due to its importance, the scarcity of resources on it and the challenges associated with working on it. We notice that DL has yet to receive the attention it deserves from the Arabic NLP (ANLP) community compared with the attention it is getting for other languages despite the vast adoption of social networks in the Arab world. The majority of the early works on using DL for ANLP focused on OCR-related problems while the more recent ones are more diverse with the increasing interest in applying DL to SA, machine translation, diacritization, etc. This survey should serve as a guide for the young and growing ANLP community in order to help bridge the huge gap between ANLP literature and the much richer and more mature English NLP literature.

AB Stop words elimination is important pre-processing step in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text mining applications. Stop words removal improves the performance and quality of classifications system. In the context of classification task it is possible to reduce number of dimensions in the term of space by removing most common words which has less significant meaning and irrelevant. But it does not mean stop words removal can improve the performance of all types of applications in the area of NLP, Artificial Intelligence, Text Mining and Machine Translation. In context of Machine Translation (MT) stop words elimination process will lead to loss of accuracy, because each token has specific meaning which will be converted into target language. As on date there is no unique stop words list is available for Gujarati language with its lexical classes (Part-of-Speech Tags) to improve the performance of MT system. This paper present construction and categorization of stop words list for Gujarati language based on its lexical classes (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc.) of Part-of-Speech family. We have prepared 126 raw text documents written in Gujarati language in which each document contained more than 260 tokens. After tokenization process, we got list of 32840 tokens. From the total number of tokens we created list of 1125 unique stop words with its lexical classes by manual inspection and help of linguistic experts. The stop words list and specifically categorization thereof is released herewith for NLP applications, particularly MT systems, in Gujarati language by the research community.

AB Creating and maintaining biomedical terminologies for multiple natural languages is a resource-expensive task, typically carried out by human domain experts. We here report on efforts to computationally support this process by treating term acquisition as a machine translation-guided classification problem capitalizing on parallel corpora. We report on experiments for French, German, Spanish and Dutch parts of a UMLS-derived terminology for which we generated 18k, 23k, 19k and 12k new terms and synonyms, respectively. Based on expert assessments of a novel German terminology segment about 80% of the newly acquired terms were judged as bio-medically reasonable and terminologically valid.

Specifically we describe a two-step process for creating candidate thematic grids for Mandarin Chinese verbs, using the English verb heading the VP in the subdefinitions to separate senses, and roughly parsing the verb complement structure to match thematic structure templates. We accomplished a substantial reduction in manual effort, without substantive loss. The procedure is part of a larger process of creating a, usable lexicon for interlingual machine translation from a large on-line resource with both too much and too little information.

AB This paper investigates methods for coping with out-of-vocabulary words in a large vocabulary speech recognition task, namely the automatic transcription of Italian broadcast news. Two alternative ways for augmenting a 64K(thousand)-word recognition vocabulary and language model are compared: introducing extra words with their phonetic transcription up to 1.2M (million) words, or extending the language model with so-called graphones, i.e. sub-word units made of phone-character sequences. Graphones and phonetic transcriptions of words are automatically generated by adapting an off-the-shelf statistical machine translation toolkit. We found that the word-based and graphone-based extensions allow both for better recognition performance, with the former performing significantly better than the latter. In addition, the word-based extension approach shows interesting potential even under conditions of little supervision. In fact, by training the grapheme to phoneme translation system with only 2K manually verified transcriptions, the final word error rate increases by just 3% relative, with respect to starting from a lexicon of 64K Words.

AB Customization of systems is costly, but it is necessary to better meet the needs of multi-various tasks and requirements in the fields such as medical care, education, and so on. A machine translation system, for example, can provide a certain level of multilingual communication support if a human translator is absent; the translation system may need to be customized, however, if it is applied to a new application area. To realize easy customization of multilingual communication systems, we have developed the Language Grid Playground, an online language Web service platform which enables easy customization of various multilingual communication tools. We have established a stepwise process of classifying language services into a layered architecture and developing and accumulating lightweight building blocks that constitute communication tool components. Through this stepwise process, we were able to identify useful components in multilingual communication tools which can be flexibly combined to create new Web services. By implementing several tools and actually accumulating building blocks, we identified useful language service components and developed these components as programs which can be deployed as Web services.

   single versus double bundle Achilles tendon grafts for PCL
   reconstructions
SO BIO-MEDICAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) consists of two primary bundles and is the primary restraint to posterior tibial translation. The emergence of the Posterior Tibial Inlay Technique (PTIT) has demonstrated a mechanical advantage over the commonly used Tibial Tunnel Method (TTM). This study was designed to investigate the effects on knee mechanics from both a Single-bundle (SB) and Double-bundle (DB) Achilles tendon PCL reconstruction using a PTIT. The investigators hypothesized that a DB graft demonstrates a mechanical advantage compared to the SB graft. A materials testing machine provided six sequential loading cycles of 100 N while total translation was measured. The testing was conducted at 90degrees, 60degrees, 30degrees and 10degrees of flexion in neutral tibial rotation. While the mechanical advantages of the DB graft were detected, specifically at small laxity values and in the physiological range of normal gait, the additional complexity of the technique may clinically outweigh the mechanical advantages.

SO MINDS AND MACHINES
AB This paper examines whether a classical model could be translated into a PDP network using a standard connectionist training technique called extra output learning. In Study 1, standard machine learning techniques were used to create a decision tree that could be used to classify 8124 different mushrooms as being edible or poisonous on the basis of 21 different Features (Schlimmer, 1987). In Study 2, extra output learning was used to insert this decision tree into a PDP network being trained on the identical problem. An interpretation of the trained network revealed a perfect mapping from its internal structure to the decision tree, representing a precise translation of the classical theory to the connectionist model. In Study 3, a second network was trained on the mushroom problem without using extra output learning. An interpretation of this second network revealed a different algorithm for solving the mushroom problem, demonstrating that the Study 2 network was indeed a proper theory translation.

AB Reaching the critical software safety requirements is one of the most important and complex tasks for the safety-related industry. This fact explains, as it was highly recommended by the CENELEC standard, the increasing use of formal means in the development process. However, industrial environments are still reticent facing difficulties in incorporating those formal methods in a larger scale of application, especially because of their mathematical modeling complexity. The present paper proposes a Petri Nets-based approach for safety critical software development using a formal transformation into B abstract machines. This work presents formal definitions for the translation of Colored Petri Nets to B abstract machines. As part of the French research project called "PERFECT", it aims at enabling a stronger combination of formal design techniques and analysis tools in order to cope with the real complexity of critical software development and to prove in an automated manner that the final software product satisfies all safety requirements. Therefore, the use of the B method will broaden the scope of its applicability by providing a new input modeling alternative. An illustrative application of the transformation practical use is shown in this paper for a railway level-crossing case study.

TI Position-robust optronic convolutional neural networks dealing with
   images position variation
SO OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Through taking maximum advantage of fast data processing characteristic of optical computing, optronic convolutional neural networks (OPCNNs) make all computation operations executed in optics to reduce calculation burden in electronic to the maximum extent and successfully performing classification tasks on both hand-written digit dataset and fashion product dataset. However, practical performance of OPCNNs is sensitive to the position variation of testing images caused by whether the alignment error of components or the translation of classified target. The classification performance reduction in such situations severely limits the application scenarios of OPCNNs. In this paper, we improve the original architecture and achieve position-robust optronic convolutional neural networks (PROPCNNs) with translation invariance through replacing strided convolutional operation and fully connected operation with spectral pooling and global average pooling. PROPCNNs contain less optical components and experiments demonstrate their streamlined architecture is capable of maintaining prediction performance in majority situation of images position variation. This consistent performance provides support for applying our architecture in more complex environment such as loaded on moving vehicles or transported in portable way.

AB Autoregressive sequence models based on deep neural networks, such as RNNs, Wavenet and the Transformer attain state-of-the-art results on many tasks. However, they are difficult to parallelize and are thus slow at processing long sequences. RNNs lack parallelism both during training and decoding, while architectures like WaveNet and Transformer are much more parallelizable during training, yet still operate sequentially during decoding. We present a method to extend sequence models using discrete latent variables that makes decoding much more parallelizable. We first autoencode the target sequence into a shorter sequence of discrete latent variables, which at inference time is generated autoregressively, and finally decode the output sequence from this shorter latent sequence in parallel. To this end, we introduce a novel method for constructing a sequence of discrete latent variables and compare it with previously introduced methods. Finally, we evaluate our model end-to-end on the task of neural machine translation, where it is an order of magnitude faster at decoding than comparable autoregressive models. While lower in BLEU than purely autoregressive models, our model achieves higher scores than previously proposed non-autoregressive translation models.

TI Model of EF4-induced ribosomal state transitions and mRNA translocation
SO PHYSICAL BIOLOGY
AB EF4, a highly conserved protein present in bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts, can bind to both the posttranslocation and pretranslocation ribosomal complexes. When binding to the posttranslocation state, it catalyzes backward translocation to a pretranslocation state. When binding to the pretranslocation state, it catalyzes transition to another pretranslocation state that is similar and possibly identical to that resulting from the posttranslocation state bound by EF4, and competes with EF-G to regulate the elongation cycle. However, the molecular mechanism on how EF4 induces state transitions and mRNA translocation remains unclear. Here, we present both the model for state transitions induced by EF4 binding to the posttranslocation state and that by EF4 binding to the pretranslocation state, based on which we study the kinetics of EF4-induced state transitions and mRNA translocation, giving quantitative explanations of the available experimental data. Moreover, we present some predicted results on state transitions and mRNA translocation induced by EF4 binding to the pretranslocation state complexed with the mRNA containing a duplex region.

TI G4Boost: a machine learning-based tool for quadruplex identification and
   stability prediction
SO BMC BIOINFORMATICS
AB Background G-quadruplexes (G4s), formed within guanine-rich nucleic acids, are secondary structures involved in important biological processes. Although every G4 motif has the potential to form a stable G4 structure, not every G4 motif would, and accurate energy-based methods are needed to assess their structural stability. Here, we present a decision tree-based prediction tool, G4Boost, to identify G4 motifs and predict their secondary structure folding probability and thermodynamic stability based on their sequences, nucleotide compositions, and estimated structural topologies. Results G4Boost predicted the quadruplex folding state with an accuracy greater then 93% and an F1-score of 0.96, and the folding energy with an RMSE of 4.28 and R-2 of 0.95 only by the means of sequence intrinsic feature. G4Boost was successfully applied and validated to predict the stability of experimentally-determined G4 structures, including for plants and humans. Conclusion G4Boost outperformed the three machine-learning based prediction tools, DeepG4, Quadron, and G4RNA Screener, in terms of both accuracy and F1-score, and can be highly useful for G4 prediction to understand gene regulation across species including plants and humans.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS-X
AB The application of X-ray microtomography for quantitative structural analysis of pharmaceutical multi-particulate systems was demonstrated for commercial capsules, each containing approximately 300 formulated ibuprofen pellets. The implementation of a marker-supported watershed transformation enabled the reliable segmentation of the pellet population for the 3D analysis of individual pellets. Isolated translation- and rotation-invariant object cross-sections expanded the applicability to additional 2D image analysis techniques. The full structural characterisation gave access to over 200 features quantifying aspects of the pellets' size, shape, porosity, surface and orientation. The extracted features were assessed using a ReliefF feature selection method and a supervised Support Vector Machine learning algorithm to build a model for the detection of broken pellets within each capsule. Data of three features from distinct structure-related categories were used to build classification models with an accuracy of more than 99.55% and a minimum precision of 86.20% validated with a test dataset of 886 pellets. This approach to extract quantitative information on particle quality attributes combined with advanced data analysis strategies has clear potential to directly inform manufacturing processes, accelerating development and optimisation.

AB With the development of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology, automatic target recognition (ATR) is becoming increasingly important. In this paper, we proposed a 3-class target classification system in SAR images. The system is based on invariant wavelet moments and support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. It is a two-stage approach. The first stage is to extract and select a small set of wavelet invariant moment features to indicate target images. The wavelet invariant moments take both advantages of the wavelet inherent property of multi-resolution analysis and moment invariants quality of invariant to translation, scaling changes and rotation. The second stage is classification of targets with SVM algorithm. SVM is based on the principle of structural risk minimization (SRM), which has been shown better than the principle of empirical risk minimization (ERM) which is used by many conventional networks. To test the performance and efficiency of the proposed method, we performed experiments on invariant wavelet moments, different kernel functions, 2-class identification, and 3-class identification. Test results show that wavelet invariant moments indicate the target effectively; linear kernel function achieves better results than other kernel functions, and SVM classification approach performs better than conventional nearest distance approach.

AB Virtual testing is a crucial task to ensure safety in autonomous driving, and sensor simulation is an important task in this domain. Most current LiDAR simulations are very simplistic and are mainly used to perform initial tests, while the majority of insights are gathered on the road. In this paper, we propose a lightweight approach for more realistic LiDAR simulation that learns a real sensor's behavior from test drive data and transforms this to the virtual domain. The central idea is to cast the simulation into an image-to-image translation problem. We train our pix2pix based architecture on two real world data sets, namely the popular KITTI data set and the Audi Autonomous Driving Dataset which provide both, RGB and LiDAR images. We apply this network on synthetic renderings and show that it generalizes sufficiently from real images to simulated images. This strategy enables to skip the sensor-specific, expensive and complex LiDAR physics simulation in our synthetic world and avoids oversimplification and a large domain-gap through the clean synthetic environment.

AB Sparse regularization is a central technique for both machine learning (to achieve supervised features selection or unsupervised mixture learning) and imaging sciences (to achieve super-resolution). Existing performance guaranties assume a separation of the spikes based on an ad-hoc (usually Euclidean) minimum distance condition, which ignores the geometry of the problem. In this article, we study the BLASSO (i.e. the off-the-grid version of l(1) LASSO regularization) and show that the Fisher-Rao distance is the natural way to ensure and quantify support recovery, since it preserves the invariance of the problem under reparameterization. We prove that under mild regularity and curvature conditions, stable support identification is achieved even in the presence of randomized sub-sampled observations (which is the case in compressed sensing or learning scenario). On deconvolution problems, which are translation invariant, this generalizes to the multi-dimensional setting existing results of the literature. For more complex translation-varying problems, such as Laplace transform inversion, this gives the first geometry-aware guarantees for sparse recovery.

TI Hypothesis Pruning in Learning Word Alignment
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS
AB Recent study shows that discriminative learning methods could provide a significant improvement of word alignment quality. One of the difficulties of these methods is how to perform efficient search of word alignment. Although Inversion transduction grammar (ITG) provides a polynomial time algorithm using synchronous parsing techniques, a very harsh pruning is still needed to make the algorithm computationally feasible. We notice that previous pruning techniques mostly focus on pruning the bi-lingual spans, after what low quality alignments still exist. To address this problem, we propose an approach that prunes low quality hypotheses on-the-fly during parsing. Compared with previous pruning methods which only use high precision alignment links as constraints, our method could make use of "high recall" alignment links as well. To demonstrate our approach, we also propose a constrained learning framework, which generates high precision and high recall constraints from some existing alignment results. Experiment shows significant improvements of both alignment and translation quality over standard IBM Model 4 alignments on the Chinese-English test data.

AB Model-based development is increasingly becoming the method of choice for developing embedded systems for applications in automotive and aerospace industries. It relies on tool-suites consisting of a variety of model-processing tools like simulators, model-translators and code-generators. The correctness of these tools used in the development process is a key requirement for safety critical applications. This paper proposes a novel testing methodology for the rigorous verification of model processing tools.
   The proposed methodology takes as input the syntactic and semantic meta-model of a modeling language, expressed in the form of inference rules. Using a coverage criteria over this meta-model, it generates test-models, and test-inputs for these test-models. Apart from testing the syntactic aspects of the translation, our method aims at testing subtle semantic interactions of the modeling language that are potentially mistranslated by the model-processing tools.
   We illustrate the methodology with a simple prototypical process calculus. We also report on the experiments carried out with Stateflow. a variant of hierarchical state-machines implemented in the Matlab/Simulink tool-suite.

TI The ribosome and the mechanism of protein synthesis
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB In virtually all forms of life on earth, proteins in each cell are made according to a genetic blueprint, in the form of DNA. The translation of copies of this genetic blueprint ( in the form of messenger RNA) into polypeptides is performed on the ribosome, a highly complex molecular machine composed of RNAs and proteins. To this end, special adaptor molecules called transfer RNAs are lined up by the ribosome in the sequence dictated by the genetic code, such that the amino acids carried by these molecules can be linked into a polypeptide. Several cofactors are involved in these processes, some of which require energy freed up by GTP hydrolysis. Although the ribosome was discovered more than 50 years ago, its structure has only been solved recently by X-ray crystallography. Another technique, cryo-electron microscopy, is starting to contribute toward our understanding of the ribosome's function, by portraying its conformational changes and binding interactions with the cofactors and tRNA.

AB Neural language models are often trained with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), where the next word is generated conditioned on the ground-truth word tokens. During testing, however, the model is instead conditioned on previously generated tokens, resulting in what is termed exposure bias. To reduce this gap between training and testing, we propose using optimal transport (OT) to match the sequences generated in these two modes. An extension is further proposed to improve the OT learning, based on the structural and contextual information of the text sequences. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on machine translation, text summarization, and text generation tasks.

AB The last twenty years of seminal microbiome research has uncovered microbiota's intrinsic relationship with human health. Studies elucidating the relationship between an unbalanced microbiome and disease are currently published daily. As such, microbiome big data have become a reality that provide a mine of information for the development of new therapeutics. Machine learning (ML), a branch of artificial intelligence, offers powerful techniques for big data analysis and prediction-making, that are out of reach of human intellect alone. This review will explore how ML can be applied for the development of microbiome-targeted therapeutics. A background on ML will be given, followed by a guide on where to find reliable microbiome big data. Existing applications and opportunities will be discussed, including the use of ML to discover, design, and characterize microbiome therapeutics. The use of ML to optimize advanced processes, such as 3D printing and in silico prediction of drug-microbiome interactions, will also be highlighted. Finally, barriers to adoption of ML in academic and industrial settings will be examined, concluded by a future outlook for the field.

SO NEWS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE REPUBLIC OF
   KAZAKHSTAN-SERIES PHYSICO-MATHEMATICAL
AB This paper provides an overview of existing modern methods and software approaches for semantic analysis. Based on the research done, it was revealed that, for the semantic analysis of text resources, an approach based on machine learning is most used. This article presents the developed algorithm for the semantic analysis of the text in the Kazakh language. The paper also presents a software solution to this approach implemented in the Python programming language. The vector representation of words was obtained by machine learning based on the corpus, which is 1 million sentences in the Kazakh language. In the software implementation, well-known libraries such as gensim, matplotlib, sklearn, numpy, etc. were used. Based on a set of semantically related pairs of words, an ontology for a specific document is built, which is formed during the operation of a neural network. The paper presents the results of the experiments in the graphical form of a set of words. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the identification of semantic close words in meaning in texts in the Kazakh language. This work contributes to solving problems in machine translation systems, information retrieval, as well as in analysis and processing systems in the Kazakh language.

AB With the growing access to the internet, the spoken Arabic dialect language becomes an informal languages written in social media. Most users post comments using their own dialect. This linguistic situation inhibits mutual understanding between internet users and makes difficult to use computational approaches since most Arabic resources are intended for the formal language: Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). In this paper, we present a pipeline to standardize the written texts in social networks by translating them to the MSA. We fine-tune at first an identification bert-based model to select Tunisian Dialect (TD) comments from MSA and other dialects. Then, the resulting comments are translated using a neural translation model. Each of these steps was evaluated on the same test corpus. In order to test the effectiveness of the approach, we compared two opinion analysis models, the first is intended for the Sentiment Analysis (SA) of dialect texts and the second is for the MSA texts. We concluded that through standardization we obtain the best score.

AB Most existing feature selection approach is limited to determine features from a single source of data. In this paper, a feature selection approach is proposed to consider multiple sources of textual data. The proposed GBFS approach is then applied to label Quranic verses based on two major references, the English translation and tafsir (Commentary). The verses were selected from two chapters, Surah Al-Baqarah and Surah Al-Anaam. The verses are classified into three categories: Faith, Worship, and Etiquette. The textual data from the translation and commentary were preprocessed using StringToWord Vector with weighted TF-IDF. Feature selection algorithms: information gain, chi square, Pearson correlation coefficient, relief, and correlation-based were experimented on four classifiers: naive Bayes, libSVM, k-NN, and decision trees (J48). The proposed group-based feature selection approach has shown promising results in terms of Accuracy and Area under Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) by achieving Accuracy of 94.5% and AUC of 0.944.

TI Functional epitopes at the ribosome subunit interface
SO NATURE CHEMICAL BIOLOGY
AB The ribosome is a 2.5-MDa molecular machine that synthesizes cellular proteins encoded in mRNAs(1). The 30S and 50S subunits of the ribosome associate through structurally defined intersubunit bridges(2-5) burying 6,000 angstrom(2), 80% of which is buried in conserved RNA-RNA interactions(6). Intersubunit bridges bind translation factors(7,8), may coordinate peptide bond formation and translocation(9-11) and may be actively remodeled in the post-termination complex(12,13), but the functional importance of numerous 30S bridge nucleotides had been unknown. We carried out large-scale combinatorial mutagenesis and in vivo selections on 30S nucleotides that form RNA-RNA intersubunit bridges in the Escherichia coli ribosome. We determined the covariation and functional importance of bridge nucleotides, allowing comparison of the structural interface and phylogenetic data to the functional epitope. Our results reveal how information for ribosome function is partitioned across bridges, and suggest a subset of nucleotides that may have measurable effects on individual steps of the translational cycle.

TI Drug repositioning: a machine-learning approach through data integration
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS
AB Existing computational methods for drug repositioning either rely only on the gene expression response of cell lines after treatment, or on drug-to-disease relationships, merging several information levels. However, the noisy nature of the gene expression and the scarcity of genomic data for many diseases are important limitations to such approaches. Here we focused on a drug-centered approach by predicting the therapeutic class of FDA-approved compounds, not considering data concerning the diseases. We propose a novel computational approach to predict drug repositioning based on state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms. We have integrated multiple layers of information: i) on the distances of the drugs based on how similar are their chemical structures, ii) on how close are their targets within the protein-protein interaction network, and iii) on how correlated are the gene expression patterns after treatment. Our classifier reaches high accuracy levels (78%), allowing us to re-interpret the top misclassifications as re-classifications, after rigorous statistical evaluation. Efficient drug repurposing has the potential to significantly impact the whole field of drug development. The results presented here can significantly accelerate the translation into the clinics of known compounds for novel therapeutic uses.

TI Fusing images with different focuses using support vector machines
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS
AB Many vision-related processing tasks, such as edge detection, image segmentation and stereo matching, can be performed more easily when all objects in the scene are in good focus. However, in practice, this may not be always feasible as optical lenses, especially those with long focal lengths, only have a limited depth of field. One common approach to recover an everywhere-in-focus image is to use wavelet-based image fusion. First, several source images with different focuses of the same scene are taken and processed with the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Among these wavelet decompositions, the wavelet coefficient with the largest magnitude is selected at each pixel location. Finally, the fused image can be recovered by performing the inverse DWT. In this paper, we improve this fusion procedure by applying the discrete wavelet frame transform (DWFT) and the support vector machines (SVM). Unlike DWT, DWFT yields a translation-invariant signal representation. Using features extracted from the DWFT coefficients, a SVM is trained to select the source image that has the best focus at each pixel location, and the corresponding DWFT coefficients are then incorporated into the composite wavelet representation. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the traditional approach both visually and quantitatively.

AB Sign language is a natural and fully-formed communication method for deaf or hearing-impaired people. Unfortunately, most of the state-of-the-art sign recognition technologies are limited by either high energy consumption or expensive device costs and have a difficult time providing a real-time service in a daily-life environment. Inspired by previous works on motion detection with wearable devices, we propose SignSpeaker - a real-time, robust, and user-friendly American sign language recognition (ASLR) system with affordable and portable commodity mobile devices. SignSpeaker is deployed on a smartwatch along with a smartphone; the smartwatch collects the sign signals and the smartphone outputs translation through an inbuilt loudspeaker. We implement a prototype system and run a series of experiments that demonstrate the promising performance of our system. For example, the average translation time is approximately 1.1 seconds for a sentence with eleven words. The average detection ratio and reliability of sign recognition are 99.2% and 99.5%, respectively. The average word error rate of continuous sentence recognition is 1.04% on average.

AB In order to handle the complexity and heterogeneity of modern instruction set architectures, analysis platforms share a common design, the adoption of hardware-independent intermediate representations. The usage of these platforms to verify systems down to binary-level is appealing due to the high degree of automation they provide. However, it introduces the need for trusting the correctness of the translation from binary code to intermediate language. Achieving a high degree of trust is challenging since this transpilation must handle (i) all the side effects of the instructions, (ii) multiple instruction encoding (e.g. ARM Thumb), and (iii) variable instruction length (e.g. Intel). We overcome these problems by formally modeling one of such intermediate languages in the interactive theorem prover HOL4 and by implementing a proof-producing transpiler. This tool translates ARMv8 programs to the intermediate language and generates a HOL4 proof that demonstrates the correctness of the translation in the form of a simulation theorem. We also show how the transpiler theorems can be used to transfer properties verified on the intermediate language to the binary code.

TI Set operations on closed intervals and their applications to the
   automatic programming of morphological machines
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING
AB Mathematical morphology on sets can be understood as a formal language, whose vocabulary comprises erosions, dilations, complementation, intersection and union. This language is complete, that is, it is enough to perform any set operation. Since the sixties special machines, called morphological machines (MMachs), have been built to implement this language. In the literature, we find hundreds of MMach programs that are used to solve image analysis problems. However, the design of these programs is not an elementary task. Thus, recently much research effort has been addressed to automating the programming of MMachs. A Very promising approach to this problem is the description of the target operator by input-output pairs of images and the translation of these data into efficient MMach programs. This approach can be decomposed into two equally important steps: (1) learning of the target operator from pairs of images; (2) search for economical representations for the operators learned. The theory presented in this paper is useful in the second step of this procedure. We present some set operations on collections of closed intervals and give efficient algorithms to perform them. These operations are used to parallelize MMach programs and to prove the equivalence between distinct MMach programs. (C) 1996 SPIE and IS&T.

TI Programming multi-protein assembly by gene-brush patterns and
   two-dimensional compartment geometry
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB The assembly of protein machines in cells is precise, rapid, and coupled to protein synthesis with regulation in space and time. The assembly of natural and synthetic nanomachines could be similarly controlled by genetic programming outside the cell. Here, we present quasi-two-dimensional (2D) silicon compartments that enable programming of protein assembly lines by local synthesis from surface-immobilized DNA brushes. Using this platform, we studied the autonomous synthesis and assembly of a structural complex from a bacteriophage and a bacterial RNA-synthesizing machine. Local synthesis and surface capture of complexes provided high assembly yield and sensitive detection of spatially resolved assembly intermediates, with the 3D geometry of the compartment and the 2D pattern of brushes dictating the yield and mode of assembly steps. Localized synthesis of proteins in a single gene brush enhances their interactions, and displacement of their genes in separated brushes leads to step-by-step surface assembly. This methodology enables spatial regulation of protein synthesis, and deciphering, reconstruction and design of biological machine assembly lines.
   Gene brushes patterned as synthetic operons on two-dimensional silicon compartments with defined geometry allow the investigation and regulation of nanoscale multi-protein assemblies.

TI Equivalence Checking of Scheduling in High-Level Synthesis Using Deep
   State Sequences
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB By using high-level synthesis tools, electronic system level design provides a promising solution to fill the growing design productivity gap of high quality hardware systems. However, an error may exist in the implementation of a compiler due to the complex and error prone compiling process. Equivalence checking is the process of proving that the target code is a correct translation of the source code being compiled. In this paper, we present a novel approach to solve the false-negative problem of value propagation (VP) based equivalence checking method. Finite State Machine with Datapath (FSMD) is used to model the original and the transformed programs. Our method proves the equivalence by comparing the deep state sequences (DSS) between the original and the transformed FSMD. Automatic test vector generation (ATVG) and simulation technique are used to recognize the corresponding DSS and exclude the false paths to solve the false-negative problem. The promising experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method to solve the false-negative problem in VP based equivalence checking method.

SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB During the work cycle of elongation, the ribosome, a molecular machine of vast complexity, exists in a large number of states distinguished by constellation of its subunits, its subunit domains and binding partners. Single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), developed over the past 40 years, is uniquely suited to determine the structure of molecular machines in their native states. With the emergence, 10 years ago, of unsupervised clustering techniques in the analysis of single-particle data, it has been possible to determine multiple structures from a sample containing ribosomes equilibrating in different thermally accessible states. In addition, recent advances in detector technology have made it possible to reach near-atomic resolution for some of these states. With these capabilities, single-particle cryo-EM has been at the forefront of exploring ribosome dynamics during its functional cycle, along with single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer and molecular dynamics computations, offering insights into molecular architecture uniquely honed by evolution to capitalize on thermal energy in the ambient environment.
   This article is part of the themed issue 'Perspectives on the ribosome'.

AB Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more interpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its sparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. 'switch off') for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.(1)

TI Cross-Lingual Bridges with Models of Lexical Borrowing
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
AB Linguistic borrowing is the phenomenon of transferring linguistic constructions (lexical, phonological, morphological, and syntactic) from a "donor" language to a "recipient" language as a result of contacts between communities speaking different languages. Borrowed words are found in all languages, and-in contrast to cognate relationships-borrowing relationships may exist across unrelated languages (for example, about 40% of Swahili's vocabulary is borrowed from the unrelated language Arabic). In this work, we develop a model of morpho-phonological transformations across languages. Its features are based on universal constraints from Optimality Theory (OT), and we show that compared to several standard-but linguistically more naive-baselines, our OT-inspired model obtains good performance at predicting donor forms from borrowed forms with only a few dozen training examples, making this a cost-effective strategy for sharing lexical information across languages. We demonstrate applications of the lexical borrowing model in machine translation, using resource-rich donor language to obtain translations of out-of-vocabulary loanwords in a lower resource language. Our framework obtains substantial improvements (up to 1.6 BLEU) over standard baselines.

AB Idioms are extensively used in everyday language. They carry a metaphorical sense that makes their comprehension difficult as their meaning cannot be deduced from the meaning of their constituent parts. They pose a challenge for Natural language processing (NLP) applications like machine translation, information retrieval and question answering as their translation and meaning needs to be derived logically rather than literally. A lot of research work has been carried out into automatic extraction of multi-word expressions, but no comprehensive work has been reported on idioms in Hindi. In this paper, an attempt has been made to study the linguistic and morphological variations that are usually encountered in idioms in Hindi. Based on this study, a methodology for deriving rules for representation of idioms and their search has been developed. The rules representing the idioms are hand crafted. For the idiom identification, rule-base has been used to mark the input text for probable presence of idiom. Our system is limited to use only intra-sentential context. The experimental results demonstrate feasibility and scalability of our methodology.

AB As we learn from the literature, flexibility in choosing synchronization operations greatly simplifies the task of designing highly concurrent programs. Unfortunately, existing hardware is inflexible and is at best on the level of a Lond-Linked/Store-Conditional operation on a single word. Building on the hardware based transactional synchronization methodology of Herlihy and Moss, we offer software transactional memory (STM), a novel software method for supporting flexible transactional programming of synchronization operations. STM is non-blocking, and can be implemented on existing machines using only a Load-Linked/Store-Conditional operation. We use STM to provide a general highly concurrent method for translating sequential object implementations to non-blocking ones based on implementing a k-word compare & swap STM-transaction. Empirical evidence collected on simulated multiprocessor architectures shows that our method always outperforms the non-blocking translation methods in the style of Barnes, and outperforms Herlihy's translation method for sufficiently large numbers of processors. The key to the efficiency of our software-transactional approach is that unlike Barnes style methods, it is not based on a costly ''recursive helping'' policy.

However, the proportion of predictive tools that are implemented in clinical practice is small in comparison to the total number of tools developed. This narrative review presents key principles to guide the translation of predictive tools from academic bodies of work into useful tools that complement clinical practice. Our review identified the following principles: (1) identifying a clinical gap, (2) selecting a target user or population, (3) optimizing predictive tool performance, (4) externally validating predictive tools, (5) marketing and disseminating the tool, (6) navigating the challenges of integrating a tool into existing healthcare systems, and (7) developing an ongoing monitoring and evaluation strategy. Although the review focuses on examples in orthopaedic surgery, the principles can be applied to other disciplines in medicine and surgery.

AB Research on the semantic argument classification requires semantically labeled data in large numbers, called corpus. Because building a corpus is costly and time-consuming, recently many studies have used existing corpus as the training data to conduct semantic argument classification research on new domain But previous studies have proven that there is a significant decrease in performance when classifying semantic arguments on different domain between the training and the testing data. The main problem is when there is a new argument that found in the testing data but it is not found in the training data. This research carries on semantic argument classification on a new domain that is Quran English Translation by utilizing Propbank corpus as the training data. To recognize the new argument in the training data, this research proposes four new features for extending the argument features in the training data. By using SVM Linear, the experiment has proven that augmenting the proposed features to the baseline system with some combinations option improve the performance of semantic argument classification on Quran data using Propbank Corpus as training data.

AB Self-training has proven effective for improving NMT performance by augmenting model training with synthetic parallel data. The common practice is to construct synthetic data based on a randomly sampled subset of large-scale monolingual data, which we empirically show is sub-optimal. In this work, we propose to improve the sampling procedure by selecting the most informative monolingual sentences to complement the parallel data. To this end, we compute the uncertainty of monolingual sentences using the bilingual dictionary extracted from the parallel data. Intuitively, monolingual sentences with lower uncertainty generally correspond to easy-to-translate patterns which may not provide additional gains. Accordingly, we design an uncertainty-based sampling strategy to efficiently exploit the monolingual data for self-training, in which monolingual sentences with higher uncertainty would be sampled with higher probability. Experimental results on large-scale WMT English)German and English)Chinese datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Extensive analyses suggest that emphasizing the learning on uncertain monolingual sentences by our approach does improve the translation quality of high-uncertainty sentences and also benefits the prediction of low-frequency words at the target side.

AB Question answering (QA) has significantly benefitted from deep learning techniques in recent years. However, domain-specific QA remains a challenge due to the significant amount of data required to train a neural network. This paper studies the answer sentence selection task in the Bible domain and answer questions by selecting relevant verses from the Bible. For this purpose, we create a new dataset BibleQA based on bible trivia questions and propose three neural network models for our task. We pre-train our models on a large-scale QA dataset, SQuAD, and investigate the effect of transferring weights on model accuracy. Furthermore, we also measured the model accuracies with different answer context lengths and different Bible translations. We affirm that transfer learning has a noticeable improvement in the model accuracy. We achieved relatively good results with shorter context lengths, whereas longer context lengths decreased model accuracy. We also find that using a more modern Bible translation in the dataset has a positive effect on the task.

AB Sequence-to-sequence translation methods based on generation with a side-conditioned language model have recently shown promising results in several tasks. In machine translation, models conditioned on source side words have been used to produce target-language text, and in image captioning, models conditioned images have been used to generate caption text. Past work with this approach has focused on large vocabulary tasks, and measured quality in terms of BLEU. In this paper, we explore the applicability of such models to the qualitatively different grapheme-to-phoneme task. Here, the input and output side vocabularies are small, plain n-gram models do well, and credit is only given when the output is exactly correct. We find that the simple side-conditioned generation approach is able to rival the state-of-the-art, and we are able to significantly advance the stat-of-the-art with bi-directional long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks that use the same alignment information that is used in conventional approaches.

TI Sequence Matching between Hemagglutinin and Neuraminidase through
   Sequence Analysis Using Machine Learning
SO VIRUSES-BASEL
AB To date, many experiments have revealed that the functional balance between hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) plays a crucial role in viral mobility, production, and transmission. However, whether and how HA and NA maintain balance at the sequence level needs further investigation. Here, we applied principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis on thousands of HA and NA sequences of A/H1N1 and A/H3N2. We discovered significant coevolution between HA and NA at the sequence level, which is closely related to the type of host species and virus epidemic years. Furthermore, we propose a sequence-to-sequence transformer model (S2STM), which mainly consists of an encoder and a decoder that adopts a multi-head attention mechanism for establishing the mapping relationship between HA and NA sequences. The training results reveal that the S2STM can effectively realize the "translation" from HA to NA or vice versa, thereby building a relationship network between them. Our work combines unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods to identify the sequence matching between HA and NA, which will advance our understanding of IAVs' evolution and also provide a novel idea for sequence analysis methods.

TI Commonsense Knowledge in Machine Intelligence
SO SIGMOD RECORD
AB There is growing conviction that the future of computing depends on our ability to exploit big data on the Web to enhance intelligent systems. This includes encyclopedic knowledge for factual details, common sense for human-like reasoning and natural language generation for smarter communication. With recent chatbots conceivably at the verge of passing the Turing Test, there are calls for more common sense oriented alternatives, e.g., the Winograd Schema Challenge. The Aristo QA system demonstrates the lack of common sense in current systems in answering fourth-grade science exam questions. On the language generation front, despite the progress in deep learning, current models are easily confused by subtle distinctions that may require linguistic common sense, e.g.quick food vs. fast food. These issues bear on tasks such as machine translation and should be addressed using common sense acquired from text. Mining common sense from massive amounts of data and applying it in intelligent systems, in several respects, appears to be the next frontier in computing. Our brief overview of the state of Commonsense Knowledge (CSK) in Machine Intelligence provides insights into CSK acquisition, CSK in natural language, applications of CSK and discussion of open issues. This paper provides a report of a tutorial at a recent conference with a brief survey of topics.

TI Is superoptimization viable for VM instruction sets?
SO SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB The technique of superoptimization attempts to ensure true optimality of a code (according to predefined criteria) through an exhaustive search of all potentially viable programs. Implementations have demonstrated that superoptimizers are capable of finding shorter programs than those hand optimized for size by experts or produced by conventional compilers. Superoptimizers have been developed for many machine architectures and used for diverse purposes including automating peephole optimization and binary translation of instruction sets. The output of superoptimizers is frequently surprising to human experts and often takes advantage of side effects or obscure characteristics of the targeted hardware. Virtual machines (VMs) are increasingly popular in implementations of programming languages, because they can provide a common platform across heterogeneous hardware architectures. This paper examines whether superoptimization could be a viable technique for VMs. A superoptimizer for the Java VM (JVM) has been developed and used to generate demonstrably size-optimized versions of some simple mathematical functions, implemented in a Java bytecode. We have shown that these versions are shorter than both implementations shipped with the Java software development kit and those generated by the Java compiler. We also have some useful observations concerning techniques to allow larger programs to be optimized in a reasonable time by this approach. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Document-level event argument linking as machine reading comprehension
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
AB Document-level event argument linking aims to find global event arguments to fill an event's semantic role, which is a challenging task owing to the appearance of long contexts and the issue of data sparsity. In this paper, we study a new formulation to address the above challenges in document-level EAL, by explicitly framing the task as a machine reading comprehension (MRC) problem. In this formulation, argument extraction is viewed as a question answering procedure. To better transfer each semantic role into a question, we propose a back-translation based query generation method, which can effectively generate well-formed questions without adopting huge human effort. Moreover, to better capture the non-local dependencies between triggers and arguments, we devise a dependency-guided question answering process, which can explore the underlying structure of the document to boost learning. The extensive experiments on a benchmark have justified the effectiveness of our approach. Particularity, our approach achieves substantially improvement over previous methods, leading to +5.7% in F1 in the full argument linking setting. Moreover, our approach is particular data-efficient and demonstrates superior performance in the data-low scenario with limited training data. (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In a combat environment, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is attractive for several reasons, including automatic target recognition (ATR). In order to effectively develop ATR algorithms, data from a wide variety of targets in different configurations is necessary. Naturally, collecting all this data is expensive and time-consuming. To mitigate the cost, simulated SAR data can be used to supplement real data, but the accuracy and performance is degraded. We investigate the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs), a recent development in the field of machine learning, to make simulated data more realistic and therefore better suited to develop ATR algorithms for real-world scenarios. This class of machine learning algorithms has been shown to have good performance in image translation between image domains, making it a promising method for improving the realism of simulated SAR data. We compare the use of two different GAN architectures to perform this task. Data from the publicly available MSTAR dataset is paired with simulated data of the same targets and used to train each GAN. The resulting images are evaluated for realism and the ability to retain target class. We show the results of these tests and make recommendations for using this technique to inexpensively augment SAR data sets.

AB With widespread applications in image recognition, language translation, computer vision and other areas, deep learning (DL) have been proliferating over the past decade. Practitioners from different business groups in industries train DL models on a shared cloud computing infrastructure for these applications with different priorities. During the model training process, one of the key challenges is to minimize the life-cycle of high priority model training jobs. This paper analyzes the distributed training of machine learning (ML) models and identifies short board effect in the training process: GPU training requires higher network bandwidth compared to CPU training. The key insight motivates the design of GAI, a centralized scheduler for ML workload. It relies on two techniques: (1) tree-based structure. The structure stores the cluster information hierarchically to apply multi-layer scheduling. (2) well-extended priority algorithm. We consider priorities from multiple dimensions for model training jobs comprehensively to support resource degradation and preemption. The prototype of GAI is implemented on top of Kubernetes, Kubeflow, and TensorFlow. It is evaluated using a simulator and a real cloud-based cluster. Evaluations show 28% increase in scheduling throughput and 21% training convergence speedup on DL models.

TI Elucidating the functional roles of prokaryotic proteins using big data
   and artificial intelligence
SO FEMS MICROBIOLOGY REVIEWS
AB Annotating protein sequences according to their biological functions is one of the key steps in understanding microbial diversity, metabolic potentials, and evolutionary histories. However, even in the best-studied prokaryotic genomes, not all proteins can be characterized by classical in vivo, in vitro, and/or in silico methods-a challenge rapidly growing alongside the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies and their enormous extension of 'omics' data in public databases. These so-called hypothetical proteins (HPs) represent a huge knowledge gap and hidden potential for biotechnological applications. Opportunities for leveraging the available 'Big Data' have recently proliferated with the use of artificial intelligence (AI). Here, we review the aims and methods of protein annotation and explain the different principles behind machine and deep learning algorithms including recent research examples, in order to assist both biologists wishing to apply AI tools in developing comprehensive genome annotations and computer scientists who want to contribute to this leading edge of biological research.
   Different principles and methods to functionally characterize and annotate prokaryotic proteins are reviewed, with a special emphasis on machine learning and deep learning algorithms.

TI DNS Poisoning of Operating System Caches: Attacks and Mitigations
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEPENDABLE AND SECURE COMPUTING
AB The Domain Name System (DNS) is a protocol supporting name resolution from Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) to the IP address of the machines corresponding to them. This resolution process is critical to the operation of the Internet, but is susceptible to a range of attacks. One of the most dangerous attack vectors is DNS poisoning where an attacker injects malicious entries into the DNS resolution forcing clients to be redirected from legitimate to malicious servers. Typically, poisoning attacks target a DNS resolver allowing attackers to poison a DNS entry for all machines that use the compromised resolver. However, recent defenses protect resolvers substantially limiting these attacks. In this paper, we present a new class of DNS poisoning attacks targeting the client-side DNS cache, which is used in mainstream operating systems, circumventing defenses protecting resolvers. We implemented the attack on Windows, Mac OS, and Ubuntu Linux machines. We also generalize the attack to work even when the client is behind a Network Address Translation (NAT) router. Our results show that we can reliably inject malicious DNS mappings, with on average, an order of tens of seconds. We also propose client-side mitigations and demonstrate that they can effectively mitigate the vulnerability.

AB Production machine learning (ML) clusters commonly host a variety of distributed ML workloads, e.g., speech recognition, machine translation. While server sharing among jobs improves resource utilization, interference among co-located ML jobs can lead to significant performance downgrade. Existing cluster schedulers (e.g., Mesos) are interference-oblivious in their job placement, causing suboptimal resource efficiency. Interference-aware job placement has been studied in the literature, but was treated using detailed workload profiling and interference modeling, which is not a general solution. This paper presents Harmony, a deep learning-driven ML cluster scheduler that places training jobs in a manner that minimizes interference and maximizes performance (i.e., training completion time). Harmony is based on a carefully designed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework augmented with reward modeling. The DRL employs state-of-the-art techniques to stabilize training and improve convergence, including actor-critic algorithm, job aware action space exploration and experience replay. In view of a common lack of reward samples corresponding to different placement decisions, we build an auxiliary reward prediction model, which is trained using historical samples and used for producing reward for unseen placement. Experiments using real ML workloads in a Kubernetes cluster of 6 GPI/servers show that Harmony outperforms representative schedulers by 27% in terms of average job completion time.

TI Vibration signal based condition monitoring of mechanical equipment with
   scattering transform
SO JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Scattering transform is proposed using machine learning to extract translational, rotational and deformation invariant information for the first time from vibration signals obtained from rolling element bearings (REBs). The core idea of scattering transform lies in the construction of a scattering network which is formed from a stack of signal processing layers of increasing width. Each layer is formed from the association of a linear filter bank with a non-linear operator. It uses a cascade of wavelet filter bank, modulus rectifiers and averaging operators to build a deep convolution network and computes multi-scale co-occurrence coefficients which are invariant to translation in time, rotation and deformation. The scattering transform coefficients are extracted as features from seven stages of a vibration signal prognosis data repository which are then input to a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Vibration signals from the intelligent management system (IMS) bearing data centre are used to validate the proposed algorithm. Test results analysis and solution show that scattering transform can be used to obtain distinguishing features from seven bearing health stages with an average accuracy of 99 %. The results were compared with other feature extraction strategies on the same data and were found to be superior.

AB Human-machine interaction has been growing with the discovery of artificial intelligence technology. The development of human-machine interaction leads to a more natural interaction. In daily interactions, human uses speech, more dominant than the other way such as gestures and eye contact. Speech is the vocalized form of human communication which is closely related to language system. The problem is meaning, ambiguity, and the language that is not according to the rules of syntax, causing the command translation become more complex. To understand the meaning of the voice command, it is necessary to know the semantic and syntactic structure of sentences. An artificial intelligence technology that can understand Indonesian voice commands for robotic applications will be developed in this research. The purpose of this research is to translate voice command into the robots action, to generate human-machine interaction more natural. The voice command will be extracted using bark-frequency cepstral coefficients. Cepstral identified into words using neural networks. Words in a complete sentences will be processed using natural language processing so that, the meaning and appropriate action from the given command can be executed. Speech recognition experiments with 28 sets of speech signal obtain 82 % accuracy, while natural language processing experiments obtain 93 % accuracy with 50 sets of learning data.

TI Forgone, Not Forgotten: "DNA Fingerprinting," Migration Control and
   Britain's DNA Profiling Pilot Project
SO SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES
AB DNA profiling has become a culturally ubiquitous technology. Its use, whether in forensic investigations, genetic databases, biomedical research, international border-making, or popular genealogy, has been familiarized through political debates, media and cultural representations and commercialization. DNA profiling has also attracted considerable scholarly attention across this terrain. However, scant attention has been paid to the key role played by legal migration in driving DNA profiling's initial translation from lab bench discovery to "truth machine" and identity token. Here, I discuss the first state-sponsored use of DNA profiling as a tool for establishing kinship relations among legal but racialized migrants on Britain's borders in the mid-1980s. I argue that this early "experiment" conditioned the commercialization and future uses of the technology at and beyond border zones. Reinstating migration as the origin context for DNA profiling, and retracing the postcolonial routes by which it entered the biopolitical sphere, sheds light on the conjoined naturalization and racialization of genetic technologies of identity and identification, whether at or beyond national borders.

AB Searching through networks of documents is an important task. A promising path to improve the performance of information retrieval systems in this context is to leverage dense node and content representations learned with embedding techniques. However, these techniques cannot learn representations for documents that are either isolated or whose content is missing. To tackle this issue, assuming that the topology of the network and the content of the documents correlate, we propose to estimate the missing node representations from the available content representations, and conversely. Inspired by recent advances in machine translation, we detail in this paper how to learn a linear transformation from a set of aligned content and node representations. The projection matrix is efficiently calculated in terms of the singular value decomposition. The usefulness of the proposed method is highlighted by the improved ability to predict the neighborhood of nodes whose links are unobserved based on the projected content representations, and to retrieve similar documents when content is missing, based on the projected node representations.

TI A comparison of pebble tree transducers with macro tree transducers
SO ACTA INFORMATICA
AB The n-pebble tree transducer was recently proposed as a model for XML query languages. The four main results on deterministic transducers are: First, (1) the translation tau of an n-pebble tree transducer can be realized by a composition of n+10-pebble tree transducers. Next, the pebble tree transducer is compared with the macro tree transducer, a well-known model for syntax-directed semantics, with decidable type checking. The 0-pebble tree transducer can be simulated by the macro tree transducer, which, by the first result, implies that (2) tau can be realized by an (n+1)-fold composition of macro tree transducers. Conversely, every macro tree transducer can be simulated by a composition of 0-pebble tree transducers. Together these simulations prove that (3) the composition closure of n-pebble tree transducers equals that of macro tree transducers (and that of 0-pebble tree transducers). Similar results hold in the nondeterministic case. Finally, (4) the output languages of deterministic n-pebble tree transducers form a hierarchy with respect to the number n of pebbles.

AB Current approaches for service composition (assemblies of atomic services) require developers to use: (a) domain-specific semantics to formalize services that restrict the vocabulary for their descriptions, and (b) translation mechanisms for service retrieval to convert unstructured user requests to strongly-typed semantic representations. In our work, we claim that the effort to developing service descriptions, request translations, and service matching could be reduced using unrestricted natural language; allowing both: (1) end-users to intuitively express their needs using natural language, and (2) service developers to develop services without relying on syntactic/semantic description languages. Although there are some natural language-based service composition approaches, they restrict service retrieval to syntactic/semantic matching. With recent developments in Machine learning and Natural Language Processing, we motivate the use of Sentence Embeddings by leveraging richer semantic representations of sentences for service description, matching and retrieval. Experimental results show that service composition development effort may be reduced by more than 36% while keeping a high precision/recall when matching high-level user requests with low-level service method invocations.

TI Detecting Parallel Covert Data Transmission Channels in Video
   Conferencing Using Machine Learning
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Covert communication channels are a concept in which a policy-breaking method is used in order to covertly transmit data from inside an organization to an external or accessible point. VoIP and Video systems are exposed to such attacks on different layers, such as the underlying real-time transport protocol (RTP) which uses Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packet streams to punch a hole through Network address translation (NAT). This paper presents different innovative attack methods utilizing covert communication and RTP channels to spread malware or to create a data leak channel between different organizations. The demonstrated attacks are based on a UDP punch hole created using Skype peer-to-peer video conferencing communication. The different attack methods were successfully able to transmit a small text file in an undetectable manner by observing the communication channel, and without causing interruption to the audio/video channels or creating a noticeable disturbance to the quality. While these attacks are hard to detect by the eye, we show that applying classical Machine Learning algorithms to detect these covert channels on statistical features sampled from the communication channel is effective for one type of attack.

TI Learning-Assisted Automated Reasoning with Flyspeck
SO JOURNAL OF AUTOMATED REASONING
AB The considerable mathematical knowledge encoded by the Flyspeck project is combined with external automated theorem provers (ATPs) and machine-learning premise selection methods trained on the Flyspeck proofs, producing an AI system capable of proving a wide range of mathematical conjectures automatically. The performance of this architecture is evaluated in a bootstrapping scenario emulating the development of Flyspeck from axioms to the last theorem, each time using only the previous theorems and proofs. It is shown that 39 % of the 14185 theorems could be proved in a push-button mode (without any high-level advice and user interaction) in 30 seconds of real time on a fourteen-CPU workstation. The necessary work involves: (i) an implementation of sound translations of the HOL Light logic to ATP formalisms: untyped first-order, polymorphic typed first-order, and typed higher-order, (ii) export of the dependency information from HOL Light and ATP proofs for the machine learners, and (iii) choice of suitable representations and methods for learning from previous proofs, and their integration as advisors with HOL Light. This work is described and discussed here, and an initial analysis of the body of proofs that were found fully automatically is provided.

TI Prediction of posttranslational modification sites from amino acid
   sequences with kernel methods
SO JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY
AB Post-translational modification (PTM) is the chemical modification of a protein after its translation and one of the later steps in protein biosynthesis for many proteins. It plays an important role which modifies the end product of gene expression and contributes to biological processes and diseased conditions. However, the experimental methods for identifying PTM sites are both costly and time-consuming. Hence computational methods are highly desired. In this work, a novel encoding method PSPM (position-specific propensity matrices) is developed. Then a support vector machine (SVM) with the kernel matrix computed by PSPM is applied to predict the PTM sites. The experimental results indicate that the performance of new method is better or comparable with the existing methods. Therefore, the new method is a useful computational resource for the identification of PTM sites. A unified standalone software PTMPred is developed. It can be used to predict all types of PTM sites if the user provides the training datasets. The software can be freely downloaded from http://www.aporc.org/doc/wiki/PTMPred. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Large facilities and the evolving ribosome, the cellular machine for
   genetic-code translation
SO JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE
AB Well-focused X-ray beams, generated by advanced synchrotron radiation facilities, yielded high-resolution diffraction data from crystals of ribosomes, the cellular nano-machines that translate the genetic code into proteins. These structures revealed the decoding mechanism, localized the mRNA path and the positions of the tRNA molecules in the ribosome and illuminated the interactions of the ribosome with initiation, release and recycling factors. They also showed that the ribosome is a ribozyme whose active site is situated within a universal symmetrical region that is embedded in the otherwise asymmetric ribosome structure. As this highly conserved region provides the machinery required for peptide bond formation and for ribosome polymerase activity, it may be the remnant of the proto-ribosome, a dimeric pre-biotic machine that formed peptide bonds and non-coded polypeptide chains. Synchrotron radiation also enabled the determination of structures of complexes of ribosomes with antibiotics targeting them, which revealed the principles allowing for their clinical use, revealed resistance mechanisms and showed the bases for discriminating pathogens from hosts, hence providing valuable structural information for antibiotics improvement.

The scientists, in an incredible tour de farce that took over twenty years, applied X-ray crystallography in order to determine the atomic structure of this large macromolecular complex, alone and in association with the major components in the protein synthesis process. The resulting models have been essential to understand the mechanisms underlying this process, in particular how the ribosome is able to decode messenger RNA (which carries the genetic information stored in DNA), how peptide bond catalysis proceeds, and the way in which several antibiotics protect us from bacterial infections.

AB In a traditional help desk environment, service engineers typically provide a worldwide customer base support through the use of long-distance telephone calls. Such a mode of support is inefficient, ineffective and generally results in high costs, long service cycles, and poor quality of service. The rapid growth of the World Wide Web technology, with its widespread acceptance and accessibility, have resulted in the emergence of Web-based help desk systems. Depending on the functionality provided by such systems, most of the associated disadvantages of the traditional help desk environment can be eliminated. This paper describes a Web-based integrated system, the WebHotLine system, that possesses Web-based retrieval, online multilingual translation capability for service records, rule-base reasoning for direct intelligent fault diagnosis by customers or service engineers, different modes of video-conferencing for enhanced customer support and network security for secure data communications.

TI Machine Learning ECG Classification Using Wavelet Scattering of Feature
   Extraction
SO APPLIED COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND SOFT COMPUTING
AB The heart's electrical activity is registered by an electrocardiogram (ECG), which consists of a wealth of pathological data on heart diseases such as arrhythmia. However, with increasing complexity and nonlinearity, direct observation of ECG signals and analysis is very tough. The highest accuracy of classification performance for machine learning approaches are 99.7 for neural network with wavelet scattering features extraction and 99.92 for SVM also with wavelet scattering features extraction. Through wavelet cascades with a neural network, the wavelet scattering transform can yield a translation invariant and deflection depictions of ECG signals. We suggested a new wavelet scattering transform-based method for automatically classifying three types of ECG heart diseases as follows: arrhythmia (ARR), congestive heart failure (CHF), and normal sinus rhythm (NSR). The bandwidth of the scaling function is used to critically downsample the wavelet scattering transform in time. As a result, each of the scattering paths has 16-time windows. Beat classification performance is classified by utilizing the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset. The suggested method is able to conduct high accuracy arrhythmia classification, with a 99.7% and 99.92% accuracy rate of the neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM), respectively, and will aid physicians in ECG explanation.

TI Solving System Problems with Machine Learning
SO STUDIES IN INFORMATICS AND CONTROL
AB Over the past decade, Machine Learning (ML) has achieved tremendous successes and has seen wide-scale adoption for human-facing tasks, such as visual recognition, speech recognition, language translation and medical diagnosis. However, going forward, we contend that ML has an even higher potential for impact by solving hard systems problems, such as improving industrial processes, supply chain optimization, and automatic program generation. One challenge is that solving many of these problems require solutions that are provably correct, which is at odds with the ML techniques which are stochastic in nature. In this paper, we consider this challenge and propose two approaches of using ML to solve system problems. The first approach, called correct by construction, is to generate provably correct solutions, for example, by starting from a correct solution, and applying ML-guided transformations that preserve the solution's correctness. The second approach, called trust but verify, is to generate solutions whose correctness can be (efficiently) verified, and then keep generating solutions until we find a correct one. To illustrate these approaches, we present several examples in the area of software systems, and show how using ML can provide significant improvements over state-of-the-art solutions which were refined over decades.

AB Quantum computing vendors are beginning to open up application programming interfaces for direct pulse-level quantum control. With this, programmers can begin to describe quantum kernels of execution via sequences of arbitrary pulse shapes. This opens new avenues of research and development with regards to smart quantum compilation routines that enable direct translation of higher-level digital assembly representations to these native pulse instructions. In this work, we present an extension to the XACC system-level quantum-classical software framework that directly enables this compilation lowering phase via user-specified quantum optimal control techniques. This extension enables the translation of digital quantum circuit representations to equivalent pulse sequences that are optimal with respect to the backend system dynamics. Our work is modular and extensible, enabling third party optimal control techniques and strategies in both C++ and Python. We demonstrate this extension with familiar gradient-based methods like gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE), gradient optimization of analytic controls (GOAT), and Krotov's method. Our work serves as a foundational component of future quantum-classical compiler designs that lower high-level programmatic representations to low-level machine instructions.

AB We present the Insertion Transformer, an iterative, partially autoregressive model for sequence generation based on insertion operations. Unlike typical autoregressive models which rely on a fixed, often left-to-right ordering of the output, our approach accommodates arbitrary orderings by allowing for tokens to be inserted anywhere in the sequence during decoding. This flexibility confers a number of advantages: for instance, not only can our model be trained to follow specific orderings such as left-to-right generation or a binary tree traversal, but it can also be trained to maximize entropy over all valid insertions for robustness. In addition, our model seamlessly accommodates both fully autoregressive generation (one insertion at a time) and partially autoregressive generation (simultaneous insertions at multiple locations). We validate our approach by analyzing its performance on the WMT 2014 English-German machine translation task under various settings for training and decoding. We find that the Insertion Transformer outperforms many prior non-autoregressive approaches to translation at comparable or better levels of parallelism, and successfully recovers the performance of the original Transformer while requiring only logarithmically many iterations during decoding.

To construct the semantic network, we used the Computing Curricular series created during 2000-2015 under the aegis of ACM and IEEE and the current standards of IT specialists training in Russia, as well as some other English language and Russian language sources. The resulting network can be used as a basic component in an intelligent information system that allows processing bilingual search queries while considering their semantics and to help support and guide automated translation efforts of academic texts from one language to the other. The network can also be useful to support comparative analysis and integration of the programs and teaching materials for Computing and IT education in Russia and English speaking countries. This network can support cross-lingual information retrieval, knowledge management and machine translation, which play an important role in e-learning personalization and retrieval in the computing domain, thus allowing to benefit from online educational resources that are available in both languages.

TI Exploring AADL verification tool through model transformation
SO JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE
AB Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) is often used to model safety-critical real-time systems. Model transformation is widely used to extract a formal specification so that AADL models can be verified and analyzed by existing tools. Timed Abstract State Machine (TASM) is a formalism not only able to specify behavior and communication but also timing and resource aspects of the system. To verify functional and nonfunctional properties of AADL models, this paper presents a methodology for translating AADL to TASM. Our main contribution is to formally define the translation rules from an adequate subset of AADL (including thread component, port communication, behavior annex and mode change) into TASM. Based on these rules, a tool called AADL2TASM is implemented using Atlas Transformation Language (ATL). Finally, a case study from an actual data processing unit of a satellite is provided to validate the transformation and illustrate the practicality of the approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI MicroARTMAP for pattern recognition problems
SO ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING SOFTWARE
AB Pattern recognition is an important aspect of a dominant technology such as machine intelligence. Domain specific fuzzy-neuro models particularly for the 'black box' implementation of pattern recognition applications have recently been investigated. In this paper, Sanchez's MicroARTMAP has been discussed as a pattern recognizer/classifier for the image processing problems. The model inherently recognizes only noise free patterns and in case of noise perturbations (rotations/scaling/translation) misclassifies the images. To tackle this problem, a conventional Hu's moment based rotation/scaling/translation invariant feature extractor has been employed. The potential of this model has been demonstrated on two problems, namely, recognition of alphabets and words and prediction of load from yield pattern of elasto-plastic analysis. The second example concerns with color images dealing with colored patterns. MicroARTMAP is also applied to other two civil engineering problems, namely (a) Indian Standard (IS) classification of soil and (b) prediction of earthquake parameters from the response spectrum in which no feature extractor step is necessary.

TI Software Vulnerability Detection Using Deep Neural Networks: A Survey
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE
AB The constantly increasing number of disclosed security vulnerabilities have become an important concern in the software industry and in the field of cybersecurity, suggesting that the current approaches for vulnerability detection demand further improvement. The booming of the open-source software community has made vast amounts of software code available, which allows machine learning and data mining techniques to exploit abundant patterns within software code. Particularly, the recent breakthrough application of deep learning to speech recognition and machine translation has demonstrated the great potential of neural models' capability of understanding natural languages. This has motivated researchers in the software engineering and cybersecurity communities to apply deep learning for learning and understanding vulnerable code patterns and semantics indicative of the characteristics of vulnerable code. In this survey, we review the current literature adopting deep-learning-/neural-network-based approaches for detecting software vulnerabilities, aiming at investigating how the state-of-the-art research leverages neural techniques for learning and understanding code semantics to facilitate vulnerability discovery. We also identify the challenges in this new field and share our views of potential research directions.

AB Generative modeling has evolved to a notable field of machine learning. Deep polynomial neural networks (PNNs) have demonstrated impressive results in unsupervised image generation, where the task is to map an input vector (i.e., noise) to a synthesized image. However, the success of PNNs has not been replicated in conditional generation tasks, such as super-resolution. Existing PNNs focus on single-variable polynomial expansions which do not fare well to two-variable inputs, i.e., the noise variable and the conditional variable. In this work, we introduce a general framework, called CoPE, that enables a polynomial expansion of two input variables and captures their auto- and cross-correlations. We exhibit how CoPE can be trivially augmented to accept an arbitrary number of input variables. CoPE is evaluated in five tasks (class-conditional generation, inverse problems, edges-to-image translation, image-to-image translation, attribute-guided generation) involving eight datasets. The thorough evaluation suggests that CoPE can be useful for tackling diverse conditional generation tasks. The source code of CoPE is available at https://github.com/grigorisg9gr/polynomial_nets_for_conditional_generation.

TI Molecular analysis of the ribosome recycling factor ABCE1 bound to the
   30S post-splitting complex
SO EMBO JOURNAL
AB Ribosome recycling by the twin-ATPase ABCE1 is a key regulatory process in mRNA translation and surveillance and in ribosome-associated protein quality control in Eukarya and Archaea. Here, we captured the archaeal 30S ribosome post-splitting complex at 2.8 angstrom resolution by cryo-electron microscopy. The structure reveals the dynamic behavior of structural motifs unique to ABCE1, which ultimately leads to ribosome splitting. More specifically, we provide molecular details on how conformational rearrangements of the iron-sulfur cluster domain and hinge regions of ABCE1 are linked to closure of its nucleotide-binding sites. The combination of mutational and functional analyses uncovers an intricate allosteric network between the ribosome, regulatory domains of ABCE1, and its two structurally and functionally asymmetric ATP-binding sites. Based on these data, we propose a refined model of how signals from the ribosome are integrated into the ATPase cycle of ABCE1 to orchestrate ribosome recycling.

AB Internal ribosome entry site (IRES) RNAs are elements of viral or cellular mRNAs that bypass steps of canonical eukaryotic cap-dependent translation initiation. Understanding of the structural basis of IRES mechanisms is limited, partially due to a lack of high-resolution structures of IRES RNAs bound to their cellular targets. Prompted by the universal phylogenetic conservation of the ribosomal P site, we solved the crystal structures of proposed P site binding domains from two intergenic region IRES RNAs bound to bacterial 70S ribosomes. The structures show that these IRES domains nearly perfectly mimic a tRNA.mRNA interaction. However, there are clear differences in the global shape and position of this IRES domain in the intersubunit space compared to those of tRNA, supporting a mechanism for IRES action that invokes hybrid state mimicry to drive a noncanonical mode of translocation. These structures suggest how relatively small structured RNAs can manipulate complex biological machines.

TI SentiCode: A new paradigm for one-time training and global prediction in
   multilingual sentiment analysis
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB The main objective of multilingual sentiment analysis is to analyze reviews regardless of the original language in which they are written. Switching from one language to another is very common on social media platforms. Analyzing these multilingual reviews is a challenge since each language is different in terms of syntax, grammar, etc. This paper presents a new language-independent representation approach for sentiment analysis, SentiCode. Unlike previous work in multilingual sentiment analysis, the proposed approach does not rely on machine translation to bridge the gap between different languages. Instead, it exploits common features of languages, such as part-of-speech tags used in Universal Dependencies. Equally important, SentiCode enables sentiment analysis in multi-language and multi-domain environments simultaneously. Several experiments were conducted using machine/deep learning techniques to evaluate the performance of SentiCode in multilingual (English, French, German, Arabic, and Russian) and multi-domain environments. In addition, the vocabulary proposed by SentiCode and the effect of each token were evaluated by the ablation method. The results highlight the 70% accuracy of SentiCode, with the best trade-off between efficiency and computing time (training and testing) in a total of about 0.67 seconds, which is very convenient for real-time applications.

SO JOURNAL OF CENTRAL SOUTH UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY
AB Six-axis numerical control spiral bevel gear grinder was taken as the object, multi-body system theory and Denavit-Hartenberg homogeneous transformed matrix (HTM) were utilized to establish the grinder synthesis error model, and the validity of model was confirmed by the experiment. Additionally, in grinding wheel tool point coordinate system, the errors of six degrees of freedom were simulated when the grinding wheel revolving around C-axis, moving along X-axis and Y-axis. The influence of these six errors on teeth space, helix angle, pitch, teeth profile was discussed. The simulation results show that the angle error is in the range from -0.148 4 rad to -0.241 9 rad when grinding wheel moving along X, Y-axis; the translation error is in the range from 0.866 0 mu m to 3.605 3 mu m when grinding wheel moving along X-axis. These angle and translation errors have a great influence on the helix angle, pitch, teeth thickness and tooth socket.

TI The Meta-Protocol framework
SO JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
AB A communication protocol is a set of rules shared by two or more communicating parties on the sequence of operations and the format of messages to be exchanged. Standardization organizations define protocols in the form of recommendations (e.g., RFC) written in technical English, which requires a manual translation of the specification into the protocol implementation. This human translation is error-prone due in part to the ambiguities of natural language and in part due to the complexity of some protocols. To mitigate these problems, we divided the expression of a protocol specification into two parts. First, we designed an XML-based protocol specification language (XPSL) that allows for the high-level specification of a protocol expressed as a Finite State Machine (FSM) using Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) principles. Then, the components required by the protocol are specified in any suitable technical language (formal or informal). In addition, we developed the multi-layer Meta-Protocol framework, which allows for on-the-fly protocol discovery and negotiation, distribution of protocol specifications and components, and automatic protocol implementation in any programming language.

AB This paper presents the second participation of the University of Ottawa group in the Cross-Languag Speech Retrieval (CL-SR) task at CLEF 2006. We present the results of the submitted runs for the English collection and very briefly for the Czech collection, followed by many additional experiments. We have used two Information Retrieval systems in our experiments: SMART and Terrier, with several query expansion techniques (including a new method based on log-likelihood scores for collocations). Our experiments showed that query expansion methods do not help much for this collection. We tested different Automatic Speech Recognition transcripts and combinations. The retrieval results did not improve, probably because the speech recognition errors happened for the words that are important in retrieval. We present cross-language experiments, where the queries are automatically translated by combining the results of several online machine translation tools. Our experiments showed that high quality automatic translations (for French) led to results comparable with monolingual English, while the performance decreased for the other languages. Experiments on indexing the manual summaries and keywords gave the best retrieval results.

TI Comparing molecules and solids across structural and alchemical space
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Evaluating the (dis)similarity of crystalline, disordered and molecular compounds is a critical step in the development of algorithms to navigate automatically the configuration space of complex materials. For instance, a structural similarity metric is crucial for classifying structures, searching chemical space for better compounds and materials, and driving the next generation of machine-learning techniques for predicting the stability and properties of molecules and materials. In the last few years several strategies have been designed to compare atomic coordination environments. In particular, the smooth overlap of atomic positions (SOAPs) has emerged as an elegant framework to obtain translation, rotation and permutation-invariant descriptors of groups of atoms, underlying the development of various classes of machine-learned inter-atomic potentials. Here we discuss how one can combine such local descriptors using a regularized entropy match (REMatch) approach to describe the similarity of both whole molecular and bulk periodic structures, introducing powerful metrics that enable the navigation of alchemical and structural complexities within a unified framework. Furthermore, using this kernel and a ridge regression method we can predict atomization energies for a database of small organic molecules with a mean absolute error below 1 kcal mol(-1), reaching an important milestone in the application of machine-learning techniques for the evaluation of molecular properties.

AB Timing side-channel attacks are an important issue for cryptographic algorithms. If the execution time of an implementation depends on secret information, an adversary may recover the latter through measuring the former. Different approaches have emerged to exploit information leakage on cryptographic implementations and to protect them against these attacks, and recent works extend the concerns to dynamic execution systems [3,15,24]. However, little has been said about Cross-ISA emulation and its impact on timing leakages. In this paper, we investigate the impact of dynamic binary translators in the constanttime property of known cryptographic implementations, using different Region Formation Techniques (RFTs). We show that the emulation may have a significant impact by inserting non constant-time constructions during the translation, leading to significant timing leakages in QEMU and HQEMU emulators. These leakages are then verified using a statistical approach. In order to guarantee the constant-time property, we have implemented a solution in the QEMU dynamic binary translator, mitigating the inserted timing side-channels.

AB Movie and TV subtitles are a highly valuable resource for the compilation of parallel corpora thanks to their availability in large numbers and across many languages. However, the quality of the resulting sentence alignments is often lower than for other parallel corpora. This paper presents a new major release of the OpenSubtitles collection of parallel corpora, which is extracted from a total of 3.7 million subtitles spread over 60 languages. In addition to a substantial increase in the corpus size (about 30 % compared to the previous version), this new release associates explicit quality scores to each sentence alignment. These scores are determined by a feedforward neural network based on simple language-independent features and estimated on a sample of aligned sentence pairs. Evaluation results show that the model is able predict lexical translation probabilities with a root mean square error of 0.07 (coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.47). Based on the scores produced by this regression model, the parallel corpora can be filtered to prune out low-quality alignments.

AB Sequence-to-sequence models with soft attention had significant success in machine translation, speech recognition, and question answering. Though capable and easy to use, they require that the entirety of the input sequence is available at the beginning of inference, an assumption that is not valid for instantaneous translation and speech recognition. To address this problem, we present a new method for solving sequence-to-sequence problems using hard online alignments instead of soft offline alignments. The online alignments model is able to start producing outputs without the need to first process the entire input sequence. A highly accurate online sequence-to-sequence model is useful because it can be used to build an accurate voice-based instantaneous translator. Our model uses hard binary stochastic decisions to select the timesteps at which outputs will be produced. The model is trained to produce these stochastic decisions using a standard policy gradient method. In our experiments, we show that this model achieves encouraging performance on TIMIT and Wall Street Journal (WSJ) speech recognition datasets.

TI Machine Learning in Body Composition Analysis
SO EUROPEAN UROLOGY FOCUS
AB Body composition analysis (BCA) generates objective anthropometric data that can inform prognostication and treatment decisions across a wide variety of urologic conditions. A patient's body composition, specifically muscle and adipose tissue mass, may be characterized via segmentation of cross-sectional images (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) obtained as part of routine clinical care. Unfortunately, conventional semi-automated segmentation techniques are time- and resource-intensive, precluding translation into clinical practice. Machine learning (ML) offers the potential to automate and scale rapid and accurate BCA. To date, ML for BCA has relied on algorithms called convolutional neural networks designed to detect and analyze images in ways similar to human neuronal connections. This mini review provides a clinically oriented overview of ML and its use in BCA. We address current limitations and future directions for translating ML and BCA into clinical practice.
   Patient Summary: Body composition analysis is the measurement of muscle and fat in your body based on analysis of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans. We discuss the use of machine learning to automate body composition analysis. The information provided can be used to guide shared decision-making and to help in identifying the best therapy option.

SO EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG DISCOVERY
AB Introduction: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a component of our everyday lives, with applications ranging from recommendations on what to buy to the analysis of radiology images. Many of the techniques originally developed for other fields such as language translation and computer vision are now being applied in drug discovery. AI has enabled multiple aspects of drug discovery including the analysis of high content screening data, and the design and synthesis of new molecules.
   Areas covered: This perspective provides an overview of the application of AI in several areas relevant to drug discovery including property prediction, molecule generation, image analysis, and organic synthesis planning.
   Expert opinion: While a variety of machine learning methods are now being routinely used to predict biological activity and ADME properties, methods of representing molecules continue to evolve. Molecule generation methods are relatively new and unproven but hold the potential to access new, unexplored areas of chemical space. The application of AI in drug discovery will continue to benefit from dedicated research, as well as AI developments in other fields. With this pairing algorithmic advancements and high-quality data, the impact of AI in drug discovery will continue to grow in the coming years.

TI Generation of Stimulus Triggering From Intracortical Spike Activity for
   Brain-Machine-Body Interfaces (BMBIs)
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING
AB Brain-machine-body interfaces (BMBIs) aim to create an artificial connection in the nervous system by converting neural activity recorded from one cortical region to electrical stimuli delivered to another cortical region, spinal cord, or muscles in real-time. In particular, conditioning-mode BMBIs utilize such activity-dependent stimulation strategies to induce functional re-organization in the nervous system and promote functional recovery after injury by exploiting mechanisms underlying neuroplasticity. This paper reports on reconfigurable, field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based implementation of a translation algorithm to extract multichannel stimulus trigger signals from intracortical neural spike activity. The approach features digital spike discrimination based on user-set thresholding and time-amplitude windowing, decision making to support different triggering patterns for various stimulation scenarios, as well as trigger-pattern-dependent blanking schemes for robust operation in the presence of stimulus artifacts. Readily lending itself to low-power, low-area implementation for future integration, the algorithm has been synthesized on a Cyclone II FPGA using Altera's Quartus II design software and validated experimentally with prerecorded intracortical neural spike activity from an anesthetized laboratory rat.

AB EAST-ADL is an architectural description language dedicated to safety-critical automotive embedded system design. We have previously modified EAST-ADL to include energy constraints and transformed energy-aware real-time behavioral constraints in EAST-ADL into analyzable UPPAAL models. In this paper, we extend our previous work by including support for Stateflow, which is used to design event-driven systems via hierarchical state machines and flow charts. However, Stateflow provides limited support for formal analysis and often suffers from incomplete coverage issues since it was originally designed for the simulation of designs and as such does not provide a model amenable to formal verification. We tackle that shortcoming by transforming Stateflow models into verifiable UPPAAL models with stochastic semantics and integrating the translation with formal statistical analysis techniques: a flattening strategy and a set of mapping rules are proposed to facilitate the guarantee of translation. The analysis techniques, including the flattening and mapping strategy, are validated and demonstrated on the Fault-Tolerant Fuel Control case study.

AB Great writers help keep a language efficient for discourse of all kinds. In doing so they produce exceptional texts which may defy Statistical Machine Translation by employing uncommon idiom. Such "turns of phrase" can enter into a Nation's collective memory and form the basis from which compassion and conviction are conveyed during important national discourse. Communities that unite across language barriers have no such robust basis for discourse. Here we describe a Multilingual Web prototype application that promotes appreciation of exceptional texts by non-native readers. The application allows dual column original/translation texts (in Open Office format) to be imported into the translator's browser, to be manually aligned for semantic correspondence, to be aligned with an audio reading, and then saved as HTML5 for subsequent presentation to non-native readers. We hope to provide a new way of experiencing exceptional texts (poetry, here) that transmits their significance without incurring extraneous distraction. We motivate, outline and illustrate our application in action.

AB Multilingual Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models have yielded large empirical success in transfer learning settings. However, these black-box representations are poorly understood, and their mode of transfer remains elusive. In this work, we attempt to understand massively multilingual NMT representations (with 103 languages) using Singular Value Canonical Correlation Analysis (SVCCA), a representation similarity framework that allows us to compare representations across different languages, layers and models. Our analysis validates several empirical results and long-standing intuitions, and unveils new observations regarding how representations evolve in a multilingual translation model. We draw three major conclusions from our analysis, with implications on cross-lingual transfer learning: (i) Encoder representations of different languages cluster based on linguistic similarity, (ii) Representations of a source language learned by the encoder are dependent on the target language, and vice-versa, and (iii) Representations of high resource and/or linguistically similar languages are more robust when fine-tuning on an arbitrary language pair, which is critical to determining how much cross-lingual transfer can be expected in a zero or few-shot setting. We further connect our findings with existing empirical observations in multilingual NMT and transfer learning.

SO NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE
AB This article reviews three concepts related to implantable brain computer interface (BCI) devices being designed for human use: neural signal extraction primarily for motor commands, signal insertion to restore sensation, and technological challenges that remain. A significant body of literature has occurred over the past four decades regarding motor cortex signal extraction for upper extremity movement or computer interface. However, little is discussed regarding postural or ambulation command signaling. Auditory prosthesis research continues to represent the majority of literature on BCI signal insertion. Significant hurdles continue in the technological translation of BC! implants. These include developing a stable neural interface, significantly increasing signal processing capabilities, and methods of data transfer throughout the human body. The past few years, however, have provided extraordinary human examples of BCI implant potential. Despite technological hurdles, proof-of-concept animal and human studies provide significant encouragement that BCI implants may well find their way into mainstream medical practice in the foreseeable future.

In previous work [7], we have studied the precision reached by registering such volumes with classical 2-D angiography images, inferring this matching only from the sensors of the angiography machine. The error led by such a registration can be described as a 3-D rigid motion composed of a large translation and a small rotation.
   This paper describes the strategy we followed to correct this error. The angiography image is compared in a two-step process to the Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) of the angiography volume. The first step provides most of the translation by maximizing the cross-correlation. The second step recovers the residual rigid-body motion, thanks to a modified optical flow technique. A fine analysis of the equations encountered in both steps allows for a speed-tip of the calculations.
   This algorithm was validated on 17 images of a phantom, and 5 patients. The residual error was determined by manually indicating points of interest and was found to be around I min.

TI ENSEMBLE LEARNING TECHNIQUES FOR TRANSMISSION QUALITY CLASSIFICATION IN
   A PAY&REQUIRE MULTI-LAYER NETWORK
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Due to a continuous increase in the use of computer networks, it has become important to ensure the quality of data transmission over the network. The key issue in the quality assurance is the translation of parameters describing transmission quality to a certain rating scale. This article presents a technique that allows assessing transmission quality parameters. Thanks to the application of machine learning, it is easy to translate transmission quality parameters, i.e., delay, bandwidth, packet loss ratio and jitter, into a scale understandable by the end user. In this paper we propose six new ensembles of classifiers. Each classification algorithm is combined with preprocessing, cross-validation and genetic optimization. Most ensembles utilize several classification layers in which popular classifiers are used. For the purpose of the machine learning process, we have created a data set consisting of 100 samples described by four features, and the label which describes quality. Our previous research was conducted with respect to single classifiers. The results obtained now, in comparison with the previous ones, are satisfactory-high classification accuracy is reached, along with 94% sensitivity (overall accuracy) with 6/100 incorrect classifications. The suggested solution appears to be reliable and can be successfully applied in practice.

   Material Design to Toxicity Prediction
SO ADVANCED INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB Materials at the nanoscale exhibit specific physicochemical interactions with their environment. Therefore, evaluating their toxic potential is a primary requirement for regulatory purposes and for the safer development of nanomedicines. In this review, to aid the understanding of nano-bio interactions from environmental and health and safety perspectives, the potential, reality, challenges, and future advances that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) present are described. Herein, AI and ML algorithms that assist in the reporting of the minimum information required for biomaterial characterization and aid in the development and establishment of standard operating procedures are focused. ML tools and ab initio simulations adopted to improve the reproducibility of data for robust quantitative comparisons and to facilitate in silico modeling and meta-analyses leading to a substantial contribution to safe-by-design development in nanotoxicology/nanomedicine are mainly focused. In addition, future opportunities and challenges in the application of ML in nanoinformatics, which is particularly well-suited for the clinical translation of nanotherapeutics, are highlighted. This comprehensive review is believed that it will promote an unprecedented involvement of AI research in improvements in the field of nanotoxicology and nanomedicine.

TI Smooth support vector learning for fuzzy rule-based classification
   systems
SO INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS
AB This paper extends the previous work in the connection between fuzzy classifiers and kernel machines [2] to a general case. In [2], all membership functions for the same input variable are generated from location transformation of a reference function. A translation invariant kernel is constructed from reference functions. The kernel is a Mercer kernel if the reference functions are positive definite. A support vector learning approach for positive definite fuzzy classifiers (PDFCs) was proposed.
   In this paper, a smooth support vector learning algorithm for fuzzy rule-based classification systems is proposed. The smooth support vector machine (SSVM) is capable of generating nonlinear separating surfaces using arbitrary kernels. The positive definiteness requirement on reference functions is relaxed. A fuzzy classifier using arbitrary reference functions can be built from the training samples based on an SSVM. The resulting fuzzy classifier is called standard binary fuzzy classifier (SBFC). Fuzzy rules are extracted with each rule given by a training sample. The reduced kernel technique is introduced to simplify the decision function of the SBFC and to reduce the number of fuzzy rules. Finally, the performance of SBFCs with different reference functions is illustrated by experimental results. Comparisons with PDFCs are also provided.

TI Comparison of Point Cloud Registration Methods in Coarse Registration
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB In order to understanding the registration efficiency and registration accuracy of different point cloud registration methods, six different point cloud registration methods (31)SC, PFH, FPFH, NOT, ICP, 1PCS) arc selected to perform three-dimentional point cloud data in the coarse registration experiment. The time of point cloud registration and the rotation angle error and translation distance error of point cloud registration on the x, y, and z axis arc recorded during the experiment, the registration efficiency and registration accuracy of different point cloud registration methods in the coarse registration experiment arc compared by analyzing the data recorded by the experiment. The experimental results show that 31)SC, PFH, and FPFH perform well in the coarse registration experiment, 1PCS has good registration effect but longer time consumption, ICP is not suitable for coarse registration, and NDT performs general in coarse registration experiments. The conclusion of this experiment can provide an effective reference for the selection of point cloud registration methods in different situations.

TI Ribosomal proteomics: Strategies, approaches, and perspectives
SO BIOCHIMIE
AB Over the past few decades, proteomic research has seen unprecedented development due to technological advancement. However, whole-cell proteomics still has limitations with respect to sample complexity and the accuracy of determining protein locations. To deal with these limitations, several subcellular proteomic studies have been initiated. Nevertheless, compared to other subcellular proteomic fields, such as mitochondrial proteomics, ribosomal proteomics has lagged behind due to the long-held idea that the ribosome is just a translation machine. Recently, with the proposed ribosome filter hypothesis and subsequent studies of ribosome-specific regulatory capacity, ribosomal proteomics has become a promising chapter for both proteomic and ribosomal research. In this review, we discuss the current strategies and approaches in ribosomal proteomics and the efficacies as well as disadvantages of individual approaches for further improvement.

AB since text in faxed document can be altered by malicious person who can get the faxed document directly from fax machine without permission from the real recipient, the method of text integrity verification for faxed document is proposed to detect any modification of text content in the faxed document. To solve such problem, digital camera is first employed to capture the faxed document in order to obtain a faxed document image. However, there will be some RST (rotation, scaling and translation) distortions occurring in that captured image, which consequently affects the accuracy of text integrity verification, we thus propose pixel reorganizing technique to reduce such distortions. Text content in the faxed document image is then verified based on the use of MAC algorithm in order to detect any altered text in the faxed document. The experimental results show the efficiency of our proposed method with various text font sizes in detecting altered text content in the faxed documents.

AB The driving of contrast microbubbles; towards a boundary by means of primary radiation (Bjerknes) forces has been of interest for ultrasound-assisted drug delivery. Secondary radiation forces, resulting from oscillating microbubbles under ultrasound insonification, may cause the mutual attraction and subsequent coalescence of contrast microbubbles. This phenomenon has been less studied. Microbubbles with a negligible shell can be forced to translate towards each other at relatively low mechanical indices (MI). Thick-shelled microbubbles would require a higher MI to be moved. However, at high MI, microbubble disruption is expected. We investigated if thick-shelled contrast agent microbubbles can be forced to cluster at high-MI. Two thick-shelled contrast agents, inserted through a cellulose capillary, were subjected to 3 MHz, high-MI pulsed ultrasound from a commercial ultrasound machine, and synchronously captured through a high numerical aperture microscope. The agent Quantison(TM) did not translate, but showed a small percentage of disrupted bubbles. The agent M1639 showed the ultrasound-induced formation of bubble clusters, and the translation thereof towards the capillary boundary. It is concluded, that forced translation and clustering of thick-shelled contrast microbubbles is feasible.

TI Tex3: An 2R1T Parallel Manipulator with Minimum DOF of Joints and Fixed
   Linear Actuators
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRECISION ENGINEERING AND MANUFACTURING
AB A new 2R1T (R: rotation, T: translation) parallel manipulator (PM), called Tex3, is proposed. The Tex3 PM is a 2PUR-PRU PM consisting of 9 joints with 12 DOFs (degrees of freedom), and can be actuated by fixed linear actuators. Mobility analysis shows that it is an RPR-equivalent PM whose finite motion is the product of a rotation (R) followed by a translation (P) and another rotation (R). Inverse position and velocity analyses are discussed. Furthermore, the local transmission index and good transmission workspace are used to evaluate the motion/force transmissibility of the proposed PM. The singularity loci of the proposed PM are obtained according to the motion/force transmissibility, corresponding to the inverse, forward and combined kinematic singularity. The constraint singularity is also discussed. Finally, link parameters are optimized to obtain an improved good transmission workspace. Because of its minimum DOF of joints and fixed linear actuators, the Tex3 PM has good kinematic performance and is suited to the high-speed machining of workpieces with curved surfaces.

TI An End-to-End Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning Framework for
   Language Understanding
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods such as Word2vec, BERT, and GPT have shown great effectiveness in language understanding. Contrastive learning, as a recent SSL approach, has attracted increasing attention in NLP. Contrastive learning learns data representations by predicting whether two augmented data instances are generated from the same original data example. Previous contrastive learning methods perform data augmentation and contrastive learning separately. As a result, the augmented data may not be optimal for contrastive learning. To address this problem, we propose a four-level optimization framework that performs data augmentation and contrastive learning end-to-end, to enable the augmented data to be tailored to the contrastive learning task. This framework consists of four learning stages, including training machine translation models for sentence augmentation, pretraining a text encoder using contrastive learning, finetuning a text classification model, and updating weights of translation data by minimizing the validation loss of the classification model, which are performed in a unified way. Experiments on datasets in the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a) and on datasets used in Gururangan et al. (2020) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

AB Subword segmentation is widely used to address the open vocabulary problem in machine translation. The dominant approach to subword segmentation is Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), which keeps the most frequent words intact while splitting the rare ones into multiple tokens. While multiple segmentations are possible even with the same vocabulary, BPE splits words into unique sequences; this may prevent a model from better learning the compositionality of words and being robust to segmentation errors. So far, the only way to overcome this BPE imperfection, its deterministic nature, was to create another subword segmentation algorithm (Kudo, 2018). In contrast, we show that BPE itself incorporates the ability to produce multiple segmentations of the same word. We introduce BPE-dropout - simple and effective subword regularization method based on and compatible with conventional BPE. It stochastically corrupts the segmentation procedure of BPE, which leads to producing multiple segmentations within the same fixed BPE framework. Using BPE-dropout during training and the standard BPE during inference improves translation quality up to 2.3 BLEU compared to BPE and up to 0.9 BLEU compared to the previous subword regularization.

AB This paper describes our effort to build a large-scale commonsense knowledge base in Korean by converting a pre-existing one in English, called ConceptNet. The English commonsense knowledge base is essentially a huge net consisting of concepts and relations. Triplets in the form of Concept-Relation-Concept in the net were extracted from English sentences collected from volunteers through a Web site, who were interested in entering commonsense knowledge. Our effort is an attempt to obtain its Korean version by utilizing a variety of language resources and tools. We not only employed a morphological analyzer and existing commercial machine translation software but also developed our own special-purpose translation and out-of-vocabulary handling methods. In order to handle ambiguity, we also devised a noisy concept filtering and concept generalization methods. Out of the 2.4 million assertions, i.e. triplets of concept-relation-concept, in the English ConceptNet, we generated about 200,000 Korean assertions so far. Based on our manual judgments of a 5% sample, the accuracy was 84.4%.

AB Our study arose from a need to find and fill lacunas in knowledge systems supporting machine translation. The paper focuses on the challenge of developing a model that describes processes of goal-oriented enrichment of linguistic typologies as dynamic knowledge systems about language units and their translations. To describe the processes, we have developed a model of knowledge discovery for filling lacunas. The model is based on the idea of the spiral of knowledge creation and describes a process of populating a typology. The population process is based on conceptualizing potential sources of new meanings. In our projects, the potential sources are parallel texts. The conceptualization provides an opportunity to discover and describe new meanings of language units in question. The goal of the paper is to present the proposed model and scrutinize iterative stages of the discovery of new meanings of language units for filling lacunas in a typology. We develop a computer system to represent discovery outcomes and populate the typology. We give an example showing that new meanings could be discovered and used to enrich the typology.

AB Redundantly actuated parallel manipulators (RAPMs) with two rotations and one translation (2R1T) are suitable for some manufacturing applications where high precision and speed are required. In this paper, a new 2R1T RAPM with two output moving platforms, called Var2 RAPM, is proposed. The Var2 RAPM is a (2RPR-R)-RPS-UPS RAPM, which is actuated by four P joints (where R denotes a revolute joint, P denotes an actuated prismatic joint, S denotes a spherical joint, and U denotes a universal joint). First, the mobility analysis shows that the second moving platform can achieve two rotations and one translation. Then, the inverse kinematics is presented by using the constraints of joints. In addition, one local and two global kinematic performance indices are used to evaluate the motion/force transmissibility of the proposed Var2 RAPM. Finally, with respect to the two global kinematic indices, the architectural parameters of Var2 RAPM are optimized by using the parameter-finiteness normalization method. The Var2 RAPM has the potential for the machining of curved workpieces.

SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Sign language is an effective form of communication for speech impaired people. However, there is a challenge for people without impairment to communicate with speech impaired people because most are unaware of the language. There are several Machine Learning techniques that have been used in sign language translation. However, no study has been found in Tanzania Sign Language which is the sign language used by speech impaired people in Tanzania. This study seeks to compare the performance of SVM and CNN on translating sign language through the image recognition. The study employs Tanzanian Sign Language images as datasets. Principal Component Analysis was employed for feature extraction. Furthermore, the study used Combined 5x2cv F test to compare the two techniques. The findings indicate that CNN scored 96% in all of the parameters which are accuracy, recall, and precision while SVM scored similar rate in precision but lag behind on recall and accuracy. Additionally, the results show that there is significant difference in performance between the techniques. Therefore, the study recommends the use of CNN since it has high accuracy.

TI Interactive broadcast services for live soccer video based on instant
   semantics acquisition
SO JOURNAL OF VISUAL COMMUNICATION AND IMAGE REPRESENTATION
AB This paper presents a system for providing interactive broadcast services for live soccer video that is based on instant semantics acquisition. Currently, we have implemented two such interactive services: live event alert and on-the-fly language selection. The live event alert service has a small time lag of about 30 s for a short video clip to reach its final viewer and at most 1.5 min for a long clip of the live event. The on-the-fly language selection service allows users to choose their preferred contents and preferred language. The motivation for this work is that such interactive services will greatly increase the value of live soccer video. Currently, similar systems attempt to derive semantics of a soccer game from gamelog in freestyle text format and low-level features of the video, which is a challenging task. In this paper, we tackle this challenge with a combination of both gamelog input tool and targeted algorithm proposed in this paper. Our system is powered by our proposed semantic gamelog input tool that facilitates fast and accurate input of a semantic gamelog that contains basic semantic information of atomic events. When an interesting event occurs, our system performs boundary detection of these events by combining features extracted from the video with additional information from the semantic gamelog. This additional information facilitates our system to achieve accurate and very fast boundary detection of these events to support our live event alert service. Our system also implements a gamelog translation machine which translates the semantic gamelog (encoded in a game-specific code) into any natural language, provided that there is a configuration file for that language. Combining our gamelog translation machine with existing text-to-speech technology, we provide the on-the-fly language selection service. (Currently, our system supports English, Chinese, and Malay).

In addition, we discuss which competencies and skills will be essential for translators who have just graduated and whether, how and to what extent these can be integrated into translator education curricula. Finally, the paper demonstrates how the DigiLing courses can be used to train trainers of translation students so that the former can remain up to date with respect to the job profiles of translators today and going forward.

TI Inosine induces context-dependent recoding and translational stalling
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB RNA modifications are present in all classes of RNAs. They control the fate of mRNAs by affecting their processing, translation, or stability. Inosine is a particularly widespread modification in metazoan mRNA arising from deamination of adenosine catalyzed by the RNA-targeting adenosine deaminases ADAR1 or ADAR2. Inosine is commonly thought to be interpreted as guanosine by cellular machines and during translation. Here, we systematically test ribosomal decoding using mass spectrometry. We show that while inosine is primarily interpreted as guanosine it can also be decoded as adenosine, and rarely even as uracil. Decoding of inosine as adenosine and uracil is context-dependent. In addition, mass spectrometry analysis indicates that inosine causes ribosome stalling especially when multiple inosines are present in the codon. Indeed, ribosome profiling data from human tissues confirm inosine-dependent ribosome stalling in vivo. To our knowledge this is the first study where decoding of inosine is tested in a comprehensive and unbiased way. Thus, our study shows novel, unanticipated functions for inosines in mRNAs, further expanding coding potential and affecting translational efficiency.

AB In the design of mobile systems, hardware/software (HW/SW) co-design has important advantages by creating specialized hardware for the performance or power optimizations. Dynamic binary translation (DBT) is a key component in co-design. During the translation, a dynamic optimizer in the DBT system applies various software optimizations to improve the quality of the translated code. With dynamic optimization, optimization time is an exposed run-time overhead and useful analyses are often restricted due to their high costs. Thus, a dynamic optimizer needs to make smart decisions with limited analysis information, which complicates the design of optimization decision models and often causes failures in human-made heuristics. In mobile systems, this problem is even more challenging because of strict constraints on computing capabilities and memory size.
   To overcome the challenge, we investigate an opportunity to build practical optimization decision models for DBT by using machine learning techniques. As the first step, loop unrolling is chosen as the representative optimization. We base our approach on the industrial strength DBT infrastructure and conduct evaluation with 17,116 unrollable loops collected from 200 benchmarks and real-life programs across various domains. By utilizing all available features that are potentially important for loop unrolling decision, we identify the best classification algorithm for our infrastructure with consideration for both prediction accuracy and cost. The greedy feature selection algorithm is then applied to the classification algorithm to distinguish its significant features and cut down the feature space. By maintaining significant features only, the best affordable classifier, which satisfies the budgets allocated to the decision process, shows 74.5% of prediction accuracy for the optimal unroll factor and realizes an average 20.9% reduction in dynamic instruction count during the steady-state translated code execution. For comparison, the best baseline heuristic achieves 46.0% prediction accuracy with an average 13.6% instruction count reduction. Given that the infrastructure is already highly optimized and the ideal upper bound for instruction reduction is observed at 23.8%, we believe this result is noteworthy.

TI Filmless methods for quality assurance of Tomotherapy using ArcCHECK
SO MEDICAL PHYSICS
AB Purpose: Tomotherapy delivers an intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment by the synchronization of gantry rotation, multileaf collimator (MLC), and couch movement. This dynamic nature makes the quality assurance (QA) important and challenging. The purpose of this study is to develop some methodologies using an ArcCHECK for accurate QA measurements of the gantry angle and speed, MLC synchronization and leaf open time, couch translation per gantry rotation, couch speed and uniformity, and constancy of longitudinal beam profile for a Tomotherapy unit.
   Methods: Four test plans recommended by AAPM Task Group 148 (TG148) and the manufacturer were chosen for this study. Helical and static star shot tests are used for checking the leaves opened at the expected gantry angles. Another helical test is to verify the couch traveled the expected distance per gantry rotation. The final test is for checking the couch speed constancy with a static gantry. ArcCHECK can record the detector signal every 50 ms as a movie file, and has a virtual inclinometer for gantry angle measurement. These features made the measurement of gantry angle and speed, MLC synchronization and leaf open time, and longitudinal beam profile possible. A shaping parameter was defined for facilitating the location of the beam center during the plan delivery, which was thereafter used to calculate the couch translation per gantry rotation and couch speed. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) was calculated for each measured longitudinal beam profile and then used to evaluate the couch speed uniformity. Furthermore, a mean longitudinal profile was obtained for constancy check of field width. The machine trajectory log data were also collected for comparison. Inhouse programs were developed in MATLAB to process both the ArcCHECK and machine log data.
   Results: The deviation of our measurement results from the log data for gantry angle was calculated to be less than 0.4 degrees. The percentage differences between measured and planned leaf open time were found to be within 0.5% in all the tests. Our results showed mean values of MLC synchronization of 0.982, 0.983, and 0.995 at static gantry angle 0 degrees, 45 degrees, and 135 degrees, respectively. The mean value of measured couch translation and couch speed by ArcCHECK had less than 0.1% deviation from the planned values. The variation in the value of FWHM suggested the couch speed uniformity was better than 1%. The mean of measured longitudinal profiles was suitable for constancy check of field width.
   Conclusion: Precise and efficient methods for measuring the gantry angle and speed, leaf open time, couch translation per gantry rotation, couch speed and uniformity, and constancy of longitudinal beam profile of Tomotherapy using ArcCHECK have been developed and proven to be accurate compared with machine log data. Estimation of the Tomotherapy binary MLC leaf open time is proven to be precise enough to verify the leaf open time as small as 277.8 ms. Our method also makes the observation and quantification of the synchronization of leaves possible. (C) 2016 American Association of Physicists in Medicine

TI Defining reference values for the norma tibiofibular syndesmosis in
   adults using weight-bearing CT
SO BONE & JOINT JOURNAL
AB Aims
   Cone beam CT allows cross-sectional imaging of the tibiofibular syndesmosis while the patient bears weight. This may facilitate more accurate and reliable investigation of injuries to, and reconstruction of, the syndesmosis but normal ranges of measurements are required first. The purpose of this study was to establish: 1) the normal reference measurements of the syndesmosis; 2) if side-to-side variations exist in syndesmotic anatomy; 3) if age affects syndesmotic anatomy; and 4) if the syndesmotic anatomy differs between male and female patients in weight-bearing cone beam CT views.
   Patients and Methods
   A retrospective analysis was undertaken of 50 male and 50 female patients (200 feet) aged 18 years or more, who underwent bilateral, simultaneous imaging of their lower legs while standing in an upright, weight-bearing position in a pedCAT machine between June 2013 and July 2017. At the time of imaging, the mean age of male patients was 47.1 years (18 to 72) and the mean age of female patients was 57.8 years (18 to 83). We employed a previously described technique to obtain six lengths and one angle, as well as calculating three further measurements, to provide information on the relationship between the fibula and tibia with respect to translation and rotation.
   Results
   The upper limit of lateral translation in un-injured patients was 5.27 mm, so values higher than this may be indicative of syndesmotic injury. Anteroposterior translation lay within the ranges 0.31 mm to 2.59 mm, and -1.48 mm to 3.44 mm, respectively. There was no difference between right and left legs. Increasing age was associated with a reduction in lateral translation. The fibulae of men were significantly more laterally translated but data were inconsistent for rotation and anteroposterior translation.
   Conclusion
   We have established normal ranges for measurements in cross-sectional syndesmotic anatomy during weight-bearing and also established that no differences exist between right and left legs in patients without syndesmotic injury. Age and gender do, however, affect the anatomy of the syndesmosis, which should be taken into account at time of assessment.

TI Biomechanical evaluation of a new technique for acromioclavicular
   stabilization
SO ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH
AB Background: The most commonly used repair techniques to treat an acromioclavicular dislocation imply a suspension mechanism by substituting the supero-inferior oriented coracoclavicular structures with a tight rope mechanism or allograft. Recently, the importance of restoring the antero-posterior stability by addressing the acromioclavicular structures has also been demonstrated. If an in situ repair at the acromioclavicular joint itself could achieve a reposition and would be strong enough, the suspension of the CC structures might become obsolete. Possible advantages would be minimal dissection, lower risk in damaging neurovascular structures, greater stability, reduction of the surgical time and even the possibility of locoregional anesthesia.
   Hypothesis: In this biomechanical study, the feasibility of different in situ repair techniques is explored thereby testing both compression and translation characteristics. Our hypothesis is that an in situ repair technique results in an adequate repair for the AC joint.
   Methods and materials: Polyurethane foam blocks will be used as a model for the acromioclavicular joint and the repair techniques will be done by using a combination of sutures and bone anchors or using a transosseous technique. Compression will be measured by means of a Tekscan pressure sensor and translation will be tested in three orthogonal directions using a tensile testing machine. Four different knot anchor configurations (nice knot, surgical knot in two different configurations, Nicky's knot) will be tested for compression. The strongest knot anchor configuration will then be compared side to side with a transosseous configuration for translation.
   Results: The nice knot in combination with bone anchors provides the strongest compression. In the side to side comparison of a nice knot anchor configuration versus a transosseous nice knot configuration, the transosseous technique shows more resistance to translation.
   Discussion: An in situ repair by a combination of the nice knot with an anchor or a transosseous nice knot configuration can theoretically be used as a repair technique for an acromioclavicular dislocation. In comparison with existing techniques, this model shows favorable results for translation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI Nonanatomic Tibial Tunnel Placement for Single-Bundle Posterior Cruciate
   Ligament Reconstruction Leads to Greater Posterior Tibial Translation in
   a Biomechanical Model
SO ARTHROSCOPY-THE JOURNAL OF ARTHROSCOPIC AND RELATED SURGERY
AB Purpose: To determine the effect of varying proximal-distal tibial tunnel placement on posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) laxity. Methods: Nine matched pairs (18 total) of cadaveric knees (mean age 79.3 years, range 60 to 89), were studied. The specimens from each pair were randomly divided into 2 groups based on tibial tunnel placement: (1) anatomic tunnel and (2) proximal nonanatomic tunnel. A 150-N cyclic posterior tibial load was applied using a Materials Testing System machine at 0 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees of knee flexion. Each specimen completed 50 cycles at a rate of 0.2 Hz at each knee flexion angle. In 10 specimens, a static 250-N posterior tibial load was applied at 90 degrees of knee flexion. Posterior tibial translation was recorded. Load to failure for all specimens was recorded. Results: With application of a 150-N posteriorly directed cyclic force, the anatomic tunnel group had significantly less posterior tibial translation (millimeters, mean [standard deviation (SD)]) than the proximal nonanatomic tunnel group at 0 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees of knee flexion: 1.1 (0.3) v 1.5 (0.4), P = .031; 1.1 (0.6) v 2.2 (0.9), P = .019; 0.9 (0.4) v 2.0 (0.6), P = .001; 0.9 (0.6) v 2.9 (0.7), P < .001, respectively. The anatomic tunnel group also demonstrated significantly less posterior tibial translation (millimeters, mean [ SD]) than the nonanatomic tunnel group at 90 degrees with a static 250-N posteriorly directed force applied (P < .05): 2.3 (1.3) v 6.1 (2.3), P = .016. Four pairs were excluded from the 250-N results because of prior load to failure testing. Conclusions: Anatomic tibial tunnel placement re-creating the tibial origin of the PCL results in significantly less posterior tibial translation than proximal nonanatomic tibial tunnel placement. Correct placement of the tibial tunnel during PCL reconstruction is essential for avoidance of posterior laxity.

TI Invariable stoichiometry of ribosomal proteins in mouse brain tissues
   with aging
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Across phyla, the ribosomes-the central molecular machines for translation of genetic information-exhibit an overall preserved architecture and a conserved functional core. The natural heterogeneity of the ribosome periodically phases a debate on their functional specialization and the tissue-specific variations of the ribosomal protein (RP) pool. Using sensitive differential proteomics, we performed a thorough quantitative inventory of the protein composition of ribosomes from 3 different mouse brain tissues, i.e., hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum, across various ages, i.e., juvenile, adult, and middle-aged mouse groups. In all 3 brain tissues, in both monosomal and polysomal ribosome fractions, we detected an invariant set of 72 of 79 core RPs, RACK1 and 2 of the 8 RP paralogs, the stoichiometry of which remained constant across different ages. The amount of a few RPs punctually varied in either one tissue or one age group, but these fluctuations were within the tight bounds of the measurement noise. Further comparison with the ribosomes from a high-metabolic-rate organ, e.g., the liver, revealed protein composition identical to that of the ribosomes from the 3 brain tissues. Together, our data show an invariant protein composition of ribosomes from 4 tissues across different ages of mice and support the idea that functional heterogeneity may arise from factors other than simply ribosomal protein stoichiometry.

TI Exploring the Limits of Synthetic Creation of Solar EUV Images via
   Image-to-image Translation
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), a NASA multispectral decade-long mission that has been daily producing terabytes of observational data from the Sun, has been recently used as a use case to demonstrate the potential of machine-learning methodologies and to pave the way for future deep space mission planning. In particular, the idea of using image-to-image translation to virtually produce extreme ultraviolet channels has been proposed in several recent studies, as a way to both enhance missions with fewer available channels and to alleviate the challenges due to the low downlink rate in deep space. This paper investigates the potential and the limitations of such a deep learning approach by focusing on the permutation of four channels and an encoder-decoder based architecture, with particular attention to how morphological traits and brightness of the solar surface affect the neural network predictions. In this work we want to answer the question: can synthetic images of the solar corona produced via image-to-image translation be used for scientific studies of the Sun? The analysis highlights that the neural network produces high-quality images over 3 orders of magnitude in count rate (pixel intensity) and can generally reproduce the covariance across channels within a 1% error. However, the model performance drastically diminishes in correspondence to extremely high energetic events like flares, and we argue that the reason is related to the rareness of such events posing a challenge to model training.

TI Model-driven design of synthetic N-terminal coding sequences for
   regulating gene expression in yeast and bacteria
SO BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL
AB N-terminal coding sequences (NCSs) are key regulatory elements for fine-tuning gene expression during translation initiation-the rate-limiting step of translation. However, owing to the complex combinatory effects of NCS biophysical factors and endogenous regulation, designing NCSs remains challenging. In this study, a multi-view learning strategy for model-driven generation of synthetic NCSs for Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Bacillus subtilis are implemented, which are widely used in laboratories and industries. NCS libraries for S. cerevisiae and B. subtilis with nearly 150,000 cells were sorted. Next, model training was performed with NCS deep features extracted from DNA, codon, and amino acid sequences, as well as calculated features from the minimum free energy (MFE) and tRNA adaption index. Two models were separately developed for generating synthetic NCSs for both up- and down-regulating gene expression with accuracies higher than 65% for S. cerevisiae and B. subtilis. Synthetic NCSs were then applied to enhance bioproduction, yielding 1.48- and 1.71-fold production improvements of D-limonene by S. cerevisiae and ovalbumin by B. subtilis, respectively. This work provides model-driven design of synthetic NCSs as a toolbox for regulating gene expression in S. cerevisiae and B. subtilis. The machine learning-based modeling approach can be used for NCS design in other microorganisms.

TI Asymmetric Joint GANs for Normalizing Face Illumination From a Single
   Image
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA
AB Illumination normalization for face recognition is very important when a face is captured under harsh lighting conditions. Instead of designing hand-crafted features, in this paper we formulate face illumination normalization as an image-to-image translation task. A great challenge of face normalization is that human facial structures are particularly sensitive to image structure distortion, which frequently occurs in traditional image-to-image translation tasks. Unfortunately, sometimes even slight facial structure distortions may prohibit human eyes and machine face recognition methods from identifying face identities. To address this issue, a novel GAN-based network architecture called the asymmetric joint generative adversarial network (AJGAN) is developed to normalize face images under arbitrary illumination conditions, without known face geometry and albedo information. In addition, an illumination normalization GAN G(1) and an asymmetric relighting GAN G(2) that maps a frontal-illuminated image to images with various lighting conditions are incorporated in AJGAN to maintain personalized facial structures. To avoid image blurring caused by the under-constrained relighting mapping, we introduce a scheme of one-hot lighting labels into G(2) and enforce label classification loss. Furthermore, the number of training images starting from a very limited number of labels is dynamically extended by the combination of different lighting labels. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on three databases validate that AJGAN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

TI Status and technology in the professionalisation of translators. Market
   disorder and the return of hierarchy
SO JOURNAL OF SPECIALISED TRANSLATION
AB The professional status of a translator is traditionally indicated by a set of social signals including previous experience, academic qualifications, professional accreditation and membership of associations. When those signals shifted from print and word-of-mouth to electronic media, some degree of market disorder resulted with respect to globalisation of translator-client contacts, the growth of volunteer translation, access to free online machine translation, and the corresponding motivation to steal the identities of professional translators. Three case studies of websites and forums that have been associated with market disorder (ProZ.com, a comparison of aRGENTeaM and GrupoTS, and the Translator Scammers Directory) indicate that the initial disorder has been challenged and in some cases significantly corrected, with new forms of signalling appearing within the electronic environments. ProZ. com has instigated its own accreditation system, the volunteer subtitling communities have developed elaborate internal hierarchies of control, and the stealing of translators' identities has been challenged through more sophisticated use of the same electronic media that allowed the thefts. In the new configuration of signals, however, it would seem that academic qualifications have less market value than does verifiable professional experience, while professional accreditation still has value but can be forged. For many segments of the translation market, the return to market equilibrium will require greater attention to new signalling mechanisms, with more sophisticated uses of electronic communication.

TI Exploring the structural dynamics of the E-coli chaperonin GroEL using
   translation-libration-screw crystallographic refinement of intermediate
   states
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Large rigid-body domain movements are critical to GroEL-mediated protein folding, especially apical domain elevation and twist associated with the formation of a folding chamber upon binding ATP and chaperonin GroES. Here, we have modeled the anisotropic displacements of GroEL domains from various crystallized states, unliganded GroEL, ATPgammaS-bound, ADP-AlFx/GroES-bound, and ADP/GroES bound, using translation-libration-screw (TLS) analysis. Remarkably, the TLS results show that the inherent motions of unliganded GroEL, a polypeptide-accepting state, are biased along the transition pathway that leads to the folding-active state. In the ADP-AlFx/GroES-bound folding-active state the dynamic modes of the apical domains become reoriented and coupled to the motions of bound GroES. The ADP/GroES complex exhibits these same motions, but they are increased in magnitude, potentially reflecting the decreased stability of the complex after nucleotide hydrolysis. Our results have allowed the visualization of the anisotropic molecular motions that link the static conformations previously observed by X-ray crystallography. Application of the same analyses to other macromolecules where rigid body motions occur may give insight into the large scale dynamics critical for function and thus has the potential to extend our fundamental understanding of molecular machines.

TI GROWTH-RATES AND INTERFACE SHAPES IN GERMANIUM AND LEAD-TIN TELLURIDE
   OBSERVED IN-SITU, REAL-TIME IN VERTICAL BRIDGMAN FURNACES
SO JOURNAL OF CRYSTAL GROWTH
AB Using the advanced technology developed to visualize the melt-solid interface in low Prandtl number materials, crystal growth rates and interface shapes have been measured in germanium and lead tin telluride semiconductors grown in vertical Bridgman furnaces. The experimental importance of using in-situ, real time observations to determine interface shapes, to measure crystal growth rates, and to improve furnace and ampoule designs is demonstrated. The interface shapes observed in-situ, in real-time were verified by quenching and mechanically induced interface demarcation, and they were also confirmed using machined models to ascertain the absence of geometric distortions. Interface shapes depended upon the interface position in the furnace insulation zone, varied with the nature of the crystal being grown, and were dependent on the extent of transition zones at the ends of the ampoule. Actual growth rates varied significantly from the constant translation rate in response to the thermophysical properties of the crystal and its melt and the thermal conditions existing in the furnace at the interface. In the elemental semiconductor germanium the observed rates of crystal growth exceeded the imposed translation rate, but in the compound semiconductor lead tin telluride the observed rates of growth were less than the translation rate. Finally, the extent of ampoule thermal loading influenced the interface positions, the shapes, and the growth rates.

AB Modern deep learning methods have achieved great success in machine learning and computer vision fields by learning a set of pre-defined datasets. Howerver, these methods perform unsatisfactorily when applied into real-world situations. The reason of this phenomenon is that learning new tasks leads the trained model quickly forget the knowledge of old tasks, which is referred to as catastrophic forgetting. Current state-of-the-art incremental learning methods tackle catastrophic forgetting problem in traditional classification networks and ignore the problem existing in embedding networks, which are the basic networks for image retrieval, face recognition, zero-shot learning, etc. Different from traditional incremental classification networks, the semantic gap between the embedding spaces of two adjacent tasks is the main challenge for embedding networks under incremental learning setting. Thus, we propose a novel class-incremental method for embedding network, named as zero-shot translation class-incremental method (ZSTCI), which leverages zero-shot translation to estimate the semantic gap without any exemplars. Then, we try to learn a unified representation for two adjacent tasks in sequential learning process, which captures the relationships of previous classes and current classes precisely. In addition, ZSTCI can easily be combined with existing regularization-based incremental learning methods to further improve performance of embedding networks. We conduct extensive experiments on CUB-200-2011 and CIFAR100, and the experiment results prove the effectiveness of our method. The code of our method has been released in https://github.com/Drkun/ZSTCI.

TI KINEMATICS OF EXPERIMENTAL FORCED FOLDS AND THEIR RELEVANCE TO
   CROSS-SECTION BALANCING
SO TECTONOPHYSICS
AB We report the results of a series of laboratory experiments in which packages of layers (consisting of rock and lead) are deformed under 50 MPa confining pressure into forced folds by the uplift and rotation of pre-machined steel forcing blocks. The models are not fully scaled, but the geometries resulting form the deformation are remarkably similar to many natural forced folds observed in the U.S. Rocky Mountains foreland. During the folding, detachment and quantifiable layer-parallel translation occur between the layered sequence and the forcing assembly, confirming limited observations from earlier model studies. Away from the fold, there is a pattern of movement in which the layered sequence first moves away from the uplift, but, with greater structural relief, those motions reverse their sense to become layer-parallel translations towards the uplift. The very ductile lead unit at the base of the layered sequence flows laterally, especially across the crest of the uplift to the downthrown block, in response to pressure gradients which are inherent to asymmetric uplifts. The flow of this ductile unit causes layer-parallel translation of the rock layers, thereby transporting material into the fold. If the models were to be treated as proposed cross sections, and if they were subjected to the usual techniques of cross-section balancing, incorrect interpretations would result; this is because there are no suitable sites for either pin lines or no-flow boundaries.

AB In this paper we introduce Smario, a MATLAB open source toolbox for the analysis of BCI signals and implementation of translation algorithms for BCI systems. The Smario functions have been created based on the design of EEGLAB [1], they are accessible through the graphic user interface but they can also be run and edited using MATLAB syntax. Smario reads BCI2000 files in DAT and MAT formats, and documentation is available to implement functions to read other formats.
   This toolbox incorporates two feature selection methods based on discriminative measures; r(2) and SEPCOR. Using the graphical capabilities of EEGLAB [1], these feature selection modules provide 2-D and 3-D topographic maps of scalp data fields for selected features and graphs of the extracted features for selected channels.
   Smario's modularized design allows the user to create a translation algorithm using existing feature extraction, selection and classification modules. These modules are easily configurable and interchangeable, to provide the user with means to compare different translation algorithms. Furthermore, the implementation of new modules is possible and guidelines for this purpose have been included in the documentation. Available modules are Common Average Reference (CAR), MEM Filter, Autoregressive (AR) analysis, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Bayesian Classifier, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), SEPCOR and r(2). Smario is available for download at http://www.hst.aau.dk/bci/Smariovl/Smindex.html where documentation and sample files can also be found.

TI SAR-to-Optical Image Translation Based on Conditional Generative
   Adversarial Networks-Optimization, Opportunities and Limits
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB Due to its all time capability, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing plays an important role in Earth observation. The ability to interpret the data is limited, even for experts, as the human eye is not familiar to the impact of distance-dependent imaging, signal intensities detected in the radar spectrum as well as image characteristics related to speckle or steps of post-processing. This paper is concerned with machine learning for SAR-to-optical image-to-image translation in order to support the interpretation and analysis of original data. A conditional adversarial network is adopted and optimized in order to generate alternative SAR image representations based on the combination of SAR images (starting point) and optical images (reference) for training. Following this strategy, the focus is set on the value of empirical knowledge for initialization, the impact of results on follow-up applications, and the discussion of opportunities/drawbacks related to this application of deep learning. Case study results are shown for high resolution (SAR: TerraSAR-X, optical: ALOS PRISM) and low resolution (Sentinel-1 and -2) data. The properties of the alternative image representation are evaluated based on feedback from experts in SAR remote sensing and the impact on road extraction as an example for follow-up applications. The results provide the basis to explain fundamental limitations affecting the SAR-to-optical image translation idea but also indicate benefits from alternative SAR image representations.

TI Abstraction and analysis of clinical guidance trees
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS
AB Objectives: The aims of this work were: to define an abstract notation for interactive decision trees; to formally analyse exploration errors in such trees through automated translation to LOTOS (language of temporal ordering specification); to generate tree implementations through automated translation for an existing tree viewer, and to demonstrate the approach oil healthcare examples created by the CGT (clinical guidance tree) project.
   Approach: An abstract and machine-readable notation was developed for describing clinical guidance trees: AD/IT (abstract decision/interactive trees). A methodology has been designed for creating trees using AD/IT. In particular, tree structure is separated from tree content. Tree structure and flow are designed and evaluated before committing to detailed content of the tree. Software tools have been created to translate AD/IT tree descriptions into LOTOS and into CGT Viewer format. These representations support formal analysis and interactive exploration of decision trees. Through automated conversion of existing CGT trees, realistic healthcare applications have been used to validate the approach.
   Results: All key objectives of the work have been achieved. An abstract notation has been created for decision trees, and is supported by automated translation and analysis. Although healthcare applications have been the main focus to date, the approach is generic and of value in almost any domain where decision trees are useful. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

TI Towards molecular machines and motors based on transition metal
   complexes
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY
CT 8th European Symposium on Organic Reactivity
CY SEP, 2001
CL CAVTAT, CROATIA
AB Biological motors and machines are multicomponent assemblies undergoing large-amplitude geometrical changes or leading to the locomotion of one of the components, under the action of either an external stimulus (pH change, redox process, light pulse, etc.) or a chemical gradient. Many examples are known of proteins which undergo important shape modifications (folding-defolding) after a signal has been sent to the protein. Threaded or interlocking rings are ideally suited to the construction of fully artificial molecular motors. If a ring is threaded onto a rod, it can either rotate around the axle or undergo a translation movement. Similarly, in catenanes (i.e. interlocking ring multicomponent systems), a ring can glide at will and spin within another ring. Several examples of such compounds have been elaborated and studied in recent years, using threaded and interlocking molecules. Our group has proposed several molecular assemblies acting as 'machines.' They are based on transition metal complexes and the systems are set in motion by sending an electrochemical or photochemical signal. A recent contribution from our team describes a doubly threaded compound which can be contracted or stretched at will. By sending a chemical signal to the molecule, one can readily convert the contracted compound [copper(I) complex] to the extended situation (zinc complex). The back reaction is also easily carried out and it is quantitative. Potentially, the system is ready to react to an electrochemical stimulus and lead to the same movement. The present molecular assembly is thus reminiscent of skeletal muscles. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

TI Multi-task Stack Propagation for Neural Quality Estimation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB Quality estimation is an important task in machine translation that has attracted increased interest in recent years. A key problem in translation-quality estimation is the lack of a sufficient amount of the quality annotated training data. To address this shortcoming, the Predictor-Estimator was proposed recently by introducing "word prediction" as an additional pre-subtask that predicts a current target word with consideration of surrounding source and target contexts, resulting in a two-stage neural model composed of a predictor and an estimator. However, the original Predictor-Estimator is not trained on a continuous stacking model but instead in a cascaded manner that separately trains the predictor from the estimator. In addition, the Predictor-Estimator is trained based on single-task learning only, which uses target-specific quality-estimation data without using other training data that are available from other-level quality-estimation tasks. In this article, we thus propose a multi-task stack propagation, which extensively applies stack propagation to fully train the Predictor-Estimator on a continuous stacking architecture and multi-task learning to enhance the training data from related other-level quality-estimation tasks. Experimental results on WMT17 quality-estimation datasets show that the Predictor-Estimator trained with multi-task stack propagation provides statistically significant improvements over the baseline models. In particular, under an ensemble setting, the proposed multi-task stack propagation leads to state-of-the-art performance at all the sentence/word/phrase levels for WMT17 quality estimation tasks.

TI Improving the outcome of kidney transplantation by ameliorating renal
   ischemia reperfusion injury: lost in translation?
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
AB Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice in patients with end stage renal disease. During kidney transplantation ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) occurs, which is a risk factor for acute kidney injury, delayed graft function and acute and chronic rejection. Kidneys from living donors show a superior short-and long-term graft survival compared with deceased donors. However, the shortage of donor kidneys has resulted in expansion of the donor pool by using not only living-and brain death donors but also kidneys from donation after circulatory death and from extended criteria donors. These grafts are associated with an increased sensitivity to IRI and decreased graft outcome due to prolonged ischemia and donor comorbidity. Therefore, preventing or ameliorating IRI may improve graft survival. Animal experiments focus on understanding the mechanism behind IRI and try to find methods to minimize IRI either before, during or after ischemia. This review evaluates the different experimental strategies that have been investigated to prevent or ameliorate renal IRI. In addition, we review the current state of translation to the clinical setting. Experimental research has contributed to the development of strategies to prevent or ameliorate IRI, but promising results in animal studies have not yet been successfully translated to clinical use.

TI Ultrafast laser micro-cutting of stainless steel and PZT using a
   modulated line of multiple foci formed by spatial beam shaping
SO OPTICS AND LASERS IN ENGINEERING
AB Femtosecond laser surface processing of materials allows for precise micrometer cutting with restricted detrimental side effects. An efficient way to increase the ablation or cutting speed and energy efficiency of the process is the generation of N parallel laser spots in the focal plane of a lens on the sample surface, each spot simultaneously following a defined cutting trajectory. However, the cutting scheme is then limited in area to avoid overlap of the spot trajectories. We present in this paper a technique to overcome this limitation. The ultrafast laser beam wavefront is spatially modulated, generating a line of multiple processing spots in the lens focal plane. Micro-cutting is then conducted by translation of the sample along the spot line. That way, no restriction on the cutting trajectory length is imposed while preserving the increase in the cutting speed and energy efficiency of the process compared to single spot machining. Successful cutting of PZT ceramic and stainless steel is achieved with the spot array and compared to single spot machining in terms of processing time. In the case of PZT, the cutting efficiency and speed is compared to single spot laser machining with various focal lenses. We also investigate the effect of intensity gradient on the spots line for micro-cutting on stainless steel. The method efficiency is discussed relying on surface characterization using scanning electron microscopy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Atomic structure generation from reconstructing structural fingerprints
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Data-driven machine learning methods have the potential to dramatically accelerate the rate of materials design over conventional human-guided approaches. These methods would help identify or, in the case of generative models, even create novel crystal structures of materials with a set of specified functional properties to then be synthesized or isolated in the laboratory. For crystal structure generation, a key bottleneck lies in developing suitable atomic structure fingerprints or representations for the machine learning model, analogous to the graph-based or SMILES representations used in molecular generation. However, finding data-efficient representations that are invariant to translations, rotations, and permutations, while remaining invertible to the Cartesian atomic coordinates remains an ongoing challenge. Here, we propose an alternative approach to this problem by taking existing non-invertible representations with the desired invariances and developing an algorithm to reconstruct the atomic coordinates through gradient-based optimization using automatic differentiation. This can then be coupled to a generative machine learning model which generates new materials within the representation space, rather than in the data-inefficient Cartesian space. In this work, we implement this end-to-end structure generation approach using atom-centered symmetry functions as the representation and conditional variational autoencoders as the generative model. We are able to successfully generate novel and valid atomic structures of sub-nanometer Pt nanoparticles as a proof of concept. Furthermore, this method can be readily extended to any suitable structural representation, thereby providing a powerful, generalizable framework towards structure-based generation.

TI Application of machine learning in predicting the risk of postpartum
   depression: A systematic review
SO JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
AB Background: Postpartum depression (PPD) presents a serious health problem among women and their families. Machine learning (ML) is a rapidly advancing field with increasing utility in predicting PPD risk. We aimed to synthesize and evaluate the quality of studies on application of ML techniques in predicting PPD risk. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of eight databases, identifying English and Chinese studies on ML techniques for predicting PPD risk and ML techniques with performance metrics. Quality of the studies involved was evaluated using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool.
   Results: Seventeen studies involving 62 prediction models were included. Supervised learning was the main ML technique employed and the common ML models were support vector machine, random forest and logistic regression. Five studies (30 %) reported both internal and external validation. Two studies involved model translation, but none were tested clinically. All studies showed a high risk of bias, and more than half showed high application risk.
   Limitations: Including Chinese articles slightly reduced the reproducibility of the review. Model performance was not quantitatively analyzed owing to inconsistent metrics and the absence of methods for correlation metaanalysis.
   Conclusions: Researchers have paid more attention to model development than to validation, and few have focused on improvement and innovation. Models for predicting PPD risk continue to emerge. However, few have achieved the acceptable quality standards. Therefore, ML techniques for successfully predicting PPD risk are yet to be deployed in clinical environments.

SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB Availability of corpora is a basic requirement for conducting research in a particular language. Unfortunately, for a morphologically rich language like Urdu, despite being used by over a 100 million people around the globe, the dearth of corpora is a major reason for the lack of attention and advancement in research. To this end, we present the first-ever large-scale publicly available Roman-Urdu parallel corpus, Roman-Urdu-Parl, with 6.37 million sentence-pairs. It is a huge corpus collected from diverse sources, annotated using crowd-sourcing techniques, and also assured for quality. It has a total of 92.76 million Roman-Urdu words, 92.85 million Urdu words, Roman-Urdu vocabulary of 42.9 K words, and Urdu vocabulary of 43.8 K words. Roman-Urdu-Parl has been built to ensure that it not only captures the morphological and linguistic features of the language but also the heterogeneity and variations arising due to demographic conditions. We validate the authenticity and quality of our corpus by using it to address two natural language processing research problems, that is, on learning word embeddings and building a machine transliteration system. Our contribution of the corpus leads to exceptional results in both settings, for example, our machine transliteration system sets a new state-of-the-art with a Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score of 84.67. We believe that Roman-Urdu-Parl can serve as fuel for igniting and advancing works in many research areas related to the Urdu language.

AB Electrohydrodynamic inkjet printing (e-jet printing) is one type of micro/nano scale 3D printing technique that automatically deposits functional materials to form 3D structures on the substrate. Unlike traditional thermal or acoustic inkjet printing, e-jet printing utilizes high electrical forces that enable the ink to overcome surface tension at the tip of micro nozzles. The droplets and filaments coming out from the nozzle have dimensions much smaller than the dimensions of the nozzle, thus printing geometries in micro and nano scale. E-jet printing process parameters could affect the final quality attributes of fabricated constructs. Currently, assessment of these critical geometries and attributes must be performed offline using optical microscopy or scanning electron microscopy. This drawback affected the efficiency of micro/nano printing from translation into industrial practice. The research in this paper focused on fundamental research to enable in-situ monitoring of e-jet printing using a real-time images characterization technique. In conclusion, the study in this paper investigated using machine vision for real-time monitoring of micro/nano scale 3D printing. The method worked well for micro-filament detection in e-jet printing, and may be further implemented into feedback control system of complicated e-j et printing. However, the optical machine vision was limited to micro scale detection. One of the future research topic is to develop nano scale in-situ detection mechanism for e-jet printing.

TI Toward point-of-care ultrasound estimation of fetal gestational age from
   the trans-cerebellar diameter using CNN-based ultrasound image analysis
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING
AB Obstetric ultrasound is a fundamental ingredient of modern prenatal care with many applications including accurate dating of a pregnancy, identifying pregnancy-related complications, and diagnosis of fetal abnormalities. However, despite its many benefits, two factors currently prevent wide-scale uptake of this technology for point-of-care clinical decision-making in low- and middle-income country (LM IC) settings. First, there is a steep learning curve for scan proficiency, and second, there has been a lack of easy-to-use, affordable, and portable ultrasound devices. We introduce a framework toward addressing these barriers, enabled by recent advances in machine learning applied to medical imaging. The framework is designed to be realizable as a point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) solution with an affordable wireless ultrasound probe, a smartphone or tablet, and automated machine-learning-based image processing. Specifically, we propose a machine-learning-based algorithm pipeline designed to automatically estimate the gestational age of a fetus from a short fetal ultrasound scan. We present proof-of-concept evaluation of accuracy of the key image analysis algorithms for automatic head transcerebellar plane detection, automatic transcerebellar diameter measurement, and estimation of gestational age on conventional ultrasound data simulating the POCUS task and discuss next steps toward translation via a first application on clinical ultrasound video from a low-cost ultrasound probe.

TI Use of machine learning to improve autism screening and diagnostic
   instruments: effectiveness, efficiency, and multi-instrument fusion
SO JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY
AB Background: Machine learning (ML) provides novel opportunities for human behavior research and clinical translation, yet its application can have noted pitfalls (Bone et al., 2015). In this work, we fastidiously utilize ML to derive autism spectrum disorder (ASD) instrument algorithms in an attempt to improve upon widely used ASD screening and diagnostic tools. Methods: The data consisted of Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores for 1,264 verbal individuals with ASD and 462 verbal individuals with non-ASD developmental or psychiatric disorders, split at age 10. Algorithms were created via a robust ML classifier, support vector machine, while targeting best-estimate clinical diagnosis of ASD versus non-ASD. Parameter settings were tuned in multiple levels of cross-validation. Results: The created algorithms were more effective (higher performing) than the current algorithms, were tunable (sensitivity and specificity can be differentially weighted), and were more efficient (achieving near-peak performance with five or fewer codes). Results from ML-based fusion of ADI-R and SRS are reported. We present a screener algorithm for below (above) age 10 that reached 89.2% (86.7%) sensitivity and 59.0% (53.4%) specificity with only five behavioral codes. Conclusions: ML is useful for creating robust, customizable instrument algorithms. In a unique dataset comprised of controls with other difficulties, our findings highlight the limitations of current caregiver-report instruments and indicate possible avenues for improving ASD screening and diagnostic tools.

TI A Function-Behaviour-Structure Machine Design Model and its use in
   Assembly Sequence Planning
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN
AB By expanding some concepts behind the Edinburgh Designer System (EDS), the paper proposes a function-behaviour-structure-based representation scheme for mechanical systems and assemblies (MSAs) that possibly supports both conceptual design and design for manufacturing. A machine structure might be viewed as being composed of two basic elements: components and connectors. Components are concrete elements such as a step shaft or a gear. Connectors are abstract elements corresponding to fastening, joining, constraint, or other functions and behaviours which are placed between two components. At the different design stages, a connector could be a form feature, a physical component or even a sub-assembly. Functional and behavioural descriptions are embedded in the structural model as predicate logic. This 'integrated design object model' provides an insight into machine design. One of the applications of such a representation is to offer designers on-line help for evaluating product assemblability by automatically generating an assembly sequence. The paper describes the problem of an assembly sequence as the sequentially movable separability of a collection of objects. A three-step alogrithm was developed to reason about assembly sequence. In the first step, sub-assemblies are recognized from the design object model using knowledge-based rules. In the second step, the precedence between sub-assemblies is obtained using the depth-sort method. Then the whole machine structure is disassembled through two kinds of atom operations: sequential translation and rotation in one direction needed for disassembling. It is successfully applied to typical mechanical products in the automotive industry such as a pump or a differential gear box.

TI Identifying urethral strictures using machine learning: a
   proof-of-concept evaluation of convolutional neural network model
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
AB Introduction To evaluate urethral strictures and to determine appropriate surgical reconstructive options, retrograde urethrograms (RUG) are used. Herein, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based machine learning algorithm to characterize RUG images between those with urethral strictures and those without urethral strictures. Methods Following approval from institutional REB from participating institutions (The Hospital for Sick Children [Toronto, Canada], St. Luke's Medical Centre [Quezon City, Philippines], East Virginia Medical School [Norfolk, United States of America]), retrograde urethrogram images were collected and anonymized. Additional RUG images were downloaded online using web scraping method through Selenium and Python 3.8.2. A CNN with three convolutional layers and three pooling layers were built (Fig. 1). Data augmentation was applied with zoom, contrast, horizontal flip, and translation. The data were split into 90% training and 10% testing set. The model was trained with one hundred epochs. Results A total of 242 RUG images were identified. 196 were identified as strictures and 46 as normal. Following training, our model achieved accuracy of up to 92.2% with its training data set in characterizing RUG images to stricture and normal images. The validation accuracy using our testing set images showed that it was able to characterize 88.5% of the images correctly. Conclusion It is feasible to use a machine learning algorithm to accurately differentiate between a stricture and normal RUG. Further development of the model with additional RUGs may allow characterization of stricture location and length to suggest optimal operative approach for repair.

AB Memristor crossbars are circuits capable of performing analog matrix-vector multiplications, overcoming the fundamental energy efficiency limitations of digital logic. They have been shown to be effective in special-purpose accelerators for a limited set of neural network applications.
   We present the Programmable Ultra-efficient Memristor-based Accelerator (PUMA) which enhances memristor crossbars with general purpose execution units to enable the acceleration of a wide variety of Machine Learning (ML) inference workloads. PUMA's microarchitecture techniques exposed through a specialized Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) retain the efficiency of in-memory computing and analog circuitry, without compromising programmability.
   We also present the PUMA compiler which translates high-level code to PUMA ISA. The compiler partitions the computational graph and optimizes instruction scheduling and register allocation to generate code for large and complex workloads to run on thousands of spatial cores.
   We have developed a detailed architecture simulator that incorporates the functionality, timing, and power models of PUMA's components to evaluate performance and energy consumption. A PUMA accelerator running at 1 GHz can reach area and power efficiency of 577 GOPS/s/mm(2) and 837 GOPS/s/W, respectively. Our evaluation of diverse ML applications from image recognition, machine translation, and language modelling (5M-800M synapses) shows that PUMA achieves up to 2,446x energy and 66x latency improvement for inference compared to state-of-the-art GPUs. Compared to an application-specific memristor-based accelerator, PUMA incurs small energy overheads at similar inference latency and added programmability.

TI Multi-frequency symmetry difference electrical impedance tomography with
   machine learning for human stroke diagnosis
SO PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT
AB Objective: Multi-frequency symmetry difference electrical impedance tomography (MFSD-EIT) can robustly detect and identify unilateral perturbations in symmetric scenes. Here, an investigation is performed to assess if the algorithm can be successfully applied to identify the aetiology of stroke with the aid of machine learning.Methods: Anatomically realistic four-layer finite element method models of the head based on stroke patient images are developed and used to generate EIT data over a 5 Hz-100 Hz frequency range with and without bleed and clot lesions present. Reconstruction generates conductivity maps of each head at each frequency. Application of a quantitative metric assessing changes in symmetry across the sagittal plane of the reconstructed image and over the frequency range allows lesion detection and identification. The algorithm is applied to both simulated and human (n = 34 subjects) data. A classification algorithm is applied to the metric value in order to differentiate between normal, haemorrhage and clot values.Main results: An average accuracy of 85% is achieved when MFSD-EIT with support vector machines (SVM) classification is used to identify and differentiate bleed from clot in human data, with 77% accuracy when differentiating normal from stroke in human data.Conclusion: Applying a classification algorithm to metrics derived from MFSD-EIT images is a novel and promising technique for detection and identification of perturbations in static scenes.Significance: The MFSD-EIT algorithm used with machine learning gives promising results of lesion detection and identification in challenging conditions like stroke. The results imply feasible translation to human patients.

TI On the Explainability of Natural Language Processing Deep Models
SO ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS
AB Despite their success, deep networks are used as black-box models with outputs that are not easily explainable during the learning and the prediction phases. This lack of interpretability is significantly limiting the adoption of such models in domains where decisions are critical such as the medical and legal fields. Recently, researchers have been interested in developing methods that help explain individual decisions and decipher the hidden representations of machine learning models in general and deep networks specifically. While there has been a recent explosion of work on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (ExAI) on deep models that operate on imagery and tabular data, textual datasets present new challenges to the ExAI community. Such challenges can be attributed to the lack of input structure in textual data, the use of word embeddings that add to the opacity of the models and the difficulty of the visualization of the inner workings of deep models when they are trained on textual data.
   Lately, methods have been developed to address the aforementioned challenges and present satisfactory explanations on Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. However, such methods are yet to be studied in a comprehensive framework where common challenges are properly stated and rigorous evaluation practices and metrics are proposed.
   Motivated to democratize ExAI methods in the NLP field, we present in this work a survey that studies model-agnostic as well as model-specific explainability methods on NLP models. Such methods can either develop inherently interpretable NLP models or operate on pre-trained models in a post hoc manner. We make this distinction and we further decompose the methods into three categories according to what they explain: (1) word embeddings (input level), (2) inner workings of NLP models (processing level), and (3) models' decisions (output level). We also detail the different evaluation approaches interpretability methods in the NLP field. Finally, we present a case-study on the well-known neural machine translation in an appendix, and we propose promising future research directions for ExAl in the NLP field.

TI Design and Validation of a Compatible 3-Degrees of Freedom Shoulder
   Exoskeleton With an Adaptive Center of Rotation
SO JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN
AB This paper outlines an experimentally based design method for a compatible 3-DOF shoulder exoskeleton with an adaptive center of rotation (CoR) by matching the mechanical CoR with the anatomical CoR to reduce human-machine interaction forces and improve comfort during dynamic humeral motion. The spatial-temporal description for anatomical CoR motion is obtained via a specific experimental task conducted on six healthy subjects. The task is comprised of a static section and a dynamic section, both of which are recorded with an infrared motion capture system using body-attached markers. To reduce the influence of human soft tissues, a custom-made four-marker group block was placed on the upper arm instead of using discrete markers. In the static section, the position of anatomical CoR is kept stationary and calculated using a well-known functional method. Based on the static results, the dynamic section determines the statistical relationship between the dynamic CoR position and the humeral orientation using an optimization method when subjects move their upper arm freely in the sagittal and coronal planes. Based on the resolved anatomical CoR motion, a new mechanical CoR model derived from a traditional ball-and-socket joint is applied to match the experimental results as closely as possible. In this mechanical model, the CoR motion in three-dimensional space is adjusted by translating two of the three intersecting joint axes, including the shoulder abduction/adduction and flexion/extension. A set of optimal translation parameters is obtained through proper matching criterion for the two CoRs. Based on the translation parameters, a compatible shoulder exoskeleton was manufactured and compared with a traditional shoulder exoskeleton with a fixed CoR. An experimental test was conducted to validate the CoR motion adaptation ability by measuring the human-machine interaction force during passive shoulder joint motion. The results provide a promising direction for future anthropomorphic shoulder exoskeleton design.

TI A Fast-Moving Copper-Based Molecular Shuttle: Synthesis and Dynamic
   Properties
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB The present report deals with the synthesis of a two-station [2]rotaxane consisting of a dpbiiq-incorporating macrocyele (dpbiiq: ,8,8'-diphenyl-3,3'-biisoquinoline) threaded by a coordinating fragment whose complexing units are a dpp and a terpy ligand (dpp: 2,9-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline: terpy: 2,2'6',2 ''-terpyridine). The [2]rotaxane was prepared in 11 steps from commercially available or easy-to-make molecules, without taking into account the preparation of the dpbiiq-containing 39-membered ring, which was available in our group. The ring-incorporated bidentate chelate is at the same time endocyclic and sterically nonhindering, which is a specific property of the dpbiiq-coordinating unit. This unique feature has a profound influence on the rate of the ring-and-copper translation notion between the stations of the axle. Based on an analogous multistep strategy a related molecular shuttle has also been prepared that contains exactly the same axle and Stoppers as the First compound but whose threaded ring incorporates the sterically hindering dpp chelate. The translation motions of this other system are several orders of magnitude slower than the corresponding movements of the dpbiiq-based compound. The motion corresponding to the rearrangement of the unstable five-coordinate cooper(I) form of the compounds is relatively fast for both shuttles; the half lifetime of the five-coordinate Cu-I species being below 20 ms for the dpbiiq-containing system and below 1 s for the dpp-based molecule. The reverse motion corresponding to the rearrangement of the four-coordinate copper (II) complexes is much slower, especially for the dpp-based system. It is of the order of several hours for the dpp-based shuttle and only one second or less for the dpbiiq system, under exactly the same conditions. The remarkable difference between the motion rates for the two two-station shuttles demonstrates that the use of a very open chelate such as dpbiiq is extremely beneficial in the context of fast-moving molecular machines.

TI Gene prediction in metagenomic fragments: A large scale machine learning
   approach
SO BMC BIOINFORMATICS
AB Background: Metagenomics is an approach to the characterization of microbial genomes via the direct isolation of genomic sequences from the environment without prior cultivation. The amount of metagenomic sequence data is growing fast while computational methods for metagenome analysis are still in their infancy. In contrast to genomic sequences of single species, which can usually be assembled and analyzed by many available methods, a large proportion of metagenome data remains as unassembled anonymous sequencing reads. One of the aims of all metagenomic sequencing projects is the identification of novel genes. Short length, for example, Sanger sequencing yields on average 700 bp fragments, and unknown phylogenetic origin of most fragments require approaches to gene prediction that are different from the currently available methods for genomes of single species. In particular, the large size of metagenomic samples requires fast and accurate methods with small numbers of false positive predictions.
   Results: We introduce a novel gene prediction algorithm for metagenomic fragments based on a two-stage machine learning approach. In the first stage, we use linear discriminants for monocodon usage, dicodon usage and translation initiation sites to extract features from DNA sequences. In the second stage, an artificial neural network combines these features with open reading frame length and fragment GC-content to compute the probability that this open reading frame encodes a protein. This probability is used for the classification and scoring of gene candidates. With large scale training, our method provides fast single fragment predictions with good sensitivity and specificity on artificially fragmented genomic DNA. Additionally, this method is able to predict translation initiation sites accurately and distinguishes complete from incomplete genes with high reliability.
   Conclusion: Large scale machine learning methods are well-suited for gene prediction in metagenomic DNA fragments. In particular, the combination of linear discriminants and neural networks is promising and should be considered for integration into metagenomic analysis pipelines. The data sets can be downloaded from the URL provided ( see Availability and requirements section).

AB BackgroundThe increasing global cancer incidence corresponds to serious health impact in countries worldwide. Knowledge-powered health system in different languages would enhance clinicians' healthcare practice, patients' health management and public health literacy. High-quality corpus containing cancer information is the necessary foundation of cancer education. Massive non-structural information resources exist in clinical narratives, electronic health records (EHR) etc. They can only be used for training AI models after being transformed into structured corpus. However, the scarcity of multilingual cancer corpus limits the intelligent processing, such as machine translation in medical scenarios. Thus, we created the cancer specific cross-lingual corpus and open it to the public for academic use.MethodsAiming to build an English-Chinese cancer parallel corpus, we developed a workflow of seven steps including data retrieval, data parsing, data processing, corpus implementation, assessment verification, corpus release, and application. We applied the workflow to a cross-lingual, comprehensive and authoritative cancer information resource, PDQ (Physician Data Query). We constructed, validated and released the parallel corpus named as ECCParaCorp, made it openly accessible online.ResultsThe proposed English-Chinese Cancer Parallel Corpus (ECCParaCorp) consists of 6685 aligned text pairs in Xml, Excel, Csv format, containing 5190 sentence pairs, 1083 phrase pairs and 412 word pairs, which involved information of 6 cancers including breast cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, and stomach cancer, and 3 cancer themes containing cancer prevention, screening, and treatment. All data in the parallel corpus are online, available for users to browse and download (http://www.phoc.org.cn/ECCParaCorp/).ConclusionsECCParaCorp is a parallel corpus focused on cancer in a cross-lingual form, which is openly accessible. It would make up the imbalance of scarce multilingual corpus resources, bridge the gap between human readable information and machine understanding data resources, and would contribute to intelligent technology application as a preparatory data foundation e.g. cancer-related machine translation, cancer system development towards medical education, and disease-oriented knowledge extraction.

AB More than half-a-billion Android devices are world's most impactful real-time, interactive multimedia systems that are open-sourced. Google introduced Renderscript language and run-time in Android releases starting in 2011. Renderscript delivers performance and portability without losing usability. However, it is difficult to reuse software written in existing compute languages such as OpenCL. Thus, we develop the O2render system to enable OpenCL programs on Android devices. We analyze fundamental differences between OpenCL and Renderscript, and present our design of a translator between them using low-level virtual machine (LLVM). We extend LLVMs frontend, Clang, and show that we achieve about the same performance in Renderscript with minimal translation overhead.

AB Sentence similarity computation is very important in the field of case-based machine translation. Through the in-depth analysis of sentence and the sentence similarity computing method based on the similarity computation of the word form feature, the word order feature and the semantic feature, we propose a sentence similarity computing model based on the multi-featured weight. By fusing the three features, giving different feature different weight to adapt the contribution of each feature to the sentence similarity computation, make sentence similarity computation more accurate. Experiment result shows that this approach has better accuracy in sentence similarity computation than the others.

AB A novel feature extraction method based on cloud model for EEG classification is proposed in the paper. The cloud model can transform numerical data to qualitative concept described by a group of characteristics. It provides a new way for concept induction in machine learning. Classification of single trial EEG recorded in a 'self-paced key typing' experiment is made through feature extraction based on cloud model and linear regression method for the classification of feature vectors. Results of up to 90% classification accuracy on test data set were obtained. The results show that compared with other methods, the feature extraction and translation method for EEG classification in this paper is simple and effective.

Inspired by those works we introduced Bahdanau Attention Based Bengali Image Caption Generation (BABBICG) that generate automatically bangla caption based on images. The Conventional encoder-decoder architectures performance curse will reduce by Bahdanau Attention and achieving momentous improvements over encoder-decoder architectures. In this work, we extract features from images using InceptionV3 neural network and generate caption using RNN decoder. We used Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) approach as RNN. We evaluate the model using BanglaLekhaImageCaptions dataset from Mendeley Data that can help to generate bangla caption.

AB A large percentage of computational tools are concentrated in a very small subset of the planet's languages. Compounding the issue, many languages lack the high-quality linguistic annotation necessary for the construction of such tools with current machine learning methods. In this paper, we address both issues simultaneously: leveraging the high accuracy of English taggers and parsers, we project morphological information onto translations of the Bible in 26 varied test languages. Using an iterative discovery, constraint, and training process, we build inflectional lexica in the target languages. Through a combination of iteration, ensembling, and reranking, we see double-digit relative error reductions in lemmatization and morphological analysis over a strong initial system.

AB Wikification is a crucial NLP task that aims to identify entities in text and disambiguate their meaning. Being partially solved for English, the problem still remains fairly untouched for Russian. In this article we present a novel approach to Disambiguation to Wikipedia applied to the Russian language. Inspired by the Neural Machine Translation task our method implements encoder-decoder neural network architecture. It translates text tokens into concept embeddings that are subsequently used as context for disambiguation. In order to test our hypothesis we add our context features to GLOW system considered a baseline. Moreover, we present commonly available dataset for the Disambiguation to Wikipedia task.

AB Word alignment is still the most time-consuming task in statistical machine translation. This paper deeply analyzes the performance bottleneck of MGIZA++, which is the most commonly used word alignment tool, and proposes a lock-free programming method to speed up the modern word alignment parallel algorithm. Firstly, a word alignment oriented linear lock-free hash table is introduced. Secondly, three sub-tasks of IBM alignment model, i.e. model initialization, expectation calculation and normalization, are parallel designed and implemented. Experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper can significantly reduce the execution time compared with MGIZA++.

AB This review focuses on recent insights into the mechanisms and the biological functions of the proteasome. This large ATP-dependent proteolytic complex is the main site for protein degradation in mammalian cells and catalyses the rapid degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, and is the source of most antigenic peptides used by the immune system to screen for viruses and cancer. ATP is required to unfold globular proteins to open the gated channel into the 20S proteasome and to facilitate protein translation into it. Inhibitors of its proteolytic activity are widely used as research tools and have proven effective in cancer therapy.

AB Many NLP applications can be framed as a graph-to-sequence learning problem. Previous work proposing neural architectures on this setting obtained promising results compared to grammar-based approaches but still rely on linearisation heuristics and/or standard recurrent networks to achieve the best performance. In this work, we propose a new model that encodes the full structural information contained in the graph. Our architecture couples the recently proposed Gated Graph Neural Networks with an input transformation that allows nodes and edges to have their own hidden representations, while tackling the parameter explosion problem present in previous work. Experimental results show that our model outperforms strong baselines in generation from AMR graphs and syntax-based neural machine translation.

The purpose of this paper is two-fold; firstly, we propose a novel attention model on Tree Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Tree-LSTMs), a tree-structured generalization of standard LSTM. Secondly, we study the interaction between attention and syntactic structures, by experimenting with three LSTM variants: bidirectional-LSTMs, Constituency Tree-LSTMs, and Dependency Tree-LSTMs. Our models are evaluated on two semantic relatedness tasks: semantic relatedness scoring for sentence pairs (SemEval 2012, Task 6 and SemEval 2014, Task 1) and paraphrase detection for question pairs (Quora, 2017).(1)

AB Mechatronic systems are complex interdisciplinary products where many parts are present that overlap each other; electronic control board, electromechanical machines, and power drives. With FPGAs, their control can run faster as multiple operations are executed in parallel. A simulation tool that facilitates the direct translation into hardware of mechatronic control algorithms is desirable. The Xilinx System Generator (XSG), a high-level tool for designing high-performance DSP systems under Simulink, has emerged as an excellent tool for such purpose. In this paper such tool is exercised to implement the conventional vector control algorithm for AC drives, which exhibit a good level of complexity.

A directory service is an important part of a computer network because it implements some logical tb physical address translation to allow user and machine mobility in the system. This service has a high availability requirement in that the normal functioning of network applications rely heavily on their ability to locate communicating parties in a flexible and dynamic environment. In this article, a technique for implementing directory services that satisfy this availability requirement is presented. (C) 1997 by Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Finite-state chunking and tagging methods are very fast for annotating non-hierarchical syntactic information, and are often applied in applications that do not require full syntactic analyses. Scenarios such as incremental machine translation may benefit from some degree of hierarchical syntactic analysis without requiring fully connected parses. We introduce hedge parsing as an approach to recovering constituents of length up to some maximum span L. This approach improves efficiency by bounding constituent size, and allows for efficient segmentation strategies prior to parsing. Unlike shallow parsing methods, hedge parsing yields internal hierarchical structure of phrases within its span bound. We present the approach and some initial experiments on different inference strategies.

AB Incremental parsing is appealing for applications such as speech recognition and machine translation due to its inherent efficiency as well as being a natural match for the language models commonly used in such systems. In this paper we introduce an Incremental Combinatory Categorical Grammar (ICCG) that extends the standard CCG grammar to enable fully incremental left-to-right parsing. Furthermore, we introduce a novel dynamic programming algorithm to convert CCGbank normal form derivations to incremental left-to-right derivations and show that our incremental CCG derivations can recover the unlabeled predicate-argument dependency structures with more than 96% F-measure. The introduced CCG incremental derivations can be used to train an incremental CCG parser.

AB Feature extraction of specified object is an important preprocessing stage in machine vision systems. In this paper we present a novel hybrid feature extraction method using PCNN (Pulse Coupled Neural Network) and shape information. First, we use PCNN firing map train to formulate object time signature, then we use roundness of each firing map to formulate object shape information vector the final feature matrix we got is combined lime signature and roundness. We take correlations as our judge criteria in our experiments. It has been proved that the algorithm is not sensitivity with the rotation, scaling and translation of the object and is a useful method for target recognition applications.

The implementation was based on the perceived requirements of large organizations, which is why the focus was more on practical rather than academic aspects. The paper can be roughly divided into three parts: (1) definition of the implementation process, co-ordination and execution, (2) implementation plan and customer/user management, (3) monitoring of the MT system and related maintenance after going live.

AB The paper reports on the application of block matching with spatial transforms to image sequences of ground scenes taken from a moving camera. The motion is a general combination of rotation and translation. The use of spatial transforms with interpolation filtering to generate rotation reference templates and the hardware implementation, for use on a robot mine-clearance vehicle, are novel. It is shown that the emerging generation of single chip floating-point digital signal processors and CMOS image sensors are well suited to rapid prototyping of image sequence analysis, which has previously been the domain of expensive camera and custom VLSI hardware or cumbersome parallel machines.

AB VHDL and other hardware description languages are commonly used as specification languages during system design, However, the underlying model of those languages does not directly support the specification of embedded systems, making the task of specifying such systems tedious and error-prone, We introduce a new conceptual model, called Program-State Machines (PSM), that caters to embedded systems, We describe SpecCharts, a VHDL extension that supports capture of the PSM model, The extensions we describe can also be applied to other languages, SpecCharts can be easily incorporated into a VHDL design environment using automatic translation to VHDL, We highlight several experiments that demonstrate the advantages of significantly reduced specification time, fewer errors, and improved specification readability.

AB Metaphor in languages is an analogy-based meaning transfer phenomenon that impacts on question answering, machine translation and other tasks requiring deep semantic analysis. Noun-noun metaphor is a common type of metaphor and is studied in noun-noun semantic analysis. Lexical knowledge bases are important knowledge source for metaphor recognition and understanding. This paper proposes a method to compute word relevance for noun-noun metaphor recognition with the help of a lexical knowledge base, which shows good performance in the experiments. Furthermore, we investigate the representation of metaphor in lexical knowledge bases and its impact on the construction of lexical knowledge bases.

AB We describe a system for automatically extracting dynamics of tongue gestures from ultrasound images of the tongue using translational deep belief networks (tDBNs). In tDBNs, a joint model of the input and output vectors are learned during a generative pretraining stage, and then a translation step is used to transform input-only vectors into this joint representation. A final fine-tuning stage is then used to reconstruct the desired outputs given input vectors. We show that this technique dramatically improves performance on segmenting ultrasound image sequences of continuous speech into individual consonant gestures compared with the original DBN method of [1] as well as alternative methods using PCA and support vector machines.

AB This paper introduces a rigorous methodology for requirements specification of systems that react to external stimulus by evolving through different operational modes. In each mode different functionalities are provided. Starting from a classical state-machine specification, the envisaged methodology interprets each state as a different mode of operation endowed with an algebraic specification of the corresponding functionality. Specifications are given in an expressive variant of hybrid logic which is, at a later stage, translated into first-order logic to bring into scene suitable tool support. The paper's main contribution is to provide rigorous foundations for the method, framing specification logics as institutions and the translation process as a comorphism between them.

AB Science in the mass media is usually interpreted in terms of traditional, linear, 'dissemination and translation' models of science communication. Using the cold fusion saga that began in 1989, this paper argues that communication among scientists uses many media, which interact in complex ways. A more appropriate model for modern science must account for the permeable boundaries between formal publications preprints, electronic computer networks, fax machines, mass media presentations and other forums for scientific discussions. The new model must account for the paradox that increased communication activity may be associated with instability rather than stability, at least in the preliminary periods of a scientific controversy.

TI Collaboration and crowdsourcing The cases of multilingual digital
   libraries
SO ELECTRONIC LIBRARY
AB Purpose - This study aims to understand key features of existing multilingual digital libraries and to suggest strategies for building and/or sustaining multilingual information access for digital libraries.
   Design/methodology/approach - A case study approach was applied to examine four American multilingual digital libraries: Project Gutenberg, Meeting of Frontiers, The International Children's Digital Library, and the Latin American Open Archives Portal. This examination used a framework derived from digital library evaluation practice. The missions, goals, funding, partners, users, collections, services, and technologies of these digital libraries were analyzed to present their key multilingual features. The collaboration and crowdsourcing characteristics were highlighted and discussed.
   Findings - These four multilingual libraries benefit substantially, both in the creation of the library and in its access, from the collaboration of groups domestic and international with different language expertise. For building the multilingual collection and services, some libraries involved both staff and users. For multilingual access to the collection, however, none of the libraries used machine translation or cross-language information retrieval technologies.
   Research limitations/implications - The four cases are all publicly available digital libraries in the USA. Their features may not be applicable to digital libraries in other countries or to commercial digital information services.
   Practical implications - With the advancement of machine translation technologies and the wide application of social media, multilingual digital libraries may have even better opportunities to sustain their multilingual capabilities through crowdsourcing and the application of new technologies.
   Originality/value - This study summarizes the key features of four existing multilingual digital libraries. It provides insights into important factors for building successful multilingual digital libraries. The suggested strategies may help digital library developers to design appropriate multilingual information access services.

TI DeepLib: Machine translation techniques to recommend upgrades for
   third-party libraries
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB To keep their code up-to-date with the newest functionalities as well as bug fixes offered by third-party libraries, developers often need to replace an old version of third-party libraries (TPLs) with a newer one. However, choosing a suitable version for a library to be upgraded is complex and susceptible to error. So far, Dependabot is the only tool that supports library upgrades; however, it targets only security fixes and singularly analyzes libraries without considering the whole set of related libraries. In this work, we propose DeepLib as a practical approach to learn upgrades for third-party libraries that have been performed by similar clients. Such upgrades are considered safe, i.e., they do not trigger any conflict, since, in the training clients, the libraries already co-exist without causing any compatibility or dependency issues. In this way, the upgrades provided by DeepLib allow developers to maintain a harmonious relationship with other libraries. By mining the development history of projects, we build migration matrices to train deep neural networks. Once being trained, the networks are then used to forecast the subsequent versions of the related libraries, exploiting the well-founded background related to the machine translation domain. As input, DeepLib accepts a set of library versions and returns a set of future versions to which developers should upgrade the libraries. The framework has been evaluated on two real-world datasets curated from the Maven Central Repository. The results show promising outcomes: DeepLib can recommend the next version for a library as well as a set of libraries under investigation. At its best performance, DeepLib gains a perfect match for several libraries, earning an accuracy of 1.0.

AB Error correction techniques have been used to refine the output sentences from automatic speech recognition (ASR) models and achieve a lower word error rate (WER) than original ASR outputs. Previous works usually use a sequence-to-sequence model to correct an ASR output sentence autoregressively, which causes large latency and cannot be deployed in online ASR services. A straightforward solution to reduce latency, inspired by non-autoregressive (NAR) neural machine translation, is to use an NAR sequence generation model for ASR error correction, which, however, comes at the cost of significantly increased ASR error rate. In this paper, observing distinctive error patterns and correction operations (i.e., insertion, deletion, and substitution) in ASR, we propose FastCorrect, a novel NAR error correction model based on edit alignment. In training, FastCorrect aligns each source token from an ASR output sentence to the target tokens from the corresponding ground-truth sentence based on the edit distance between the source and target sentences, and extracts the number of target tokens corresponding to each source token during edition/correction, which is then used to train a length predictor and to adjust the source tokens to match the length of the target sentence for parallel generation. In inference, the token number predicted by the length predictor is used to adjust the source tokens for target sequence generation. Experiments on the public AISHELL-1 dataset and an internal industrial-scale ASR dataset show the effectiveness of FastCorrect for ASR error correction: 1) it speeds up the inference by 6-9 times and maintains the accuracy (8-14% WER reduction) compared with the autoregressive correction model; and 2) it outperforms the popular NAR models adopted in neural machine translation and text edition by a large margin.

TI Deep Learning Approach for the Morphological Synthesis in Malayalam and
   Tamil at the Character Level
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB Morphological synthesis is one of the main components of Machine Translation (MT) frameworks, especially when any one or both of the source and target languages are morphologically rich. Morphological synthesis is the process of combining two words or two morphemes according to the Sandhi rules of the morphologically rich language. Malayalam and Tamil are two languages in India which are morphologically abundant as well as agglutinative. Morphological synthesis of a word in these two languages is challenging basically because of the following reasons: (1) Abundance in morphology; (2) Complex Sandhi rules; (3) The possibilty in Malayalam to form words by combining words that belong to different syntactic categories (for example, noun and verb); and (4) The construction of a sentence by combining multiple words. We formulated the task of the morphological generation of nouns and verbs of Malayalam and Tamil as a character-to-character sequence tagging problem. In this article, we used deep learning architectures like Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and their stacked and bidirectional versions for the implementation of morphological synthesis at the character level. In addition to that, we investigated the performance of the combination of the aforementioned deep learning architectures and the Conditional Random Field (CRF) in the morphological synthesis of nouns and verbs in Malayalam and Tamil. We observed that the addition of CRF to the Bidirectional LSTM/GRU architecture achieved more than 99% accuracy in the morphological synthesis of Malayalam and Tamil nouns and verbs.

AB In sequence modeling, certain tokens are usually less ambiguous than others, and representations of these tokens require fewer refinements for disambiguation. However, given the nature of attention-based models like Transformer and UT (universal transformer), all tokens are equally processed towards depth. Inspired by the equilibrium phenomenon, we present a lazy transition, a mechanism to adjust the significance of iterative refinements for each token representation. Our lazy transition is deployed on top of UT to build LT (lazy transformer), where all tokens are processed unequally towards depth. Eventually, LT is encouraged to oscillate around a relaxed equilibrium. Our experiments show that LT outperforms baseline models on several tasks of machine translation, pre-training, Learning to Execute, and LAMBADA.

We perform controlled experiments on a very strong baseline English CTS system, comparing three methods for simulating ASR output, and compare the results with training with "real" n-best list output from the baseline recognizer. We find that methods based on extracting phrasal cohorts similar to methods from machine translation for extracting phrase tables - yielded the largest gains of our three methods, achieving over half of the WER reduction of the fully supervised methods.

AB Multiword expressions (MWE) are word combinations where multiple words leave their own meaning to build a new one. These word combinations are important in text summarization, automatic machine translation and language generation fields. In this study, MWEs are detected employing the word vector representations of word combinations and their composing words.
   In our work, vector representations of words and Word combinations are built employing five different methods. Giving vector representations as inputs to a group of classifiers, the classification performances are examined relatively. Experimental work is performed on Turkish data sets. The classification performance is measured by F1 value employing 5-fold cross validation. Experimental results showed that vector representations can be employed in MWE detection.

AB This paper presents a first attempt towards finding an abstractive compression generation system for a set of related sentences which jointly models sentence fusion and paraphrasing using continuous vector representations. Our paraphrastic fusion system improves the informativity and the grammaticality of the generated sentences. Our system can be applied to various real world applications such as text simplification, microblog, opinion and newswire summarization. We conduct our experiments on human generated multi-sentence compression datasets and evaluate our system on several newly proposed Machine Translation (MT) evaluation metrics. Our experiments demonstrate that our method brings significant improvements over the state of the art systems across different metrics.

AB Large-scale discriminative training has become promising for statistical machine translation by leveraging the huge training corpus; for example the recent effort in phrase-based MT (Yu et al., 2013) significantly outperforms mainstream methods that only train on small tuning sets. However, phrase-based MT suffers from limited reorderings, and thus its training can only utilize a small portion of the bi-text due to the distortion limit. To address this problem, we extend Yu et al. (2013) to syntax-based MT by generalizing their latent variable "violation-fixing" perceptron from graphs to hypergraphs. Experiments confirm that our method leads to up to +1.2 BLEU improvement over mainstream methods such as MERT and PRO.

AB A surface walking/climbing robot is developed based on a simple planar 8-bar locomotion mechanism using four 2-way linear cylinders and four 2-way gripper modules. The robot may traverse a fixed distance or turn at a fixed angle after completing a series of repetitive cylinder and gripper actions termed gaits. Symmetric arrangement of the actuators decouples the translation and rotation of the robot. Hence the robot can swiftly change its direction of travel. Basic locomotion gaits are classified and modeled using finite state machines. Experiments on the real prototype are conducted to establish the repeatability and consistency of gait performances. Mechatronic design of the Planar Walker system is also described.

We are able to improve a competitive baseline on the WMT'14 English to German task by 0.3 BLEU by filtering out 25% of the training data. The same approach is used to mine additional bitexts for the WMT'14 system and to obtain competitive results on the BUCC shared task to identify parallel sentences in comparable corpora.
   The approach is generic, it can be applied to many language pairs and it is independent of the architecture of the machine translation system.

AB Improved approach of phrase extraction was proposed for phrase-based statistical machine translation. The effectiveness was investigated when using n-best alignments instead of one-best for phrase extraction. Bilingual phrase pairs were extracted in the presented approach by combining word-to-word links from n-best alignments between source and target sentences. First, the n-best alignments were divided into hierarchies by frequencies of word co-occurrence. Second, candidates of phrase pairs were extracted from each layer. Experimental results show that the presented approach outperforms the baseline system Pharaoh in both NIST and BLEU scores. Therefore it is effective to use n-best alignments as an extension to one-best alignment for phrase extraction.

AB Climate science is about to produce numerical daily weather reconstructions based on meteorological measurements for central Europe 250 years back. Using a pilot reconstruction covering Switzerland at a 2 x 2 km(2) resolution for 1816, this paper presents methods to translate numerical reconstructions and derived indices into text describing daily weather and the state of vegetation. This facilitates comparison with historical sources and analyses of the effects of weather on different aspects of life. The translation, termed "synthetic weather diary", could possibly be used to train machine learning approaches to do the reverse: reconstruct past weather from categorised text entries in diaries.

This kind of artificial neural network takes wavelet function as neuron of hidden layer so as to realize nonlinear mapping between fault and symptoms. A algorithm based on minimum mean square error was given to obtain the weight value of network, dilation and translation parameter of wavelet function. To testify the correctness of wavelet neural network, it was adopted in diagnosing the fault type and location of rolling bearing. The final result shows that it can recognize the fault of outer race, inner race and roller accurately.

While there is a long track of research in rule-based and retrieval-based approaches, the generation-based approaches are promisingly emerging solving issues like responding to queries in inference that were not previously seen in development or training time. In this paper, we offer an experimental view of how recent advances in close areas as machine translation can be adopted for chatbots. In particular, we compare how alternative encoder-decoder deep learning architectures perform in the context of chatbots. Our research concludes that a fully attention-based architecture is able to outperform the recurrent neural network baseline system.

AB The present paper deals with the design and development of a morphological generator for Manipuri language, a Tibeto-Burman language. It is highly agglutinating language. The input of the morphological generator would be the root word which then inflects the word to the morphology of the language and gives the target forms of the word. The Morphological structure of Manipuri Noun is quite complex since it caters to gender, diminutive, numbers, case and number markings etc. Manipuri nouns are broadly classified into 27 categories according to ending characters and phonological factors. Also Manipuri verbs are classified into 15 main categories. The coverage of the system is directly related to the size of the root list.

TI Ranking and reranking with perceptron

AB This work is inspired by the so-called reranking tasks in natural language processing. In this paper, we first study the ranking, reranking, and ordinal regression algorithms proposed recently in the context of ranks and margins. Then we propose a general framework for ranking and reranking, and introduce a series of variants of the perceptron algorithm for ranking and reranking in the new framework. Compared to the approach of using pairwise objects as training samples, the new algorithms reduces the data complexity and training time. We apply the new perceptron algorithms to the parse reranking and machine translation reranking tasks, and study the performance of reranking by employing various definitions of the margins.

TI Full-adaptive THEN-part equipped fuzzy wavelet neural controller design
   of FACTS devices to suppress inter-area oscillations
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
AB By incorporating Self-Recurrent Wavelet Neural Networks (SRWNNs) into Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy model, this paper not only develops a novel Indirect Stable Adaptive Fuzzy Wavelet Neural Controller (ISAFWNC), but also uses it as a supplementary damping controller of Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) devices. In the proposed approach, the SRWNN is employed to construct a full-adaptive self-recurrent consequent part for each fuzzy rule of a TSK fuzzy model. A Stable Back-Propagation (SBP) algorithm with the aid of an Adaptive SRWNN-Identifier (ASRWNNI) is then employed to adjust fuzzy rules in real-time operation while the closed-loop stability is guaranteed by a Lyapunov-based approach. The proposed controller is thus able to handle the plant uncertainty by both the concepts of fuzzy logic and ASRWNNI while the local details of non stationary signals can be decomposed in terms of the dilation and translation parameters of the self-recurrent wavelet neural networks. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) based approach is proposed to choose the initial values of the dilation and the translation parameters of the wavelet and thus to increases the training speed and convergence rate of the proposed control scheme, since the BP convergence rate depends on the selection of the initial values of the network parameters. Simulations results of both two-machine two-area and benchmark four-machine two-area power systems, respectively equipped with a Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC) and a Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ISAFWNC design.

AB The identification of the correct sense of a word is necessary for many tasks in automatic natural language processing like machine translation, information retrieval, speech and text processing. Automatic Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is difficult and accuracies with state-of-the art methods are substantially lower than in other areas of text understanding like part-of-speech tagging. One shortcoming of these methods is that they do not utilize substantial sources of background knowledge, such as semantic taxonomies and dictionaries, which are now available in electronic form (the methods largely use shallow syntactic features). Empirical results from the use of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) have repeatedly shown the ability of ILP systems to use diverse sources of background knowledge. In this paper we investigate the use of ILP for WSD in two different ways: (a) as a stand-alone constructor of models for WSD; and (b) to build interesting features, which can then be used by standard model-builders such as SVM. In our experiments we examine a monolingual WSD task using the 32 English verbs contained in the SENSEVAL-3 benchmark data; and a bilingual WSD task using 7 highly ambiguous verbs in machine translation from English to Portuguese. Background knowledge available is from eight sources that provide a wide range of syntactic and semantic information. For both WSD tasks, experimental results show that ILP-constructed models and models built using ILP-generated features have higher accuracies than those obtained using a state-of-the art feature-based technique equipped with shallow syntactic features. This suggests that the use of ILP with diverse sources of background knowledge can provide one way for making substantial progress in the field of automatic WSD.

AB We demonstrate that a continuous relaxation of the argmax operation can be used to create a differentiable approximation to greedy decoding for sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models. By incorporating this approximation into the scheduled sampling training procedure (Bengio et al., 2015)-a well-known technique for correcting exposure bias-we introduce a new training objective that is continuous and differentiable everywhere and that can provide informative gradients near points where previous decoding decisions change their value. In addition, by using a related approximation, we demonstrate a similar approach to sampled-based training. Finally, we show that our approach outperforms cross-entropy training and scheduled sampling procedures in two sequence prediction tasks: named entity recognition and machine translation.

AB The paper examines issues related to the development of a cross-language information extraction system using a consistent translingual parsing mechanism. Pattern formulation that relies on shallow parsing and relative positioning of terms, while effective in monolingual systems operating on English texts, is all but impossible for languages with free word order. Effective cross-language information extraction necessitates the use of patterns expressed in terms of deep syntactic structures that can be aligned across language boundaries, such as sentence frames and case roles, rather than verbs, noun phrases, and surface-syntactic dependencies. The Meaning Text theory provides a consistent language-independent framework for cross-lingual pattern formulation and matching.

AB Recently, statistical machine translation models have begun to take advantage of higher level linguistic structures such as syntactic dependencies. Underlying these models is an assumption about the directness of translational correspondence between sentences in the two languages; however, the extent to which this assumption is valid and useful is not well understood. In this paper, we present an empirical study that quantifies the degree to which syntactic dependencies are preserved when parses are projected directly from English to Chinese. Our results show that although the direct correspondence assumption is often too restrictive, a small set of principled, elementary linguistic transformations can boost the quality of the projected Chinese parses by 76% relative to the unimproved baseline.

AB The address translation subsystem of operating systems, hypervisors, and virtual machine monitors must correctly enforce address space separation in the presence of adversaries. The size, and hierarchical nesting, of the data structures over which such systems operate raise challenges for automated model checking techniques to be fruitfully applied to them. We address this problem by developing a sound and complete parametric verification technique that achieves the best possible reduction in model size. Our results significantly generalize prior work on this topic, and bring interesting systems within the scope of analysis. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by modeling shadow paging mechanisms of Xen version 3.0.3 and ShadowVisor, a research hypervisor developed for the x86 platform.

AB Author presents an idea of remote management with applications using mobile devices. Proposed architecture consists of: applications run in the Java Virtual Machine environment and use JMX technology for representing resources, mobile clients run on Java ME platform, and a proxy server. The access to JMX mechanisms requires an implementation of RMI protocol. Unfortunately the Java ME Platform does not define proper API. That is why we need a proxy server representing JMX. services for non-RMI mobile clients. The role of the proxy server is two-directional translation between text descriptions of MBeans and remote method invocations. Advantages of proposed solution: easy extensibility and platform independence.

TI A HARDWARE IMPLEMENTATION OF PURE ESTEREL
SO SADHANA-ACADEMY PROCEEDINGS IN ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB ESTEREL is a synchronous concurrent programming language dedicated to reactive systems (controllers, protocols, man-machine interfaces etc.). ESTEREL has an efficient standard software implementation based on well-defined mathematical semantics. We present a new hardware implementation of the pure synchronization subset of the language. Each program generates a specific circuit that responds to any input in one clock cycle. When the source program satisfies some statically checkable dynamic properties, the circuit is shown to be semantically equivalent to the source program. The hardware translation has been effectively implemented on the programmable active memory PERLE0 developed by J Vuillemin and his group at Digital Equipment.

AB We propose a novel way to create categorized discourse lexicons for multiple languages. We combine information from the Penn Discourse Treebank with statistical machine translation techniques on the Europarl corpus. Using gender profiling as an application, we evaluate our approach by comparing it with an approach using features from a knowledge-based lexicon and with an Rhetorical structure theory (RST) discourse parser. Our experiments are performed on corpora for three languages (English, Dutch, and German) in two genres (news and blogs). We include a feature analysis in which we look for (in)consistencies of discourse features related to male and female authors between the different experimental settings.

AB We present the Source Code Statistical Language Model data analysis pattern. Statistical language models have been an enabling tool for a wide array of important language technologies. Speech recognition, machine translation, and document summarization (to name a few) all rely on statistical language models to assign probability estimates to natural language utterances or sentences. In this data analysis pattern, we describe the process of building n-gram language models over software source files. We hope that by introducing the empirical software engineering community to best practices that have been established over the years in research for natural languages, statistical language models can become a tool that SE researchers are able to use to explore new research directions.

AB While program verification environments typically target source programs, there is an increasing need to provide strong guarantees for executable programs.
   We establish that it is possible to reuse the proof that a source Java program meets its specification to show that the corresponding JVM program, obtained by non-optimizing compilation, meets the same specification. More concretely, we show that verification condition generators for Java and JVM programs generate the same set of proof obligations, when applied to a program p and its compilation [p] respectively.
   Preservation of proof obligations extends the applicability of Proof Carrying Code, by allowing certificate generation to rely on existing verification technology.

A WFST for dialog management was automatically created using a corpus annotated with Interchange Format (IF) consisting of dialog acts and argument which is an interlingua for machine translation. A word-to-concept WFST for spoken language understanding (SLU) was created using the same corpus. Tire scenario and SLU WFSTs acquired from the corpus were composed together and then optimized. We have confirmed the WFST automatically trained using the annotated corpus can manage dialog reasonably.

TI Proposing Causal Sequence of Death by Neural Machine Translation in
   Public Health Informatics
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS
AB Each year there are nearly 57 million deaths worldwide, with over 2.7 million in the United States. Timely, accurate and complete death reporting is critical for public health, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, as institutions and government agencies rely on death reports to formulate responses to communicable diseases. Unfortunately, determining the causes of death is challenging even for experienced physicians. The novel coronavirus and its variants may further complicate the task, as physicians and experts are still investigating COVID-related complications. To assist physicians in accurately reporting causes of death, an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach is presented to determine a chronically ordered sequence of conditions that lead to death (named as the causal sequence of death), based on decedent's last hospital discharge record. The key design is to learn the causal relationship among clinical codes and to identify death-related conditions. There exist three challenges: different clinical coding systems, medical domain knowledge constraint, and data interoperability. First, we apply neural machine translation models with various attention mechanisms to generate sequences of causes of death. We use the BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy) score with three accuracy metrics to evaluate the quality of generated sequences. Second, we incorporate expert-verified medical domain knowledge as constraints when generating the causal sequences of death. Lastly, we develop a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) interface that demonstrates the usability of this work in clinical practice. Our results match the state-of-art reporting and can assist physicians and experts in public health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI Sparse B-spline polynomial descriptors for human activity recognition
SO IMAGE AND VISION COMPUTING
AB The extraction and quantization of local image and video descriptors for the subsequent creation of visual codebooks is a technique that has proved very effective for image and video retrieval applications. In this paper we build on this concept and propose a new set of visual descriptors that provide a local space-time description of the visual activity. The proposed descriptors are extracted at spatiotemporal salient points detected on the estimated optical flow field for a given image sequence and are based on geometrical properties of three-dimensional piecewise polynomials, namely B-splines. The latter are fitted on the spatiotemporal locations of salient points that fall within a given spatiotemporal neighborhood. Our descriptors are invariant in translation and scaling in space-time. The latter is ensured by coupling the neighborhood dimensions to the scale at which the corresponding spatiotemporal salient points are detected. In addition, in order to provide robustness against camera motion (e.g. global translation due to camera panning) we subtract the motion component that is estimated by applying local median filters on the optical flow field. The descriptors that are extracted across the whole dataset are clustered in order to create a codebook of 'visual verbs', where each verb corresponds to a cluster center. We use the resulting codebook in a 'bag of verbs' approach in order to represent the motion of the subjects within small temporal windows. Finally, we use a boosting algorithm in order to select the most discriminative temporal windows of each class and Relevance Vector Machines (RVM) for classification. The presented results using three different databases of human actions verify the effectiveness of our method. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Parser is an efficient and accurate enough to be useful in many natural language processing systems, most notably in machine translation [1]. Previously many sentence parsers are developed for foreign languages such as English, Arabic, etc. as well as for Amharic language from local languages of Ethiopia. However, to the best of the researcher's knowledge concerned, there is no Afan Oromo sentence parser for simple and complex sentences. Thus, we proposed to develop a sentence parser for Afan Oromo language. Parsing Afan Oromo sentence is needed and a necessary mechanism for other natural language processing applications like machine translation, question answering, knowledge extraction and information retrieval, particularly for Afan Oromo language. Rule-based parser using a top-down chart parsing algorithm for Afan Oromo sentences presented in this paper. Context Free Grammar (CFG) is used to represent the grammar. 500 sentences were prepared for sample corpus and CFG rules are extracted manually from sample tagged corpus. We also developed simple algorithm of a lexicon generator to automatically generate the lexical rules. Python programming language and NLTK are used as an implementation tools for this study. From the total of sample dataset 70% is simple sentence type because of we considered four different types of simple sentences (declaratives, interrogatives, imperatives and exclamatory sentences) and the rest 30% is complex sentence type. The parser was trained on 400 sentences of training dataset with the accuracy of 98.25% and tested on 100 sentences of testing dataset with the accuracy of 91%. The experimental results on a parser is an encouraging result since it is the first work for simple and complex sentences of Afan Oromo language.

TI UML Sequence Diagram: An Alternative Model
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB The UML sequence diagram is the second most common UML diagram that represents how objects interact and exchange messages over time. Sequence diagrams show how events or activities in a use case are mapped into operations of object classes in the class diagram. The general acceptance of sequence diagrams can be attributed to their relatively intuitive nature and ability to describe partial behaviors (as opposed to such diagrams as state charts). However, studies have shown that over 80% of graduating students were unable to create a software design or even a partial design, and many students had no idea how sequence diagrams were constrained by other models. Many students exhibited difficulties in identifying valid interacting objects and constructing messages with appropriate arguments. Additionally, according to authorities, even though many different semantics have been proposed for sequence diagrams (e.g., translations to state machines), there exists no suitable semantic basis refinement of required sequence diagram behavior because direct style semantics do not precisely capture required sequence diagram behaviors; translations to other formalisms disregard essential features of sequence diagrams such as guard conditions and critical regions. This paper proposes an alternative to sequence diagrams, a generalized model that provides further understanding of sequence diagrams to assimilate them into a new modeling language called thinging machine (TM). The sequence diagram is extended horizontally by removing the superficial vertical-only dimensional limitation of expansion to preserve the logical chronology of events. TM diagramming is spread nonlinearly in terms of actions. Events and their chronology are constructed on a second plane of description that is superimposed on the initial static description. The result is a more refined representation that would simplify the modeling process. This is demonstrated through remodeling sequence diagram cases from the literature.

AB Text generation applications such as machine translation and automatic summarization require an additional post-processing step to enhance readability and coherence of output texts. In this work, we identify a set of coherence features from different levels of discourse analysis. Features have either positive or negative input to the output coherence. We propose a new model that combines these features to produce more coherent summaries for our target application: extractive summarization. The model use a genetic algorithm to search for a better ordering of the extracted sentences to form output summaries. Experimentations on two datasets using an automatic coherence assessment measure show promising results.

AB This paper focuses on style transfer on the basis of non-parallel text. This is an instance of a broad family of problems including machine translation, decipherment, and sentiment modification. The key challenge is to separate the content from other aspects such as style. We assume a shared latent content distribution across different text corpora, and propose a method that leverages refined alignment of latent representations to perform style transfer. The transferred sentences from one style should match example sentences from the other style as a population. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this cross-alignment method on three tasks: sentiment modification, decipherment of word substitution ciphers, and recovery of word order.

AB The Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) is a representation for open-domain rich semantics, with potential use in fields like event extraction and machine translation. Node generation, typically done using a simple dictionary lookup, is currently an important limiting factor in AMR parsing. We propose a small set of actions that derive AMR subgraphs by transformations on spans of text, which allows for more robust learning of this stage. Our set of construction actions generalize better than the previous approach, and can be learned with a simple classifier. We improve on the previous state-of-the-art result for AMR parsing, boosting end-to-end performance by 3 F-1 on both the LDC2013EI17 and LDC2014T12 datasets.

AB Spatial SQL (structured query language) is a powerful tool for systematically solving geographic problems; however, it has not been widely applied to the problem of geographic question answering. This paper introduces a parameterized approach to translate natural language geographic questions into spatial SQLs. In particular, three types of complexity are introduced and initial solutions are proposed to deal with these complexities. The entire parameterization process is implemented to generate spatial SQL templates for five types of geographic questions. It is suggested that our approach is useful for solving natural geographic problems using spatial functions such as those in a GIS.

TI A Bag of Concepts Approach for Biomedical Document Classification Using
   Wikipedia Knowledge Spanish-English Cross-language Case Study
SO METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE
AB Objectives: The ability to efficiently review the existing literature is essential for the rapid progress of research. This paper describes a classifier of text documents, represented as vectors in spaces of Wikipedia concepts, and analyses its suitability for classification of Spanish biomedical documents when only English documents are available for training. We propose the cross-language concept matching (CLCM) technique, which relies on Wikipedia interlanguage links to convert concept vectors from the Spanish to the English space.
   Methods: The performance of the classifier is compared to several baselines: a classifier based on machine translation, a classifier that represents documents after performing Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA), and a classifier that uses a domain-specific semantic annotator (MetaMap). The corpus used for the experiments (Cross-Language UVigoMED) was purpose-built for this study, and it is composed of 12,832 English and 2,184 Spanish MEDLINE abstracts.
   Results: The performance of our approach is superior to any other state-of-the art classifier in the benchmark, with performance increases up to: 124% over classical machine translation, 332% over MetaMap, and 60 times over the classifier based on ESA. The results have statistical significance, showing p-values < 0.0001.
   Conclusion: Using knowledge mined from Wikipedia to represent documents as vectors in a space of Wikipedia concepts and translating vectors between language-specific concept spaces, a cross-language classifier can be built, and it performs better than several state-of-the-art classifiers.

AB N-gram models have been an established choice for language modeling in machine translation, summarization and other tasks. Recently n-gram graphs managed to capture significant language characteristics that go beyond mere vocabulary and grammar, for tasks such as text classification. This work proposes an efficient distributed implementation of the n-gram graph framework on Apache Spark, named ARGOT. The implementation performance is evaluated on a demanding text classification task, where the n-gram graphs are used for extracting features for a supervised classifier. A provided experimental study shows the scalability of the proposed implementation to large text corpora and its ability to take advantage of a varying number of processing cores.

AB A parallel corpus aligned at both sentence and word level is an important prerequisite in statistical machine translation. However, manual creation of such a parallel corpus is time consuming, and requires experts fluent in both languages. This paper presents the first ever empirical evaluation carried out to identify the best unsupervised word alignment technique for Sinhala and Tamil. It also presents a novel approach that combines the output of individual aligners, which outperforms the solitary use of these aligners. Sentence aligned parallel text from annual reports and letters of Sri Lankan Government institutions, and order papers from the Parliament of Sri Lanka were used in the evaluation.

AB Reduplication is an important phenomenon in language studies especially in Indian languages. The definition of reduplication is the repetition of the smallest linguistic unit partially or completely i.e. repetition of phoneme, morpheme, word, phrase, clause or the utterance as a whole and it gives different meaning in syntax as well as semantic level. The reduplicated words has important role in many natural language processing (NLP) applications, namely in machine translation (MT), text summarization, identification of multiword expressions, etc. This article focuses on an algorithm for identifying the reduplicated words from a text corpus and computing statistics (descriptive statistics) of reduplicated words frequently used in Bengali.

AB Syntactically-enriched language models (parsers) constitute a promising component in applications such as machine translation and speech-recognition. To maintain a useful level of accuracy, existing parsers are non-incremental and must span a combinatorially growing space of possible structures as every input word is processed. This prohibits their incorporation into standard linear-time decoders. In this paper, we present an incremental, linear-time dependency parser based on Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) and classification techniques. We devise a deterministic transform of CCG-bank canonical derivations into incremental ones, and train our parser on this data. We discover that a cascaded, incremental version provides an appealing balance between efficiency and accuracy.

AB Sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models with attention have excelled at tasks which involve generating natural language sentences such as machine translation, image captioning and speech recognition. Performance has further been improved by leveraging unlabeled data, often in the form of a language model. In this work, we present the Cold Fusion method, which leverages a pre-trained language model during training, and show its effectiveness on the speech recognition task. We show that Seq2Seq models with Cold Fusion are able to better utilize language information enjoying i) faster convergence and better generalization, and ii) almost complete transfer to a new domain while using less than 10% of the labeled training data.

AB This paper deals with a new strategy to evaluate a Natural Language Processing (NLP) complex task using the Turing test. Automatic summarization based on sentence compression requires to asses informativeness and modify inner sentence structures. This is much more intrinsically related with real rephrasing than plain sentence extraction and ranking paradigm so new evaluation methods are needed. We propose a novel imitation game to evaluate Automatic Summarization by Compression (ASC). Rationale of this Turing-like evaluation could be applied to many other NLP complex tasks like Machine translation or Text Generation. We show that a state of the art ASC system can pass such a test and simulate a human summary in 60% of the cases.

This parallel mechanism is named as H4. A model-based dynamic control scheme is developed to improve the accuracy of the trajectory tracking. A simplified dynamic model is used for the H4 robot to decrease the cost of computation. A dynamic simulation is performed using ADAMS(TM). In addition, the Adept motion is used as a benchmark test to evaluate the effect of the dynamic control. The simulation results show that the dynamic control dramatically improves the trajectory tracking accuracy.

AB The predicate-argument structure transparently encoded in dependency-based syntactic representations supports machine translation, question answering, information extraction, etc. The quality of dependency parsing is therefore a crucial issue in natural language processing. In the current paper we discuss the fundamental ideas of the dependency theory and provide an overview of selected dependency-based resources for Polish. Furthermore, we present some state-of-the-art dependency parsing systems whose models can be estimated on correctly annotated data. In the experimental part, we provide an in-depth evaluation of these systems on Polish data. Our results show that graph-based parsers, even those without any neural component, are better suited for Polish than transition-based parsing systems.

Anaphora is an important phenomenon in linguistics which enhances the beauty of a language by eliminating frequent use of words and substituting them for their equivalent pronoun/noun phrase. This linguistic tinkering often comes with an overhead of resolving the appropriate anaphors to their antecedents for use in almost every field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) like Machine Translation, Information Retrieval, Knowledge Extraction, and Text Summarization amongst others. We present in this paper, the study of the Anaphora Resolution system and the results of the proposed algorithm.

Morphological segmentation models can be used in many Natural Language Processing applications such as machine translation, speech recognition, information retrieval and part-of-speech tagging. A divisive hierarchical clustering and frequency distribution were used to build a tree of candidate stems from which segmented suffix sequences can be modeled. The proposed morphological segmentation model was evaluated with test word-lists. The accuracy obtained by our morphological segmentation model is encouraging.

TI A Discriminative Hierarchical PLDA-Based Model for Spoken Language
   Recognition
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Spoken language recognition (SLR) refers to the automatic process used to determine the language present in a speech sample. SLR is an important task in its own right, for example, as a tool to analyze or categorize large amounts of multi-lingual data. Further, it is also an essential tool for selecting downstream applications in a work flow, for example, to chose appropriate speech recognition or machine translation models. SLR systems are usually composed of two stages, one where an embedding representing the audio sample is extracted and a second one which computes the final scores for each language. In this work, we approach the SLR task as a detection problem and implement the second stage as a probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) model. We show that discriminative training of the PLDA parameters gives large gains with respect to the usual generative training. Further, we propose a novel hierarchical approach where two PLDA models are trained, one to generate scores for clusters of highly-related languages and a second one to generate scores conditional to each cluster. The final language detection scores are computed as a combination of these two sets of scores. The complete model is trained discriminatively to optimize a cross-entropy objective. We show that this hierarchical approach consistently outperforms the non-hierarchical one for detection of highly related languages, in many cases by large margins. We train our systems on a collection of datasets including over 100 languages, and test them both on matched and mismatched conditions, showing that the gains are robust to condition mismatch.

TI Using routine MRI data of depressed patients to predict individual
   responses to electroconvulsive therapy
SO EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY
AB Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective treatments in cases of severe and treatment resistant major depression. 60-80% of patients respond to ECT, but the procedure is demanding and robust prediction of ECT responses would be of great clinical value. Predictions based on neuroimaging data have recently come into focus, but still face methodological and practical limitations that are hampering the translation into clinical practice. In this retrospective study, we investigated the feasibility of ECT response prediction using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data that was collected during ECT routine examinations. We applied machine learning techniques to predict individual treatment outcomes in a cohort of N = 71 ECT patients, N = 39 of which responded to the treatment. SMRI-based classification of ECT responders and non-responders reached an accuracy of 69% (sensitivity: 67%; specificity: 72%). Classification on additionally investigated clinical variables had no predictive power. Since dichotomisation of patients into ECT responders and non-responders is debatable due to many patients only showing a partial response, we additionally performed a posthoc regression-based prediction analysis on continuous symptom improvements. This analysis yielded a significant relationship between true and predicted treatment outcomes and might be a promising alternative to dichotomization of patients. Based on our results, we argue that the prediction of individual ECT responses based on routine sMRI holds promise to overcome important limitations that are currently hampering the translation of such treatment biomarkers into everyday clinical practice. Finally, we discuss how the results of such predictive data analysis could best support the clinician's decision on whether a patient should be treated with ECT.

TI An intelligent machine vision-based smartphone app for beef quality
   evaluation
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD ENGINEERING
AB Beef tenderness is the most important attribute correlated with beef quality, consumer satisfaction, and purchasing decisions. Nowadays, a rapid, non-invasive, and non-destructive evaluation and prediction of beef tenderness and quality from fresh product attributes is desired in industries, laboratories, and markets dealing with beef handling, processing, analyzing, and buy and sell. In this study, a new machine vision-based smart phone app was developed and verified for the first time in order to predict beef tenderness from fresh beef image captured under uncontrolled conditions. In order to eliminate the effects of uncontrolled imaging conditions, an illumination-, rotation-, scale-, and translation-invariant image processing algorithm was developed so that a common user can easily capture the image of the beef sample with more degree of freedom in terms of luminance, rotation, scale, and translation with no worries about the accuracy of the results. The obtained preprocessed image textural features were well correlated with instrumental data obtained using Warner-Bratzler shear force measurement through artificial neural network technique. The developed android app was installed on a LG G4 H815 smartphone and its performance was assessed using thirty unseen beef samples. The probability of occurrence of 2-D correlation coefficients obtained from the analyses of all the beef samples subjected to the image processing algorithm showed the average probability of 0.92, which strongly supported the robustness of the developed algorithm. The best obtained neural network model could predict the tenderness values with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 3.28% and coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.97. The app promisingly predicted the beef tenderness values of the unseen samples with mean squared error (MSE) of 3.34, MAPE of 3.74%, and R-2 of 0.99. Accordingly, the developed app can be a low-cost and user-friendly tool for predicting beef tenderness and quality from its real-world image.

AB Recently, variants of neural networks for computational linguistics have been proposed and successfully applied to neural language modeling and neural machine translation. These neural models can leverage knowledge from massive corpora but they are extremely slow as they predict candidate words from a large vocabulary during training and inference. As an alternative to gradient approximation and softmax with class decomposition, we explore the tree-based hierarchical softmax method and reform its architecture, making it compatible with modern GPUs and introducing a compact tree-based loss function. When combined with several word hierarchical clustering algorithms, improved performance is achieved in language modelling task with intrinsic evaluation criterions on PTB, WikiText-2 and WikiText-103 datasets.

AB The paper presents a structured translation from a static (bounded) subset of PROMELA/SPIN to the planning description language PDDL2.1. It exploits the representation of protocols as communicating finite state machines.
   First, the state-space representation is defined to handle processes, queues, and shared variables. Second, each basic statement (assignment, input, etc.) is translated into a couple of predicates.
   The deadlock detection problem is reformulated as an action planning problem and SPIN is compared to two action planners Metric-FF and MIPS on several benchmarks (e.g. leader election, dining philosophers, optical telegraph).
   The difference to existing approaches is the direct use of planning tools. As a byproduct this introduces refined estimates for improved error detection in directed protocol validation.

AB W-operators are discrete set operators that are both translation invariant and locally defined within a finite ii window W. A particularly interesting property of W-operators is thai they have a sup-decomposition in terms of a family sup-generating operators. that art parameterized hg the operator basis. The sup-decomposition has a parallel structure that usually is not efficient for computation ill conventional sequential machines. In this paper, we formalize the problem of transforming sup-decompositions into purely sequential decompositions (when they exist). The techniques were developed fur general W-operational specialized for increasing W-operators and applied on operators built by alternating compositions of dilations and erosions.

TI Detecting Hardware-Assisted Virtualization With Inconspicuous Features
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY
AB Recent years have witnessed the proliferation of the deployment of virtualization techniques. Virtualization is designed to be transparent, that is, unprivileged users should not be able to detect whether a system is virtualized. Such detection can result in serious security threats such as evading virtual machine (VM)-based malware dynamic analysis and exploiting vulnerabilities for cross-VM attacks. The traditional software-based virtualization leaves numerous artifacts/fingerprints, which can be exploited without much effort to detect the virtualization. In contrast, current mainstream hardware-assisted virtualization significantly enhances the virtualization transparency, making itself more transparent and difficult to be detected. Nonetheless, we showcase three new identified low-level inconspicuous features, which can be leveraged by an unprivileged adversary to effectively and stealthily detect the hardware-assisted virtualization. All three features come from the chipset fingerprints, rather than the traces of software-based virtualization implementations (e.g., Xen or KVM). The identified features include i) Translation-Lookaside Buffer (TLB) stores an extra layer of address translations; ii) Last-Level Cache (LLC) caches one more layer of page-table entries; and iii) Level-1 Data (L1D) Cache is unstable. Based on the above features, we develop three corresponding virtualization detection techniques, which are then comprehensively evaluated on three native environments and three popular cloud providers: i) Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, ii) Google Compute Engine and iii) Microsoft Azure. Experimental results validate that these three adversarial detection techniques are effective (with no false positive) and stealthy (without triggering suspicious system events, e.g., VM-exit) in detecting the above commodity virtualized environments.

TI Semantic comparison of texts by the metric approach
SO DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP IN THE HUMANITIES
AB A novel approach to the semantic comparison of texts based on the metric method to calculate semantic distances between lexical units is put forward. The supplementary semantic information is provided through semes of the words composing the texts, or through their semantic fields. The proposed method takes into account semantic polarity and yields, for two paraphrase sentences, more feasible results than the conventional approaches based on word occurrences. The described approach may be useful for linguistic theory as well as for a variety of Natural Language Processing tasks based on supervised learning that require semantic information: computer lexicography, semantic analysis, information search and retrieval, document classification, text summarization, and understanding machine translation and others.

The datasets that we used for training and testing are creatd according to the atmospheric scattering model. With the change of the adversarial loss from cross-entropy loss to hinge loss, and the change of the reconstruction loss from MAE loss to perceptual loss, we improve the performance measure of SSIM value from 0.828 to 0.841 on the NYU dataset. With the Middlebury stereo datasets, we achieve an SSIM value of 0.811, which is significantly better than the baseline CycleGAN model.

AB Spiral Architecture is a new and powerful approach to a general-putpose machine vision system. Earlier research on the Spiral Architecture focused on the properties of undistorted translation, rotation and scaling. The research reported here uses the properties of the pixel address labelling scheme. The property of interest is the physical proximity of the hexagonal pixels with neighbouring addresses. Rectangular systems may, for instance, have vertical physically adjacent pixels but the address distance is the length of a scan line. It is demonstrated that in the Spiral Architecture, unlike the rectangular system, many images have the property that neighbouring pixels have similar intensities thus giving opportunities for better compression.

AB Not all types of supervision signals are created equal: Different types of feedback have different costs and effects on learning. We show how self-regulation strategies that decide when to ask for which kind of feedback from a teacher (or from oneself) can be cast as a learning-to-learn problem leading to improved cost-aware sequence-to-sequence learning. In experiments on interactive neural machine translation, we find that the self-regulator discovers an epsilon-greedy strategy for the optimal cost-quality trade-off by mixing different feedback types including corrections, error markups, and self-supervision. Furthermore, we demonstrate its robustness under domain shift and identify it as a promising alternative to active learning.

AB Restoring punctuation and capitalization in the output of automatic speech recognition (ASR) system greatly improves readability and extends the number of downstream applications. We present a Transformer-based method for restoring punctuation and capitalization for Latvian and English, following the established approach of using neural machine translation (NMT) models. NMT methods here pose a challenge as the length of the predicted sequence does not always match the length of the input sequence. We offer two solutions to this problem: a simple target sequence cutting or padding by force and a more sophisticated attention alignment-based method. Our approach reaches new state of the art results for Latvian and competitive results on English.

Experiments were made to compare the two kinds of feature templates, and the precision rate and recall rate of Chinese NER rose to 90.86% and 88.23%, which showed remarkable performance of the proposed approach. Combination of ontology and CRFs method increased effectively the precision and recall of Chinese NER.

One of the uses of such algorithms is in the transition from requirements scenarios to component design. To date, however, most efforts have concentrated on the algorithmic details of the proposed translations. Less work has been done on evaluating these algorithms on a realistic case study. In this paper, we do exactly that for the algorithm presented in [10]. Our study is a component of an air traffic advisory system developed at NASA Ames Research Center.

To capture structural information associated with graphs, we investigate the problem of encoding graphs using graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Unlike various existing approaches where shallow architectures were used for capturing local structural information only, we introduce a dense connection strategy, proposing a novel Densely Connected Graph Convolutional Network (DCGCN). Such a deep architecture is able to integrate both local and non-local features to learn a better structural representation of a graph. Ourmodel outperforms the state-of-the-art neural models significantly on AMR-to-text generation and syntax-based neural machine translation.

AB Chronic pain is recognised as a complex and challenging condition. In Scotland alone, over 800,000 people are affected by chronic pain to varying degrees [1]. The experience of living with, and delivering treatment and care for chronic pain therefore requires a management strategy that responds effectively within a complex context. Management strategies should be interdisciplinary and take into account the many stakeholders involved, including the person experiencing chronic pain. This paper outlines the role for visualisation and machine learning to support people to make sense of data and enable the translation of the complexity around chronic pain towards better management, and in particular self-management.

Word graphs provide a compact representation of the ambiguous alternatives generated during many pattern recognition, machine translation and other NLP tasks. This paper generalizes the framework for string parsing based on semirings and hypergraphs to the case of lattice parsing. This framework is the basis for the implementation of a parsing interface in a dataflow software architecture where modules send and receive word graphs in a serialized form using a protocol which allows the easy generation, filtering and parsing of word graphs. An implementation of the CYK algorithm is presented as an example. Experimental results are reported to demonstrate the proposed method.

AB The case postpositions usually have more than one semantic role in Korean. The adverbial postpositions among various postpositions especially make the development of Korean-based machine translation system difficult, because they have more semantic roles than others. In this paper, we describe a new method for resolving semantic ambiguities of adverbial postpositions using decision tree induction. The lack of training examples in decision tree induction is overcome by clustering words into classes using a kind of greedy algorithm. The cross validation results show that the presented method achieves 76.5% of accuracy on the average, which is 20.3% improvement over the baseline method.

TI Pre-Training-Based Grammatical Error Correction Model for the Written
   Language of Chinese Hearing Impaired Students
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Grammatical error correction has been considered as an application closely related to daily life and an important shared task in many prestigious competitions and workshops. The neural machine translation with an encoder-decoder architecture containing language models has been the fundamental solution for the grammatical error correction. Whereas Grammatical error correction task on texts of hearing impaired people or its solution has not been seen yet, and common Grammatical error correction tasks are suffering several challenges, such as insufficient training data, insufficient accuracy due to the unsatisfactory capacity of extracting semantic and grammatical patterns. Under these circumstances, we proposed a novel encoder-decoder architecture based on multi-head self-attention along with multiple strategies, which excels at extracting deep representations from the corrupted sentences of hearing impaired students and further reconstructing the sentences into grammatical ones. Via the re-ranking strategy, our model can correct various kinds of errors including spelling and complex syntax errors. The ablation experiments prove that the semantic extracting of self-attention mechanism excluding the position encoding with the word order shuffle operation can significantly learn the hearing impaired students' sentence patterns whose word order is quite different from the ones of hearing people and improve the correction scores. The pre-training can enhance the restoring efficiency of sentence structure in the decoding process. The comparison experiments with baseline models show that our model obtains superior performance either in the hearing impaired students' grammatical error correction or in a common grammatical error correction shared task.

TI EcoTLB: Eventually Consistent TLBs
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ARCHITECTURE AND CODE OPTIMIZATION
AB We propose EcoTLB-software-based eventual translation lookaside buffer (TLB) coherence-which eliminates the overhead of the synchronous TLB shootdown mechanism in operating systems that use address space identifiers (ASIDs). With an eventual TLB coherence, EcoTLB improves the performance of free and page swap operations by removing the inter-processor interrupt (IPI) overheads incurred to invalidate TLB entries. We show that the TLB shootdown has implications for page swapping in particular in emerging, disaggregated data centers and demonstrate that EcoTLB can improve both the performance and the specific swapping policy decisions using EcoTLB's asynchronous mechanism. We demonstrate that EcoTLB improves the performance of real-world applications, such as Memcached and Make, that perform page swapping using INFINISWAP, a solution for next generation data centers that use disaggregated memory, by up to 17.2%. Moreover, EcoTLB improves the 99th percentile tail latency of Memcached by up to 70.8% due to its asynchronous scheme and improved policy decisions. Furthermore, we show that recent features to improve security in the Linux kernel, like kernel page table isolation (KPTI), can result in significant performance overheads on architectures without support for specific instructions to clear single entries in tagged TLBs, falling back to full TLB flushes. In this scenario, EcoTLB is able to recover the performance lost for supporting KPTI due to its asynchronous shootdown scheme and its support for tagged TLBs. Finally, we demonstrate that EcoTLB improves the performance of free operations by up to 59.1% on a 120-core machine and improves the performance of Apache on a 16-core machine by up to 13.7% compared to baseline Linux, and by up to 48.2% compared to ABIS, a recent state-of-the-art research prototype that reduces the number of IPIs.

TI SVMyr: A Web Server Detecting Co- and Post-translational Myristoylation
   in Proteins
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Myristoylation (MYR) is a protein modification where a myristoyl group is covalently attached to an translation) or after (post-translation). Myristoylated proteins have a role in signal transduction, apoptosis, and pathogen-mediated processes and their prediction can help in functionally annotating the fraction of proteins undergoing MYR in different proteomes. Here we present SVMyr, a web server allowing the detection of both co- and post-translational myristoylation sites, based on Support Vector Machines (SVM). The input encodes composition and physicochemical features of the octapeptides, known to act as substrates and to physically interact with N-myristoyltransferases (NMTs), the enzymes catalyzing the myristoylation reaction. The method, adopting a cross validation procedure, scores with values of Area Under the Curve (AUC) and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.92 and 0.61, respectively. When benchmarked on an independent dataset including experimentally detected 88 medium/high confidence co-translational myristoylation sites and 528 negative examples, SVMyr outperforms available methods, with AUC and MCC equal to 0.91 and 0.58, respectively. A unique feature of SVMyr is the ability to predict post-translational myristoylation sites by coupling the trained SVMs with the detection of caspase cleavage sites, identified by searching regular motifs matching upstream caspase cleavage sites, as reported in literature. Finally, SVMyr confirms 96% of the UniProt set of the electronically annotated myristoylated proteins (31,048) and identifies putative myristoylomes in eight different proteomes, highlighting also new putative NMT substrates. SVMyr is freely available through a user-friendly web server at https://busca.biocomp.unibo.it/lipipred. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Automatic Arabic Grammatical Error Correction based on
   Expectation-Maximization routing and target-bidirectional agreement
SO KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS
AB Automatic Grammar Error Correction (GEC) detects and corrects various types of syntax, spelling, and grammatical errors. Different approaches such as rule-based, Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), and Neural Machine Translation (NMT) have been proposed. Among these approaches, NMT based on seq2seq multi-head attention (Transformer) performs the best. The key shortcoming of GEC seq2seq models with multiple encoder-decoder layers is that only the top layer is exploited in the subsequent processes. In addition, due to the exposure bias problem during inference, some of the previous target words are deleted and replaced by other words generated by the model itself, which leads to unsatisfactory output. This paper proposed GEC model based on seq2seq Transformer for low-resource languages such as Arabic to address these issues. Initially, we proposed a noising method for constructing synthetic parallel data to overcome the bottleneck arising from the lack of corpus. Furthermore, motivated by the success of capsule networks in computer vision, we used the Expectation-Maximization routing algorithm to dynamically aggregate information across layers in Arabic GEC. Moreover, to conquer the exposure bias problem, we introduced a bidirectional regularization term using Kullback-Leibler divergence in the training objective to improve the agreement between Right-to-left and Left-to-right models. Experiments performed on two benchmarks QALB-2014 and QALB-2015 showed that our proposed model achieved the best F 1 score compared to the existing Arabic GEC systems.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB With the increase of deception and misinformation especially in social media, it has become crucial to be able to develop machine learning methods to automatically identify deceptive language. In this proposal, we identify key challenges underlying deception detection in cross-domain, cross-lingual and multi-modal settings. To improve cross-domain deception classification, we propose to use inter-domain distance to identify a suitable source domain for a given target domain. We propose to study the efficacy of multilingual classification models vs translation for cross-lingual deception classification. Finally, we propose to better understand multi-modal deception detection and explore methods to weight and combine information from multiple modalities to improve multi-modal deception classification.

AB The performance and energy efficiency of modern architectures depend on memory locality, which can be improved by thread and data mappings considering the memory access behavior of parallel applications. In this article, we propose intense pages mapping, a mechanism that analyzes the memory access behavior using information about the time the entry of each page resides in the translation lookaside buffer. It provides accurate information with a very low overhead. We present experimental results with simulation and real machines, with average performance improvements of 13.7% and energy savings of 4.4%, which come from reductions in cache misses and interconnection traffic.

AB Every language employs its own coordination strategies, according to the type of coordinating marking, the pattern of marking, the position of the marker, and the phrase types coordinated. The SOV language Korean is intriguing in the sense that it displays almost all the possibilities of these dimensions. This paper shows how a typed feature structure grammar, HPSG, together with the notions of 'type hierarchy' and 'constructions', can provide a robust basis for parsing the coordination constructions found in the language. We show that this system induces robust syntactic structures as well as enriched semantic representations for real-time applications such as machine translation, which require deep processing of the phenomena concerned.

AB Attention mechanism has become the dominant module in natural language processing models. It is computationally intensive and depends on massive power-hungry multiplications. In this paper, we rethink variants of attention mechanism from the energy consumption aspects. After reaching the conclusion that the energy costs of several energyfriendly operations are far less than their multiplication counterparts, we build a novel attention model by replacing multiplications with either selective operations or additions. Empirical results on three machine translation tasks demonstrate that the proposed model, against the vanilla one, achieves competitable accuracy while saving 99% and 66% energy during alignment calculation and the whole attention procedure.

SO IET COMPUTER VISION
AB Camera parameters estimation is an important issue in machine vision. This study proposes a new method to find translation and rotation matrix of camera in a sport scene based on points at infinity. Vanishing point (point at infinity) of parallel lines is the image of the point at infinity, which corresponds to the projection of the intersection of parallel lines at infinity. According to projective geometry constraint, camera rotation of the projection matrix is directly computed using two vanishing points and rotation matrix of camera extracted from those points at infinity. Computer simulation and real data experiments are carried out to validate the proposed method.

AB Interfacing the human nervous system with prosthetic limb electronics requires signal translation from a biologic to an abiotic environment and vice versa. Information exchange occurs in the form of ionic (nerve) and electronic (machine) current. The conductive polymer, 3,4 polyethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) carries both electronic and ionic transmission. PEDOT has recently been used for biomedical applications, including neural cell signaling[1] and neural interfaces[2]. We demonstrate that peripheral nerves successfully regenerate across a critical-length gap in the presence of PEDOT. We evaluated regenerated nerve conductivity, end-organ function and histology when in the presence of PEDOT. These are the first reported data of regenerating peripheral nerve fibers under the long-term influence of PEDOT.

AB We propose an Hierarchical State Machine (HSM) model for specifying behavioral interfaces of peers participating in a composite web service. We integrate the HSM model to a design pattern which is supported by a modular verification technique that can 1) statically analyze the properties about global interactions of a composite web service and 2) check the conformance of the Java implementations of the participant peers to their interfaces. We extend the synchronizability analysis to HSMs to efficiently identify composite web services whose global interactions can be analyzed with respect to unbounded queues using finite state model checkers. We also discuss automated translation of behavioral interfaces specified as HSMs to BPEL specifications to be published and used by other services.

AB This paper reports on the design of a Fortran-to-Java translator whose target language is the instruction set of the Java Virtual Machine. The goal of the translator is to generate Java implementations of legacy Fortran numerical codes in a consistent and reliable fashion. The benefits of directly generating bytecode are twofold. First, compared with generating Java source code, it provides a much more straightforward and efficient mechanism for translating Fortran GOTO statements. Second, it provides a framework for pursuing various compiler optimizations, which could be beneficial not only to our project, but to the Java community as a whole.

TI Feature-Based Decipherment for Machine Translation
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Orthographic similarities across languages provide a strong signal for unsupervised probabilistic transduction (decipherment) for closely related language pairs. The existing decipherment models, however, are not well suited for exploiting these orthographic similarities. We propose a log-linear model with latent variables that incorporates orthographic similarity features. Maximum likelihood training is computationally expensive for the proposed log-linear model. To address this challenge, we perform approximate inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and contrastive divergence. Our results show that the proposed log-linear model with contrastive divergence outperforms the existing generative decipherment models by exploiting the orthographic features. The model both scales to large vocabularies and preserves accuracy in low- and no-resource contexts.

AB Electronic Health Records (EHR) are data generated during routine clinical care. EHR offer researchers unprecedented phenotypic breadth and depth and have the potential to accelerate the pace of precision medicine at scale. A main EHR use-case is creating phenotyping algorithms to define disease status, onset and severity. Currently, no common machine-readable standard exists for defining phenotyping algorithms which often are stored in human-readable formats. As a result, the translation of algorithms to implementation code is challenging and sharing across the scientific community is problematic. In this paper, we evaluate openEHR, a formal EHR data specification, for computable representations of EHR phenotyping algorithms.

The descriptions are translated into FSMD (finite state machine with datapaths) models and described in RTL. Then, descriptions written in different levels are translated into same level descriptions. They can be verified with existing formal verification tools. We also report experimental results.

AB In intercultural communication, there are large barriers when the languages and the cultures are different. It is undoubtedly preferable for people to have smooth communications using their mother language. Therefore, we have developed a chat system called AnnoChat. AnnoChat has an annotation function for smooth intercultural communications. We applied AnnoChat in experiments with Japanese, Chinese, and Korean speakers. The results of the experiments showed that about 70% of the added annotations were reusable as intercultural knowledge information. About 20% of the added annotations were used to supplement information that could not be described while chatting. It is thought to be an effective example of applying annotation in intercultural communications.

TI Design and Evaluation of a New General-Purpose Device for Calibrating
   Instrumented Spatial Linkages
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
AB Because instrumented spatial linkages (ISLs) have been commonly used in measuring joint rotations and must be calibrated before using the device in confidence, a calibration device design and associated method for quantifying calibration device error would be useful. The objectives of the work reported by this paper were to (1) design an ISL calibration device and demonstrate the design for a specific application, (2) describe a new method for calibrating the device that minimizes measurement error, and (3) quantify measurement error of the device using the new method. Relative translations and orientations of the device were calculated via a series of transformation matrices containing inherent fixed and variable parameters. These translations and orientations were verified with a coordinate measurement machine, which served as a gold standard. Inherent fixed parameters of the device were optimized to minimize measurement error. After parameter optimization, accuracy was determined. The root mean squared error (RMSE) was 0.175 deg for orientation and 0.587 mm for position. All RMSE values were less than 0.8% of their respective full-scale ranges. These errors are comparable to published measurement errors of ISLs for positions and lower by at least a factor of 2 for orientations. These errors are in spite of the many steps taken in design and manufacturing to achieve high accuracy. Because it is challenging to achieve the accuracy required for a custom calibration device to serve as a viable gold standard, it is important to verify that a calibration device provides sufficient precision to calibrate an ISL.

AB Protein structures are translation and rotation invariant. In protein structure prediction, it is therefore important to be able to assess and predict intermediary topological representations, such as distance or contact maps, that are translation and rotation invariant. Here we develop several new machine teaming methods for the prediction and assessment of fine-grained and coarse topological representations of proteins. In particular, we introduce a general class of graphical model architectures together with the corresponding neural network implementations. These architectures can be viewed as Bayesian network generalizations of input-output hidden Markov models (GIOHMMs), involving an input layer, an output layer, and a hidden layer supported by one or several directed acyclic graphs. The corresponding generalized recursive neural network (GRNN) architectures are derived by preserving the graphical structures of the GIOHMMs, but replacing the conditional probability tables with learnable deterministic functions.
   Two methods are proposed for the prediction of protein topological structures. The first method uses a GIOHMM organized into six horizontal layers: one input plane, four hidden planes, and one output plane that directly represents the adjacency matrix of the contact map (or the distance matrix). Each hidden plane is associated with one of the four cardinal corners towards which all the edges of the corresponding lattice are oriented. The corresponding GRNNs are used to construct a fine-grained contact map predictor. The second method uses a GIOHMM approach to learn a graph scoring function which, in turn, is used to efficiently search the space of possible configurations. The corresponding GRNNs are used to construct a coarse-grained contact map predictor. Computer simulations show that the predictors for both tasks achieve state-of-the-art performance.

AB Chinese pinyin input method engine (IME) lets user conveniently input Chinese into a computer by typing pinyin through the common keyboard. In addition to offering high conversion quality, modern pinyin IME is supposed to aid user input with extended association function. However, existing solutions for such functions are roughly based on oversimplified matching algorithms at word-level, whose resulting products provide limited extension associated with user inputs. This work presents the Moon IME, a pinyin IME that integrates the attention-based neural machine translation (NMT) model and Information Retrieval (IR) to offer amusive and customizable association ability. The released IME is implemented on Windows via text services framework.

AB The normalized data is the backbone of various Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR), data mining, and Machine Translation (MT) applications. Thus, we propose an approach to normalize the colloquial and breviate text being posted on the social media like Twitter, Facebook, etc. The proposed approach for text normalization is based upon Levenshtein distance, demetaphone algorithm, and dictionary mappings. The standard dataset named lexnorm 1.2, containing English tweets is used to validate the proposed modular approach. Experimental results are compared with existing unsupervised approaches. It has been found that modular approach outperforms other exploited normalization techniques by achieving 83.6% of precision, recall, and F-scores. Also 91.1% of BLUE scores have been achieved.

AB Recognition of special linguistic patterns in a certain language is very helpful for many NLP applications such as information extraction, machine translation and parsing. State-of-the-arts syntax parsers are based on given grammar. The used grammar is context free and cannot discover complex patterns which contain multiple linguistic units. We propose an unsupervised method to automatically discover the complex linguistic patterns from a classically parsed corpus. A specialized and efficient algorithm is applied to mine the frequent subtrees in the forest and the found subtrees are formalized as the linguistic patterns. The approach is validated on the Penn Chinese Treebank with found linguistic patterns.

SO LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Here, for the first time, we give an implementation which computes answer sets of every class of (function-free) logic programs and deductive databases containing both negation as failure and classical negation. The proposal is based on bottom-up, incremental, backtrack-free computation of the minimal models of positive disjunctive programs, together with integrity constraints over beliefs and disbeliefs. Our translation method not only provides a simple fixpoint characterization of answer sets, but also is very helpful to understand under what conditions each model is ''stable'' or ''unstable'. The procedure has been implemented on top of the model generation theorem prover MGTP on a parallel inference machine, and has been applied to a legal reasoning system.

TI Gene prediction in metagenomic fragments based on the SVM algorithm
SO BMC BIOINFORMATICS
AB Background: Metagenomic sequencing is becoming a powerful technology for exploring micro-ogranisms from various environments, such as human body, without isolation and cultivation. Accurately identifying genes from metagenomic fragments is one of the most fundamental issues.
   Results: In this article, we present a novel gene prediction method named MetaGUN for metagenomic fragments based on a machine learning approach of SVM. It implements in a three-stage strategy to predict genes. Firstly, it classifies input fragments into phylogenetic groups by a k-mer based sequence binning method. Then, protein-coding sequences are identified for each group independently with SVM classifiers that integrate entropy density profiles (EDP) of codon usage, translation initiation site (TIS) scores and open reading frame (ORF) length as input patterns. Finally, the TISs are adjusted by employing a modified version of MetaTISA. To identify protein-coding sequences, MetaGun builds the universal module and the novel module. The former is based on a set of representative species, while the latter is designed to find potential functionary DNA sequences with conserved domains.
   Conclusions: Comparisons on artificial shotgun fragments with multiple current metagenomic gene finders show that MetaGUN predicts better results on both 3' and 5' ends of genes with fragments of various lengths. Especially, it makes the most reliable predictions among these methods. As an application, MetaGUN was used to predict genes for two samples of human gut microbiome. It identifies thousands of additional genes with significant evidences. Further analysis indicates that MetaGUN tends to predict more potential novel genes than other current metagenomic gene finders.

AB While sentiment analysis is a popular research area, most of the research has been conducted for English and the number of studies for Turkish are rather limited. Limited resources for Turkish natural language processing (NLP) is one of the major challenges for Turkish NLP research. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose two approaches for Turkish sentiment analysis: 1) fine tuning multilingual model of BERT 2) using main model of BERT after machine translation of Turkish texts into English. We conducted experiments on Turkish movie and hotel review datasets where each review is labeled either positive or negative. Our methods achieve high accuracy scores such that in the movie dataset, our BERT models outperform existing methods.

Our approach for CLEF 2002 was translating the documents and topics into English, and applying our standard retrieval methods. Four ranked results were submitted for each monolingual task and five for each bilingual task. We explored the potential of term weight estimation from a contemporaneous English text collection and show that although this method has been shown to be effective in retrieval from English collections, it cannot be applied effectively to translated document collections in a simple way. This paper also reports our unofficial results for monolingual and bilingual English runs.

TI A Computational Neural Network Model for College English Grammar
   Correction
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB For the error correction of English grammar, if there are errors in the semantic units (words and sentences), it will inevitably affect the subsequent text analysis and semantic understanding, and ultimately reduce the overall performance of the practical application system. Therefore, intelligent error detection and correction of the word and grammatical errors in English texts is one of the key and difficult points of natural language processing. This exploration innovatively combines a computational neural model with college grammar error correction to improve the accuracy of college grammar error correction. It studies the computational neural model in English grammar error correction based on a neural network named Knowledge and Neural machine translation powered College English Grammar Typo Correction (KNGTC). First, the Recurrent Neural Network is introduced, and the overall structure of the English grammatical error correction neural model is constructed. Moreover, the supervised training of Attention is discussed, and the experimental environment and experimental data are given. The results show that KNGTC has high accuracy in college English grammar correction, and the accuracy of this model in CET-4 and CET-6 writing can reach 82.69%. The English grammar error correction model based on the computational neural network has perfect function and strong error correction ability. The optimization and perfection of the model can improve students' English grammar level, which has certain practical value. After years of continuous optimization and improvement, English grammar error correction technology has entered a performance bottleneck. This mode's construction can break the current technology's limitations and bring a better user experience. Therefore, it is very valuable to study the error correction model of English grammar in practical application.

AB Since the advent of Federated Learning (FL), research has applied these methods to natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Despite a plethora of papers in FL for NLP, no previous works have studied how multilingual text impacts FL algorithms. Furthermore, multilingual text provides an interesting avenue to examine the impact of non-IID text (e.g. different languages) on FL in naturally occurring data. We explore three multilingual language tasks, language modeling, machine translation, and text classification using differing federated and non-federated learning algorithms. Our results show that using pretrained models reduces the negative effects of FL, helping them to perform near or better than centralized (no privacy) learning, even when using non-IID partitioning.(1)

With low-resource language pairs that do not have available and well-developed pronunciation lexicons, grapheme-to-phoneme models are particularly useful. These models are based on initial alignments between grapheme source and phoneme target sequences. Inspired by sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural network-based translation methods, the current research presents an approach that applies an alignment representation for input sequences and pre-trained source and target embeddings to overcome the transliteration problem for a low-resource languages pair.

In this paper, hierarchical graph matching is presented for handwritten character recognition. Handwritten character was transformed into graphs based on its underlying skeleton structure. Edges of the extracted graph were categorized into shape types and vertices were extracted from each of the edges using line simplification algorithm. Matching procedure of the graph was performed in hierarchical approach and followed sub-graph isomorphism principals. Performance evaluation of the proposed method was conducted using validated CEDAR dataset which exclude ambiguous and unidentified writing samples. In this scenario, the method reaches a recognition rate of 93.40%.

In our previouswork [18], the English parse trees were manually translated to Turkish. In this paper, the words are semi-automatically annotated morphologically. As a second step, a rule-based approach is used for refining the parse trees based on the morphological analyses of the words. We generated Turkish phrase structure trees for 5143 sentences from Penn Treebank that contain fewer than 15 tokens. The annotated corpus can be used in statistical natural language processing studies for developing tools such as constituency parsers and statistical machine translation systems for Turkish.

TI Investigation on shaping machining method for deep hole keyway based on
   on-line symmetry detection and compensation
SO JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Machining of deep hole keyway often suffers from low processing accuracy, low processing symmetry degree between keyway and the reference plane and is difficult to control. In order to enhance the processing quality, a mathematical model of space symmetry error was established based on space projection, orthogonal combination and linear fitting methods so as to study rotatable and shift-able space objects. The space symmetry error was separated into included angle error and displacement error between the fitting straight line and the benchmark line. Through included angle rotation and location measurement along with quantitative translation, the space symmetry error compensation was realized. On the basis of the proposed methods, a Double combined manual self-centering fixture (DCMSF) was designed to realize the radial self-centering and axial location for effective clamping of deep hole keyway, and the reference plane of builtin straight slot was derived out to make it detectable and controllable. Meanwhile, an Online multi-degree of freedom symmetry detection device (OMFSDD) and corresponding Numerical control (NC) programs were also designed for automatic detection and control of symmetry error. Subsequently, mass production of high symmetric deep hole keyway were realized by means of NC gear shaper servo control of rotating shaft angle compensation and bi-directional cutter back-off amount translation compensation, and combination of NC control of fixed angle processing. Deep hole keyway processing experiments indicate that the proposed method can steadily keep the symmetry within 0.03 mm. Thus, the rationality and accuracy of the proposed method was validated which provides a novel approach to high precision deep hole keyway processing.

TI Carrying on the legacy of imperative languages in the future parallel
   computing era
SO PARALLEL COMPUTING
AB There has been a renewed interest in dataflow.computing models in recent years of technology scaling. Potentiality of exploiting huge parallelism, with the expense of low power, simpler circuit, less silicon area, is the main characteristic of a dataflow model. Growing trends in housing large number of functional units in a single chip, making use of local clocks, reducing energy consumptions, avoiding global wires are the main reasons behind the resurgence of dataflow models. To program a dataflow machine, new architectures suggest imperative languages rather than functional type dataflow languages or parallel languages because this is the right way to make the new architectures popular among the general community. Although for several decades scientists have been working on how imperative languages can be used in dataflow models efficiently, there is no systematic review on those works. Existing reviews on dataflow paradigm mainly focus on the architectures. Although few papers review programming languages of dataflow architectures, their discussions are limited to only dataflow languages and visual programming languages which are fundamentally different from imperative languages. In this paper, we conduct a systematic review on those works that attempt to provide a way to use imperative languages in any type of dataflow architectures. Our survey of compilers and related architectures cover the aspects like translation mechanisms of program construct, their optimization techniques, memory ordering methods, program allocation and scheduling and special architectural features. We also present some of our observations and future research directions obtained by exploring the literature. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The explosive growth of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm has brought the rise of malicious activity targeting the Internet. Indeed, the lack of basic security protocols and measures in IoT devices is allowing attackers to use exploited Internet-scale IoT devices to organize malicious botnets, and cause significant damage to the Internet through Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, illicit scraping, and cryptojacking attacks. Such IoT botnets can be Internet-facing, or can also be deployed behind Network Address Translation (NAT) gateways that provide anonymity to the exploited bots. In this paper, we aim at detecting compromised IoT bots behind NAT gateways which could possibly generate malicious activities towards the Internet by leveraging large-scale macroscopic one-way darknet data. To the best of our knowledge, we are among the first to explore the capabilities of attentive interpretable tabular transformers to capture the nature of such nodes operating on one-way network traffic. Our results, which employed 2.6GB of darknet data, show that our approach was able to classify malware-infected NATed IoT bots with an accuracy of 93%, outperforming the state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) approaches. Additionally, we were able to infer around 4 million Internet-scale Mirai-infected NATed IoT bots and 16,871 unique NATed IP addresses. Results from this work put forward interesting future work in the area of network traffic analysis of NATed IoT bots for better Internet security, while highlighting the need for addressing the notions of attention and interpretability.

AB The current capacity to translate paper documents quickly and accurately into machine readable form using optical character recognition technology augments the opportunities in document searching and storing, as well as the automated document processing. A fast response in translating large collections of image-based electronic documents into structured electronic documents is still a problem. The availability of a large number of processing units in Grid environments and of free optical character recognition tools can be exploited to produce a fast translation. Following this idea, several experiments concerning optical character recognition were performed on a Grid infrastructure and their results are reported in this paper. These results are encouraging further developments of systems for document image analysis using Grid technologies.

TI Applying various distance functions and feature extraction schemes to
   ambiguity resolution
SO INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS
AB Word Sense Disambiguation, which is one of the most challenging problems in the process of machine translation, can be considered as a classification problem. In this paper, we use K-Nearest-Neighbor, as one of the most popular classification methods, as well as some knowledge based resources in order to design a WSD scheme. The success of K-Nearest-Neighbor is tightly dependent on two factors; the features used to represent the context in which an ambiguous word occurs and the distance/similarity measure used for comparison of text vectors. Hence, in the present study, we focus on these two matters. For the first purpose, we extract three sets of features; syntactic features, lexical features and semantic features. In order to produce enriched and useful corpora, we apply preprocessed steps. In this work, we carry out a feature selection process as well as a feature weighting policy in order to fine-tune the classifier. For the second purpose, we try several distance/similarity metrics (rather than one metric) in order to find the most proper one. We also assign and use feature weights and propose a weighted formula for every metric. Moreover, to show that the proposed schemes are not language-dependent, we apply the suggested schemes to two sets of data; English and Persian corpora. The evaluation results, with regards to the feature selection and feature weighting strategies, show that the semantic and syntactic features have a significant effect on the classification ability of the system. The results are also encouraging compared to state of the art.

However, despite these opportunities and the success of deep learning when applied to a range of neuroimaging tasks and domains, significant barriers continue to limit the impact of large-scale datasets and analysis tools. Here, we examine the main challenges and the approaches that have been explored to overcome them. We focus on issues relating to data availability, interpretability, evaluation, and logistical challenges and discuss the problems that still need to be tackled to enable the success of "big data'' deep learning approaches beyond research.

AB Gene expression is regulated by miRNAs or micro RNAs which car be 21-23 nucleotide in length. They are non coding RNAs which control gene expression either by translation repression or mRNA degradation. Plants and animals both contain miRNAs which have been classified by wet lab techniques. These techniques are highly expensive, labour intensive and time con. suming. Hence faster and economical computational approaches are needed. In view of above a machine learning model has been developed for classification of plant and animal miRNAs using decision tree classifier. The model has beer tested on available data and it gives results with 91 % accuracy.

Topics are translated into English using the Babelfish online machine translation system. Text runs used the BM25 algorithm, while visual approach used simple low-level features with matching based on the Jeffrey Divergence measure.

TI Exceptional error minimization in putative primordial genetic codes
SO BIOLOGY DIRECT
AB Background: The standard genetic code is redundant and has a highly non-random structure. Codons for the same amino acids typically differ only by the nucleotide in the third position, whereas similar amino acids are encoded, mostly, by codon series that differ by a single base substitution in the third or the first position. As a result, the code is highly albeit not optimally robust to errors of translation, a property that has been interpreted either as a product of selection directed at the minimization of errors or as a non-adaptive by-product of evolution of the code driven by other forces.
   Results: We investigated the error-minimization properties of putative primordial codes that consisted of 16 supercodons, with the third base being completely redundant, using a previously derived cost function and the error minimization percentage as the measure of a code's robustness to mistranslation. It is shown that, when the 16-supercodon table is populated with 10 putative primordial amino acids, inferred from the results of abiotic synthesis experiments and other evidence independent of the code's evolution, and with minimal assumptions used to assign the remaining supercodons, the resulting 2-letter codes are nearly optimal in terms of the error minimization level.
   Conclusion: The results of the computational experiments with putative primordial genetic codes that contained only two meaningful letters in all codons and encoded 10 to 16 amino acids indicate that such codes are likely to have been nearly optimal with respect to the minimization of translation errors. This near-optimality could be the outcome of extensive early selection during the co-evolution of the code with the primordial, error-prone translation system, or a result of a unique, accidental event. Under this hypothesis, the subsequent expansion of the code resulted in a decrease of the error minimization level that became sustainable owing to the evolution of a high-fidelity translation system.

AB In the last decade, the approximate vanishing ideal and its basis construction algorithms have been extensively studied in computer algebra and machine learning as a general model to reconstruct the algebraic variety on which noisy data approximately lie. In particular, the basis construction algorithms developed in machine learning are widely used in applications across many fields because of their monomialorder-free property: however, they lose many of the theoretical properties of computer-algebraic algorithms. In this paper, we propose general methods that equip monomial-order-free algorithms with several advantageous theoretical properties. Specifically, we exploit the gradient to (i) sidestep the spurious vanishing problem in polynomial time to remove symbolically trivial redundant bases, (ii) achieve consistent output with respect to the translation and scaling of input, and (iii) remove nontrivially redundant bases. The proposed methods work in a fully numerical manner, whereas existing algorithms require the awkward monomial order or exponentially costly (and mostly symbolic) computation to realize properties (i) and (iii). To our knowledge, property (ii) has not been achieved by any existing basis construction algorithm of the approximate vanishing ideal.

TI Magnetic Design Aspects of the Trans-Rotary Magnetic Gear
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION
AB This paper studies several magnetic design aspects of the trans-rotary magnetic gear (TROMAG). The TROMAG is a magnetic device that converts linear motion to rotation, and vice versa, through magnetic field while doing a gearing action. This means that a high-force, low-speed translation can be converted to a high-speed low-torque rotation. Once coupled with a conventional rotary machine, the resultant system may be used as a compact electromechanical motion system for high-force linear-motion applications, such as wave energy conversion. The paper investigates the magnetic design of the TROMAG by means of either two-dimensional (2-D) or three-dimensional (3-D) finite element analysis (FEA), or an accurate analytical model. The impact of nonideal discretized helix and dimensions of magnets and air gap are investigated, as well as scaling rules of the TROMAG and the possibility of demagnetization. Experimental results obtained from a lab prototype are also presented to verify the concept and analysis.

CY APR 05-13, 2014
CL Grenoble, FRANCE
AB In high-end compilers such as Open64, GCC or LLVM, the Static Single Assignment (SSA) form is a structural part of the target-independent program representation that supports most of the code optimizations. However, aggressive compilation also requires that optimizations that are more effective with the SSA form be applied to the target-specific program representations operated by the code generator, that is, the set of compiler phases after and including instruction selection.
   While using the SSA form in the code generator has definite advantages, the SSA form does not apply to all the code generator program representations, and is not suited for all optimizations. We discuss some of the issues of inserting the SSA form in a code generator, specifically: what are the challenges of maintaining the SSA form on a program representation based on machine instructions; how the SSA form may be used in the if-conversion optimizations; why the SSA form does not seem to benefit instruction scheduling; and what is the state-of-the-art in SSA form destruction on machine code.

TI A Cross-Lingual Similarity Measure for Detecting Biomedical Term
   Translations
SO PLOS ONE
AB Bilingual dictionaries for technical terms such as biomedical terms are an important resource for machine translation systems as well as for humans who would like to understand a concept described in a foreign language. Often a biomedical term is first proposed in English and later it is manually translated to other languages. Despite the fact that there are large monolingual lexicons of biomedical terms, only a fraction of those term lexicons are translated to other languages. Manually compiling large-scale bilingual dictionaries for technical domains is a challenging task because it is difficult to find a sufficiently large number of bilingual experts. We propose a cross-lingual similarity measure for detecting most similar translation candidates for a biomedical term specified in one language (source) from another language (target). Specifically, a biomedical term in a language is represented using two types of features: (a) intrinsic features that consist of character n-grams extracted from the term under consideration, and (b) extrinsic features that consist of unigrams and bigrams extracted from the contextual windows surrounding the term under consideration. We propose a cross-lingual similarity measure using each of those feature types. First, to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space in each language, we propose prototype vector projection (PVP)-a non-negative lower-dimensional vector projection method. Second, we propose a method to learn a mapping between the feature spaces in the source and target language using partial least squares regression (PLSR). The proposed method requires only a small number of training instances to learn a cross-lingual similarity measure. The proposed PVP method outperforms popular dimensionality reduction methods such as the singular value decomposition (SVD) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) in a nearest neighbor prediction task. Moreover, our experimental results covering several language pairs such as English-French, English-Spanish, English-Greek, and English-Japanese show that the proposed method outperforms several other feature projection methods in biomedical term translation prediction tasks.

AB With explosive growth in dataset sizes and increasing machine memory capacities, per-application memory footprints are commonly reaching into hundreds of GBs. Such huge datasets pressure the TLB, resulting in frequent misses that must be resolved through a page walk - a long-latency pointer chase through multiple levels of the in-memory radix tree-based page table.
   Anticipating further growth in dataset sizes and their adverse affect on TLB hit rates, this work seeks to accelerate page walks while fully preserving existing virtual memory abstractions and mechanisms - a must for software compatibility and generality. Our idea is to enable direct indexing into a given level of the page table, thus eliding the need to first fetch pointers from the preceding levels. A key contribution of our work is in showing that this can be done by simply ordering the pages containing the page table in physical memory to match the order of the virtual memory pages they map to. Doing so enables direct indexing into the page table using a base-plus-offset arithmetic.
   We introduce Address Translation with Prefetching (ASAP), a new approach for reducing the latency of address translation to a single access to the memory hierarchy. Upon a TLB miss, ASAP launches prefetches to the deeper levels of the page table, bypassing the preceding levels. These prefetches happen concurrently with a conventional page walk, which observes a latency reduction due to prefetching while guaranteeing that only correctly-predicted entries are consumed. ASAP requires minimal extensions to the OS and trivial microarchitectural support. Moreover, ASAP is fully legacy-preserving, requiring no modifications to the existing radix tree-based page table, TLBs and other software and hardware mechanisms for address translation. Our evaluation on a range of memory-intensive workloads shows that under SMT colocation, ASAP is able to reduce page walk latency by an average of 25% (42% max) in native execution, and 45% (55% max) under virtualization.

AB Machine Learning algorithms and Neural Networks are widely applied to many different areas such as stock market prediction, facial recognition and automatic machine translation. This paper introduces a novel strategy based on the classic Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm, Deep Q-Network, for stock market portfolio management. It is a type of deep neural network which is optimized by Q Learning. To adapt the Deep Q-Network for stock market production, we first discretize the action space so that portfolio management becomes a problem that Deep Q-Network can solve. Following this, we combine the Convolutional Neural Network and dueling Q-Net to enhance the recognition ability of the algorithm. We choose five low-relevant American stocks to test our model. It is found that the Deep Q-Network based strategy outperforms the ten other traditional strategies. The profit of Deep Q-Network algorithm is 30% more than the profit of other strategies. Moreover, the Sharpe ratio and Max Drawdown demonstrates that the risk of policy associated with Deep Q-Network is the lowest.

TI The verified CakeML compiler backend
SO JOURNAL OF FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
AB The CakeML compiler is, to the best of our knowledge, the most realistic verified compiler for a functional programming language to date. The architecture of the compiler, a sequence of intermediate languages through which high-level features are compiled away incrementally, enables verification of each compilation pass at an appropriate level of semantic detail. Parts of the compiler's implementation resemble mainstream (unverified) compilers for strict functional languages, and it supports several important features and optimisations. These include efficient curried multiargument functions, configurable data representations, efficient exceptions, register allocation, and more. The compiler produces machine code for five architectures: x86-64, ARMv6, ARMv8, MIPS-64, and RISC-V. The generated machine code contains the verified runtime system which includes a verified generational copying garbage collector and a verified arbitrary precision arithmetic (bignum) library. In this paper, we present the overall design of the compiler backend, including its 12 intermediate languages. We explain how the semantics and proofs fit together and provide detail on how the compiler has been bootstrapped inside the logic of a theorem prover. The entire development has been carried out within the HOL4 theorem prover.

TI Magnet alignment on a common girder: Development of a length artefact
   for measurement accuracy improvement
SO PRECISION ENGINEERING-JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETIES FOR
   PRECISION ENGINEERING AND NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB The tolerances for the alignment of the magnets on the girders of the proposed particle accelerator of the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS), Sirius, are as small as 40 mu m for translations and 0.3 mrad for rotations. The functional axis of the magnets is measured by the vibrating wire technique, which employs conductive wires of diameters of approx. 0.1 mm. Since the alignment has to be performed targeting these magnetic axes, rather than their geometric centrelines, non-contact measuring sensors mounted on a coordinate measuring machine have been chosen to measure the relative deviations between magnets. To better the measurement accuracy for that specific measuring task, to allow interim checks on multiple coordinate measuring systems, and to provide effective traceability to the SI unit of length, a multipurpose geometrical artefact has been devised. The reasoning behind this development and the first measurement results are described in this paper. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Native Simulation of MPSoC Using Hardware-Assisted Virtualization
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND
   SYSTEMS
AB Integration of multiple heterogeneous processors into a single system-on-a-chip is a clear trend in embedded devices. Designing and verifying these devices requires high-speed and easy-to-build simulation platforms. Among the software simulation approaches, native simulation is a good candidate since the embedded software is executed natively on the host machine, and no instruction set simulator development effort is necessary. However, existing native simulation approaches are such that the simulated software shares the memory space of the modeled hardware modules and the host operating system, making impractical the support of legacy code running on the target platform. To overcome this issue seldom mentioned in the literature, we propose the addition of a transparent address space translation layer to separate the target address space from the host simulator one. For this, we exploit the hardware-assisted virtualization technology now available on most general-purpose processors. Experiments show that this solution does not degrade the native simulation speed, while keeping the ability to accomplish software performance evaluation.

AB We envisage pervasive computing applications to be predominantly engaged in knowledge-based interactions, where services and information will be found and exchanged based on some formal knowledge representation. To enable knowledge sharing and reuse, current middleware make the assumption that a single, universally accepted, ontology exists with which queries and assertions are exchanged. We argue that such an assumption is unrealistic. Rather different communities will speak different 'dialects'; in order to enable cross-community interactions, thus increasing the range of services and information available to users, on-the-fly translations are required. In this paper we introduce MaLM, a middleware for pervasive computing devices that exploits an unsupervised machine learning technique called Self-Organising Map to tackle the problem of ontology heterogeneity. At any given time, the MaLM instance running on a device operates in one of two possible modes: 'training', that is, MaLM is autonomically learning how to group together semantically closed concepts; and 'expert', that is, given in input a query or assertion expressed in a foreign dialect, MaLM identifies the concept, expressed in the device mother-tongue, that most closely represents it.

TI Polymer transport in random potentials and the genetic code: The waltz
   of life
SO ANNALES HENRI POINCARE
AB We address the question of why the translation from nucleic acids to protein forming amino acids is carried out by triplets known as codons. We approach this problem from a dynamical point of view by considering the translocation properties of primitive molecular machines operating under prebiotic conditions [1, 2, 3, 4]. Our model captures some basic ribosome-mRNA interaction features. We consider short chains of charged particles interacting with polymers via electrostatic forces, constrained to move in quasi one dimensional geometries, subject to external forcing. Our numerical and analytic studies of statistical properties of random chain/polymer potentials suggest that, under very general conditions, a dynamics is attained in which the chain moves along the polymer in steps of three monomers, traversing swiftly two monomers and lingering on the third one as in a waltz. This behavior is enhanced when we consider present day protein coding sequences. We also comment on noncoding sequences. We argue that this property could be one of the underlying causes for the three base codon structure of the genetic code.

SO MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES
AB Environmental implication is a key concern while utilizing the conventional synthetic polymers for composite applications. Biodegradable/biocompatible/natural polymeric materials can potentially resolve this issue by strategic replacement of traditional polymeric counterparts. Auxiliary to materials selection, the processing techniques has an essential role to influence the composite performance. Advanced additive manufacturing techniques have advantages over conventional polymer processing techniques due to their proficiency to print complex parts which can conform to intricate shape, minimize wastage, rapid prototyping and ease of product translation. Improved 3D printing such as powder based methods has been demonstrated to fabricate biocompatible parts like tooth implants. The current article includes the review on additive manufacturing techniques for the development of biocomposites, and further utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) in 3 D printing technologies. This review highlights how AI techniques such as machine learning and deep learning, supports efficiency and easy processibility of additive manufacturing methods for biocomposite development.

AB In this paper, authors present a novel architecture for controlling an industrial robot via Brain Computer Interface. The robot used is a Series 2000 KR 210-2. The robotic arm was fitted with DI drawing devices that clamp, hold and manipulate various artistic media like brushes, pencils, pens. User selected a high-level task, for instance a shape or movement, using a human machine interface and the translation in robot movement was entirely demanded to the Robot Control Architecture defining a plan to accomplish user's task. The architecture was composed by a Human Machine Interface based on P300 Brain Computer Interface and a robotic architecture composed by a deliberative layer and a reactive layer to translate user's high-level command in a stream of movement for robots joints. To create a real-case scenario, the architecture was presented at Ars Electronica Festival, where the A3-K3 architecture has been used for painting. Visitors completed a survey to address 4 self-assessed different dimensions related to human-robot interaction: the technology knowledge, the personal attitude, the innovativeness and the satisfaction. The obtained results have led to further exploring the border of human-robot interaction, highlighting the possibilities of human expression in the interaction process with a machine to create art.

AB Measuring the performance of natural language processing models is challenging. Traditionally used metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, originally devised for machine translation and summarization, have been shown to suffer from low correlation with human judgment and a lack of transferability to other tasks and languages. In the past 15 years, a wide range of alternative metrics have been proposed. However, it is unclear to what extent this has had an impact on NLP benchmarking efforts. Here we provide the first large-scale cross-sectional analysis of metrics used for measuring performance in natural language processing. We curated, mapped and systematized more than 3500 machine learning model performance results from the open repository `Papers with Code' to enable a global and comprehensive analysis. Our results suggest that the large majority of natural language processing metrics currently used have properties that may result in an inadequate reflection of a models' performance. Furthermore, we found that ambiguities and inconsistencies in the reporting of metrics may lead to difficulties in interpreting and comparing model performances, impairing transparency and reproducibility in NLP research.

However, even after six decades of fielded systems most IIT inspections are accomplished relying on human judgment and round-robin calibration techniques. We report on the Automated Intensifier Measurement System (AIMS), a NIST-traceable, calibratable, machine vision system developed to produce automated, quantifiable, reproducible results on eight of the major IIT inspections: (1) Useful Diameter, (2) Modulation Transfer Function, (3) Gross Distortion, (4) Shear Distortion, (5) Bright Spot, (6) Dark Spot, (7) Gain and (8) Uniformity. The overall architecture of the system and a description of the algorithms required for each test is presented. Translation from the anthropocentric MIL-PRF-A3256363D(CR) OMNI VII Military Specification to measurable quantities (with appropriate uncertainties) is described. The NIST-traceable system uncertainties associated with each measurement is reported; in all cases AIMS measures quantities associated with the above tests to more precision than current industry practice. Issues with the current industry standard equipment and testing methods are also identified. Future work, which will include additional inspections, is discussed.

AB A learning-training simulator with virtual functions for lathe operations has been developed and tested. The hardware is constructed based on the feed driving system of an actual lathe. A sense of force produced by the built-in direct drive motors provides the operator with some real feeling as if he or she were operating an. actual lathe. With multimedia techniques incorporated into the software, the simulator can display animated pictures to demonstrate the rotation of the work-piece and the translation of the cutter on the screen in real time. A computer-controlled speaker generates several types of working sound, mixing the sounds of the lathe spindle rotation and cutting corresponding to the operation status in the progress. Other useful functions, such as warning of a dangerous operation, and a demonstration of basic principles of metal cutting, have also been developed within the simulator in order to increase the teaming and training efficiency. Most of the operators, who have actually operated the simulator, gave a good evaluation for the teaming effects of the simulator.

AB This paper presents a detailed review of deep learning techniques used in Sentiment Analysis. Sentiment analysis is one of the most researched areas in natural language processing. Natural language processing has a wide range of applications like voice recognition, machine translation, product review, aspect oriented product analysis, sentiment analysis and text classification like email categorization and spam filtering. The conventional methods used for sentiment analysis is lexicon based processing. However, with the advancements in the field of artificial intelligence, the machine learning algorithms started to play a major role in sentiment analysis applications. Currently deep learning technique is the latest hotspot being used for predicting the sentiments. Several research works have been carried out in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) using the deep learning methods. The most popular deep learning methods employed includes Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) particularly the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). These techniques are used in combination or as stand-alone based on the domain area of application. The focus of this survey is on the various flavors of the deep learning methods used in different applications of sentiment analysis at sentence level and aspect/target level. Furthermore, the advantages and drawbacks of the methods are discussed along with their performance parameters.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NANOBIOSCIENCE
AB As one of the new posttranslational modification, lysine glutarylation has been identified in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. These glutarylated proteins are involved in various cellular functions, such as translation, metabolism, and exhibited diverse subcellular localizations. Experimental identification of lysine glutarylation sites was founded in 2014 and also identified its deglutarylase sirturn 5(SIRT 5). Computational prediction of lysine glutarylation could be a complementary way to the experimental technique. In this work, the lysine glutarylation predictor iGlu-Lys has been developed based on the machine learning scheme. We have selected the best feature scheme which took the amino acid pair order and special-position information into account from four constructions. The machine learning algorithm support vector machine has been adopted and its performance has been measured for different window length of peptides. In the 10-fold cross-validation with window length 19, the AUC and MCC were 0.8944 and 0.5098, respectively. Different ROC curves in 6-, 8-, and 10-fold cross-validations were very close which illustrated the robustness of our predictor. The results of iGLu-Lys were better than the existing method GlutPred. Meanwhile, a free webserver for iGlu-Lys is accessible at http://app.aporc.org/iGlu-Lys/.

TI Detecting light verb constructions across languages
SO NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING
AB Light verb constructions (LVCs) are verb and noun combinations in which the verb has lost its meaning to some degree and the noun is used in one of its original senses, typically denoting an event or an action. They exhibit special linguistic features, especially when regarded in a multilingual context. In this paper, we focus on the automatic detection of LVCs in raw text in four different languages, namely, English, German, Spanish, and Hungarian. First, we analyze the characteristics of LVCs from a linguistic point of view based on parallel corpus data. Then, we provide a standardized (i.e., language-independent) representation of LVCs that can be used in machine learning experiments. After, we experiment on identifying LVCs in different languages: we exploit language adaptation techniques which demonstrate that data from an additional language can be successfully employed in improving the performance of supervised LVC detection for a given language. As there are several annotated corpora from several domains in the case of English and Hungarian, we also investigate the effect of simple domain adaptation techniques to reduce the gap between domains. Furthermore, we combine domain adaptation techniques with language adaptation techniques for these two languages. Our results show that both out-domain and additional language data can improve performance. We believe that our language adaptation method may have practical implications in several fields of natural language processing, especially in machine translation.

TI Discarded Livers Find a New Life: Engineered Liver Grafts Using
   Hepatocytes Recovered From Marginal Livers
SO ARTIFICIAL ORGANS
AB Treatment for end-stage liver failure is restricted by the critical shortage of donor organs; about 4000 people die in the USA while waiting for a transplantable organ. This situation has been a major driving force behind the rise of tissue engineering to build artificial tissues/organs. Recent advancements in creating transplantable liver grafts using decellularized liver scaffolds bring the field closer to clinical translation. However, a source of readily available and highly functional adult hepatocytes in adequate numbers for regenerative liver therapies still remains unclear. Here, we describe a new method to utilize discarded livers to make transplantable new liver grafts. We show that marginal donor livers damaged due to warm ischemia could be treated with machine perfusion to yield 39 million viable hepatocytes per gram of liver, similar to fresh livers, and these cells could be used to repopulate decellularized liver matrix (DLM) scaffolds to make transplantable liver grafts. The hepatocytes from recovered livers sustained their characteristic epithelial morphology while they exhibited slightly lower protein synthesis functions both in plate cultures and in recellularized liver grafts. The dampened protein synthesis was attributed to residual endoplasmic reticulum stress found in recovered cells. The results here represent a unique approach to reengineer transplantable liver grafts solely from discarded organs.

AB Electrohydrodynamic inkjet printing (e-jet printing) is one type of micro/nano scale 3D printing techniques that automatically deposit functional materials to form 3D structures on the substrate. Unlike traditional thermal or acoustic inkjet printing, e-jet printing utilizes high electrical forces for the ink to overcome surface tension at the tip of micro needles. The droplets and filaments coming out from the needle have dimensions much smaller than the dimension of the needle, thus to print geometries in micro and nano scale. E-jet printing process parameters can affect the final quality attributes of fabricated constructs. Currently, assessment of these critical geometries and attributes information must be performed offline using optical microscopy or scanning electron microscopy. This drawback affected the efficiency of micro/nano printing from translation to industrial practice. The research in this paper focused on fundamental research to enable in situ monitoring of e-jet printing using a real-time images characterization technique. In conclusion, the study in this paper investigated using machine vision for real-time monitoring of micro/nano scale 3D printing. The method worked well for micro-filament detection in e-jet printing, and may be further implemented into feedback control system of complicated e-jet printing. However, the optical machine vision was limited to micro scale detection. One of the future research topic is to develop nano scale in situ detection mechanism for e-jet printing.

TI Machine Learning Techniques for Multi-Fault Analysis and Detection on a
   Rotating Test Rig Using Vibration Signal
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Machine health monitoring of rotating mechanical systems is an important task in manufacturing engineering. In this paper, a system for analyzing and detecting mounting defects on a rotating test rig is developed. The test rig comprises a slender shaft with a central disc, supported symmetrically by oscillating ball bearings. The shaft is driven at constant speed (with tiny variations) through a timing belt. Faults, such as the translation of the central disc along the shaft, the disc eccentricity, and defects on the motor reducer position or timing belt mounting position, are imposed. Time and frequency domain features, extracted from the vibration signal, are used as predictors in fault detection. This task is modeled as a multi-class classification problem, where the classes correspond to eight health states: one healthy and seven faulty. Data analysis, using unsupervised and supervised algorithms, provides significant insights (relevance of features, correlation between features, classification difficulties, data visualization) into the initial dataset, a balanced one. The experiments are performed using classifiers from MATLAB and six feature sets. Quadratic SVM achieves the best performance: 99.18% accuracy for the set of all 41 features extracted from X and Y accelerometer axes, and 98.93% accuracy for the subset of the 18 most relevant features.

TI Predicting Outcome in Patients with Brain Injury: Differences between
   Machine Learning versus Conventional Statistics
SO BIOMEDICINES
AB Defining reliable tools for early prediction of outcome is the main target for physicians to guide care decisions in patients with brain injury. The application of machine learning (ML) is rapidly increasing in this field of study, but with a poor translation to clinical practice. This is basically dependent on the uncertainty about the advantages of this novel technique with respect to traditional approaches. In this review we address the main differences between ML techniques and traditional statistics (such as logistic regression, LR) applied for predicting outcome in patients with stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Thirteen papers directly addressing the different performance among ML and LR methods were included in this review. Basically, ML algorithms do not outperform traditional regression approaches for outcome prediction in brain injury. Better performance of specific ML algorithms (such as Artificial neural networks) was mainly described in the stroke domain, but the high heterogeneity in features extracted from low-dimensional clinical data reduces the enthusiasm for applying this powerful method in clinical practice. To better capture and predict the dynamic changes in patients with brain injury during intensive care courses ML algorithms should be extended to high-dimensional data extracted from neuroimaging (structural and fMRI), EEG and genetics.

TI Flexible printed circuit board magnetic micromirror for laser
   marking/engraving
SO JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING
AB This paper presents a flexible printed circuit board (PCB) quasi-static magnetic micromirror, on which a portable laser marking/engraving machine is built. The micromirror consists of a flexible PCB structure (including two polyimide torsion beams, a middle seat with coils, and two support pads), two permanent magnets, and a mirror plate. The fabrication uses a flexible PCB process, in addition to dicing a silicon wafer for making the mirror plate. The mirror plate is bonded to the flexible PCB middle seat, which has high strain strength (maximum strain at yield similar to 3%) and high bonding yield with easy operation. The flexible PCB micromirror achieves a large quasi-static rotation, e.g. 13 degrees (optical), a low driving voltage (-0.4- + 0.4 v), and a low cost (a few dollars). Its aperture is large (4 x 4 nun) with high flatness (radius of curvature, ROC of similar to 10 m). A prime method is proposed to address the drift/ creep problem associated with the flexible PCB micromirror's quasi-static rotation. A low cost and portable laser marking/engraving machine is built with the following performance: working area (22 x 17 mm(2)), size (116 x 43 x 55 mm(3)), laser power (0.23 W), speed 2 mm s(-1).

TI Synthesizing safe state machines from Esterel
SO ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES
AB Esterel and Safe State Machines (SSMs) are synchronous languages dedicated to the modeling of embedded reactive systems. While Esterel is a textual language, SSMs are based on the graphical Statecharts formalism. Statecharts are often more intuitive to understand than their textual counterpart, and their animated simulation can help to visualize subtle behaviors of a program. However, in terms of editing speed, revision management, and meta-modeling, the textual nature of Esterel is advantageous. We present an approach to transform Esterel v5 programs into equivalent SSMs. This permits a design flow where the designer develops a system at the Esterel level, but uses a graphical browser and simulator to inspect and validate the system under development.
   We synthesize SSMs in two phases. The first phase transforms an Esterel program into an equivalent SSM, using a structural translation that results in correct, but typically not very compact SSMs. The second phase iteratively applies optimization rules that aim to reduce the number of states, transitions and hierarchy levels to enhance readability of the SSM. As it turned out, this optimization is also useful for the traditional, manual design of SSMs. The complete transformation has been implemented in a prototypical modeling environment, which allows to demonstrate the practicality of this approach and the compactness of the generated SSMs.

TI A Research Ethics Framework for the Clinical Translation of Healthcare
   Machine Learning
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BIOETHICS
AB The application of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) technologies in healthcare have immense potential to improve the care of patients. While there are some emerging practices surrounding responsible ML as well as regulatory frameworks, the traditional role of research ethics oversight has been relatively unexplored regarding its relevance for clinical ML. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive research ethics framework that can apply to the systematic inquiry of ML research across its development cycle. The pathway consists of three stages: (1) exploratory, hypothesis-generating data access; (2) silent period evaluation; (3) prospective clinical evaluation. We connect each stage to its literature and ethical justification and suggest adaptations to traditional paradigms to suit ML while maintaining ethical rigor and the protection of individuals. This pathway can accommodate a multitude of research designs from observational to controlled trials, and the stages can apply individually to a variety of ML applications.

AB The rise of the software engineering industry sparkled the research on static analyzers in both academia and industry. Academic tools historically have an exhaustive feature set but don't easily apply to industrial applications, and industrial verifiers are still very limited. The Equid project, which loosely stands for "Engine for performing queries on unified intermediate representations of program and domain models" is an attempt to fill the gap between theory and practice by building a language-agnostic analyzer in close contact with development and security community. In this introductory paper we set project goals, reveal motivation and describe code processing stages, such as preprocessing, translation to project's own intermediate codes, virtual machine execution, constraint solving, all done to make static and interactive contract violation checks easier, more precisive yet informative. The project is compared to other analyzers. We believe that such a framework can draw attention to industrial uses clearly missed by verification communities and help shape a vision of universal static analyzer architectures.

AB Language identification is an important task in machine translation, information storage and retrieval et al. However, traditional approaches cannot adapt those texts in social applications, which have the following characteristics: 1) shorter length, no more than 140 characters generally. 2) colloquial and anomalous grammar texts, which are generated directly by different users of the social platform. In this paper, we propose a vectorization-based approach, which exploits weighted n-gram statistical features and improved Cascade Forest approach to conduct accurate language identification of social media short texts. In order to classify a line of text, our approach firstly represents it by a fix-length feature vector, and then leverages a supervised classifier to assign a proper language to it. We implement our approach and conduct extensive evaluations on real-world social texts. The results show that our approach achieves better accuracy, precision and recall rates when compared with the state-of-art machine learning algorithms and off-the-shelf approaches. It also proves that our approach displays competitive performance in practice.

AB Knowledge graph embeddings offer prospects to integrate machine learning and symbolic reasoning. Learning algorithms are designed that map constants, concepts, and relations to geometric entities in a real-valued domain R-n. By identifying logics that feature these geometric entities as their model, one is able to achieve a tight integration of logic reasoning with machine learning. However, interesting description logics are more expressive than current knowledge graph embeddings, as description logics allow concept definitions using arbitrary relations, such as non-functional relationships and partial ones. By contrast, geometric models of relations used so far in knowledge graph embeddings such as translations, rotations, or linear functions can only represent total functional relationships. In this paper we describe a new geometric model of the description logic ALC based on cones that exploits reification combined with linear functions to represent arbitrary relations. While this paper primarily describes reification in context of a particular model for ALC, the proposed reification technique is general and applicable with other ontology languages and knowledge graph embeddings.

TI Finger spelling recognition using depth information and support vector

SO MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB In Sign Language fingerspelling systems, letters of the alphabet are presented by a diverse form or/and movement of the fingers. In this study, the presented work focus on developing a real-time translation framework of static fingerspelling alphabets. At first an adaptive k-means based cluster method for depth segmentation is proposed, where a flexible cluster number n is used instead of the pre-defined definitive one. Based on the segmentation step, a recognition framework using intensity and depth information is proposed and compared with some distinctive works. Discriminative features extracted from Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and Zernike moments are used due to their simplicity and good performance. The experiments are executed on a public fingerspelling dataset, which consisted of 120,000 images representing 24 alphabet letters over five different users. The results show that the presented framework is efficient, easy implementation, and performs better than the compared approaches.

TI Captioning Transformer with Stacked Attention Modules
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Image captioning is a challenging task. Meanwhile, it is important for the machine to understand the meaning of an image better. In recent years, the image captioning usually use the long-short-term-memory (LSTM) as the decoder to generate the sentence, and these models show excellent performance. Although the LSTM can memorize dependencies, the LSTM structure has complicated and inherently sequential across time problems. To address these issues, recent works have shown benefits of the Transformer for machine translation. Inspired by their success, we develop a Captioning Transformer (CT) model with stacked attention modules. We attempt to introduce the Transformer to the image captioning task. The CT model contains only attention modules without the dependencies of the time. It not only can memorize dependencies between the sequence but also can be trained in parallel. Moreover, we propose the multi-level supervision to make the Transformer achieve better performance. Extensive experiments are carried out on the challenging MSCOCO dataset and the proposed Captioning Transformer achieves competitive performance compared with some state-of-the-art methods.

AB An alteration of neuronal morphology is present in cognitive neurological diseases where learning or memory abilities are affected. The quantification of this alteration and its evolution by the study of microscopic images is essential. However, the use of advanced and automatic image processing techniques is currently very limited, focusing on the analysis of the morphology of isolated neurons. On this article we present a new methodology, based on texture analysis, to characterize the global distribution of different neural patterns in immunofluorescence images of brain tissue sections, where the neurons can be visualized as they are really distributed. We apply the technique to mice brain tissue section dividing them into two classes: Ts1Cje Down's syndrome model and wild type, free of this neurodegenerative disease. Taking into account CA1 region of the hippocampus, we calculate and compare several state of the art texture descriptors that are subsequently classified using machine learning techniques. Achieving a 95% of accuracy, the assumption that texture characterization is relevant to quantify globally morphological alterations in the neurons, seems to be demonstrated.

AB To efficiently extract and manage extremely large quantities of meaningful data in a delicate sector like healthcare requires sophisticated linguistic strategies and computational solutions. In the research described here we approach the semantic dimension of the formative elements of medical words in monolingual and bilingual environments. The purpose is to automatically build Italian-English medical lexical resources by grounding their analysis and generation on the manipulation of their consituent morphemes. This approach has a significant impact on the automatic analysis of neologisms, typical for the medical domain. We created two electronic dictionaries of morphemes and a morphological finite state transducer, which, together, find all possible combinations of prefixes, confixes, and suffixes, and are able to annotate and translate the terms contained in a medical corpus, according to the meaning of the morphemes that compose these words. In order to enable the machine to "understand" also medical multiword expressions, we designed a syntactic grammar net that includes several paths based on different combinations of nouns, adjectives, and prepositions.

TI Exploiting linguistic information from Nepali transcripts for early

   machine learning techniques
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES
AB Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered as progressing brain disease, which can be slowed down with the early detection and proper treatment by identifying the early symptoms. Language change serves as an early sign that a patient's cognitive functions have been impacted, potentially leading to early detection. The effects of language changes are being studied thoroughly in the English language to analyze the linguistic patterns in AD patients using Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, it has not been much explored in local languages and lowresourced languages like Nepali. In this paper, we have created a novel dataset on low resources language, i.e., Nepali, consisting of transcripts of the AD patients and control normal subjects. We have also presented baselines by applying various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms on a novel dataset for the early detection of AD. The proposed work incorporates the speech decline of AD patients in order to classify them as control subjects or AD patients. This study makes an effective conclusion that the difficulty in processing information of AD patients reflects in their speech narratives of patients while describing a picture. The dataset is made publicly available.

TI Overall survival prediction in glioblastoma multiforme patients from
   volumetric, shape and texture features using machine learning
SO SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
AB Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) are aggressive brain tumors, which lead to poor overall survival (OS) of patients. OS prediction of GBM patients provides useful information for surgical and treatment planning. Radiomics research attempts at predicting disease prognosis, thus providing beneficial information for personalized treatment from a variety of imaging features extracted from multiple MR images. In this study, MR image derived texture features, tumor shape and volumetric features, and patient age were obtained for 163 patients. OS group prediction was performed for both 2-class (short and long) and 3-class (short, medium and long) survival groups. Support vector machine classification based recursive feature elimination method was used to perform feature selection. The performance of the classification model was assessed using 5-fold cross-validation. The 2-class and 3-class OS group prediction accuracy obtained were 98.7% and 88.95% respectively. The shape features used in this work have been evaluated for OS prediction of GBM patients for the first time. The feature selection and prediction scheme implemented in this study yielded high accuracy for both 2-class and 3-class OS group predictions. This study was performed using routinely acquired MR images for GBM patients, thus making the translation of this work into a clinical setup convenient.

TI Tumor Microenvironment Evaluation for Gastrointestinal Cancer in the Era
   of Immunotherapy and Machine Learning
SO FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
AB A dynamic and mutualistic interplay between tumor cells and the surrounding tumor microenvironment (TME) triggered the initiation, progression, metastasis, and therapy response of solid tumors. Recent clinical breakthroughs in immunotherapy for gastrointestinal cancer conferred considerable attention to the estimation of TME, and the maturity of next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based technology contributed to the availability of increasing datasets and computational toolbox for deciphering TME compartments. In the current review, we demonstrated the components of TME, multiple methodologies involved in TME detection, and prognostic and predictive TME signatures derived from corresponding methods for gastrointestinal cancer. The TME evaluation comprises traditional, radiomics, and NGS-based high-throughput methodologies, and the computational algorithms are comprehensively discussed. Moreover, we systemically elucidated the existing TME-relevant signatures in the prognostic, chemotherapeutic, and immunotherapeutic settings. Collectively, we highlighted the clinical and technological advances in TME estimation for clinical translation and anticipated that TME-associated biomarkers may be promising in optimizing the future precision treatment for gastrointestinal cancer.

TI Transformer neural network for protein-specific de novo drug generation
   as a machine translation problem
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Drug discovery for a protein target is a very laborious, long and costly process. Machine learning approaches and, in particular, deep generative networks can substantially reduce development time and costs. However, the majority of methods imply prior knowledge of protein binders, their physicochemical characteristics or the three-dimensional structure of the protein. The method proposed in this work generates novel molecules with predicted ability to bind a target protein by relying on its amino acid sequence only. We consider target-specific de novo drug design as a translational problem between the amino acid "language" and simplified molecular input line entry system representation of the molecule. To tackle this problem, we apply Transformer neural network architecture, a state-of-the-art approach in sequence transduction tasks. Transformer is based on a self-attention technique, which allows the capture of long-range dependencies between items in sequence. The model generates realistic diverse compounds with structural novelty. The computed physicochemical properties and common metrics used in drug discovery fall within the plausible drug-like range of values.

TI Measurement and identification of geometric errors of translational axis
   based on sensitivity analysis for ultra-precision machine tools
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB Identification of geometric errors of translational axis is a key step to improve the accuracy of machine tools. However, during the procedure of measurement, installation errors of instruments are inevitable and should influence the measurement results. In order to avoid this and improve the reliability and accuracy of measurement, a novel identification measurement method is proposed. The errors of positioning and straightness of translational axis are measured by a laser interferometer in four installation positions. Twelve measured results are obtained, and then are used to identify six geometric errors of translation axis, based on the homogeneous transformation matrix and the least square method. Furthermore, an optimization method based on sensitivity analysis of the identification matrix is presented to obtain the optimum installation positions of the laser interferometer, to diminish the influence of the installation errors. Finally, simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the correctness and effectiveness of proposed method. The results indicate that the optimization identification method proposed is effective and accurate.

AB Robot milling is an alternative to the expensive multi-axis NC for the large components, such as large scale marine propeller, with the advantage of less expensive and more flexible. However, the machining error mainly caused by poor stiffness of the joint is a critical obstacle for robot milling application. Especially for the robot multi-axis milling, the machining error is more difficult to predict and compensate due to the complicated coordinate transformation between the deformation of tool point and the cutting force feedback. The static stiffness model of robot milling system is established based on the joint stiffness matrix and Jacobian matrix. Using the static stiffness model and the cutting force model, an equilibrium equation with the variable of tool point deformation is established based on the constructed coordinate transformation for the theoretical cutting position and the actual cutting position in different coordinate systems. The analyzed results indicate that the milling error is mainly influenced by the translation of tool point. The proposed error prediction and compensation method is validated by the cutting experiments.

TI Automated conversion of engineering rules: Towards flexible
   manufacturing collaboration
SO RESULTS IN ENGINEERING
AB Rapid on-demand manufacturing resource sharing within and between factories are critical to achieving responsive autonomous manufacturing collaborations towards mass personalization. To this end, cloud manufacturing technologies allow resource owners/service providers to virtualize and encapsulate their resources as services accessible over the Internet. Decision-making in cloud manufacturing needs to utilize realworld engineering knowledge from different parties. Many existing systems have adopted the semantic web-based decision-making framework, in which engineering knowledge is modeled using structured syntax. However, manually converting engineering rules to semantic rules is time-consuming and error prone. This research proposes a machine learning model, based on the Transformer model, that uses neural machine translation techniques to convert engineering knowledge expressed in natural language to structured semantic rules directly. The model is implemented using neural network. The model is first trained using typical sentences that are used for describing engineering knowledge. From these sample sentences, the model learns the patterns and the meaning of the sentences. This allows the model to identify the service providers, resource users, and the resources described in the sentences. As a result, the corresponding semantic rules can be constructed. Compared with previous approaches, the proposed scheme not only improves the conversion accuracy but also reduces the amount of required human interaction, simplifying the system and its use.

TI Imaging and artificial intelligence for progression of age-related
   macular degeneration
SO EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of severe vision loss. With our aging population, it may affect 288 million people globally by the year 2040. AMD progresses from an early and intermediate dry form to an advanced one, which manifests as choroidal neovascularization and geographic atrophy. Conversion to AMD-related exudation is known as progression to neovascular AMD, and presence of geographic atrophy is known as progression to advanced dry AMD. AMD progression predictions could enable timely monitoring, earlier detection and treatment, improving vision outcomes. Machine learning approaches, a subset of artificial intelligence applications, applied on imaging data are showing promising results in predicting progression. Extracted biomarkers, specifically from optical coherence tomography scans, are informative in predicting progression events. The purpose of this mini review is to provide an overview about current machine learning applications in artificial intelligence for predicting AMD progression, and describe the various methods, data-input types, and imaging modalities used to identify high-risk patients. With advances in computational capabilities, artificial intelligence applications are likely to transform patient care and management in AMD. External validation studies that improve generalizability to populations and devices, as well as evaluating systems in real-world clinical settings are needed to improve the clinical translations of artificial intelligence AMD applications.

TI Feature Map Analysis-Based Dynamic CNN Pruning and the Acceleration on

SO ELECTRONICS
AB Deep-learning-based applications bring impressive results to graph machine learning and are widely used in fields such as autonomous driving and language translations. Nevertheless, the tremendous capacity of convolutional neural networks makes it difficult for them to be implemented on resource-constrained devices. Channel pruning provides a promising solution to compress networks by removing a redundant calculation. Existing pruning methods measure the importance of each filter and discard the less important ones until reaching a fixed compression target. However, the static approach limits the pruning effect. Thus, we propose a dynamic channel-pruning method that dynamically identifies and removes less important filters based on a redundancy analysis of its feature maps. Experimental results show that 77.10% of floating-point operations per second (FLOPs) and 91.72% of the parameters are reduced on VGG16BN with only a 0.54% accuracy drop. Furthermore, the compressed models were implemented on the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and a significant speed-up was observed.

AB Estimating or predicting the downlink channel state information (CSI) is extremely important for practical implementation of frequency division duplex (FDD) massive MIMO. Estimation of downlink CSI from uplink CSI using second order channel statistics, namely the channel covariance matrix (CCM), is a promising approach. However, published work so far has rarely applied machine learning techniques to solve this problem using CCMs, most probably due to the unavailability of a direct mapping function or parametric model for supervised learning to convert from uplink to downlink CCMs. In this paper, we develop a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) method for uplink-to-downlink CCM conversion. To apply the CGAN-based method, we convert the uplink and downlink CCMs to images and use image translation techniques for CGANs. The normalized mean square error performance of the proposed CGAN is evaluated for several antenna array sizes and with both perfect and imperfect knowledge of the CCMs. Our results demonstrate performance improvement over existing algorithms.

TI Stable hovering of a jellyfish-like flying machine
SO JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE
AB Ornithopters, or flapping-wing aircraft, offer an alternative to helicopters in achieving manoeuvrability at small scales, although stabilizing such aerial vehicles remains a key challenge. Here, we present a hovering machine that achieves self-righting flight using flapping wings alone, without relying on additional aerodynamic surfaces and without feedback control. We design, construct and test-fly a prototype that opens and closes four wings, resembling the motions of swimming jellyfish more so than any insect or bird. Measurements of lift show the benefits of wing flexing and the importance of selecting a wing size appropriate to the motor. Furthermore, we use highspeed video and motion tracking to show that the body orientation is stable during ascending, forward and hovering flight modes. Our experimental measurements are used to inform an aerodynamic model of stability that reveals the importance of centre-of-mass location and the coupling of body translation and rotation. These results show the promise of flapping-flight strategies beyond those that directly mimic the wing motions of flying animals.

AB Symbolic software verification engines such as SLAM and ESC/JAVA often use automatic theorem provers to implement forms of symbolic simulation. The theorem provers that are used, such as SIMPLIFY, usually combine decision procedures for the theories of uninterpreted functions, linear arithmetic, and sometimes bit vectors using techniques proposed by Nelson-Oppen or Shostak. Programming language constructs such as pointers, structures and unions are not directly supported by the provers, and are often encoded imprecisely using axioms and uninterpreted functions.
   In this paper we describe a more direct and accurate approach towards providing symbolic infrastructure for program verification engines. We propose the use of a theorem prover called COGENT, which provides better accuracy for ANSI-C expressions with the possibility of nested logic quantifiers. The prover's implementation is based on a machine-level interpretation of expressions' into propositional logic. COGENT's translation allows the program verification tools to better reason about finite machine-level variables, bit operations, structures, unions, references, pointers and pointer arithmetic.
   This paper also provides experimental evidence that the proposed approach is practical when applied to industrial program verification.

TI Dependency parsing with stacked conditional random fields for Turkish
SO JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF ENGINEERING AND ARCHITECTURE OF GAZI
   UNIVERSITY
AB In the most general form Sequence Labelling is the production of an output sequence in response to an input sequence. Many of natural language processing problems such as (entity name recognition, machine translation, morphological analysis, separation of the elements of sentence etc.) can be defined as a sequence labelling. Dependency parsing is to determine the relationship and the type of the relationship between words within a sentence and it is essential to perform semantic analysis of a sentence. When dependency parsing is defined as a sequence labelling problem, production of two outputs (relationship type, related words) is required. Our recommendation is to use the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) which is commonly used in sequence labelling problems. However CRF is a method that produces a single output. To overcome this difficulty we propose to divide Dependency Parsing which is a problem with two outputs into two parts. The overall solution is provided by combining the results of these parts. With the performed operation we reached the best dependency parsing results for Turkish language.

AB Accurate acquisition for customer's requirements is the base and key in product configuration design. However, original customer's requirements must be decomposed in order to comprehend truly and apply them to guide product configuration design, because they are usually some fuzzy, general even contradictory customized demands. In the paper, two concepts are introduced for customer's requirement decomposition. One is the requirement element, and the other is the granularity of requirement element. Moreover, the controlling principle for granularity of requirement element is given and the method of requirement decomposition is proposed. This method means semantic segmentation, semantic translation, supplement or subdivision of human-machine-environment and semantic combination. Customer's abstract demands could be effectively decomposed into some specific requirement elements according to the proposed method of requirement decomposition as well as by controlling the granularity of requirement element reasonably. Finally, the customized design of a money-binding machine is taken as an example to validate the effectivity of proposed method.

TI Corpus-Based Methods for Recognizing the Gender of Anthroponyms
SO NAMES-A JOURNAL OF ONOMASTICS
AB This paper presents a series of methods for automatically determining the gender of proper names, based on their co-occurrence with words and grammatical features in a large corpus. Although the results obtained were for Spanish given names, the method presented here can be easily replicated and used for names in other languages. Most methods reported in the literature use pre-existing lists of first names that require costly manual processing and tend to become quickly outdated. Instead, we propose using corpora. Doing so offers the possibility of obtaining real and up-to-date name-gender links. To test the effectiveness of our method, we explored various machine-learning methods as well as another method based on simple frequency of co-occurrence. The latter produced the best results: 93% precision and 88% recall on a database of ca. 10,000 mixed names. Our method can be applied to a variety of natural language processing tasks such as information extraction, machine translation, anaphora resolution or large-scale delivery or email correspondence, among others.

AB Deaf people communicate naturally using sign languages, and because of this, they have difficulty in communicating using oral or written languages. To minimize this problem, one alternative is to use machine translation systems from sign languages into oral languages, especially for scenarios where human interpreters are not viable or unavailable. In this work, we address this problem by proposing a solution for fingerspelling recognition in Brazilian Sign Language (Libras) using Convolutional Neural Networks. The system uses a 224000 images dataset created by our team, which represents the letters of the Libras alphabet signed by 12 people in different backgrounds, body arm, hand positions, and lighting patterns. The results show that the solution had an average accuracy of approximately 99% in a dependent person scenario, and had an average accuracy of 71% in an independent person scenario. This type of solution can be used together with machine translators from Brazilian Portuguese to Libras, to assist in the communication of Brazilian deaf people.

AB The paraphrase identification task has practical importance in the NLP community because of the need to deal with the pervasive problem of linguistic variation. Accurate methods should help improve the performance of NLP applications, including machine translation, information retrieval, question answering, text summarization, document clustering and plagiarism detection, amongst others. We consider an approach to paraphrase identification that may be considered " knowledge-lean". Our approach minimizes the need for data transformation and avoids the use of knowledge-based tools and resources. Candidate paraphrase pairs are represented using combinations of word-and character-based features. We show that SVM classifiers may be trained to distinguish paraphrase and nonparaphrase pairs across a number of different paraphrase corpora with good results. Analysis shows that features derived from character bigrams are particularly informative. We also describe recent experiments in identifying paraphrase for Russian, a language with rich morphology and free word order that presents a particularly interesting challenge for our knowledge-lean approach. We are able to report good results on a three-way paraphrase classification task.

AB Unlike machines, humans learn through rapid, abstract model-building. The role of a teacher is not simply to hammer home right or wrong answers, but rather to provide intuitive comments, comparisons, and explanations to a pupil. This is what the Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI) paradigm endeavors to model by utilizing extra knowledge only available during training. We propose a new LUPI algorithm specifically designed for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). We propose to use a heteroscedastic dropout (i.e. dropout with a varying variance) and make the variance of the dropout a function of privileged information. Intuitively, this corresponds to using the privileged information to control the uncertainty of the model output. We perform experiments using CNNs and RNNs for the tasks of image classification and machine translation. Our method significantly increases the sample efficiency during learning, resulting in higher accuracy with a large margin when the number of training examples is limited. We also theoretically justify the gains in sample efficiency by providing a generalization error bound decreasing with O(1/n), where n is the number of training examples, in an oracle case.

AB This paper presents a three degrees of freedom (3-DOF) nano-positioning stage in the plane. In order to apply machining, the stage composes of a parallel kinematic mechanism (PKM) structure with the flexure hinges driven by three piezo-electric actuators to achieve the translations in the X-and Y-axes and rotation in the Z-axis. The design of the stage aims at structural stiffness improvement and miniaturization of the size. The static and dynamic stiffness analysis results are presented to verify the validity of three-OOF motion. The proposed nano-positioning stage has a translational motion of 20 nm and rotational motion of 0.2 arcsec in X-, Y-, and B-directional motion. Experimental testing has been evaluated to the compensation performance of the developed stage respecting the error of a linear axis. The linear displacement error, horizontal straightness error and yaw error is reduced by 90.8%, 96.5% and 90% respectively.

AB Converting an n-dimensional vector to a probability distribution over n objects is a commonly used component in many machine learning tasks like multiclass classification, multilabel classification, attention mechanisms etc. For this, several probability mapping functions have been proposed and employed in literature such as softmax, sum-normalization, spherical softmax, and sparsemax, but there is very little understanding in terms how they relate with each other. Further, none of the above formulations offer an explicit control over the degree of sparsity. To address this, we develop a unified framework that encompasses all these formulations as special cases. This framework ensures simple closed-form solutions and existence of sub-gradients suitable for learning via backpropagation. Within this framework, we propose two novel sparse formulations, sparsegen-lin and sparsehourglass, that seek to provide a control over the degree of desired sparsity. We further develop novel convex loss functions that help induce the behavior of aforementioned formulations in the multilabel classification setting, showing improved performance. We also demonstrate empirically that the proposed formulations, when used to compute attention weights, achieve better or comparable performance on standard seq2seq tasks like neural machine translation and abstractive summarization.

AB In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been applied to various machine leaning tasks, including image recognition, speech recognition, and machine translation. However, large DNN models are needed to achieve state-of-the-art performance, exceeding the capabilities of edge devices. Model reduction is thus needed for practical use. In this paper, we point out that deep learning automatically induces group sparsity of weights, in which all weights connected to an output channel (node) are zero, when training DNNs under the following three conditions: (1) rectified-linear-unit (ReLU) activations, (2) an L-2-regularized objective function, and (3) the Adam optimizer. Next, we analyze this behavior both theoretically and experimentally, and propose a simple model reduction method: eliminate the zero weights after training the DNN. In experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, we demonstrate the sparsity with various training setups. Finally, we show that our method can efficiently reduce the model size and performs well relative to methods that use a sparsity-inducing regularizer.

AB Individuals who are blind use exploration procedures (EPs) to navigate and understand digital images. The ability to model and detect these EPs can help the assistive technologies' community build efficient and accessible interfaces for the blind and overall enhance human-machine interaction. In this paper, we propose a framework to classify various EPs using spike-timing neural networks (SNNs). While users interact with a digital image using a haptic device, rotation and translation-invariant features are computed directly from exploration trajectories acquired from the haptic control. These features are further encoded as model strings through trained SNNs. A classification scheme is then proposed to distinguish these model strings to identify the EPs. The framework adapted a modified Dynamic Time Wrapping (DTW) for spatial-temporal matching with Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) for multimodal fusion. Experimental results (87.05% as EPs' detection accuracy) indicate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and its potential application in human-machine interfaces.

   Under Multiresource Constraints
SO OPERATIONS RESEARCH
AB Motivated by scheduling challenges of burn-in ovens in back-end semiconductor manufacturing, we propose a linear-programming-based algorithm, an integer-programming-based algorithm, and a heuristic-based algorithm to schedule non-homogenous parallel batch machines with nonidentical job sizes and incompatible job families. We consider the common scheduling of consecutive steps that are linked together through secondary scarce resources. Our approach addresses the availability and compatibility of several resources required to make each process possible. The algorithms strive to meet short-term production targets expressed by product and step. The algorithms are shown to be effective and computationally efficient for this purpose. Taken together with previously developed methodology for the practical translation of target output schedules into short-term local production targets, this article suggests how a complex supply chain manufacturing system can be efficiently and effectively managed by decentralized local scheduling algorithms striving to meet short-term production targets that in turn ensure maintenance of an appropriate dynamic profile across production steps for work-in-process.

   Paradigm Shift
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE PSYCHIATRIE
AB Neuroimaging research has substantiated the functional and structural abnormalities underlying psychiatric disorders but has, thus far, failed to have a significant impact on clinical practice. Recently, neuroimaging-based diagnoses and clinical predictions derived from machine learning analysis have shown significant potential for clinical translation. This review introduces the key concepts of this approach, including how the multivariate integration of patterns of brain abnormalities is a crucial component. We survey recent findings that have potential application for diagnosis, in particular early and differential diagnoses in Alzheimer disease and schizophrenia, and the prediction of clinical response to treatment in depression. We discuss the specific clinical opportunities and the challenges for developing biamarkers for psychiatry in the absence of a diagnostic gold standard. We propose that longitudinal outcomes, such as early diagnosis and prediction of treatment response, offer definite opportunities for progress. We propose that efforts should be directed toward clinically challenging predictions in which neuroimaging may have added value, compared with the existing standard assessment. We conclude that diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers will be developed through the joint application of expert psychiatric knowledge in addition to advanced methods of analysis.

AB As patients who receive orthopedic implants live longer and opt for surgery at a younger age, the need to extend the in vivo lifetimes of these implants has grown. One approach is to pattern implant surfaces with linear grooves, which elicit a cellular response known as contact guidance. Lasers provide a unique method of generating these surface patterns because they are capable of modifying physical and chemical properties over multiple length scales. In this paper we explore the relationship between surface morphology and laser parameters such as fluence, pulse overlap (translation distance), number of passes, and machining environment. We find that using simple procedures involving multiple passes it is possible to manipulate groove properties such as depth, shape, sub-micron roughness, and chemical composition of the Ti-6Al-4V oxide layer. Finally, we demonstrate this procedure by machining several sets of grooves with the same primary groove parameters but varied secondary characteristics. The significance of the secondary groove characteristics is demonstrated by preliminary cell studies indicating that the grooves exhibit basic features of contact guidance and that the cell proliferation in these grooves are significantly altered despite their similar primary characteristics. With further study it will be possible to use specific laser parameters during groove formation to create optimal physical and chemical properties for improved osseointegration.

TI Automatic construction of English/Chinese parallel corpora
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB As the demand for global information increases significantly, multilingual corpora has become a valuable linguistic resource for applications to cross-lingual information retrieval and natural language processing. In order to cross the boundaries that exist between different languages, dictionaries are the most typical tools. However, the general-purpose dictionary is less sensitive in both genre and domain. It is also impractical to manually construct tailored bilingual dictionaries or sophisticated multilingual thesauri for large applications. Corpus-based approaches, which do not have the limitation of dictionaries, provide a statistical translation model with which to cross the language boundary. There are many domain-specific parallel or comparable corpora that are employed in machine translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. Most of these are corpora between Indo-European languages, such as English/French and English/Spanish. The Asian/Indo-European corpus, especially English/Chinese corpus, is relatively sparse. The objective of the present research is to construct English/Chinese parallel corpus automatically from the World Wide Web. In this paper, an alignment method is presented which is based on dynamic programming to identify the one-to-one Chinese and English title pairs. The method includes alignment at title level, word level and character level. The longest common subsequence (LCS) is applied to find the most reliable Chinese translation of an English word. As one word for a language may translate into two or more words repetitively in another language, the edit operation, deletion, is used to resolve redundancy. A score function is then proposed to determine the optimal title pairs. Experiments have been conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed method using the daily press release articles by the Hong Kong SAR government as the test bed. The precision of the result is 0.998 while the recall is 0.806. The release articles and speech articles, published by Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, are also used to test our method, the precision is 1.00, and the recall is 0.948.

CY JUL 18-24, 2021
CL ELECTR NETWORK
AB Real-world machine learning systems are often trained using a mix of data sources with varying cost and quality. Understanding how the size and composition of a training dataset affect model performance is critical for advancing our understanding of generalization, as well as designing more effective data collection policies. We show that there is a simple scaling law that predicts the loss incurred by a model even under varying dataset composition. Our work expands recent observations of scaling laws for log-linear generalization error in the i.i.d setting and uses this to cast model performance prediction as a learning problem. Using the theory of optimal experimental design, we derive a simple rational function approximation to generalization error that can be fitted using a few model training runs. Our approach can achieve highly accurate (r(2) approximate to .9) predictions of model performance under substantial extrapolation in two different standard supervised learning tasks and is accurate (r(2) approximate to .83) on more challenging machine translation and question answering tasks where many baselines achieve worse-than-random performance.

TI A novel approach for detecting vulnerable IoT devices connected behind a
   home NAT
SO COMPUTERS & SECURITY
AB Telecommunication service providers (telcos) are exposed to cyber-attacks executed by compromised IoT devices connected to their customers' networks. Such attacks might have severe effects on the attack target, as well as the telcos themselves. To mitigate those risks, we propose a machine learning-based method that can detect specific vulnerable IoT device models connected behind a domestic NAT, thereby identifying home networks that pose a risk to the telcos infrastructure and service availability. To evaluate our method, we collected a large quantity of network traffic data from various commercial IoT devices in our lab and compared several classification algorithms. We found that (a) the LGBM algorithm produces excellent detection results, and (b) our flow-based method is robust and can handle situations for which existing methods used to identify devices behind a NAT are unable to fully address, e.g., encrypted, non-TCP or non-DNS traffic. To promote future research in this domain we share our novel labeled benchmark dataset. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Bayesian network based extreme learning machine for subjectivity
   detection
SO JOURNAL OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE-ENGINEERING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS
AB Subjectivity detection is a task of natural language processing that aims to remove 'factual' or 'neutral' content, i. e., objective text that does not contain any opinion, from online product reviews. Such a pre-processing step is crucial to increase the accuracy of sentiment analysis systems, as these are usually optimized for the binary classification task of distinguishing between positive and negative content. In this paper, we extend the extreme learning machine (ELM) paradigm to a novel framework that exploits the features of both Bayesian networks and fuzzy recurrent neural networks to perform subjectivity detection. In particular, Bayesian networks are used to build a network of connections among the hidden neurons of the conventional ELM configuration in order to capture dependencies in high-dimensional data. Next, a fuzzy recurrent neural network inherits the overall structure generated by the Bayesian networks to model temporal features in the predictor. Experimental results confirmed the ability of the proposed framework to deal with standard subjectivity detection problems and also proved its capacity to address portability across languages in translation tasks.

AB Colloquialism in the Philippines has been prominently used in day-to-day conversations. Its vast emergence is evident especially on social media platforms but poses issues in terms of understandability to certain groups. For this research, machine translators have been implemented to fill in that gap. The translators cover Filipino Textspeak or Shortcuts, Swardspeak or Gay-lingo, Conyo, and Datkilab - implemented on Tensorflow library and Moses tool. Implementing in Tensorflow achieved 85.88 BLEU score when evaluated to the training data and 14.67 to the test data, while Moses garnered 95.27 BLEU score on training data and 79.91 on test data. Analyses on both implementations include advantages and disadvantages in using each one. Through the analyses and development of this research, it is recommended to implement the following in the future: addition of colloquialism samples, experimentation on sequence-to-sequence configurations, applying Graphical User Interface (GUI) to the translators, implementing the translators to Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, and to deploy the translators as a web application.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The research on resistance genes (R-gene) plays a vital role in bioinformatics as it has the capability of coping with adverse changes in the external environment, which can form the corresponding resistance protein by transcription and translation. It is meaningful to identify and predict R-gene of Larimichthys crocea (L. Crocea). It is friendly for breeding and the marine environment as well. Large amounts of L. Crocea's immune mechanisms have been explored by biological methods. However, much about them is still unclear. In order to break the limited understanding of the L. Crocea's immune mechanisms and to detect new R-gene and R-gene-like genes, this paper came up with a more useful combination prediction method, which is to extract and classify the feature of available genomic data by machine learning. The effectiveness of feature extraction and classification methods to identify potential novel R-gene was evaluated, and different statistical analyzes were utilized to explore the reliability of prediction method, which can help us further understand the immune mechanisms of L. Crocea against pathogens.

AB Nanostructures have been machined into Si by a high-resolution laser direct write system. The Si substrate is locally heated above its melting point by a continuous-wave laser and rapidly etched by dry Cl-2 gas. If the solid-to-liquid transition is adjusted to occur only at the peak of the temperature profile, the melt size is significantly smaller than the diffraction-limited spot size. This can translate to extremely small etched features because of the high selectivity of the etching process for liquid Si compared to crystalline Si. By using objectives with a high numerical aperture, 488 nm as well as 351 nm light from an Ar ion laser, and X/Y/Z translation stages for moving the substrate instead of steering the beam, we have achieved line widths below 200 nm combined with very high scanning accuracy and speed. The resolution limit for Si machining is determined by the selectivity of the chemical reaction rather than the laser spot size. Interfacing to computer-aided design (CAD) software allows us to remove layer by layer of a truly three-dimensional nanostructure.

AB More than 16 million Americans served in World War I. Of these service members, over 400,000 were killed in action during the war. Today, more than 72,000 service members remain unaccounted for from World War II. The United States continues to diligently locate, recover, and identify missing personnel from World War H and other past conflicts to provide the fullest possible accounting. This work importantly provides closure and resolution to numerous US families. To fulfill this mission, massive amounts of information must be integrated from historical records, genealogy records, anthropological data, archeological data, odontology data, and DNA. These disparate data sources are produced and maintained by multiple agencies, with different data governance rules and different internal structuring of service member information. Previously, a manual approach had been undertaken to Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) records from these different data sources, which creates the potential for introduced human error. In addition, a large number of person-hours were required to synthesize this data on a biweekly basis. To address this issue, we implemented (i) a regex decision tree to translate genealogical relationships into DNA type availability and (ii) a machine learning approach for record-linkage between disparate data sources. This application is currently in production and greatly reduces person-hours needed and has a very low error rate for record translation and integration.

TI Dynamics of the Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis) Ovary Proteome Reveal a
   Complex Network of the Translasome
SO JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH
AB We evaluated changes in the striped bass (Morone saxatilis) ovary proteome during the annual reproductive cycle using label-free quantitative mass spectrometry and a novel machine learning analysis based on K-means clustering and support vector machines. Modulated modularity clustering was used to group co-variable proteins into expression modules and Gene Ontology (GO) biological process and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were conducted for proteins within those modules. We discovered that components of the ribosome along with translation initiation and elongation factors generally decrease as the annual ovarian cycle progresses toward ovulation, concomitant with a slight increase in components of the 26S-proteasome. Co-variation within more than one expression module of components from these two multi-protein complexes suggests that they are not only co-regulated, but that co-regulation occurs through more than one sub-network. These components also co-vary with subunits of the TCP-1 chaperonin system and enzymes of intermediary metabolic pathways, suggesting that protein folding and cellular bioenergetic state play important roles in protein synthesis and degradation. We provide further evidence to suggest that protein synthesis and degradation are intimately linked, and our results support function of a proteasome-ribosome supercomplex known as the translasome.

TI Using Emulation to Engineer and Understand Simulations of Biological
   Systems
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND BIOINFORMATICS
AB Modeling and simulation techniques have demonstrated success in studying biological systems. As the drive to better capture biological complexity leads to more sophisticated simulators, it becomes challenging to perform statistical analyses that help translate predictions into increased understanding. These analyses may require repeated executions and extensive sampling of high-dimensional parameter spaces: analyses that may become intractable due to time and resource limitations. Significant reduction in these requirements can be obtained using surrogate models, or emulators, that can rapidly and accurately predict the output of an existing simulator. We apply emulation to evaluate and enrich understanding of a previously published agent-based simulator of lymphoid tissue organogenesis, showing an ensemble of machine learning techniques can reproduce results obtained using a suite of statistical analyses within seconds. This performance improvement permits incorporation of previously intractable analyses, including multi-objective optimization to obtain parameter sets that yield a desired response, and Approximate Bayesian Computation to assess parametric uncertainty. To facilitate exploitation of emulation in simulation-focused studies, we extend our open source statistical package, spartan, to provide a suite of tools for emulator development, validation, and application. Overcoming resource limitations permits enriched evaluation and refinement, easing translation of simulator insights into increased biological understanding.

TI Modeling and analysis of variable-core groove for integral cutting tools
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART E-JOURNAL OF
   PROCESS MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
AB With good stiffness, the helical groove with variable-core radius has been widely used for end mills, drills and other integral cutting tools. However, ground by five-axis grinder, its machining process is high cost and time consuming. Thus, this paper reports a graphical analysis method to obtain the structure parameters and geometric shapes of variable-core grooves with the known wheel geometry and position before the practical machining. The wheel movement during the machining process is firstly decomposed into three simple motions and modeled as a translation matrix. Then, a family of wheel surfaces is calculated and the groove cross section line is deduced by splitting the surfaces with a cross section plane. Accordingly, the normal section line of the groove is expressed by a series of scattered points, which are the intersections of the normal section plane and the helical curves generated by the points on the groove cross section line which moves along the wheel trajectory. All the mathematic models are programed by Matlab and verified by experiment. Finally, the key parameters of the variable-core groove, including the rake angle, groove width on the cross and normal sections and the departure distance between the cross and normal groove section lines, are analyzed from the tool bit to the hilt.

TI Full-Mobility Three-CCC Parallel-Kinematics Machines: Kinematics and
   Isotropic Design
SO JOURNAL OF MECHANISMS AND ROBOTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
AB The subject of this paper is twofold: the kinematics and the isotropic design of six degrees-of-freedom (DOF), three-CCC parallel-kinematics machines (PKMs). Upon proper embodiment and dimensioning, the PKMs discussed here, with all actuators mounted on the base, exhibit interesting features, not found elsewhere. One is the existence of an isotropy locus, as opposed to isolated isotropy points in the workspace, thereby guaranteeing the accuracy and the homogeneity of the motion of the moving platform (MP) along different directions within a significantly large region of their workspace. The conditions leading to such a locus are discussed in depth; several typical isotropic designs are brought to the limelight. Moreover, the kinematic analysis shows that rotation and translation of the MP are decoupled, which greatly simplifies not only the kinetostatic analysis but also, most importantly, their control. Moreover, it is shown that the singularity loci of this class of mechanism are determined only by the orientation of their MP, which also simplifies locus evaluation and eases its representation.

AB Japanese case markers, which indicate the grammatical relation of the complement NP to the predicate, often pose challenges to the generation of Japanese text, be it done by a foreign language learner, or by a machine translation (MT) system. In this paper, we describe the task of predicting Japanese case markers and propose machine learning methods for solving it in two settings: (i) monolingual, when given information only from the Japanese sentence; and (ii) bilingual, when also given information from a corresponding English source sentence in an MT context. We formulate the task after the well-studied task of English semantic role labelling, and explore features from a syntactic dependency structure of the sentence. For the monolingual task, we evaluated our models on the Kyoto Corpus and achieved over 84% accuracy in assigning correct case markers for each phrase. For the bilingual task, we achieved an accuracy of 92% per phrase using a bilingual dataset from a technical domain. We show that in both settings, features that exploit dependency information, whether derived from gold-standard annotations or automatically assigned, contribute significantly to the prediction of case markers.

TI Quantitative Prediction of Inorganic Nanomaterial Cellular Toxicity via
   Machine Learning
SO SMALL
AB Organic chemistry has seen colossal progress due to machine learning (ML). However, the translation of artificial intelligence (AI) into materials science is challenging, where biological behavior prediction becomes even more complicated. Nanotoxicity is a critical parameter that describes their interaction with the living organisms screened in every bio-related research. To prevent excessive experiments, such properties have to be pre-evaluated. Several existing ML models partially fulfill the gap by predicting whether a nanomaterial is toxic or not. Yet, this binary categorization neglects the concentration dependencies crucial for experimental scientists. Here, an ML-based approach is proposed to the quantitative prediction of inorganic nanomaterial cytotoxicity achieving the precision expressed by 10-fold cross-validation (CV) Q(2) = 0.86 with the root mean squared error (RMSE) of 12.2% obtained by the correlation-based feature selection and grid search-based model hyperparameters optimization. To provide further model flexibility, quantitative atom property-based nanomaterial descriptors are introduced allowing the model to extrapolate on unseen samples. Feature importance is calculated to find an interpretable model with optimal decision-making. These findings allow experimental scientists to perform primary in silico candidate screening and minimize the number of excessive, labor-intensive experiments enabling the rapid development of nanomaterials for medicinal purposes.

TI Helical drilling of carbon fiber reinforced polymer by a femtosecond
   laser
SO APPLIED OPTICS
AB Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) has been widely used in the aerospace industry and other fields, but its processing is still subject to many restrictions. A femtosecond laser helical drilling device is proposed. It can realize beam deflection and translation through a scanning galvanometer and a pair of lenses, respectively, and finally obtain the effect of beam oblique focusing. With the combination of a spiral scanning path and focus feed, the non-taper and high-quality drilling of materials can be realized. CFRP materials were processed through this method, and the influences of process parameters on the heat affected zone and machining taper were studied. The distribution and influence degree of the heat affected zone and the formation mechanism of the machining taper were analyzed. Finally, a high-quality straight hole processing effect of CFRP with up to a 9.7: 1 aspect ratio, less than 15 mu m heat affected zone outside the hole, and no delamination in the hole was realized. This new drilling method is expected to further expand CFRP applications. (C) 2021 Optica Publishing Group

TI Rolling stylometry
SO DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP IN THE HUMANITIES
AB This article introduces a new stylometric method that combines supervised machine-learning classification with the idea of sequential analysis. Unlike standard procedures, aimed at assessing style differentiation between discrete text samples, the new method, supported with compact visualization, tries to look inside a text represented as a set of linearly sliced chunks, in order to test their stylistic consistency. Three flavors of the method have been introduced: (1) Rolling SVM, relying on the support vector machines (SVM) classifier, (2) Rolling NSC, based on the nearest shrunken centroids method, and (3) Rolling Delta, using the classic Burrowsian measure of similarity. The technique is primarily intended to assess mixed authorship; however, it can be also used as a magnifying glass to inspect works with unclear stylometric signal. To demonstrate its applicability, three different examples of collaborative work have been briefly discussed: (1) the 13th-century French allegorical poem Roman de la Rose, (2) a 15th-century translation of the Bible into Polish known as Queen Sophia's Bible, and (3) The Inheritors, a novel collaboratively written by Joseph Conrad and Ford Madox Ford in 1901.

TI Design and Analysis of a 2-DOF Split-Stator Induction Motor
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION
AB A two degrees of freedom (2-DOF) actuator capable of producing linear translation, rotary motion, or helical motion would be a desirable asset to the fields of machine tools, robotics, and various apparatuses. In this paper, a novel 2-DOF split-stator induction motor was proposed and electromagnetic structure parameters of themotor were designed and optimized. The feature of the direct-drive 2-DOF induction motor lies in its solid mover arrangement. In order to study the complex distribution of the eddy current field on the ferromagnetic cylinder mover and the motor's operating characteristics, the mathematical model of the proposed motor was established, and characteristics of the motor were analyzed by adopting the permeation depth method (PDM) and finite elementmethod (FEM). The analytical and numerical results from motor simulation clearly show a correlation between the PDM and FEM models. This may be considered as a fair justification for the proposed machine and design tools.

AB Complex wavelet structural similarity (CW-SSIM) index has been proposed as a promising image similarity measure that is robust to small geometric distortions such as translation, scaling and rotation of images, but how to make the best use of it in image classification problems has not been deeply investigated. In this paper, we propose a novel "feature-extraction free" image classification algorithm based on CW-SSIM and use handwritten digit recognition as an example to demonstrate it. First, a CW-SSIM based unsupervised clustering method is used to divide the training images into clusters and to pick a representative image for each cluster. A supervised learning method based on support vector machines is then employed to maximize the classification accuracy based on CW-SSIM values between an input image and the representative images. Our experiments show that such a conceptually simple image classification method, which does not involve any registration, intensity normalization or sophisticated feature extraction processes, and does not rely on any modeling of the image patterns or distortion processes, achieves competitive performance with reduced computational complexity.

TI Exact finite-state machine identification from scenarios and temporal
   properties
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON SOFTWARE TOOLS FOR TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER
AB Finite-state models, such as finite-state machines (FSMs), aid software engineering in many ways. They are often used in formal verification and also can serve as visual software models. The latter application is associated with the problems of software synthesis and automatic derivation of software models from specification. Smaller synthesized models are more general and are easier to comprehend, yet the problem of minimum FSM identification has received little attention in previous research. This paper presents four exact methods to tackle the problem of minimum FSM identification from a set of test scenarios and a temporal specification represented in linear temporal logic. The methods are implemented as an open-source tool. Three of them are based on translations of the FSM identification problem to SAT or QSAT problem instances. Accounting for temporal properties is done via counterexample prohibition. Counterexamples are either obtained from previously identified FSMs, or based on bounded model checking. The fourth method uses backtracking. The proposed methods are evaluated on several case studies and on a larger number of randomly generated instances of increasing complexity. The results show that the Iterative SAT-based method is the leader among the proposed methods. The methods are also compared with existing inexact approaches, i.e., the ones which do not necessarily identify the minimum FSM, and these comparisons show encouraging results.

AB Software verification tools that build machine-checked proofs of functional correctness usually focus on the algorithmic content of the code. Their proofs are not grounded in a formal semantic model of the environment that the program runs in, or the program's interaction with that environment. As a result, several layers of translation and wrapper code must be trusted. In contrast, the CakeML project focuses on end-to-end verification to replace this trusted code with verified code in a cost-effective manner.
   In this paper, we present infrastructure for developing and verifying impure functional programs with I/O and imperative file handling. Specifically, we extend CakeML with a low-level model of file I/O, and verify a high-level file I/O library in terms of the model. We use this library to develop and verify several Unix-style command-line utilities: cat, sort, grep, diff and patch. The workflow we present is built around the HOL4 theorem prover, and therefore all our results have machine-checked proofs.

AB The task of an automatic language identification (LID) system is to automatically identify the language in a spoken utterance. Language identification can be applied as front-end to speech-to-speech translation systems, in speaker diarization, and at call centers to automatically route incoming calls to appropriate native speaker operators. In the current study, a method for automatic language identification based on i-vector paradigm and conditional random fields (CRF) is presented. CRF belong to discriminative classifiers and use an exponential distribution to model a sequence given the observation sequence. This allows non-independent observations, and allows also non-local dependencies between state and observation. When the proposed method is evaluated on the NIST 2015 i-vector Machine Learning Challenge task for the recognition of 50 in-set languages, a 3.7% equal error rate (EER) (i.e., miss probability equal to false alarms) is achieved. Using support vector machines (SVM) a 5.2% EER, using probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) a 6.7% EER, and when using convolutional neural networks (CNN) a 4.2% EER are achieved.

AB The tolerances for the alignment of the magnets in the girders of the next machine of the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS), Sirius, are as small as 40 mu m for translations and 0.2 mrad for rotations. Therefore, a novel approach to the well-known vibrating wire technique has been developed and tested for the precise fiducialization of magnets. The alignment bench consists of four commercial linear stages, a stretched wire, a commercial lock-in amplifier working with phase-locked loop (PLL), a coordinate measuring machine (CMM) and a vibration sensor for the wire. This novel sensor has been designed for a larger linear region of operation. For the mechanical metrology step of the fiducialization of quadrupoles an innovative technique, using the vision system of the CMM, is presented. While the work with pitch and yaw orientations is still ongoing with promising partial results, the system already presents an uncertainty level below 10 mu m for translational alignment.

TI Transmorph: a transformer based morphological disambiguator for Turkish
SO TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES
AB The agglutinative nature of the Turkish language has a complex morphological structure, and there are generally more than one parse for a given word. Before further processing, morphological disambiguation is required to determine the correct morphological analysis of a word. Morphological disambiguation is one of the first and crucial steps in natural language processing since its success determines later analyses. In our proposed morphological disambiguation method, we used a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence neural network architecture. Transformers are commonly used in various NLP tasks, and they produce state-of-the-art results in machine translation. However, to the best of our knowledge, transformer-based encoder-decoders have not been studied in morphological disambiguation. In this study, in addition to character level tokenization, three input subword representations are evaluated, which are unigram, bytepair, and wordpiece tokenization methods. We have achieved the best accuracy with character input representation which is 96.25%. Although the proposed model is developed for Turkish language, it is not language-dependent, so it can be applied to a larger set of languages.

TI Corpus-Based Methods for Recognizing the Gender of Anthroponyms
SO NAMES-A JOURNAL OF ONOMASTICS
AB This paper presents a series of methods for automatically determining the gender of proper names, based on their co-occurrence with words and grammatical features in a large corpus. Although the results obtained were for Spanish given names, the method presented here can be easily replicated and used for names in other languages as well. Most methods reported in the literature use pre-existing lists of first names that require costly manual processing and tend to become quickly outdated. Instead, we propose using corpora. Doing so offers the possibility of obtaining real and up-to-date name-gender links. To test the effectiveness of our method, we explored various machine learning methods as well as another method based on simple frequency of co-occurrence. The latter produced the best results: 93% precision and 88% recall on a database of ca. 10,000 mixed names. Our method can be applied to a variety of natural language processing tasks such as information extraction, machine translation, anaphora resolution or large-scale delivery or email correspondence, among others.

AB Model based feature selection for identification of diverse faults in rotary machines can significantly cost time and money and it is nearly impossible to model all faults under different operating environments. In this paper, feed-forward ANN input-layer-weights have been used for the adaptive selection of the least number of features, without fault model information, reducing the computations significantly but assuring the required accuracy by mitigating the noise. In the proposed approach, under the assumption that presented features should be translation invariant, ANN uses entire set of spectral features from raw input vibration signal for training. Dominant features are then selected using input-layer-weights relative to a threshold value vector. Different instances of ANN are then trained and tested to calculate F1_score with the reduced dominant features at different SNRs for each threshold value. Trained ANN with best average classification accuracy among all ANN instances gives us required number of dominant features.

AB One of the main goals in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) research is to help patients with faltering communication abilities due to neurodegenrative diseases produce text or speech output using their neural recordings. However, practical implementation of such a system has proven difficult due to limitations in the speed, accuracy, and training time of existing interfaces. In this paper, we contribute to this endeavour by isolating appropriate input features from speech-producing neural signals that will feed into a machine learning classifier to identify target phonemes. Analysing data from six subjects, we discern frequency bands that encapsulate differential information regarding production of vowels and consonants broadly, and more specifically nasals and semivowels. Subsequent spatial localization analysis reveals the underlying cortical regions responsible for different phoneme categories. Anatomical locations along with their respective frequency bands act as prospective feature sets for machine learning classifiers. We demonstrate this classification ability in a preliminary language reconstruction task and show an average word classification accuracy of 30.6% (p<0.001).

AB Foreign language materials on the web are growing at a faster rate than English language materials and it has been predicted that by the end of 1999 the amount of non-English resources on the internet will exceed English resources. A significant portion of the non-English material is in the form of images.
   We believe that it would be of value if we were to be able to identify the language/script or identify the text by processing the images through English character OCRs that are trained on the English alphabet. The output of the recognizer is analyzed to see if there are unique signature patterns that would help map the resultant English characters or strings to foreign language/script characters or strings. If the language or script used in the image can be identified based on the results of an English recognition system, then the OCR for that script, if available, can be applied and an appropriate Machine Translation Engine can be used to recognize the text.
   An initial attempt to identify charcateristic signature patterns while procesing machine-printed Devanagari characters through English OCRs is detailed in this paper.

SO THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Below is a translation from my Russian paper. I added references, unavailable to me in Moscow. Similar results have been also given in [9] (see also [6]). Earlier relevant work (classical theorems like Compression, Speed-up, etc.) was done in [15, 13, 2, 1, 14, 7].
   I translated only the part with the statement of the results. Instead of the proof part. I appended a later (1979, unpublished) proof sketch of a slightly tighter version. The improvement is based on the results of Meyer and Winklmann [8] and Sipser [12]. Meyer and Winklmann extended earlier versions to machines with a separate input and working tape, thus allowing complexities smaller than the input length (down to its log). Sipser showed the space-bounded Halting Problem to require only additive constant overhead. The proof in the appendix below employs both advances to extend the original proofs to machines with a fixed alphabet and a separate input and working space. The extension has no (even logarithmic) restrictions on complexity and no overhead (beyond an additive constant). The sketch is very brief and a more detailed exposition is expected later [11].

TI Virtual prototyping for a parallel-link coordinate measuring machine
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART B-JOURNAL OF
   ENGINEERING MANUFACTURE
AB Compared with the conventional coordinate measuring machine (CMM), the parallel-link CMM has a simple structure, a higher measuring accuracy, a flexible probe posture, etc. However, the design for a physical prototype of the parallel-link CMM is very difficult because there is a nonlinear relationship between the probe position and the actuating variables applied through three parallel links. For this reason, the paper reports an approach by constructing the virtual prototype for a parallel-link CMM. Firstly, the structure and the working theory of the parallel-link CMM are introduced, and then the kinematic model of it is established. On the basis of that, the three-dimensional geometric model for the virtual prototype is constructed on computer screen, and the realistic visual effect is achieved by using the strong colouring process function available in the OpenGL graphic library. After that, the kinematic simulation for the virtual prototype is realized in the virtual environment by combining organically the spatial kinematic mechanics and the graphic transformation functions, such as rotation and translation, included in OpenGL. Finally, an example of measurement simulation is given. Thereby, the correctness of the kinematic model is further verified in a virtual environment. This research lays the foundation for manufacturing the real prototype of the parallel-link CMM.

TI Brain Tumor Diagnosis Using Machine Learning, Convolutional Neural
   Networks, Capsule Neural Networks and Vision Transformers, Applied to
   MRI: A Survey
SO JOURNAL OF IMAGING
AB Management of brain tumors is based on clinical and radiological information with presumed grade dictating treatment. Hence, a non-invasive assessment of tumor grade is of paramount importance to choose the best treatment plan. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) represent one of the effective Deep Learning (DL)-based techniques that have been used for brain tumor diagnosis. However, they are unable to handle input modifications effectively. Capsule neural networks (CapsNets) are a novel type of machine learning (ML) architecture that was recently developed to address the drawbacks of CNNs. CapsNets are resistant to rotations and affine translations, which is beneficial when processing medical imaging datasets. Moreover, Vision Transformers (ViT)-based solutions have been very recently proposed to address the issue of long-range dependency in CNNs. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of brain tumor classification and segmentation techniques, with a focus on ML-based, CNN-based, CapsNet-based, and ViT-based techniques. The survey highlights the fundamental contributions of recent studies and the performance of state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, we present an in-depth discussion of crucial issues and open challenges. We also identify some key limitations and promising future research directions. We envisage that this survey shall serve as a good springboard for further study.

TI Decoding Intracranial EEG With Machine Learning: A Systematic Review
SO FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE
AB Advances in intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) and neurophysiology have enabled the study of previously inaccessible brain regions with high fidelity temporal and spatial resolution. Studies of iEEG have revealed a rich neural code subserving healthy brain function and which fails in disease states. Machine learning (ML), a form of artificial intelligence, is a modern tool that may be able to better decode complex neural signals and enhance interpretation of these data. To date, a number of publications have applied ML to iEEG, but clinician awareness of these techniques and their relevance to neurosurgery, has been limited. The present work presents a review of existing applications of ML techniques in iEEG data, discusses the relative merits and limitations of the various approaches, and examines potential avenues for clinical translation in neurosurgery. One-hundred-seven articles examining artificial intelligence applications to iEEG were identified from 3 databases. Clinical applications of ML from these articles were categorized into 4 domains: i) seizure analysis, ii) motor tasks, iii) cognitive assessment, and iv) sleep staging. The review revealed that supervised algorithms were most commonly used across studies and often leveraged publicly available timeseries datasets. We conclude with recommendations for future work and potential clinical applications.

TI Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Computational
   Nanotoxicology: Unlocking and Empowering Nanomedicine
SO ADVANCED HEALTHCARE MATERIALS
AB Advances in nanomedicine, coupled with novel methods of creating advanced materials at the nanoscale, have opened new perspectives for the development of healthcare and medical products. Special attention must be paid toward safe design approaches for nanomaterial-based products. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) gifted the computational tool for enhancing and improving the simulation and modeling process for nanotoxicology and nanotherapeutics. In particular, the correlation of in vitro generated pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics to in vivo application scenarios is an important step toward the development of safe nanomedicinal products. This review portrays how in vitro and in vivo datasets are used in in silico models to unlock and empower nanomedicine. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME)-based in silico methods along with dosimetry models as a focus area for nanomedicine are mainly described. The computational OMICS, colloidal particle determination, and algorithms to establish dosimetry for inhalation toxicology, and quantitative structure-activity relationships at nanoscale (nano-QSAR) are revisited. The challenges and opportunities facing the blind spots in nanotoxicology in this computationally dominated era are highlighted as the future to accelerate nanomedicine clinical translation.

TI Extreme Learning Machine With Affine Transformation Inputs in an
   Activation Function
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
AB The extreme learning machine (ELM) has attracted much attention over the past decade due to its fast learning speed and convincing generalization performance. However, there still remains a practical issue to be approached when applying the ELM: the randomly generated hidden node parameters without tuning can lead to the hidden node outputs being nonuniformly distributed, thus giving rise to poor generalization performance. To address this deficiency, a novel activation function with an affine transformation (AT) on its input is introduced into the ELM, which leads to an improved ELM algorithm that is referred to as an AT-ELM in this paper. The scaling and translation parameters of the AT activation function are computed based on the maximum entropy principle in such a way that the hidden layer outputs approximately obey a uniform distribution. Application of the AT-ELM algorithm in nonlinear function regression shows its robustness to the range scaling of the network inputs. Experiments on nonlinear function regression, real-world data set classification, and benchmark image recognition demonstrate better performance for the AT-ELM compared with the original ELM, the regularized ELM, and the kernel ELM. Recognition results on benchmark image data sets also reveal that the AT-ELM outperforms several other state-of-the-art algorithms in general.

Furthermore, most existent Arabic language resources focus on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). This paper describes KUNUZ a multi-purpose test collection composed of voweled and structured classical Arabic documents. Its goal is to provide a unique benchmark for assessing applications in several areas of document engineering including IR, document classification and information extraction. The documents are also translated in English to allow Arabic English cross-lingual IR and machine translation. As far as IR is concerned, we follow the standard topic development and results sampling used in international campaigns. The paper, describes the process of topic development, results pooling and relevance judgment. It also analyses the results of some processing tools and IR models used in the runs. In order to enhance the results of our experiments, we also proposed to combine the results based on a meta-search approach using Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification.

SO ELEKTROTECHNIK UND INFORMATIONSTECHNIK
AB The bearingless rotary-linear reluctance motor is a novel drive and enables independent magnetic levitation as well as translation and rotation of a ferromagnetic rotor. Additionally, its compact, simple and robust design enables a wide range of new applications. Due to the large variety of possible movements and the couplings of many physical quantities of the system, the required control of the rotor in all six degrees of freedom is much more complex than the control of conventional drives. Therefore, a theoretical modelling of the machine was initially carried out with appropriate simplifications. Subsequently, a basic variant of the control of the rotor in all six degrees of freedom was developed, with which the machine could be successfully and completely put into operation. Using this control, initial studies on the dynamics of the overall system were carried out by evaluating the system responses to various setting value steps.

AB Due to the relative lack of pervasive sign language usage within our society, deaf and other verbally-challenged people tend to face difficulty in communicating on a daily basis. Our study thus aims to provide research into a sign language translator applied on the smartphone platform, due to its portability and ease of use. In this paper, a novel framework comprising established image processing techniques is proposed to recognise images of several sign language gestures. More specifically, we initially implement Canny edge detection and seeded region growing to segment the hand gesture from its background. Feature points are then extracted with Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) algorithm, whose features are derived through Bag of Features (BoF). Support Vector Machine (SVM) is subsequently applied to classify our gesture image dataset; where the trained dataset is used to recognize future sign language gesture inputs. The proposed framework has been successfully implemented on smartphone platforms, and experimental results show that it is able to recognize and translate 16 different American Sign Language gestures with an overall accuracy of 97.13%.

AB Girard's Geometry of Interaction (GoI) is interaction based semantics of linear logic proofs and, via suitable translations, of functional programs in general. Its mathematical cleanness identifies essential structures in computation; moreover its use as a compilation technique from programs to state machines-"GoI implementation," so to speak-has been worked out by Mackie, Ghica and others. In this paper, we develop Abramsky's idea of resumption based GoI systematically into a generic framework that accounts for computational effects (nondeterminism, probability, exception, global states, interactive I/O, etc.). The framework is categorical: Plotkin & Power's algebraic operations provide an interface to computational effects; the framework is built on the categorical axiomatization of GoI by Abramsky, Haghverdi and Scott; and, by use of the coalgebraic formalization of component calculus, we describe explicit construction of state machines as interpretations of functional programs. The resulting interpretation is shown to be sound with respect to equations between algebraic operations, as well as to Moggi's equations for the computational lambda calculus. We illustrate the construction by concrete examples.

TI Repair in Translation
SO EAST ASIAN SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB In this article, the author juxtaposes writing and conversation about care for, with, and in spite of technology in Cambodia. The scene is medical care, and the actors are radiologists, engineers, cadres, and X-ray machines. A radiologist is forced to repair an X-ray machine for doctors of the revolution; the pressure and constraints are almost unreal, yet his skill in repair affirms his humanity and the specialized knowledge and creativity required for problem solving. An engineer teaches repair as he fixes an old X-ray machine. He finds words and necessary tools are missing in Phnom Penh, a familiar story of lack, yet repair is material practice that enables improvisation in spite of linguistic and epistemic challenges. A radiologist, the same one from before, in the twilight of his life, questions the dominance of technologies within medical care and the deskilling of doctors. Juxtaposing these stories bolsters attention for the mundane and creative work of keeping things going in a "broken world," in line with the ways that care and repair are mobilized in STS. It also shows how the radical potential of "broken world thinking" is circumscribed when a broken world is the one from which people are struggling to distance themselves. What we are left with are multiple, overlapping, fraught stories of modernity in which need, choice, and pleasure of repair all have a place.

TI Structural mechanism for nucleotide-driven remodeling of the AAA-ATPase
   unfoldase in the activated human 26S proteasome
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The proteasome is a sophisticated ATP-dependent molecular machine responsible for protein degradation in all known eukaryotic cells. It remains elusive how conformational changes of the AAA-ATPase unfoldase in the regulatory particle (RP) control the gating of the substrate-translocation channel leading to the proteolytic chamber of the core particle (CP). Here we report three alternative states of the ATP-gamma-S-bound human proteasome, in which the CP gates are asymmetrically open, visualized by cryo-EM at near-atomic resolutions. At least four nucleotides are bound to the AAA-ATPase ring in these open-gate states. Variation in nucleotide binding gives rise to an axial movement of the pore loops narrowing the substrate-translation channel, which exhibit remarkable structural transitions between the spiral-staircase and saddle-shaped-circle topologies. Gate opening in the CP is thus regulated by nucleotide-driven conformational changes of the AAA-ATPase unfoldase. These findings demonstrate an elegant mechanism of allosteric coordination among sub-machines within the human proteasome holoenzyme.

AB Ethereum is a framework for cryptocurrencies which uses blockchain technology to provide an open global computing platform, called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). EVM executes bytecode on a simple stack machine. Programmers do not usually write EVM code; instead, they can program in a JavaScript-like language, called Solidity, that compiles to bytecode. Since the main purpose of EVM is to execute smart contracts that manage and transfer digital assets (called Ether), security is of paramount importance. However, writing secure smart contracts can be extremely difficult: due to the openness of Ethereum, both programs and pseudonymous users can call into the public methods of other programs, leading to potentially dangerous compositions of trusted and untrusted code. This risk was recently illustrated by an attack on TheDAO contract that exploited subtle details of the EVM semantics to transfer roughly $50M worth of Ether into the control of an attacker. In this paper, we outline a framework to analyze and verify both the runtime safety and the functional correctness of Ethereum contracts by translation to F*, a functional programming language aimed at program verification.

TI Coping With Complexity: Machine Learning Optimization of Cell-Free
   Protein Synthesis
SO BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOENGINEERING
AB Biological systems contain complex metabolic pathways with many nonlinearities and synergies that make them difficult to predict from first principles. Protein synthesis is a canonical example of such a pathway. Here we show how cell-free protein synthesis may be improved through a series of iterated high-throughput experiments guided by a machine-learning algorithm implementing a form of evolutionary design of experiments (Evo-DoE). The algorithm predicts fruitful experiments from statistical models of the previous experimental results, combined with stochastic exploration of the experimental space. The desired experimental response, or evolutionary fitness, was defined as the yield of the target product, and new experimental conditions were discovered to have similar to 350% greater yield than the standard. An analysis of the best experimental conditions discovered indicates that there are two distinct classes of kinetics, thus showing how our evolutionary design of experiments is capable of significant innovation, as well as gradual improvement.

TI AnatomicalTerms.info: Heading for an Online Solution to the Anatomical
   Synonym Problem: Hurdles in Data-reuse from the Terminologia Anatomica
   and the Foundational Model of Anatomy and Potentials for Future
   Development
SO CLINICAL ANATOMY
AB The many synonyms for anatomical structures confuse medical students and complicate medical communication. Easily accessible translations would alleviate this problem. None of the presently available resources-Terminologia Anatomica (TA), digital terminologies such as the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA), and websites-are fully satisfactory to this aim. Internet technologies offer new possibilities to solve the problem. Several authors have called for an online TA. An online translation resource should be easily accessible, user-friendly, comprehensive, expandable, and its quality determinable. As first step towards this goal, we built a translation website that we named www.AnatomicalTerms.info, based on the database of the FMA. It translates between English, Latin, eponyms, and to a lesser extent other languages, and presently contains over 31,000 terms for 7,250 structures, covering 95% of TA. In addition, it automatically presents searches for images, documents and anatomical variations regarding the sought structure. Several terminological and conceptual issues were encountered in transferring data from TA and FMA into AnatomicalTerms.info, resultant from these resources' different set-ups (paper versus digital) and targets (machine versus human-user). To the best of our knowledge, AnatomicalTerms.info is unique in its combination of user-friendliness and comprehensiveness. As next step, wiki-like expandability will be added to enable open contribution of clinical synonyms and terms in different languages. Specific quality measures will be taken to strike a balance between open contribution and quality assurance. AnatomicalTerms.info's mechanism that "translates" terms to structures furthermore may enhance targeted searching by linking images, descriptions, and other anatomical resources to the structures.

AB Deep learning has been successfully applied in several fields such as machine translation, manufacturing, and pattern recognition. However, successful application of deep learning depends upon appropriately setting its parameters to achieve high-quality results. The number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each layer of a deep machine learning network are two key parameters, which have main influence on the performance of the algorithm. Manual parameter setting and grid search approaches somewhat ease the users' tasks in setting these important parameters. Nonetheless, these two techniques can be very time-consuming. In this paper, we show that the Particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique holds great potential to optimize parameter settings and thus saves valuable computational resources during the tuning process of deep learning models.
   Specifically, we use a dataset collected from a Wi-Fi campus network to train deep learning models to predict the number of occupants and their locations. Our preliminary experiments indicate that PSO provides an efficient approach for tuning the optimal number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each layer of the deep learning algorithm when compared to the grid search method. Our experiments illustrate that the exploration process of the landscape of configurations to find the optimal parameters is decreased by 77 % - 85%. In fact, the PSO yields even better accuracy results.

TI Road-sign detection and recognition based on support vector machines
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
AB This paper presents an automatic road-sign detection and recognition system based on support vector machines (SVMs). In automatic traffic-sign maintenance and in a visual driver-assistance system, road-sign detection and recognition are two of the most important functions. Our system is able to detect and recognize circular, rectangular, triangular, and octagonal signs and, hence, covers all existing Spanish traffic-sign shapes. Road signs provide drivers important information and help them to drive more safely and more easily by guiding and warning them and thus regulating their actions. The proposed recognition system is based on the generalization properties of SVMs. The system consists of three stages: 1) segmentation according to the color of the pixel; 2) traffic-sign detection by shape classification using linear SVMs; and 3) content recognition based on Gaussian-kernel SVMs. Because of the used segmentation stage by red, blue, yellow, white, or combinations of these colors, all traffic signs can be detected, and some of them can be detected by several colors. Results show a high success rate and a very low amount of false positives in the final recognition stage. From these results, we can conclude that the proposed algorithm is invariant to translation, rotation, scale, and, in many situations, even to partial occlusions.

TI Learning Translation Invariant Kernels for Classification
SO JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH
AB Appropriate selection of the kernel function, which implicitly defines the feature space of an algorithm, has a crucial role in the success of kernel methods. In this paper, we consider the problem of optimizing a kernel function over the class of translation invariant kernels for the task of binary classification. The learning capacity of this class is invariant with respect to rotation and scaling of the features and it encompasses the set of radial kernels. We show that how translation invariant kernel functions can be embedded in a nested set of sub-classes and consider the kernel learning problem over one of these sub-classes. This allows the choice of an appropriate sub-class based on the problem at hand. We use the criterion proposed by Lanckriet et al. (2004) to obtain a functional formulation for the problem. It will be proven that the optimal kernel is a finite mixture of cosine functions. The kernel learning problem is then formulated as a semi-infinite programming (SIP) problem which is solved by a sequence of quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) sub-problems. Using the fact that the cosine kernel is of rank two, we propose a formulation of a QCQP sub-problem which does not require the kernel matrices to be loaded into memory, making the method applicable to large-scale problems. We also address the issue of including other classes of kernels, such as individual kernels and isotropic Gaussian kernels, in the learning process. Another interesting feature of the proposed method is that the optimal classifier has an expansion in terms of the number of cosine kernels, instead of support vectors, leading to a remarkable speedup at run-time. As a by-product, we also generalize the kernel trick to complex-valued kernel functions. Our experiments on artificial and real-world benchmark data sets, including the USPS and the MNIST digit recognition data sets, show the usefulness of the proposed method.

AB Dynamic Binary Instrumentation (DBI) is a core technology for building debugging and profiling tools for application executables. Most state-of-the-art DBI systems have focused on the same instruction set architecture (ISA) where the guest binary and the host binary have the same ISA. It is uncommon to have a cross-ISA DBI system, such as a system that instruments ARM executables to run on x86 machines. We believe cross-ISA DBI systems are increasingly more important, since ARM executables could be more productively analyzed on x86 based machines such as commonly available PCs and servers.
   In this paper, we present DBILL, a cross-ISA and retargetable dynamic binary instrumentation framework that builds on both QEMU and LLVM. The DBILL framework enables LLVM-based static instrumentation tools to become DBI ready, and deployable to different target architectures. Using address sanitizer and memory sanitizer as implementation examples, we show DBILL is an efficient, versatile and easy to use cross-ISA retargetable DBI framework.

By using gestures we can convey instructions to the machine (computer) or commands to a robots. This is known as Human machine interaction (Human computer interaction (HCI). Hand gestures are an ideal way of exchanging information between human and computer, robots, or any other device. In this paper we are calculating skeleton of the hand by using distance transformation technique and are using for recognition instead of the entire hand, because of its robust nature against translation, rotation and scaling. Skeleton is computed for each and every hand posture in the entire hand motion and superimposed on a single image called as Dynamic Signature of the particular gesture type. Gesture is recognized by using the Image Euclidean distance measure by comparing the current Dynamic Signature of the particular gesture with the gesture Alphabet set.

AB Most essential information contained in the electronic medical record is stored as text, and this imposes several difficulties on automated data extraction and retrieval. Natural language processing is an approach that can unlock clinical information from free texts. The proposed methodology uses the specialized natural language processor MEDLEE developed for the English language. To use this processor on Portuguese medical texts, chest X-ray reports were machine translated (MT) into English. The result of serial coupling of MT and NLP is tagged text that needs further investigation for extracting clinical findings. This experiment's objective was to investigate normal reports and reports with device description on a set of 165 chest X-ray reports. We obtained sensitivity and specificity of I and 0.71 for the first condition, and 0.97 and 0.97 for the second. The reference was formed by the opinions of two radiologists. The results of this experiment indicate the viability of extracting clinical findings from chest X-ray reports through coupling MT and NLP.

TI Learning multiview deep features from skeletal sign language videos for
   recognition
SO TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES
AB The most challenging objective in machine translation of sign language has been the machine's inability to learn interoccluding finger movements during an action process. This work addresses the problem of teaching a deep learning model to recognize differently oriented skeletal data. The multi-view 2D skeletal sign language video data is obtained using 3D motion-captured system. A total of 9 signer views were used for training the proposed network and the 6 for testing and validation. In order to obtain multi-view deep features for recognition, we proposed an end-to-end trainable multistream convolutional neural network (CNN) with late feature fusion. The fused multiview features are then inputted to a two-layer dense and a decision making softmax. The proposed CNN employs numerous layers to characterize view correspondence to generate maximally discriminative features. This study is important to understand the effects of multiview data processing by CNNs for sign language recognition in decoding joint spatial information. Further, deeper perspectives were developed into multiview processing of CNNs by applying skeletal action data.

AB Resolution of anaphors is required for any application which require Natural Language Understanding (NLU) such as Information Extraction, Conversation Analysis, Opinion Mining, Machine Translation etc. The growth of social media platforms such as twitter, facebook for communication between people has led to the creation of huge user generated data different from the normal text data. This is leading to the development of a new challenge and perspective in language technology research. Thus there is great need to develop applications such as Anaphora resolution, co-reference resolution which can be used for the development of NLU systems. This shared task is on Anaphora resolution from the microblog text from Twitter for languages such as Hindi, Tamil and Malayalam (Indian Languages). Also we gave data from English which can be used as resource rich language, if one wants to take Indian languages as resources poor language. There were six registered groups who took data for development and testing but only one group submitted the run. They have used Deep learning for analysis.

The formal analysis focuses on one component of the system, namely the table-driven software controller which drives the dialysis cycle and deals with error management. The analysis provided evidence of the verification of risk control measures relating to the software component. The paper describes the productive dialogue between the developers of the device, who had no experience or knowledge of formal methods, and an analyst who had experience of using the formal analysis tools. There were two aspects to this dialogue. The first concerned the translation of safety requirements so that they preserved the meaning of the requirement. The second involved understanding the relationship between the software component under analysis and the broader concern of the system as a whole. The paper focuses on the process, highlighting how the team recognised the advantages over a more traditional testing approach.

TI Pseudo nucleotide composition or PseKNC: an effective formulation for
   analyzing genomic sequences
SO MOLECULAR BIOSYSTEMS
AB With the avalanche of DNA/RNA sequences generated in the post-genomic age, it is urgent to develop automated methods for analyzing the relationship between the sequences and their functions. Towards this goal, a series of sequence-based methods have been proposed and applied to analyze various character-unknown DNA/RNA sequences in order for in-depth understanding their action mechanisms and processes. Compared with the classical sequence-based methods, the pseudo nucleotide composition or PseKNC approach developed very recently has the following advantages: (1) it can convert length-different DNA/RNA sequences into dimension-fixed digital vectors that can be directly handled by all the existing machine-learning algorithms or operation engines; (2) it can contain the desired features and properties according to the selection or definition of users; (3) it can cover considerable sequence pattern information, both local and global. This minireview is focused on the concept of pseudo nucleotide composition, its development and applications.

AB Mapping a binary function taken from a compiled binary to the same function in the original source code has many security applications, such as discovering reused free open source code in malware binaries. To facilitate malware analysis, we present BINDEEP, a framework that learns the semantic relationships among binary functions based on assembly code. It also learns semantic information about the source functions in order to carry out function matching. We demonstrate how BINDEEP can be applied to fingerprint the origin of functions in malware binaries, and then benchmark its performance against that of five competing systems (i.e., RESOURCE, the Binary Analysis Tool (BAT), BinPro, Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), and FOSSIL). The findings show that BINDEEP is more robust and achieves significant improvement over these existing systems when confronted with changes introduced by code transformation methods or the use of different compilers and optimization levels. Furthermore, BINDEEP is able to discover source packages in malware binaries, such as Zeus and Citadel, that match those listed in existing security reports.

In its results, the text does not exceed the 3rd chapter of the book of M.A. Aiserman, E.M. Braverman and L.I. Rozonoer, The Method of Potential Functions in Machine Learning Theory, Physical-Mathematical State Publishing, Moscow (1970) - a chapter dedicated to the choice of a potential function. I.B. Muchnik argued the need for the presentation of the results of this chapter from the long-published book by the fact that these results were never translated into English and remained not well known. Besides this, the accents in the exposition of this presentation have significantly shifted from the exposition given in the book - here only complexity is discussed, and concrete problems of machine learning theory are not touched upon at all. The concept of compositional complexity proves useful for the choice of a potential function, and this is essentially demonstrated in the 3rd chapter of the cited book. Benjamin Rozonoer translated, and Maxim Braverman edited the translation of this section of the book (c.f. list of main publications).

AB Word sense disambiguation as a central research topic in natural language processing can promote the development of many applications such as information retrieval, speech synthesis, machine translation, summarization and question answering. Previous approaches can be grouped into three categories: supervised, unsupervised and knowledge-based. The accuracy of supervised methods is the highest, but they suffer from knowledge acquisition bottleneck. Unsupervised method can avoid knowledge acquisition bottleneck, but its effect is not satisfactory. With the built-up of large-scale knowledge, knowledge-based approach has attracted more and more attention. This paper introduces a new context weighting method, and based on which proposes a novel semi-supervised approach for word sense disambiguation. The significant contribution of our method is that thesaurus and machine learning techniques are integrated in word sense disambiguation. Compared with the state of the art on the test data of the English all words disambiguation task in Sensaval-3, our method yields obvious improvements over existing methods in nouns, adjectives and verbs disambiguation.

TI The long journey of actin and actin-associated proteins from genes to
   polysomes
SO CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR LIFE SCIENCES
AB During gene expression, multiple regulatory steps make sure that alterations of chromatin structure are synchronized with RNA synthesis, co-transcriptional assembly of ribonucleoprotein complexes, transport to the cytoplasm and localized translation. These events are controlled by large multiprotein complexes commonly referred to as molecular machines, which are specialized and at the same time display a highly dynamic protein composition. The crosstalk between these molecular machines is essential for efficient RNA biogenesis. Actin has been recently proposed to be an important factor throughout the entire RNA biogenesis pathway as a component of chromatin remodeling complexes, associated with all eukaryotic RNA polymerases as well as precursor and mature ribonucleoprotein complexes. The aim of this review is to present evidence on the involvement of actin and actin-associated proteins in RNA biogenesis and propose integrative models supporting the view that actin facilitates coordination of the different steps in gene expression.

TI A portrait of facial recognition: Tracing a history of a statistical way
   of seeing
SO PHILOSOPHY OF PHOTOGRAPHY
AB Automated facial recognition methods have become widely used as a way to ascertain the identity of individuals. Yet the methods by which facial recognition technologies (FRT) operate - the machinic performance of the perception of the human face - are often invisible to those under their gaze. This article investigates the machinic perception of the face through an FRT method known as eigenface, in order to both reveal and problematize the ways of seeing that underlie it. As part of its algorithmic processes, eigenface produces an image. This image can be understood as a portrait of machine recognition, making visible the processes through which the algorithm performs recognition and 'sees' the human face. The eigenface portrait reveals a way of seeing that is based on statistical processes of pattern recognition. An analogue antecedent of this application of statistics to the recognition of facial images can be found in the composite portrait. Through a dialectical discussion of composite portraiture in multiple disciplinary fields ranging from sociology to philosophy and the visual arts, this article experiments with providing a cultural and social translation of machine processes of visual perception. The discussion shifts the focus of enquiry towards the aesthetics of the algorithmic process in order to provide an entry point for critique and a possible reimagination on algorithmic knowledge production.

TI A Novel Genetic Simulated Annealing Algorithm for No-wait Hybrid
   Flowshop Problem with Unrelated Parallel Machines
SO ISIJ INTERNATIONAL
AB This paper studies the problem of scheduling N jobs in a hybrid flowshop with unrelated parallel machines at each stage. Considering the practical application of the presented problem, no-wait constraints and the objective function of total flowtime are included in the scheduling problem. A mathematical model is constructed and a novel genetic simulated annealing algorithm so-called GSAA are developed to solve this problem. In the algorithm, firstly a modified NEH algorithm is proposed to obtain the initial population. A two-dimensional matrix encoding scheme for scheduling solutions is designed and an insertion-translation approach are employed for decoding in order to meet no-wait constraints. Afterwards, to avoid GA premature and enhance search ability, an adaptive adjustment strategy is imposed on the crossover and mutation operators. In addition, a SA procedure is implemented for some better individuals from the GA solutions to complete re-optimization, where five neighborhood search structures are constructed including job based exchange, gene based exchange, gene based insertion, job based mutation, and gene based mutation. Finally, various simulation experiments in two scales of small-medium and large are established. Computational results show that the presented algorithm performs much more effectively compared with several heuristic algorithms reported in the literature.

TI Sequence-To-Sequence Neural Networks Inference on Embedded Processors
   Using Dynamic Beam Search
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Sequence-to-sequence deep neural networks have become the state of the art for a variety of machine learning applications, ranging from neural machine translation (NMT) to speech recognition. Many mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) applications would benefit from the ability of performing sequence-to-sequence inference directly in embedded devices, thereby reducing the amount of raw data transmitted to the cloud, and obtaining benefits in terms of response latency, energy consumption and security. However, due to the high computational complexity of these models, specific optimization techniques are needed to achieve acceptable performance and energy consumption on single-core embedded processors. In this paper, we present a new optimization technique called dynamic beam search, in which the inference complexity is tuned to the difficulty of the processed input sequence at runtime. Results based on measurements on a real embedded device, and on three state-of-the-art deep learning models, show that our method is able to reduce the inference time and energy by up to 25% without loss of accuracy.

AB The regularity of devastating cyber-attacks has made cybersecurity a grand societal challenge. Many cybersecurity professionals are closely examining the international Dark Web to proactively pinpoint potential cyber threats. Despite its potential, the Dark Web contains hundreds of thousands of non-English posts. While machine translation is the prevailing approach to process non-English text, applying MT on hacker forum text results in mistranslations. In this study, we draw upon Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Cross-Lingual Knowledge Transfer (CLKT), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) principles to design a novel Adversarial CLKT (A-CLKT) approach. A-CLKT operates on untranslated text to retain the original semantics of the language and leverages the collective knowledge about cyber threats across languages to create a language invariant representation without any manual feature engineering or external resources. Three experiments demonstrate how A-CLKT outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning, deep learning, and CLKT algorithms in identifying cyber-threats in French and Russian forums.

AB The majority of activities performed by humans are done through language, whether communicated directly or reported using natural language. As technology is increasingly making the methods and platforms on which we communicate ever more accessible, there is a great need to understand the languages we use to communicate. By combining the power of artificial intelligence, computational linguistics and computer science, natural language processing (NLP) helps machines read text by simulating the human ability to understand language. Part-of-speech tagging (POS Tagging) is done as a pre-requisite to simplify a lot of different NLP applications like question answering, speech recognition, machine translation, and so on. Here, we attempt a comparison between part-of-speech taggers in Malayalam using decision tree algorithm and bi-directional long short term memory (BLSTM). The experiments presented in this paper use two corpora, one of 29076 sentences and the other of 500 sentences for performance evaluation. The experiments demonstrate the potential of architectural choice of BLSTM-based tagger over conventional decision tree-based tagging in Malayalam.

TI Information fusion to detect and classify pedestrians using invariant

SO INFORMATION FUSION
AB A novel approach to detect pedestrians and to classify them according to their moving direction and relative speed is presented in this paper. This work focuses on the recognition of pedestrian lateral movements, namely: walking and running in both directions, as well as no movement. The perception of the environment is performed through a lidar sensor and an infrared camera. Both sensor signals are fused to determine regions of interest in the video data. The classification of these regions is based on the extraction of 2D translation invariant features, which are constructed by integrating over the transformation group. Special polynomial kernel functions are defined in order to obtain a good separability between the classes. Support vector machine classifiers are used in different configurations to classify the invariants. The proposed approach was evaluated offline considering fixed sensors. Results obtained based on real traffic scenes demonstrate very good detection and classification rates. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A hardware Trojan (HT) is a malicious modification of the design done by a rogue employee or a malicious foundry to leak secret information, create a backdoor for attackers, alter functionality, degrade performance and even halt the system. In Black-hat high-level synthesis (HLS) (Pilato et al., 2019), the authors have introduced a possibility of HTs insertion in the register transfer level (RTL) design by the HLS tool itself. Specifically, degradation attack (DA), battery exhaustion (BE) attack, and downgrade attack (DG) have been proposed in that work. In this study, we show how all three HTs inserted by Pilato et al. (2019) can be detected using a C-to-RTL equivalence checking framework. We have assumed that both the input C code and the Trojan-infected RTL code are available for our analysis. Specifically, our framework extracts an RTL-level finite-state machine with datapaths (RTL-FSMDs) from the HLS-generated RTL. During finite-state machine with datapath (FSMD) construction, a BE attack can be identified. Our proposed method then compares the FSMD of the input C code with the RTL-FSMD to identify the DA and the DG. The experimental results confirm the detection of HTs of the black-hat HLS tool.

AB Parts-of-speech (POS) tagging plays an important role in the field of natural language processing (NLP), such as-retrieval of information, machine translation, spelling check, language processing, sentiment analysis, and so on. Many works have been done for Bangla part-of-speech (POS) tagging using machine learning but the result does not enough. It is a matter of fact that not even a single effective research work has been conducted for Bangla POS tagging using deep learning due to a lack of data scarcity. Considering that our context is the Bangla POS tagging employing both machine learning and deep learning approach. In our research, we have compared some well-known supervised POS tagging approaches (Brill, HMM, unigram, bigram, trigram, and recurrent neural network) for Bangla languages. The supervised POS tagging technique requires a large number of data set to tag accurately. That is why we have used a large number of data set for POS tagging of Bangla languages, which will accept a raw Bangla text to produce a Bangla POS tagged output that can be directly used for other NLP applications. After the comparison, we have found the best tagging approach in terms of performance. Bangla is an inflectional language. That is why it is a very much tough job for grammatical categories of Bangla language. But our proposed model works well for Bangla languages.

TI Transformation Invariant Real-time Recognition of Indian Sign Language

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEXT-GENERATION COMPUTING
AB Sign Language Recognition (SLR) is immerging as current area of research in the field of machine learning. SLR system recognizes gestures of sign language and converts them into text/voice thus making the communication possible between deaf and ordinary people. Acceptable performance of such system demands invariance of the output with respect to certain transformations of the input. In this paper, we introduce the real time hand gesture recognition system for Indian Sign Language (ISL). In order to obtain very high recognition accuracy, we propose a hybrid feature vector by combining shape oriented features like Fourier Descriptors and region oriented features like Hu Moments & Zernike Moments. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained using feature vectors of images of training dataset. During experiment it is found that the proposed hybrid feature vector enhanced the performance of the system by compactly representing the fundamentals of invariance with respect transformation like scaling, translation and rotation. Being invariant with respect to transformation, system is easy to use and achieved a recognition rate of 95.79%.

AB Latent print examinations involve a process by which a latent print, often recovered from a crime scene, is compared against a known standard or sets of standard prints. Despite advances in automatic fingerprint recognition, latent prints are still examined by human expert primarily due to the poor image quality of latent prints. The aim of the present study is to better understand the perceptual and cognitive processes of fingerprint practices as implicit expertise. Our approach is to collect fine-grained gaze data from fingerprint experts when they conduct a matching task between two prints. We then rely on machine learning techniques to discover meaningful patterns from their eye movement data. As the first steps in this project, we compare gaze patterns from experts with those obtained from novices. Our results show that experts and novices generate similar overall gaze patterns. However, a deeper data analysis using machine translation reveals that experts are able to identify more corresponding areas between two prints within a short period of time.

AB The recent popularity of deep neural networks (DNNs) has generated considerable research interest in performing DNN-related computation efficiently. However, the primary focus is usually very narrow and limited to (i) inference - i.e. how to efficiently execute already trained models and (ii) image classification networks as the primary benchmark for evaluation.
   Our primary goal in this work is to break this myopic view by (i) proposing a new benchmark suite for DNN training, called TBD1, which comprises a representative set of eight DNN models and covers six major machine learning applications: image classification, machine translation, speech recognition, object detection, adversarial networks, reinforcement learning, and (ii) performing an extensive performance analysis of these models on three major deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, MXNet, CNTK) across different hardware configurations (single-GPU, multi-GPU, and multi-machine). We present a new toolchain for performance analysis for these models that combines the targeted usage of existing performance analysis tools, careful selection of performance metrics, and methodologies to analyze the results. We also build a new set of tools for memory profiling in three major frameworks. These tools can shed light on precisely how much memory is consumed by different data structures (weights, activations, gradients, workspace) in DNN training. Using our tools and methodologies, we make several important observations and recommendations on where future DNN training research and optimization should be focused.

AB There is considerable geometric variability of raw castings and weldments before any machining of surfaces that assemble with other components. Consequently, considerable time often is spent identifying successful set-up adjustments at the machining fixtures for such parts in a way to ensure that every machined surface will be complete. The proposed Set-Up-Map is a point-space subset of R-6 where each of the six orthogonal coordinates correspond to one of the rigid-body displacements in three dimensional space: three translations and three rotations. Any point within the Set-Up-Map (S-Map) corresponds to a small body displacement (SBD) of the part that satisfies the condition that each feature will lie within its associated tolerance zone after machining. S-Maps are derived from previous work on Tolerance Maps (c) (T-Maps), which represent feature deviations allowed by a given tolerance zone. Each raw casting or weldment is scanned, and the point-cloud data fitted to individual features, to determine how much each to-be-machined (TBM) feature deviates from nominal specifications. Each local T-Map is formed from a library, then shifted to be centered on its corresponding scanned feature on each casting; it becomes a local S-Map primitive. Each of these local S-Maps is then transformed to a single global reference frame. The intersection of these S-Map primitives in the global frame gives the allowable small body displacements that satisfy the positioning requirements for all TBM features. Since T Maps are convex objects, a half-space intersection method is used to generate an S-Map. Any point within the S-Map represents a viable small body displacement specific to the global coordinate system established on the part. In the case that as-cast or as-welded features deviate from what is acceptable, the S-Map will be the empty set. Consequently, in addition to reducing the time for setup in a fixture, S-Maps can serve as a valuable diagnostic to determine that a part should be either scrapped or reworked.

TI Accurately predicting nitrosylated tyrosine sites using probabilistic
   sequence information
SO GENE
AB Post-translational modification (PTM) is defined as the enzymatic changes of proteins after the translation process in protein biosynthesis. Nitrotyrosine, which is one of the most important modifications of proteins, is interceded by the active nitrogen molecule. It is known to be associated with different diseases including autoimmune diseases characterized by chronic inflammation and cell damage. Currently, nitrotyrosine sites are identified using experimental approaches which are laborious and costly. In this study, we propose a new ma-chine learning method called PredNitro to accurately predict nitrotyrosine sites. To build PredNitro, we use sequence coupling information from the neighboring amino acids of tyrosine residues along with a support vector machine as our classification technique.Our results demonstrates that PredNitro achieves 98.0% accuracy with more than 0.96 MCC and 0.99 AUC in both 5-fold cross-validation and jackknife cross-validation tests which are significantly better than those reported in previous studies. PredNitro is publicly available as an online predictor at: http://103.99.176.239/PredNitro.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
AB One of the pillar generative machine learning approaches in time series data study and analysis is the hidden Markov model (HMM). Early research focused on the speech recognition application of the model with later expansion into numerous fields, including video classification, action recognition, and text translation. The recently developed generalized Dirichlet HMMs have proven efficient in proportional sequential data modeling. As such, we focus on investigating a maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework for the inference of its parameters. The proposed approach differs from the widely deployed Baum-Welch through the placement of priors that regularizes the estimation process. A feature selection paradigm is also integrated simultaneously in the algorithm. For validation, we apply our proposed approach in the classification of dynamic textures and the recognition of infrared actions.

TI Deep learning systems as complex networks
SO JOURNAL OF COMPLEX NETWORKS
AB Thanks to the availability of large scale digital datasets and massive amounts of computational power, deep learning algorithms can learn representations of data by exploiting multiple levels of abstraction. These machine-learning methods have greatly improved the state-of-the-art in many challenging cognitive tasks, such as visual object recognition, speech processing, natural language understanding and automatic translation. In particular, one class of deep learning models, known as deep belief networks (DBNs), can discover intricate statistical structure in large datasets in a completely unsupervised fashion, by learning a generative model of the data using Hebbian-like learning mechanisms. Although these self-organizing systems can be conveniently formalized within the framework of statistical mechanics, their internal functioning remains opaque, because their emergent dynamics cannot be solved analytically. In this article, we propose to study DBNs using techniques commonly employed in the study of complex networks, in order to gain some insights into the structural and functional properties of the computational graph resulting from the learning process.

The smart community contains various refined smart scenarios, involving various smart hardware and smart system ecological chain construction. This paper analyze the smart community security monitoring based on artificial intelligence and improved machine learning algorithm. In the deployment of urban surveillance, a smart camera embedded with face recognition technology can transmit facial feature data to a computer center database through a computer network while taking a suspicious portrait, and the system can automatically integrate the facial database of fugitives compared quickly and accurately. Simulation results show that the artificial intelligence mode can effectively improve the accuracy of facial recognition, and at the same time, it is effective for dynamic image monitoring of moving objects. The size of the detected interest point will be reduced by more than 30%, which reduces the calculation amount to some extent and improves the decision efficiency.

AB Vision based robot motion control (Visual Servoing) is a challenging research direction in utilizing vision information to control the robot motion. In this work, we successfully controlled the real-time pose of an end-effector based on a hand gesture detector that we trained with acquired training data in the lab environment. Meanwhile, a machine learning model for hand "language translation based on convolutional neural network is proposed and utilized in this paper. SSD is the suggested meta architecture that uses single feed-forward convolutional network for straightly predicting categories. The proposed model is evaluated on Tensorflow platform along with Pascal VOC 2012. In addition, an image-based vision servoing system based on Lyapunov's theory is developed to control velocities of the robot's joints. In the experimentation, the integration of the above systems and MobileNet network as a convolutional feature extractor shows good performance in identification, tracking and motion control of the robot. The model achieved 98% mAP and 0.8 for Total-loss while visual servoing also demonstrated good performance during experimentation.

AB Specular surfaces inspection remains a delicate task within the automatic control of products made by plastic plating. These objects are of very varied shape and their surface is highly reflective acting like a mirror. This paper presents steps to follow in order to detect geometric aspect surface defects on objects made by plastic plating. The projection of a binary fringes pattern is used and enables to reveal the defects near the transition between a dark fringe and a bright fringe. Indeed, the surface imperfections provoke important light rays deviations. By moving this dynamic lighting, and thanks to a saturated camera, the system brings an aspect image where the defects appear very contrasted on a dark background. A simple image processing algorithm is then applied leading to a very efficient segmentation. To obtain such resulting images, the translation step, the duty cycle and also the number of images are constraint. This article finally shows how to adjust these parameters according to the various sizes of defect and to the objects shape.

TI A Study of the Effects of Stemming Strategies on Arabic Document
   Classification
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Stemming is one of the most effective techniques, which has been adopted in many applications, such as machine learning, machine translation, document classification (DC), information retrieval, and natural language processing. The stemming technique is meant to be applied during the classification of documents to reduce the high dimensionality of the feature space, which, in turn, raises the functioning of the classification system, particularly with extreme modulated language, for instance, Arabic language. This paper aims to study the impact of stemming techniques, namely Information Science Research Institute (ISRI), Tashaphyne, and ARLStem on Arabic DC. The classification algorithms, namely Naive Bayesian (NB), support vector machine (SVM), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN), are used in this paper. In addition, the chi-square feature selection is used to select the most relevant features. Experiments are conducted on CNN Arabic corpus, which is collected from Arabic websites to assess the performance of the classification system. In order to evaluate the classifiers, the K-fold cross-validation method and Micro-F1 are used. Findings of this paper indicate that the ARLStem outperforms the ISRI and Tashaphyne stemmers. The outcomes clearly showed the effectiveness of the SVM over the KNN and NB classifiers, which achieved 94.64% Micro-F1 value when using the ARLStem stemmer.

TI A new machine learning model based on the broad learning system and
   wavelets
SO ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB In this work, we present a new neural network named WAvelet-Based Broad LEarning System (WABBLES). WABBLES is based on the flat structure of the broad learning system. Such structure offers an alternative to deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks. The WABBLES network uses multiresolution analysis to look for subtle, yet important features from the input data for a better classification performance. WABBLES uses wavelets to map the input signal, to obtain more relevant features from it. This is achieved by autonomously learning and adjusting the dilation and translation parameters of a wavelet, which control its shape. In this way, the resulting mapping nodes have a better representation of the most important features for the classification problem. The construction of the model is described here, along with special considerations and algorithms involved. Finally, the proposed model is tested using a database of synthetic astronomical data and a benchmark dataset called the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset (Original). The conducted experiments provide a comparison between the proposed model and several machine learning algorithms with different performance metrics applied to the context of exoplanet identification and breast cancer detection. Our results confirm that the WABBLES model obtains superior accuracy and F-score percentages than the other models.

TI Design and experimental verification of novel six-degree-of freedom
   geometric error measurement system for linear stage
SO OPTICS AND LASERS IN ENGINEERING
AB In this study, a novel and simple measurement system for simultaneously measuring the geometric errors in six degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) for a moving linear stage of a machine tool is designed and validated. Compared to laser interferometer and laser Doppler systems, this new measurement system is less expensive and capable of multiple functions. The proposed measurement system comprises an optics module, composed of two reflectors and two cubic beam splitters; a sensing module, composed of three two-dimensional position sensitive detectors (PSDs); and a helium-neon (He-Ne) laser. Using skew-ray tracing and a first-order Taylor series expansion, the 6-DOF geometric errors of the moving linear stage, which include translation and rotation errors, are analyzed. A laboratory prototype system is built to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed measurement system. The experimental results show that the displacement uncertainty and the angular uncertainty of the proposed measurement system are less than 1.2 mu m and 0.4", respectively. Compared with the Renishaw laser interferometer XL-80 laser system, the translational accuracy and the rotational accuracy of the proposed measurement system are less than +/- 1 mu m and +/- 0.2", respectively, when the linear stage travels 6 mm.

TI Support vector learning for fuzzy rule-based classification systems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS
AB To design a fuzzy rule-based classification system (fuzzy classifier) with good generalization ability in a high dimensional feature space has been an active research topic for a long time. As a powerful machine learning approach for pattern recognition problems, support vector machine (SVM) is known to have good generalization ability. More importantly, an SVM can work very well on a high- (or even infinite) dimensional feature space. This paper investigates the connection between fuzzy classifiers and kernel machines, establishes a link between fuzzy rules and kernels, and proposes a learning algorithm for fuzzy classifiers. We first show that a fuzzy classifier implicitly defines a translation invariant kernel under the assumption that all membership functions associated with the same input variable are generated from location transformation of a reference function. Fuzzy inference on the IF-part of a fuzzy rule can be viewed as evaluating the kernel function. The kernel function is then proven to be a Mercer kernel if the reference functions meet certain spectral requirement. The corresponding fuzzy classifier is named positive definite fuzzy classifier (PDFC). A PDFC can be built from the given training samples based on a support vector learning approach with the IF-part fuzzy rules given by the support vectors. Since the learning process minimizes an upper bound on the expected risk (expected prediction error) instead of the empirical risk (training error), the resulting PDFC usually has good generalization. Moreover, because of the sparsity properties of the SVMs, the number of fuzzy rules is irrelevant to the dimension of input space. In this sense, we avoid the "curse of dimensionality." Finally, PDFCs with different reference functions are constructed using the support vector learning approach. The performance of the PDFCs is illustrated by extensive experimental results. Comparisons with other methods are also provided.

CY MAR 09-11, 2011
CL Newport Beach, CA
AB As virtualization becomes a key technique for supporting cloud computing, much effort has been made to reduce virtualization overhead, so a virtualized system can match its native performance. One major overhead is due to memory or page table virtualization. Conventional virtual machines rely on a shadow mechanism to manage page tables, where a shadow page table maintained by the VMM (Virtual Machine Monitor) maps virtual addresses to machine addresses while a guest maintains its own virtual to physical page table. This shadow mechanism will result in expensive VM exits whenever there is a page fault that requires synchronization between the two page tables. To avoid this cost, both Intel and AMD provide hardware assists, EPT (extended page table) and NPT (nested page table), to facilitate address translation. With the hardware assists, the MMU (Memory Management Unit) maintains an ordinary guest page table that translates virtual addresses to guest physical addresses. In addition, the extended page table as provided by EPT translates from guest physical addresses to host physical or machine addresses. NPT works in a similar style. With EPT or NPT, a guest page fault can be handled by the guest itself without triggering VM exits. However, the hardware assists do have their disadvantage compared to the conventional shadow mechanism - the page walk yields more memory accesses and thus longer latency. Our experimental results show that neither hardware-assisted paging (HAP) nor shadow paging (SP) can be a definite winner. Despite the fact that in over half of the cases, there is no noticeable gap between the two mechanisms, an up to 34% performance gap exists for a few benchmarks. We propose a dynamic switching mechanism that monitors TLB misses and guest page faults on the fly, and dynamically switches between the two paging modes. Our experiments show that this new mechanism can match and, sometimes, even beat the better performance of HAP and SP.

SO NEURAL GENERATION AND TRANSLATION
CT 4th Workshop on Neural Generation and Translation
CY JUL 05-10, 2020
CL ELECTR NETWORK
AB We propose a novel procedure for training multiple Transformers with tied parameters which compresses multiple models into one enabling the dynamic choice of the number of encoder and decoder layers during decoding. In training an encoder-decoder model, typically, the output of the last layer of the N-layer encoder is fed to the M-layer decoder, and the output of the last decoder layer is used to compute loss. Instead, our method computes a single loss consisting of N x M losses, where each loss is computed from the output of one of the M decoder layers connected to one of the N encoder layers. Such a model subsumes N x M models with different number of encoder and decoder layers, and can be used for decoding with fewer than the maximum number of encoder and decoder layers. Given our flexible tied model, we also address to a-priori selection of the number of encoder and decoder layers for faster decoding, and explore recurrent stacking of layers and knowledge distillation for model compression. We present a cost-benefit analysis of applying the proposed approaches for neural machine translation and show that they reduce decoding costs while preserving translation quality.

TI Improved chamfer matching method for surface mount component positioning
SO IET IMAGE PROCESSING
AB This study is concerned with the surface mount component positioning problem and an improved chamfer matching method based on iterative position and rotation angle estimation approach is proposed. Instead of performing matching of the image with different pre-specified angle templates pixel by pixel, as does in traditional chamfer matching methods, the gradient information of the distance transform image is incorporated into the chamfer matching method and reduced computational cost of the method is achieved. The iterative formulas to update the translation and rotation angle are derived by reference to the characteristic of rigid body motion. The criterions of search region establishment, seed point selection and terminal conditions are given. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by applying the method to component positioning with actual captured images.

TI Permutation Invariant Graph-to-Sequence Model for Template-Free
   Retrosynthesis and Reaction Prediction
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING
AB Synthesis planning and reaction outcome prediction are two fundamental problems in computer-aided organic chemistry for which a variety of data-driven approaches have emerged. Natural language approaches that model each problem as a SMILES-to-SMILES translation lead to a simple end-to-end formulation, reduce the need for data preprocessing, and enable the use of well-optimized machine translation model architectures. However, SMILES representations are not efficient for capturing information about molecular structures, as evidenced by the success of SMILES augmentation to boost empirical performance. Here, we describe a novel Graph2SMILES model that combines the power of Transformer models for text generation with the permutation invariance of molecular graph encoders that mitigates the need for input data augmentation. In our encoder, a directed message passing neural network (D-MPNN) captures local chemical environments, and the global attention encoder allows for long-range and intermolecular interactions, enhanced by graph-aware positional embedding. As an end-to-end architecture, Graph2SMILES can be used as a drop-in replacement for the Transformer in any task involving molecule(s)-to-molecule(s) transformations, which we empirically demonstrate leads to improved performance on existing benchmarks for both retrosynthesis and reaction outcome prediction.

TI Hybrid C-11-MET PET/MRI Combined With "Machine Learning" in Glioma
   Diagnosis According to the Revised Glioma WHO Classification 2016
SO CLINICAL NUCLEAR MEDICINE
AB Purpose With the advent of the revised WHO classification from 2016, molecular features, including isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation have become important in glioma subtyping. This pilot trial analyzed the potential for C-11-methionine (MET) PET/MRI in classifying glioma according to the revised WHO classification using a machine learning model. Methods Patients with newly diagnosed WHO grade II-IV glioma underwent preoperative MET-PET/MRI imaging. Patients were retrospectively divided into four groups: IDH wild-type glioblastoma (GBM), IDH wild-type grade II/III glioma (GII/III-IDHwt), IDH mutant grade II/III glioma with codeletion of 1p19q (GII/III-IDHmut1p19qcod) or without 1p19q-codeletion (GII/III-IDHmut1p19qnc). Within each group, the maximum tumor-to-brain-ratio (TBRmax) of MET-uptake was calculated. To gain generalizable implications from our data, we made use of a machine learning algorithm based on a development and validation subcohort. A support vector machine model was fit to the development subcohort and evaluated on the validation subcohort. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis served as metric to assess model performance. Results Of a total of 259 patients, 39 patients met the inclusion criteria. TBRmax was highest in the GBM cohort (TBRmax 3.83 +/- 1.30) and significantly higher (P = 0.004) compared to GII/III-IDHmut1p19qnc group, where TBRmax was lowest (TBRmax 2.05 +/- 0.94). ROC analysis showed poor AUC for glioma subtyping (AUC 0.62) and high AUC of 0.79 for predicting IDH status. In the GII/III-IDHmut1p19qcod group, TBR values were slightly higher than in the IDHmut1p19qnc group. Conclusions MET-PET/MRI imaging in pre-operatively classifying glioma entities appears useful for the assessment of IDH status. However, a larger trial is needed prior to translation into the clinical routine.

AB Code comments can effectively help developers comprehend programs. However, it is a challenging and time consuming task to write good comments for source code. Therefore, automatic generation of code comments is a promising research direction. Recently, researchers have leveraged neural machine translation to generate comments from source code and achieved impressive results. Another line of work has tried to exploit information retrieval (IR) techniques and showed excellent performance improvement on this task. However, current retrieval-based methods usually involve complex retrieval and editing operations, which are difficult to implement. To tackle the problems, we propose kNN-Transformer, a simple end-to-end retrieval-based code comment generation method. Our method combines a simple nearest neighbor retrieval module and a powerful transformer-based model. When generating each token, the retrieval module estimates a probability distribution depending on the current translation context rather than obtaining the retrieved samples in advance. The experiment results on four widely used public datasets (two Java datasets and two Python datasets) demonstrate that our method outperforms all the baselines, and our kNN retrieval module brings significant improvement when similar code snippets are available.

TI Technology for subtitling: a 360-degree turn
SO HERMENEUS
AB Subtitling has become one of the most important audiovisual translation modes and cannot be understood outside the context of the technology that makes it possible. New audiovisual media are appearing, such as 360 degrees videos, and the necessity of subtitling this type of content to make it accessible is emerging. In this article, an updated review of current subtitling technology is presented to contextualise the study. Then, a review of main immersive environments (3D, augmented reality and virtual reality) and their implications for subtitling has also been introduced. The focus of the study is on virtual reality and, therefore, the main challenges of subtitling 360 degrees content are presented. To respond to the needs of subtitling this type of content, a prototype version of a subtitle editor has been developed and presented to twenty-seven professional subtitlers who have tested the tool and reported the correspondent feedback on usability and preferences. This study has proven the importance of carrying out usability tests with end users when developing specific software. Finally, the challenges faced by subtitlers in new audiovisual media such as 360 degrees content are presented.

AB The primary obstacle to developing technologies for low-resource languages is the lack of usable data. In this paper, we report the adoption and deployment of 4 technology-driven methods of data collection for Gondi, a low-resource vulnerable language spoken by around 2.3 million tribal people in south and central India. In the process of data collection, we also help in its revival by expanding access to information in Gondi through the creation of linguistic resources that can be used by the community, such as a dictionary, children's stories, an app with Gondi content from multiple sources and an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) based mass awareness platform. At the end of these interventions, we collected a little less than 12,000 translated words and/or sentences and identified more than 650 community members whose help can be solicited for future translation efforts. The larger goal of the project is collecting enough data in Gondi to build and deploy viable language technologies like machine translation and speech to text systems that can help take the language onto the internet.

TI Novel Transformer Networks for Improved Sequence Labeling in genomics
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND BIOINFORMATICS
AB In genomics, a wide range of machine learning methodologies have been investigated to annotate biological sequences for positions of interest such as transcription start sites, translation initiation sites, methylation sites, splice sites and promoter start sites. In recent years, this area has been dominated by convolutional neural networks, which typically outperform previously-designed methods as a result of automated scanning for influential sequence motifs. However, those architectures do not allow for the efficient processing of the full genomic sequence. As an improvement, we introduce transformer architectures for whole genome sequence labeling tasks. We show that these architectures, recently introduced for natural language processing, are better suited for processing and annotating long DNA sequences. We apply existing networks and introduce an optimized method for the calculation of attention from input nucleotides. To demonstrate this, we evaluate our architecture on several sequence labeling tasks, and find it to achieve state-of-the-art performances when comparing it to specialized models for the annotation of transcription start sites, translation initiation sites and 4mC methylation in E. coli.

TI Certifying the Synthesis of Heap-Manipulating Programs
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Automated deductive program synthesis promises to generate executable programs from concise specifications, along with proofs of correctness that can be independently verified using third-party tools. However, an attempt to exercise this promise using existing proof-certification frameworks reveals significant discrepancies in how proof derivations are structured for two different purposes: program synthesis and program verification. These discrepancies make it difficult to use certified verifiers to validate synthesis results, forcing one to write an ad-hoc translation procedure from synthesis proofs to correctness proofs for each verification backend.
   In this work, we address this challenge in the context of the synthesis and verification of heap-manipulating programs. We present a technique for principled translation of deductive synthesis derivations (a.k.a. source proofs) into deductive target proofs about the synthesised programs in the logics of interactive program verifiers. We showcase our technique by implementing three different certifiers for programs generated via SuSLik, a Separation Logic-based tool for automated synthesis of programs with pointers, in foundational verification frameworks embedded in Coq: Hoare Type Theory (HTT), IRIS, and Verified Software Toolchain (VST), producing concise and efficient machine-checkable proofs for characteristic synthesis benchmarks.

AB The compilation of synchronous block diagrams into sequential imperative code has been addressed in the early eighties and can now be considered as folklore. However, separate, or modular, code generation, though largely used in existing compilers and particularly in industrial ones, has never been precisely described or entirely formalized. Such a formalization is now fundamental in the long-term goal to develop a mathematically certified compiler for a synchronous language as well as in simplifying existing implementations.
   This article presents in full detail the modular compilation of synchronous block diagrams into sequential code. We consider a first-order functional language reminiscent of LUSTRE, which it extends with a general n-ary merge operator, a reset construct, and a richer notion of clocks. The clocks are used to express activation of computations in the program and are specifically taken into account during the compilation process to produce efficient imperative code. We introduce a generic machine-based intermediate language to represent transition functions, and we present a concise clock-directed translation from the source to this intermediate language. We address the target code generation phase by describing a translation from the intermediate language to JAVA and C.

TI The meniscofemoral ligaments: secondary restraints to the posterior
   drawer - Analysis of anteroposterior and rotary laxity in the intact and
   posterior-cruciate-deficient knee
SO JOURNAL OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY-BRITISH VOLUME
AB We have tested the hypothesis that the meniscofemoral ligaments make a significant contribution to resisting anteroposterior and rotatory laxity of the posterior-cruciate-ligament-deficient knee. Eight cadaver human knees were tested for anteroposterior and rotatory laxity in a materials-testing machine. The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) was then divided, followed by division of the meniscofemoral ligaments (MFLs). Laxity results were obtained for intact, PCL-deficient, and PCL-MFL-deficient knees.
   Division of the MFLs in the PCL-deficient knee increased posterior laxity between 15degrees and 90degrees of flexion. Force-displacement measurements showed that the MFLs contributed 28% to the total force resisting posterior drawer at 90degrees of flexion in the intact knee, and 70.1% in the PCL-deficient knee. There was no effect on rotatory laxity.
   This is the first study which shows a function for the MFLs as secondary restraints to posterior tibial translation. The integrity of these structures should be assessed during both imaging and arthroscopic studies of PCL-injured knees since this may affect the diagnosis and management of such injuries.

TI Oxidative Damage of Mussels Living in Seawater Enriched with Trace
   Metals, from the Viewpoint of Proteins Expression and Modification
SO TOXICS
AB The impact of metals bioaccumulation in marine organisms is a subject of intense investigation. This study was designed to determine the association between oxidative stress induced by seawater enriched with trace metals and protein synthesis using as a model the mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis. Mussels were exposed to 40 mu g/L Cu, 30 mu g/L Hg, or 100 mu g/L Cd for 5 and 15 days, and the pollution effect was evaluated by measuring established oxidative biomarkers. The results showed damage on the protein synthesis machine integrity and specifically on translation factors and ribosomal proteins expression and modifications. The exposure of mussels to all metals caused oxidative damage that was milder in the cases of Cu and Hg and more pronounced for Cd. However, after prolonged exposure of mussels to Cd (15 days), the effects receded. These changes that perturb protein biosynthesis can serve as a great tool for elucidating the mechanisms of toxicity and could be integrated in biomonitoring programs.

TI Synchronous CDMA Based on the Cyclical Translations of a CAZAC Sequence
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
AB A new scheme of synchronous CDMA is introduced in the paper. The new scheme is based on a code made by all the cyclical translations of a basic sequence having constant amplitude and white discrete spectrum. Such a code is proposed here for the first time as a code for CDMA. According to the proposed scheme, a cyclic prefix is appended to the multiplexed signal. The proposed scheme has a property that none of the known CDMA schemes has: in a multipath environment, it allows multiuser interference to become cyclic intersymbol interference. Noticeably, the memory of the finite state machine that describes the ISI model is equal to memory of the multipath channel. The main advantage of our proposed scheme is that optimal and suboptimal detectors can be obtained from detectors proposed in the past for the ISI channel, which are much easier to implement than conventional multiuser detectors of classical CDMA schemes. Another advantage of our scheme is that it leads naturally to a signal processing architecture similar to that of OFDM systems, hence based on the efficient FFT/IFFT algorithm.

TI The dorsopalmar stability of the distal radioulnar joint
SO JOURNAL OF HAND SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME
AB Sixteen fresh-frozen adult human cadaveric upper extremities were used in a biomechanical analysis of distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) stability. The relative contribution to stability of the DRUJ by the surrounding anatomic structures presumed to stabilize the joint was analyzed with respect to forearm rotation and wrist flexion and extension using a purpose-built 4-axis materials testing machine. The dominant structures stabilizing the DRUJ were the ligamentous components of the triangular fibrocartilage complex proper. The major constraint to dorsal translation of the distal ulna relative to the radius is the palmar radioulnar ligament. Palmar translation of the distal ulna relative to the radius is constrained primarily by the dorsal radioulnar ligament, with secondary constraint provided by the palmar radioulnar ligament and interosseous membrane. The ulnocarpal ligaments and extensor carpi ulnaris subsheath did not contribute significantly to DRUJ stability; however, approximately 20% of DRUJ constraint is provided by the articular contact of the radius and ulna. These relationships were consistent regardless of wrist position or degree of forearm rotation. (J Hand Surg 2000;25A: 689-699. Copyright (C) 2000 by the American Society for Surgery of the Hand).

AB In many natural language processing (NLP) tasks the same input (e.g. source sentence) can have multiple possible outputs (e.g. translations). To analyze how this ambiguity (also known as intrinsic uncertainty) shapes the distribution learned by neural sequence models we measure sentence-level uncertainty by computing the degree of overlap between references in multi-reference test sets from two different NLP tasks: machine translation (MT) and grammatical error correction (GEC). At both the sentence- and the task-level, intrinsic uncertainty has major implications for various aspects of search such as the inductive biases in beam search and the complexity of exact search. In particular, we show that well-known pathologies such as a high number of beam search errors, the inadequacy of the mode, and the drop in system performance with large beam sizes apply to tasks with high level of ambiguity such as MT but not to less uncertain tasks such as GEC. Furthermore, we propose a novel exact n-best search algorithm for neural sequence models, and show that intrinsic uncertainty affects model uncertainty as the model tends to overly spread out the probability mass for uncertain tasks and sentences.

AB Dependent types are a key feature of type systems, typically used in the context of both richly-typed programming languages and proof assistants. Control operators, which are connected with classical logic along the proof-as-program correspondence, are known to misbehave in the presence of dependent types, unless dependencies are restricted to values. We place ourselves in the context of the sequent calculus which has the ability to smoothly provide control under the form of the mu operator dual to the common let operator, as well as to smoothly support abstract machine and continuation-passing style interpretations.
   We start from the call-by-value version of the lambda mu(mu) over tilde language and design a minimal language with a value restriction and a type system that includes a list of explicit dependencies and maintains type safety. We then show how to relax the value restriction and introduce delimited continuations to directly prove the consistency by means of a continuation-passing-style translation. Finally, we relate our calculus to a similar system by Lepigre [19], and present a methodology to transfer properties from this system to our own.

AB This paper describes how to use conventional parser generation tools for the development of JSON processing applications. According to the resulting grammar-driven development approach, JSON processing applications are architected as syntax-directed translators. Thus, the core part of these components can be described in terms of translation schemata and can be automatically generated by using suitable parser generators. It makes it possible to specify critical parts of the application (those interfacing with JSON documents) by using high-level, grammar-oriented descriptions, as well as to promote the separation of JSON processing concerns from other application-specific aspects. In consequence, the production and maintenance of JSON processing applications is facilitated (especially for applications involving JSON documents with intricate nested structures, as well as for applications in which JSON formats are exposed to frequent changes and evolutions in their surface structures). This paper illustrates the approach with JSON-P as the generic JSON processing framework, with ANTLR as the parser generation tool, and with a case study concerning the development of a player for simple man-machine dialogs shaped in terms of JSON documents.

This is because most systems cannot accurately detect the geospatial semantic elements from the natural language questions, or capture the semantic relationships between those elements. In this paper, we propose a geospatial semantic encoding schema and a semantic graph representation which captures the semantic relations and dependencies in geospatial questions. We demonstrate that our proposed graph representation approach aids in the translation from natural language to a formal, executable expression in a query language. To decrease the need for people to provide explanatory information as part of their question and make the translation fully automatic, we treat the semantic encoding of the question as a sequential tagging task, and the graph generation of the query as a semantic dependency parsing task. We apply neural network approaches to automatically encode the geospatial questions into spatial semantic graph representations. Compared with current template-based approaches, our method generalises to a broader range of questions, including those with complex syntax and semantics. Our proposed approach achieves better results on GeoData201 than existing methods.

TI The Impact of Oxidative Stress on Ribosomes: From Injury to Regulation
SO CELLS
AB The ribosome is a complex ribonucleoprotein-based molecular machine that orchestrates protein synthesis in the cell. Both ribosomal RNA and ribosomal proteins can be chemically modified by reactive oxygen species, which may alter the ribosome ' s functions or cause a complete loss of functionality. The oxidative damage that ribosomes accumulate during their lifespan in a cell may lead to reduced or faulty translation and contribute to various pathologies. However, remarkably little is known about the biological consequences of oxidative damage to the ribosome. Here, we provide a concise summary of the known types of changes induced by reactive oxygen species in rRNA and ribosomal proteins and discuss the existing experimental evidence of how these modifications may affect ribosome dynamics and function. We emphasize the special role that redox-active transition metals, such as iron, play in ribosome homeostasis and stability. We also discuss the hypothesis that redox-mediated ribosome modifications may contribute to adaptive cellular responses to stress.

AB With Internet, the bulk of predictive intelligence can be obtained from public and unclassified sources, which are more accessible, ubiquitous, and valuable. Up to 80% of electronic data is textual and most valuable information is often encoded in pages which are neither structured, nor classified. The process of accessing all these raw data, heterogeneous for language used, and transforming them into information is therefore inextricably linked to the concepts of textual analysis and synthesis, hinging greatly on the ability to master the problems of multilinguality. Through Multilingual Text Mining, users can get an overview of great volumes of textual data having available a highly readable grid, which helps them discover meaningful similarities among documents and find all related information. This paper describes the approach used by SYNTHEMA, showing a content enabling system for OSINT that provides deep semantic search and information access to large quantities of distributed multimedia. SPYWatch provides with a language independent search and dynamic classification features for a broad range of data collected from several sources in a number of culturally diverse languages.

AB We study the problem of evaluating automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems that target dialectal speech input. A major challenge in this case is that the orthography of dialects is typically not standardized. From an ASR evaluation perspective, this means that there is no clear gold standard for the expected output, and several possible outputs could be considered correct according to different human annotators, which makes standard word error rate (WER) inadequate as an evaluation metric. Such a situation is typical for machine translation (MT), and thus we borrow ideas from an MT evaluation metric, namely TERp, an extension of translation error rate which is closely-related to WER. In particular, in the process of comparing a hypothesis to a reference, we make use of spelling variants for words and phrases, which we mine from Twitter in an unsupervised fashion. Our experiments with evaluating ASR output for Egyptian Arabic, and further manual analysis, show that the resulting WERd (i.e., WER for dialects) metric, a variant of TERp, is more adequate than WER for evaluating dialectal ASR.

AB Hospital acquired infections (HAIs) are notorious for their likelihood of fatal outcomes in infected patients due to rapid bacterial mutation rates, consequent resistance to antibiotic treatments and stubbornness to treatment, let alone eradication, to the point they have become a challenge to medical science. A fast and accurate method to identify HAI will assist in the diagnosis and identification of appropriate patient treatment and in controlling future outbreaks. Based on recently developed new methods for genomic data extraction, representation and analysis in bioinformatics, we propose an entirely new method for species identification. The accuracy of the new methods is very competitive and in several cases outperforms the standard spectroscopic protein-based MALDI-TOF MS commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories and public healthcare settings, at least prior to translation to a clinical setting. The proposed method relies on a model of hybridization that is robust to frameshifts and thus is likely to provide resilience to length variability in the sonication of the samples, probably one of the major challenges in a translation to clinical settings.

TI Ionotronic Tough Adhesives with Intrinsic Multifunctionality
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Ionotronic hydrogels find wide applications in flexible electronics, wearable/implantable devices, soft robotics, and human-machine interfaces. Their performance and practical translation have been bottlenecked by poor adhesiveness, limited mechanical properties, and the lack of biological functions. The remedies are often associated with complex formulations and sophisticated processing. Here, we report a rational design and facile synthesis of ionotronic tough adhesives (i-TAs), which have excellent mechanical, physical, electrical, and biological properties and promise high scalability and translational potential. They consist of an interpenetrating network with high-density amine groups and highly mobile chains, which enable intrinsic adhesiveness, self-healing, ionic stability, cytocompatibility, and antimicrobial functions. The i-TAs in both pristine and swollen states possess high toughness, stretchability, and strong adhesion to diverse substrates such as tissues and elastomers. The superior mechanical performance is achieved simultaneously with high ionic conductivity and stability in electrolyte solutions. We further demonstrate the use of i-TAs as wearable devices, strain sensors, and sensory sealants. This work is expected to open avenues for new ionotronics with novel functions and stimulate the development and translation of ionotronics.

TI QoS Analysis for Service Composition by Human and Web Services
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB The availability of more and more Web services provides great varieties for users to design service processes. However, there are situations that services or service processes cannot meet users' requirements in functional QoS dimensions (e.g., translation quality in a machine translation service). In those cases, composing Web services and human tasks is expected to be a possible alternative solution. However, analysis of such practical efforts were rarely reported in previous researches, most of which focus on the technology of embedding human tasks in software environments. Therefore, this study aims at analyzing the effects of composing Web services and human activities using a case study in the domain of language service with large scale experiments. From the experiments and analysis, we find out that (I) service implementation variety can be greatly increased by composing Web services and human activities for satisfying users' QoS requirements; (2) functional QoS of a Web service can be significantly improved by inducing human activities with limited cost and execution time provided certain quality of human activities; and (3) multiple QoS attributes of a composite service are affected in different ways with different quality of human activities.

TI Algorithmic explainability and legal reasoning
SO THEORY AND PRACTICE OF LEGISLATION
AB Algorithmic explainability has become one of the key topics of the last decade of the discourse about automated decision making (AMD, machine-made decisions). Within this discourse, an important subfield deals with the explainability of machine-made decisions or outputs that affect a person's legal position or have legal implications in general - in short, the algorithmic legal decisions. These could be decisions or recommendations taken or given by software which support judges, governmental agencies, or private actors. These could involve, for example, the automatic refusal of an online credit application or e-recruiting practices without any human intervention, or a prediction about one's likelihood of recidivism. This article is a contribution to this discourse, and it claims, that as explainability has become a prominent issue in hundreds of ethical codes, policy papers and scholarly writings, so it has become a 'semantically overloaded' concept. It has acquired such a broad meaning, which overlaps with so many other ethical issues and values, that it is worth narrowing down and clarifying its meaning. This study suggests that this concept should be used only for individual automated decisions, especially when made by software based on machine learning, i.e. 'black box-like' systems. If the term explainability is only applied to this area, it allows us to draw parallels between legal decisions and machine decisions, thus recognising the subject as a problem of legal reasoning, and, in part, linguistics. The second claim of this article is, that algorithmic legal decisions should follow the pattern of legal reasoning, translating the machine outputs to a form, where the decision is explained as applications of norms to a factual situation. Therefore, as the norms and the facts should be translated to data for the algorithm, so the data outputs should be back-translated to a proper legal justification.

AB As high-quality Malay language resources are still a scarcity, cross lingual word embeddings make it possible for richer English resources to be leveraged for downstream Malay text classification tasks. This paper focuses on creating an English-Malay cross-lingual word embeddings using embedding alignment by exploiting existing language resources. We augmented the training bilingual lexicons using machine translation with the goal to improve the alignment precision of our cross-lingual word embeddings. We investigated the quality of the current state-of-the-art English-Malay bilingual lexicon and worked on improving its quality using Google Translate. We also examined the effect of Malay word coverage on the quality of cross-lingual word embeddings. Experimental results with a precision up till 28.17% show that the alignment precision of the cross-lingual word embeddings would inevitably degrade after 1-NN but a better seed lexicon and cleaner nearest neighbours can reduce the number of word pairs required to achieve satisfactory performance. As the English and Malay monolingual embeddings are pre-trained on informal language corpora, our proposed English-Malay embeddings alignment approach is also able to map non-standard Malay translations in the English nearest neighbours.

AB Generating image descriptions in different languages is essential to satisfy users worldwide. However, it is prohibitively expensive to collect large-scale paired image-caption dataset for every target language which is critical for training descent image captioning models. Previous works tackle the unpaired cross-lingual image captioning problem through a pivot language, which is with the help of paired image-caption data in the pivot language and pivot-to-target machine translation models. However, such language-pivoted approach suffers from inaccuracy brought by the pivot-to-target translation, including disfluency and visual irrelevancy errors. In this paper, we propose to generate cross-lingual image captions with self-supervised rewards in the reinforcement learning framework to alleviate these two types of errors. We employ self-supervision from mono-lingual corpus in the target language to provide fluency reward, and propose a multi-level visual semantic matching model to provide both sentence-level and concept-level visual relevancy rewards. We conduct extensive experiments for unpaired cross-lingual image captioning in both English and Chinese respectively on two widely used image caption corpora. The proposed approach achieves significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

AB We present a novel scheme to apply factored phrase-based SMT to a language pair with very disparate morphological structures. Our approach relies on syntactic analysis on the source side (English) and then encodes a wide variety of local and non-local syntactic structures as complex structural tags which appear as additional factors in the training data. On the target side (Turkish), we only perform morphological analysis and disambiguation but treat the complete complex morphological tag as a factor, instead of separating morphemes. We incrementally explore capturing various syntactic substructures as complex tags on the English side, and evaluate how our translations improve in BLEU scores. Our maximal set of source and target side transformations, coupled with some additional techniques, provide an 39% relative improvement from a baseline 17.08 to 23.78 BLEU, all averaged over 10 training and test sets. Now that the syntactic analysis on the English side is available, we also experiment with more long distance constituent reordering to bring the English constituent order close to Turkish, but find that these transformations do not provide any additional consistent tangible gains when averaged over the 10 sets.

TI API2CAN: a dataset & service for canonical utterance generation for REST
   APIs
SO BMC RESEARCH NOTES
AB Objectives Recently natural language interfaces (e.g., chatbots) have gained enormous attention. Such interfaces execute underlying application programming interfaces (APIs) based on the user's utterances to perform tasks (e.g., reporting weather). Supervised approaches for building such interfaces rely upon a large set of user utterances paired with APIs. Collecting such pairs is typically starts with obtaining initial utterances for a given API method. Generating initial utterances can be considered as a machine translation task in which an API method is translated into an utterance. However, the key challenge is the lack of training samples for training domain-independent translation models. In this paper, we propose a dataset for training supervised models to generate initial utterances for APIs. Data description The dataset contains 14,370 pairs of API methods and utterances. It is built automatically by converting method descriptions of a large number of APIs to user utterances; and it is cleaned manually to ensure quality. The dataset is also accompanied with a set of microservices (e.g., translating API methods to utterances) which can facilitate the process of collecting training samples for building natural language interfaces.

AB Semantically detailed and typologically-informed morphological analysis that is broadly applicable cross-linguistically has the potential to improve many NLP applications, including machine translation, n-gram language models, information extraction, and co-reference resolution. In this paper, we present a universal morphological feature schema, which is a set of features that represent the finest distinctions in meaning that are expressed by inflectional morphology across languages. We first present the schema's guiding theoretical principles, construction methodology, and contents. We then present a method of measuring cross-linguistic variability in the semantic distinctions conveyed by inflectional morphology along the multiple dimensions spanned by the schema. This method relies on representing inflected wordforms from many languages in our universal feature space, and then testing for agreement across multiple aligned translations of pivot words in a parallel corpus (the Bible). The results of this method are used to assess the effectiveness of cross-linguistic projection of a multilingual consensus of these fine-grained morphological features, both within and across language families. We find high cross-linguistic agreement for a diverse range of semantic dimensions expressed by inflectional morphology.

AB The existing studies in cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) mostly rely on general text representation models (e.g., vector space model or latent semantic analysis). These models are not optimized for the target retrieval task. In this paper, we follow the success of neural representation in natural language processing (NLP) and develop a novel text representation model based on adversarial learning, which seeks a task-specific embedding space for CLIR. Adversarial learning is implemented as an interplay between the generator process and the discriminator process. In order to adapt adversarial learning to CLIR, we design three constraints to direct representation learning, which are (1) a matching constraint capturing essential characteristics of cross-language ranking, (2) a translation constraint bridging language gaps, and (3) an adversarial constraint forcing both language and source invariant to be reached more efficiently and effectively. Through the joint exploitation of these constraints in an adversarial manner, the underlying cross-language semantics relevant to retrieval tasks are better preserved in the embedding space. Standard CLIR experiments show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art continuous space models and approaches the strong machine translation and monolingual baselines.

TI Increased cell survival and cytogenetic integrity by spatial dose
   redistribution at a compact synchrotron X-ray source
SO PLOS ONE
AB X-ray microbeam radiotherapy can potentially widen the therapeutic window due to a geometrical redistribution of the dose. However, high requirements on photon flux, beam collimation, and system stability restrict its application mainly to large-scale, cost-intensive synchrotron facilities. With a unique laser-based Compact Light Source using inverse Compton scattering, we investigated the translation of this promising radiotherapy technique to a machine of future clinical relevance. We performed in vitro colony-forming assays and chromosome aberration tests in normal tissue cells after microbeam irradiation compared to homogeneous irradiation at the same mean dose using 25 keV X-rays. The microplanar pattern was achieved with a tungsten slit array of 50 mu m slit size and a spacing of 350 mu m. Applying microbeams significantly increased cell survival for a mean dose above 2 Gy, which indicates fewer normal tissue complications. The observation of significantly less chromosome aberrations suggests a lower risk of second cancer development. Our findings provide valuable insight into the mechanisms of microbeam radiotherapy and prove its applicability at a compact synchrotron, which contributes to its future clinical translation.

TI DeepGenGrep: a general deep learning-based predictor for multiple
   genomic signals and regions
SO BIOINFORMATICS
AB Motivation: Accurate annotation of different genomic signals and regions (GSRs) from DNA sequences is fundamentally important for understanding gene structure, regulation and function. Numerous efforts have been made to develop machine learning-based predictors for in silico identification of GSRs. However, it remains a great challenge to identify GSRs as the performance of most existing approaches is unsatisfactory. As such, it is highly desirable to develop more accurate computational methods for GSRs prediction.
   Results: In this study, we propose a general deep learning framework termed DeepGenGrep, a general predictor for the systematic identification of multiple different GSRs from genomic DNA sequences. DeepGenGrep leverages the power of hybrid neural networks comprising a three-layer convolutional neural network and a two-layer long short-term memory to effectively learn useful feature representations from sequences. Benchmarking experiments demonstrate that DeepGenGrep outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches on identifying polyadenylation signals, translation initiation sites and splice sites across four eukaryotic species including Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Bos taurus and Drosophila melanogaster. Overall, DeepGenGrep represents a useful tool for the high-throughput and cost-effective identification of potential GSRs in eukaryotic genomes.

TI Vietnamese Sentence Paraphrase Identification using Pre-trained Model
   and Linguistic Knowledge
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB The paraphrase identification task identifies whether two text segments share the same meaning, thereby playing a crucial role in various applications, such as computer-assisted translation, question answering, machine translation, etc. Although the literature on paraphrase identification in English and other popular languages is vast and growing, the research on this topic in Vietnamese remains relatively untapped. In this paper, we propose a novel method to classify Vietnamese sentence paraphrases, which deploys both the pre-trained model to exploit the semantic context and linguistic knowledge to provide further information in the identification process. Two branches of neural networks built in the Siamese architecture are also responsible for learning the differences among the sentence representations. To evaluate the proposed method, we present experiments on two existing Vietnamese sentence paraphrase corpora. The results show that for the same corpora, our method using the PhoBERT as a feature vector yields 94.97% F1-score on the VnPara corpus and 93.49% F1-score on the VNPC corpus. They are better than the results of the Siamese LSTM method and the pre-trained models.

TI Observation of collisionless thermalization of a plasmoid with a
   field-reversed configuration in a magnetic mirror
SO PHYSICS OF PLASMAS
AB A systematic translation study of field-reversed configurations (FRCs) has been conducted on the FRC Injection Experiment (FIX) machine [Okada et al., in Fusion Energy 1996 (International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna, 1997), Vol. 2, p. 229]. Plasma density and temperature of a translated FRC moving at supersonic speed are measured in the downstream magnetic mirror of FIX to verify a shock jump there when the FRC is reflected. A significant jump is observed. Moreover, the time evolution of the Carbon V Doppler profile is measured both quasi-parallel and perpendicular to the direction of FRC motion. Distinct transitions from Gaussian to non-Gaussian shapes are clearly seen in both profiles before and after the shock jump. Also, the ion mean-free path in the downstream magnetic mirror is calculated to be much longer than the characteristic width of the shock jump. These results indicate that the thermalization of flow energy in the translated FRC in the mirror is produced by a collisionless process, implying that this heating mechanism can be realized even in a reactor regime.

TI Robust, Primitive, and Unsupervised Quality Estimation for Segmentation
   Ensembles
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
AB A multitude of image-based machine learning segmentation and classification algorithms has recently been proposed, offering diagnostic decision support for the identification and characterization of glioma, Covid-19 and many other diseases. Even though these algorithms often outperform human experts in segmentation tasks, their limited reliability, and in particular the inability to detect failure cases, has hindered translation into clinical practice. To address this major shortcoming, we propose an unsupervised quality estimation method for segmentation ensembles. Our primitive solution examines discord in binary segmentation maps to automatically flag segmentation results that are particularly error-prone and therefore require special assessment by human readers. We validate our method both on segmentation of brain glioma in multi-modal magnetic resonance - and of lung lesions in computer tomography images. Additionally, our method provides an adaptive prioritization mechanism to maximize efficacy in use of human expert time by enabling radiologists to focus on the most difficult, yet important cases while maintaining full diagnostic autonomy. Our method offers an intuitive and reliable uncertainty estimation from segmentation ensembles and thereby closes an important gap toward successful translation of automatic segmentation into clinical routine.

AB In this paper we describe an Intelligent System for Automatic Transfer Grammar creation using parallel corpus of source and target language. As we know about English and Hindi language, the structure of Hindi is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) while in English the structure is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). Now the system has to decide in which order to translate the given source language (English) to the given target language (Hindi). The grammatically parsing source sentence has to generate target language on basis of grammar rule which we have created based on parallel corpus. These unique rules are always applicable when the same input structure is found and regenerate the output on basis of the grammatical rules. Thus it gives better accuracy in terms of quality of translation. Reordering [1, 2] is important part of Transfer Grammar which is very helpful in language pairs of distant origin. We focus on designing a system that gives correct reordering for English-Hindi Machine Translation System including simple, compound as well as complex sentences. Reorder sentences gets generated based on probability. The system is evaluated on the basis of precision, recall and f-measure.

TI Generating image descriptions with multidirectional 2D long short-term
   memory
SO IET COMPUTER VISION
AB Connecting visual imagery with descriptive language is a challenge for computer vision and machine translation. To approach this problem, the authors propose a novel end-to-end model to generate descriptions for images. Some early works used convolutional neural network-long-short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) model to describe the image, where a CNN encodes the input image into feature vector and an LSTM decodes the feature vector into a description. Since two-dimensional LSTM (2DLSTM) has property of translation invariance and can encode the relationships between regions in an image, they not only apply a CNN to extract global features of an image, but also use a multidirectional 2DLSTM to encode the feature maps extracted by CNN into structural local features. Their model is trained through maximising the likelihood of the target description sentence from the training dataset. Experiments on two challenging datasets show the accuracy of the model and the fluency of the language which is learned by their model. They compare bilingual evaluation understudy score and retrieval metric of their results with current state-of-the-art scores and show the improvements on Flickr30k and MS COCO.

TI Patterns of ribosomal protein expression specify normal and malignant
   human cells
SO GENOME BIOLOGY
AB Background: Ribosomes are highly conserved molecular machines whose core composition has traditionally been regarded as invariant. However, recent studies have reported intriguing differences in the expression of some ribosomal proteins (RPs) across tissues and highly specific effects on the translation of individual mRNAs.
   Results: To determine whether RPs are more generally linked to cell identity, we analyze the heterogeneity of RP expression in a large set of human tissues, primary cells, and tumors. We find that about a quarter of human RPs exhibit tissue-specific expression and that primary hematopoietic cells display the most complex patterns of RP expression, likely shaped by context-restricted transcriptional regulators. Strikingly, we uncover patterns of dysregulated expression of individual RPs across cancer types that arise through copy number variations and are predictive for disease progression.
   Conclusions: Our study reveals an unanticipated plasticity of RP expression across normal and malignant human cell types and provides a foundation for future characterization of cellular behaviors that are orchestrated by specific RPs.

AB We introduce a dictionary containing forms of common words in various Swiss German dialects normalized into High German. As Swiss German is, for now, a predominantly spoken language, there is a significant variation in the written forms, even between speakers of the same dialect. To alleviate the uncertainty associated with this diversity, we complement the pairs of Swiss German - High German words with the Swiss German phonetic transcriptions (SAMPA). This dictionary becomes thus the first resource to combine large-scale spontaneous translation with phonetic transcriptions. Moreover, we control for the regional distribution and insure the equal representation of the major Swiss dialects. The coupling of the phonetic and written Swiss German forms is powerful. We show that they are sufficient to train a Transformer-based phoneme to grapheme model that generates credible novel Swiss German writings. In addition, we show that the inverse mapping - from graphemes to phonemes - can be modeled with a transformer trained with the novel dictionary. This generation of pronunciations for previously unknown words is key in training extensible automated speech recognition (ASR) systems, which are key beneficiaries of this dictionary.

TI Almost lost in translation. Cryo-EM of a dynamic macromolecular complex:
   the ribosome
SO EUROPEAN BIOPHYSICS JOURNAL WITH BIOPHYSICS LETTERS
AB Ribosomes are dynamic biological machines that perform numerous tasks during translation, the biosynthesis of proteins. Translocation, the movement of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and messenger RNA (mRNA) to progress in the reading frame of codons in the mRNA, takes place after the addition of each amino acid. This process involves large ribosome conformational changes, where tRNAs proceed through intermediate states. The structural characterization of these translocation intermediates has remained elusive. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) produces three-dimensional averages, and translocating ribosomes poise distinct conformational states, and hence, structurally heterogeneous populations. During the last decade, the quest for visualization of translocation intermediates has progressed together with the development of classification tools in cryo-EM. Some of these new tools have recently been tested in ribosomal translocation, uncovering a clearer picture of the process. This success goes along with the latest advances in cryo-EM and illustrates how the technique offers multiple possibilities for studying macromolecular complexes engaged in dynamic reactions.

TI A STRING PATTERN-MATCHING ALGORITHM
SO JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
AB A string pattern-matching algorithm uses a character string, pattern, to search another character string, text, for the first or all occurrence(s) of the pattern in the text. This article presents a string pattern-matching algorithm using a mapping table and an automaton. The number of states of the automaton is equal to the length of the pattern and its number of inputs is one more than the number of different characters in the pattern. During the search, when a mismatch occurs between a pattern character and a text character, the jump to the next position for comparison is made optimal based on the information in the automaton. For non case-sensitive pattern matching, the translation of cases is all done in the mapping table in linear time of the sum of the pattern length and the size of the alphabet; the search part does not do any translation. Experimental results confirm     that the ratio of the number of characters inspected over the number of characters passed is better than       that of the Boyer-Moore algorithm. The search loop is also very simple and machine independent. Therefore, the algorithm should appeal to anyone who needs a universal search routine that does not depend on statistics of characters.

AB Pre-training and fine-tuning, e.g., BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), have achieved great success in language understanding by transferring knowledge from rich-resource pre-training task to the low/zero-resource downstream tasks. Inspired by the success of BERT, we propose MAsked Sequence to Sequence pre-training (MASS) for encoder-decoder based language generation. MASS adopts the encoder-decoder framework to reconstruct a sentence fragment given the remaining part of the sentence: its encoder takes a sentence with randomly masked fragment (several consecutive tokens) as input, and its decoder tries to predict this masked fragment. In this way, MASS can jointly train the encoder and decoder to develop the capability of representation extraction and language modeling. By further fine-tuning on a variety of zero/low-resource language generation tasks, including neural machine translation, text summarization and conversational response generation (3 tasks and totally 8 datasets), MASS achieves significant improvements over baselines without pre-training or with other pre-training methods. Specially, we achieve state-of-the-art accuracy (37.5 in terms of BLEU score) on the unsupervised English-French translation, even beating the early attention-based supervised model (Bandanau et al., 2015b)(1).

AB Cross-lingual spoken language understanding (SLU) systems traditionally require machine translation services for language portability and liberation from human supervision. However, restriction exists in parallel corpora and model architectures. Assuming reliable data are provided with human-supervision, which encourages non-parallel corpora and alleviate translation errors, this paper aims to explore cross-lingual knowledge transfer from multiple levels by taking advantage of neural architectures, We first investigate a joint model of slot filling and intent determination for SLU, which alleviates the out of -vocabulary problem and explicitly models dependencies between output labels by combining character and word representations, bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory and conditional random fields together, while attention-based classifier is introduced for intent determination. Knowledge transfer is further operated on character-level and sequence-level, aiming to share morphological and phonological information between languages with similar alphabets by sharing character representations, and characterize the sequence with language-general and language-specific knowledge adaptively acquired by separate encoders. Experimental results on the MIT-Restaurant Corpus and the ATIS corpora in different languages demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

AB The paper presents a unified algorithm for aligning sentences with their translations in bilingual data. The sentence alignment problem is handled as a large-scale pattern recognition problem similar to the task of finding the word sequence that corresponds to an acoustic input signal in isolated word automatic speech recognition (ASR). The algorithm gains efficiency from related work on dynamic programming (DP) search for speech recognition ([1]): a stack-based search is parametrized in a novel way, such that the unified algorithm can be used on various types of data that have been previously handled by separate implementations: the extracted text chunk pairs can be either sub-sentential pairs, one-to-one, or many-to-many sentence-level pairs. The one-stage search algorithm is carried out in a single run over the data. With the help of a unified beam-search candidate pruning, the algorithm is very efficient: it avoids any document-level pre-filtering and uses less restrictive sentence-level filtering. Results are presented on a Russian-English and a Spanish-English extraction task. Based on a simple word-based scoring model, text chunk pairs are extracted out of several trillion candidates.

   Learning
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
AB Single-cell multi-omics technologies enable comprehensive interrogation of cellular regulation, yet most single-cell assays measure only one type of activity-such as transcription, chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, or 3D chromatin architecture-for each cell. To enable a multimodal view for individual cells, we propose Polarbear, a semi-supervised machine learning framework that facilitates missing modality profile prediction and single-cell cross-modality alignment. Polarbear learns to translate between modalities by using data from co-assay measurements coupled with the large quantity of single-assay data available in public databases. This semi-supervised scheme mitigates issues related to low cell quantities and high sparsity in co-assay data. Polarbear first pre-trains a beta-variational autoencoder for each modality using both co-assay and single-assay profiles to learn robust representations of individual cells, and it then uses the co-assay labels to train a translator between these cell representations. This semi-supervised framework enables us to predict missing modality profiles and match single cells across modalities with improved accuracy compared with fully supervised methods, thus facilitating multimodal data integration.

TI Image Translation Method for Game Character Sprite Drawing
SO CMES-COMPUTER MODELING IN ENGINEERING & SCIENCES
AB Two-dimensional (2D) character animation is one of the most important visual elements on which users' interest is focused in the game field. However, 2D character animation works in the game field are mostly performed manually in two dimensions, thus generating high production costs. This study proposes a generative adversarial network based production tool that can easily and quickly generate the sprite images of 2D characters. First, we proposed a methodology to create a synthetic dataset for training using images from the real world in the game resource production field where machine learning datasets are insufficient. In addition, we have enabled effective sprite generation while minimizing user input in the process of using the tool. To this end, we proposed a mixed input method with a small number of segmentations and skeletal bone paintings. The proposed image-to-image translation network effectively generated sprite images from the user input images using the skeletal loss. We conducted an experiment regarding the number of images required and showed that 2D sprite resources can be generated even with a small number of segmentation inputs and one skeletal bone drawing.

AB One key perspective when communicating with deaf people is sign language recognition. Many experts agree upon the fact that using a system communication is a key for bridging the gap between deaf and non deaf people since ordinary people can not exchange using the sign language. As a result, researchers, deaf people, parents and deaf-mute community are striving to have a bidirectional communication system based on translation with lower costs. The importance of the research is related to its goal of helping these categories of unvoiced people communicate with others and enhance their contributions to growth and capacity building and vice versa.
   This paper gives an overview of the most used techniques and technologies (gloves, android application, image processing, ...) in order to translate sign language to written or spoken language. Furthermore, this paper provides a critical and comparative analysis of the studied approaches and stands out major challenges to overcome their limits. Finally, we propose in this paper a dual way communication system ensuring arabic sign language translation into spoken language based on image processing and deep learning.

TI QD-JANUS - A SEQUENTIAL IMPLEMENTATION OF JANUS IN PROLOG
SO SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB Janus is a language designed for distributed constraint programming. This paper describes QD-Janus, a sequential implementation of Janus in Prolog. The compiler uses a number of novel analyses and optimizations to improve the performance of the system. The choice of Prolog as the target language for a compiler, although unusual, is motivated by the following: (i) the semantic gap between Janus and Prolog is much smaller than that between Janus and, say, C or machine language-this simplifies the compilation process significantly, and makes it possible to develop a system with reasonable performance fairly quickly; (ii) recent progress in Prolog implementation techniques, and the development of Prolog systems whose speeds are comparable to those of imperative languages, indicates that the translation to Prolog need not entail a significant performance loss compared to native code compilers; and (iii) compilation to Prolog can benefit immediately from a significant body of work on, and implementations of, parallel Prolog systems. Our experience indicates that translation of logic programming languages to Prolog, accompanied by the development of good program analysis and optimization tools, is an effective way to quickly develop flexible and portable implementations with good performance and low cost.

AB Sentiment analysis and emotion recognition are emerging research fields of research that aim to build intelligent systems able to recognize and interpret human emotions. Due to the applicability of these systems to almost all kinds of markets, also the interest of companies and industries is grown in an exponential way in the last years and a lot of frameworks for programming these systems are introduced. IBM Watson is one of the most famous and used: it offers, among others, a lot of services for Natural Language Processing. In spite of broad-scale multi-language services, most of functions are not available in a lot of "secondary" languages (like Italian). The main objective of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of a translation-based approach to emotion recognition in texts written in "secondary" languages. We present a prototypical system using IBM Watson to extract emotions from Italian text by means of Bluemix Alchemy Language. Some preliminary results are shown and discussed in order to stress pro and cons of the approach.

AB Natural Language Constraints have a vital role in Business Organization. The main problem is scope ambiguity when these NL constraints are translated into formal languages. Human beings can understand the context in which these constraints are defined but it is most difficult for a machine to understand the exact meanings of these constraints in their context and this leads to crash the Business System. Therefore before translating these business constraints to OCL, the scope ambiguities should be resolved for correct translation of NL to OCL. For this purpose a new technique is proposed for handling the scope of logical operators used in NL constraints by using the Markov Logic. The subject and scope knowledge and Markov logic integrates into natural language processing. The subject knowledge has been deployed as context knowledge and scope knowledge was acquired from the business constraints. Markov logic was applied to NL constraints for selecting the most possible meaning of an ambiguous NL constraint based on the context. The presented work shows that by handling the identified cases of scope ambiguities of logical operators, we can take correct translation of business constraints into formal specifications.

TI Prediction of drug metabolites using neural machine translation
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Metabolic processes in the human body can alter the structure of a drug affecting its efficacy and safety. As a result, the investigation of the metabolic fate of a candidate drug is an essential part of drug design studies. Computational approaches have been developed for the prediction of possible drug metabolites in an effort to assist the traditional and resource-demanding experimental route. Current methodologies are based upon metabolic transformation rules, which are tied to specific enzyme families and therefore lack generalization, and additionally may involve manual work from experts limiting scalability. We present a rule-free, end-to-end learning-based method for predicting possible human metabolites of small molecules including drugs. The metabolite prediction task is approached as a sequence translation problem with chemical compounds represented using the SMILES notation. We perform transfer learning on a deep learning transformer model for sequence translation, originally trained on chemical reaction data, to predict the outcome of human metabolic reactions. We further build an ensemble model to account for multiple and diverse metabolites. Extensive evaluation reveals that the proposed method generalizes well to different enzyme families, as it can correctly predict metabolites through phase I and phase II drug metabolism as well as other enzymes. Compared to existing rule-based approaches, our method has equivalent performance on the major enzyme families while it additionally finds metabolites through less common enzymes. Our results indicate that the proposed approach can provide a comprehensive study of drug metabolism that does not restrict to the major enzyme families and does not require the extraction of transformation rules.

TI The Synonym Lookaside Buffer: A Solution to the Synonym Problem in
   Virtual Caches
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS
AB To support dynamic address translation in today's microprocessors, the first-level cache is accessed in parallel with a translation lookaside buffer (TLB). However, this current approach faces mounting problems as more concurrency is exploited in the processor core, as multiprocessors are becoming more and more prevalent, and as the memory demand of emerging applications is growing. This paper introduces new ideas to enable the use of virtual addresses in the cache hierarchy, thus removing the TLB from the critical path of the processor core. The major idea is the replacement of the on-chip TLB by a synonym lookaside buffer (SLB). The SLB translates synonyms into a primary virtual address, which is a unique identifier resolving all ambiguities due to synonyms in the memory system. We introduce various system configurations with SLBs and discuss all functional issues associated with them. An SLB is much more scalable than a regular TLB. It scales with memory data set sizes, physical memory sizes, and number of cores in a multiprocessor. Moreover, SLB entry flushes and shootdowns due to physical memory management are eliminated. We show performance data resulting from the simulation of several applications as diverse as scientific computing, database, and JAVA virtual machines. These evaluations target SLB miss rates and flushes as well as the impact of the SLB on cache miss rates. They show that small SLBs of 8-16 entries are sufficient to solve the synonym problem in virtual caches and that their performance overhead is negligible.

TI Current Challenges Facing the Translation of Brain Computer Interfaces

SO FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE
AB Current research in brain computer interface (BCI) technology is advancing beyond preclinical studies, with trials beginning in human patients. To date, these trials have been carried out with several different types of recording interfaces. The success of these devices has varied widely, but different factors such as the level of invasiveness, timescale of recorded information, and ability to maintain stable functionality of the device over a long period of time all must be considered in addition to accuracy in decoding intent when assessing the most practical type of device moving forward. Here, we discuss various approaches to BCIs, distinguishing between devices focusing on control of operations extrinsic to the subject (e.g., prosthetic limbs, computer cursors) and those focusing on control of operations intrinsic to the brain (e.g., using stimulation or external feedback), including closed loop or adaptive devices. In this discussion, we consider the current challenges facing the translation of various types of BCI technology to eventual human application.

TI Cross-Lingual Adaptation Using Structural Correspondence Learning
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Cross-lingual adaptation is a special case of domain adaptation and refers to the transfer of classification knowledge between two languages. In this article we describe an extension of Structural Correspondence Learning (SCL), a recently proposed algorithm for domain adaptation, for cross-lingual adaptation in the context of text classification. The proposed method uses unlabeled documents from both languages, along with a word translation oracle, to induce a cross-lingual representation that enables the transfer of classification knowledge from the source to the target language. The main advantages of this method over existing methods are resource efficiency and task specificity.
   We conduct experiments in the area of cross-language topic and sentiment classification involving English as source language and German, French, and Japanese as target languages. The results show a significant improvement of the proposed method over a machine translation baseline, reducing the relative error due to cross-lingual adaptation by an average of 30% (topic classification) and 59% (sentiment classification). We further report on empirical analyses that reveal insights into the use of unlabeled data, the sensitivity with respect to important hyperparameters, and the nature of the induced cross-lingual word correspondences.

AB We propose the flying object that adapts itself to the environment by means of the dynamic behavior change mechanism. The flying object is user-defined first-class and abstract entity Such properties provide independency and transparency. The flying object model establishes a unique decomposition of the flying object. In this model, the flying object consists of four objects: the delegator that encapsulates the implementation, the message handler that interprets the messages, the event handler that provides adaptation strategies and the context object that holds a stare beyond the adaptation. The ability of accommodation, the openness, is one of great contributions of this model because many functions such as object migration, load balancing, distributed transaction management, the communication protocols and even adaptation strategies can be introduced by the message handler and the event handler as a plug-in module. Furthermore, a source code translation technique is introduced for automatic decomposition of the flying object as a replacement for the virtual machine customizations or low-level programming. The delegator and the context object are instantiated from the same translated class to minimize maintenance costs of classes as a result of an automatic translation. Therefore, the system organized by the flying object is best suited for the open distributed environment.

TI Knockdown of the mRNA encoding the ribosomal protein eL38 in mammalian
   cells causes a substantial reorganization of genomic transcription
SO BIOCHIMIE
AB The ribosomal protein eL38 is a component of the mammalian translation machine. The deletion of the Rpl38 locus in mice results in the Tail-short (Ts) mutant phenotype characterized by a shortened tail and other defects in the axial skeleton development. Here, using the next-generation sequencing of total RNA from HEK293 cells knocked down of eL38 mRNA by transfection with specific siRNAs, we examined the effect of reduced eL38 content on genomic transcription. An approximately 4-fold decrease in the level of eL38 was shown to cause changes in the expression of nearly 1500 genes. Among the down-regulated genes, there were those responsible for p53 activity, Ca2+ metabolism and several signaling processes, as well as genes involved in the organization and functioning of the cytoskeleton. The genes related to rRNA processing and translation, along with many others, including those whose dysregulation is associated with developmental disorders, turned out to be up-regulated. Thus, we demonstrated that the decreased RPL38 expression leads to a significant reorganization of genomic transcription. Our findings suggest a possible link between the balance of eL38 and genes implicated in osteogenesis, thereby contributing to the elucidation of the reasons for the appearance of the above Ts mutant phenotype in animals.

TI Turnover of endogenous SsrA-tagged proteins mediated by ATP-dependent
   proteases in Escherichia coli
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Formation and degradation of SsrA-tagged proteins enable ribosome recycling and elimination of defective products of incomplete translation. We produced an antibody against the SsrA peptide and used it to measure the amounts of SsrA-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli cells without interfering with tagging or altering the context of the tag added at the ends of nascent polypeptides. SsrA-tagged proteins were present in very small amounts unless a component of the ClpXP protease was missing. From the levels of tagged proteins in cells in which degradation is essentially blocked, we calculate that >= 1 in 200 translation products receives an SsrA tag. ClpXP is responsible for >= 90% of the degradation of SsrA-tagged proteins. The degradation rate in wild type cells is >= 1.4 min(-1) and decreases to similar to 0.10 min(-1) in a clpX mutant. The rate of degradation by ClpXP is decreased similar to 3-fold in mutants lacking the adaptor SspB, whereas degradation by ClpAP is increased 3-5-fold. However, ClpAP degrades SsrA-tagged proteins slowly even in the absence of SspB, possibly because of interference from ClpA-specific substrates. Lon protease degrades SsrA-tagged proteins at a rate of similar to 0.05 min(-1) in the presence or absence of SspB. We conclude that ClpXP, together with SspB, is uniquely adapted for degradation of SsrA-tagged proteins and is responsible for the major part of their degradation in vivo.

AB Most current quality estimation (QE) models for machine translation are trained and evaluated in a fully supervised setting requiring significant quantities of labelled training data. However, obtaining labelled data can be both expensive and time-consuming. In addition, the test data that a deployed QE model would be exposed to may differ from its training data in significant ways. In particular, training samples are often labelled by one or a small set of annotators, whose perceptions of translation quality and needs may differ substantially from those of end-users, who will employ predictions in practice. Thus, it is desirable to be able to adapt QE models efficiently to new user data with limited supervision data. To address these challenges, we propose a Bayesian meta-learning approach for adapting QE models to the needs and preferences of each user with limited supervision. To enhance performance, we further propose an extension to a state-of-the-art Bayesian meta-learning approach which utilizes a matrix-valued kernel for Bayesian meta-learning of quality estimation. Experiments on data with varying number of users and language characteristics demonstrates that the proposed Bayesian metalearning approach delivers improved predictive performance in both limited and full supervision settings.

AB This paper describes a suitable sign translator system that can be used for Arabic hearing impaired and any Arabic Sign Language (ArSL) users as well. The proposed system makes use of an automatic Arabic Speech Recognition module (ASR) integrated with Arabic Signer model to generate the ArSL signs. It translates from Arabic speech recognition (ASR) into ArSL. Therefore, the paper describes technologies for generating 3D Avatar signers from the Arabic speech recognition engine. The 3D avatar is based on character behaviours and gestures used by ArSL users. Consequently, sign language translator and the 3D avatar technology are used to sign the Arabic text script produced from the Arabic automatic speech recognition (ASR) engine. Therefore, the Arabic Text-to-Sign (ArTTS) translation is the goal of this paper. The machine translation with a set of transformational rules and language model with linguistic background used throughout our work will be described according to the model used for the proposed system.
   A typical presentation is developed to establish the values of the proposed solution. Experimental results show that the proposed ArTTS technique has a sign detection rate of 85 %. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper is framed in the context of the SSHOC project and aims at exploring how Language Technologies can help in promoting and facilitating multilingualism in the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH). Although most SSH researchers produce culturally and societally relevant work in their local languages, metadata and vocabularies used in the SSH domain to describe and index research data are currently mostly in English. We thus investigate Natural Language Processing and Machine Translation approaches in view of providing resources and tools to foster multilingual access and discovery to SSH content across different languages. As case studies, we create and deliver as freely, openly available data a set of multilingual metadata concepts and an automatically extracted multilingual Data Stewardship terminology. The two case studies allow as well to evaluate performances of state-of-the-art tools and to derive a set of recommendations as to how best apply them. Although not adapted to the specific domain, the employed tools prove to be a valid asset to translation tasks. Nonetheless, validation of results by domain experts proficient in the language is an unavoidable phase of the whole workflow.

TI A Generalized Michaelis-Menten Equation in Protein Synthesis: Effects of
   Mis-Charged Cognate tRNA and Mis-Reading of Codon
SO BULLETIN OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY
AB The sequence of amino acid monomers in the primary structure of a protein is decided by the corresponding sequence of codons (triplets of nucleic acid monomers) on the template messenger RNA (mRNA). The polymerization of a protein, by incorporation of the successive amino acid monomers, is carried out by a molecular machine called ribosome. We develop a stochastic kinetic model that captures the possibilities of mis-reading of mRNA codon and prior mis-charging of a tRNA. By a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we obtain the distribution of the times taken for incorporation of the successive amino acids in the growing protein in this mathematical model. The corresponding exact analytical expression for the average rate of elongation of a nascent protein is a 'biologically motivated' generalization of the Michaelis-Menten formula for the average rate of enzymatic reactions. This generalized Michaelis-Menten-like formula (and the exact analytical expressions for a few other quantities) that we report here display the interplay of four different branched pathways corresponding to selection of four different types of tRNA.

TI IRESPred: Web Server for Prediction of Cellular and Viral Internal
   Ribosome Entry Site (IRES)
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Cellular mRNAs are predominantly translated in a cap-dependent manner. However, some viral and a subset of cellular mRNAs initiate their translation in a cap-independent manner. This requires presence of a structured RNA element, known as, Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) in their 5' untranslated regions (UTRs). Experimental demonstration of IRES in UTR remains a challenging task. Computational prediction of IRES merely based on sequence and structure conservation is also difficult, particularly for cellular IRES. A web server, IRESPred is developed for prediction of both viral and cellular IRES using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The predictive model was built using 35 features that are based on sequence and structural properties of UTRs and the probabilities of interactions between UTR and small subunit ribosomal proteins (SSRPs). The model was found to have 75.51% accuracy, 75.75% sensitivity, 75.25% specificity, 75.75% precision and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.51 in blind testing. IRESPred was found to perform better than the only available viral IRES prediction server, VIPS. The IRESPred server is freely available at http://bioinfo.net.in/IRESPred/.

AB Although ultrafast lasers have demonstrated much success in structuring and ablating dielectrics on the micrometer scale and below, high aspect ratio structuring remains a challenge. Specifically, microfluidics or lab-on-chip DNA sequencing systems require high aspect ratio sub-10 mu m wide channels with no taper. Micro-dicing also requires machining with vertical walls. Backside water assisted ultrafast laser processing with Gaussian beams allows the production of high aspect ratio microchannels but requires sub-micron sample positioning and precise control of translation velocity.
   In this context, we propose a new approach based on Bessel beams that exhibit a focal range exceeding the Rayleigh range by over one order of magnitude. An SLM-based setup allows us to produce a Bessel beam with central core diameter of 1.5 mu m FWHM extending over a longitudinal range of 150 mu m. A working window in the parameter space has been identified that allows the reliable production of high aspect ratio taper-free microchannels without sample translation. We report a systematic investigation of the damage morphology dependence on focusing geometry and energy per pulse.

TI Knowing Right From Wrong: Quality Control of Ribosome Biogenesis in
   Eubacteria
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INDIAN NATIONAL SCIENCE ACADEMY
AB Ribosomes are amongst the largest molecular machines in any living cell, which consist of three ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) over 50 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins). In bacteria they have a small subunit (30S) and a large subunit (50S) which together form a functional 70S ribosome, which translates the information in a messenger RNA (mRNA) into a polypeptide sequence. Translation occurs in multiple steps such as initiation, elongation, termination and recycling. The fidelity of these steps depends on the faithful assembly of the ribosome itself. The synthesis of ribosomes involves various processes such as folding and processing of rRNA, ordered loading of ribosomal proteins and modification of various critical residues in them. For accuracy of protein synthesis, a cell must ensure that the immature particles are kept away from participating in active translation. And, once the ribosomes have been assembled, the cells must have a quality check to ensure the accuracy of assembled particles. Defect in any of these processes will result in the occurrence of defective ribosomes in translating pool, which in turn may lead to production of mis-translated proteins. In humans, genetic disorders of ribosomopathies occur because of deficiencies in ribosome biogenesis and quality control. Thus, it is crucial to understand the hitherto obscure mechanisms of quality control of ribosome biogenesis. This review is an attempt to provide an overview of our understanding of quality control mechanisms in ribosome biogenesis of prokaryotes.

TI A Chinese Calligraphy-Writing Robotic System Based on Image-to-Action
   Translations and a Hypothesis Generation Net
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper attempts to use a delta robot's structure and reliable coordinates to develop a self-learning Chinese calligraphy-writing system that requires precise control. Ideally, to achieve human-like behavior, a delta robot can learn stroke trajectories autonomously and present the stroke beauty of calligraphy characters. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art approaches have not yet considered the presentation of stroke beauty resulting from angles of rotation and tilt of the brush. This paper presents an integrated system consisting of a stroke processing module, a hypothesis generation net (HGN) learning model with self-learning capability, a delta robot, and an image capture module. Our approach utilizes both the stroke trajectories from the stroke processing module and angles information from the HGN learning model to automatically produce five degrees of freedom action instructions. Based on the instructions, the delta robot completes calligraphy writing. Then, the image capture module provides feedback to the writing system for error calculation and coordinate correction. We utilize the mean absolute percentage error to verify the performance of the writing results. A correction algorithm and linear regression were used to improve the error correction results (less than 2% error). After several cycles, the written results approached the target sample finally. Consequently, the written results produced by the delta robot prove that our proposed system with learning ability can write Chinese calligraphy aesthetically.

TI Reactive balance performance and neuromuscular and cognitive responses
   to unpredictable balance perturbations in children with developmental
   coordination disorder
SO GAIT & POSTURE
AB Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) is a common motor disorder affecting balance performance. However, few studies have investigated reactive balance performance and the underlying mechanisms in children with DCD. This study aimed to compare the reactive balance performance, lower limb muscle reflex contraction latency and attention level in response to unpredictable balance perturbations between 100 typically developing children and 120 children with DCD (with and without comorbid autism spectrum disorder) aged 6-9 years. Reactive balance performance was evaluated using a motor control test (MCT) conducted on a computerized dynamic posturography machine. The lower limb postural muscle responses and attention level before, during and after a MCT were measured using surface electromyography and electroencephalography, respectively. The results revealed that relative to typically developing children, those with DCD had a significantly longer MCT latency score in the backward platform translation condition (p = 0.048) but a significantly shorter latency score in the forward platform translation condition (p = 0.024). The MCT composite latency scores and the corresponding lower limb muscle onset latencies were similar between the groups. Children with DCD also demonstrated a lower attention level during and after sudden backward (p = 0.042) and forward (p = 0.031) platform translations, compared to typically developing children. Children with DCD were less attentive in response to postural threats, and their balance responses were direction-specific. Balance training for children with DCD might require an additional emphasis on sudden posterior-to-anterior balance perturbations, as well as on problems with inattention.

AB We describe the process of creating a User Interface Terminology (UIT) with the goal to generate a maximum of German language interface terms that are mapped to the reference terminology SNOMED CT. The purpose is to offer a high coverage of medical jargon in order to optimise semantic annotations of clinical documents by text mining systems. The first step consisted in the creation of an n-gram table to which words and short phrases from the English SNOMED CT description table were automatically extracted and entered. The second step was to fill up the n-gram table with human and machine translations, manually enriched by POS tags. Top-down and bottom-up methods for manual terminology population were used. Grammar rules were formulated and embedded into a term generator, which then created one-to many German variants per SNOMED CT description. Currently, the German user interface terminology contains 4,425,948 entries, created out of 111,605 German n-grams, assigned to 95,298 English n-grams. With 341,105 active concepts and 542,462 (non FSN) descriptions, it corresponds to an average of 13 interface terms per concept and 8.2 per description. An analysis of the current quality of this resource by blinded human assessment terminology states equivalence regarding term understandability compared to a fully automated Web-based translator, which, however does not yield any synonyms, so that there are good reasons to further develop this semi-automated terminology engineering method and recommend it for other language pairs.

CY JUL 15-19, 1991
CL CHESTER, ENGLAND
AB An x-ray monochromator for the range from 800 eV to 10 keV has been designed, constructed, and tested at LNLS.  The high resolution is achieved by a four-crystal scheme where two nondispersive double crystals (or channel-cut crystals) are arranged in the dispersive configuration.  Each double crystal is installed on the axis of a precision-machined cylindrical plate.  Synchronized counterrotation of both plates is achieved by a single high precision translation stage connected to them by thin metallic tapes or wires.  This mechanical design makes it very stable and easy to implement as a compact ultrahigh-vacuum unit, since only one translation has to be transmitted into the monochromator vessel.  To characterize the prototype we used the Cu K lines of a conventional x-ray tube and two Si(422) channel-cut crystals, yielding an angular acceptance of 2.6 arcsec and an energy resolution of 10(-5).  The stability of the whole system turned out to be better than 0.6 arcsec for several hours.  We swept several times the angle from Cu K-alpha1,2 to Cu K-beta (about 5.6-degrees) and the position was reproduced within the same accuracy of 0.6 arcsec.

TI Hammer for Coq: Automation for Dependent Type Theory
SO JOURNAL OF AUTOMATED REASONING
AB Hammers provide most powerful general purpose automation for proof assistants based on HOL and set theory today. Despite the gaining popularity of the more advanced versions of type theory, such as those based on the Calculus of Inductive Constructions, the construction of hammers for such foundations has been hindered so far by the lack of translation and reconstruction components. In this paper, we present an architecture of a full hammer for dependent type theory together with its implementation for the Coq proof assistant. A key component of the hammer is a proposed translation from the Calculus of Inductive Constructions, with certain extensions introduced by Coq, to untyped first-order logic. The translation is "sufficiently" sound and complete to be of practical use for automated theorem provers. We also introduce a proof reconstruction mechanism based on an eauto-type algorithm combined with limited rewriting, congruence closure and some forward reasoning. The algorithm is able to re-prove in the Coq logic most of the theorems established by the ATPs. Together with machine-learning based selection of relevant premises this constitutes a full hammer system. The performance of the whole procedure is evaluated in a bootstrapping scenario emulating the development of the Coq standard library. For each theorem in the library only the previous theorems and proofs can be used. We show that 40.8% of the theorems can be proved in a push-button mode in about 40 s of real time on a 8-CPU system.

AB Qur'an contains teachings about life given by Allah to the Prophet Muhammad. In the Qur'an, there are a lot of verses. With a large number of verses, it will be very difficult and take a long time for us to find a name. Manually searching for entities will be very difficult and take a long time to be searched. With NER, which is one of the techniques of information extraction that aims to detect entity names, such as people's names, locations, events, and time expected search for entity names in the Qur'an will significantly simplify and shorten the time. Indonesian Qur'an translations will later be used as Inputs, and their names are entity names. The solution to the problem above is to use NER. The Named Entity (NE) Recognition (NER) system will look for name entities people from the corpus that have been created. In applying NER requires a model to detect name entities in a text. Hidden Markov Model-Viterbi is a machine learning algorithm type Supervised Learning which will be applied.

TI Studies of mutations of assembly factor Hit1 in budding yeast suggest
   translation defects as the molecular basis for PEHO syndrome
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Regulation of protein synthesis is critical for control of gene expression in all cells. Ribosomes are ribonucleoprotein machines responsible for translating cellular proteins. Defects in ribosome production, function, or regulation are detrimental to the cell and cause human diseases, such as pro-gressive encephalopathy with edema, hypsarrhythmia, and optic atrophy (PEHO) syndrome. PEHO syndrome is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the ZNHIT3 gene, which encodes an evolutionarily conserved nu-clear protein. The precise mechanisms by which ZNHIT3 mutations lead to PEHO syndrome are currently unclear. Studies of the human zinc finger HIT-type containing protein 3 homolog in budding yeast (Hit1) revealed that this protein is critical for formation of small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein complexes that are required for rRNA processing and 2'-O-methylation. Here, we use budding yeast as a model system to reveal the basis for the molecular pathogenesis of PEHO syn-drome. We show that missense mutations modeling those found in PEHO syndrome patients cause a decrease in steady-state Hit1 protein levels, a significant reduction of box C/D snoRNA levels, and subsequent defects in rRNA processing and altered cellular translation. Using RiboMethSeq analysis of rRNAs isolated from actively translating ribosomes, we reveal site-specific changes in the rRNA modification pattern of PEHO syndrome mutant yeast cells. Our data suggest that PEHO syndrome is a ribosomopathy and reveal potential new aspects of the molecular basis of this disease in translation dysregulation.

TI Personalized Prognostic Prediction of Treatment Outcome for Depressed
   Patients in a Naturalistic Psychiatric Hospital Setting: A Comparison of
   Machine Learning Approaches
SO JOURNAL OF CONSULTING AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB Objective: Research on predictors of treatment outcome in depression has largely derived from randomized clinical trials involving strict standardization of treatments, stringent patient exclusion criteria, and careful selection and supervision of study clinicians. The extent to which findings from such studies generalize to naturalistic psychiatric settings is unclear. This study sought to predict depression outcomes for patients seeking treatment within an intensive psychiatric hospital setting and while comparing the performance of a range of machine learning approaches. Method: Depressed patients (N = 484; ages 18-72; 89% White) receiving treatment within a psychiatric partial hospital program delivering pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy were split into a training sample and holdout sample. First, within the training sample, 51 pretreatment variables were submitted to 13 machine learning algorithms to predict, via cross-validation, posttreatment Patient Health Questionnaire-9 depression scores. Second, the best performing modeling approach (lowest mean squared error; MSE) from the training sample was selected to predict outcome in the holdout sample. Results: The best performing model in the training sample was elastic net regularization (ENR; MSE = 20.49, R-2 = . 28), which had comparable performance in the holdout sample (MSE = 11.26; R-2 = . 38). There were 14 pretreatment variables that predicted outcome. To demonstrate the translation of an ENR model to personalized prediction of treatment outcome, a patient-specific prognosis calculator is presented. Conclusions: Informed by pretreatment patient characteristics, such predictive models could be used to communicate prognosis to clinicians and to guide treatment planning. Identified predictors of poor prognosis may suggest important targets for intervention.

TI Improving formal analysis of state machines with particular emphasis on
   and-cross transitions
SO COMPUTER LANGUAGES SYSTEMS & STRUCTURES
AB In this paper, we present an approach to formally encode state machines expressed in Umple for symbolic verification. We illustrate this with a real-world modeling example that encodes and analyzes and-cross transitions. This paper discusses a formal description of our approach to represent state machine systems under analysis (SSUAs); a systematic approach to certifying that SSUAs are deterministic; and an evaluation of performance (memory usage and execution time) on the case study.
   Method: We describe a formalization of state machines in Umple that enables their translation to model checking tools and also to code that is consistent with this. We present three alternative modeling solutions for a sample problem and a solution based on the use of and-cross transitions. State machine models corresponding to these solutions are represented in Umple, a model-oriented programming language. These are automatically transformed to SMV, the input language of the nuXmv (or NuSMV) model checker. By cleanly separating concerns, we systematically integrate components of hierarchical state systems as opposed to the traditional flattening approach, yet manage the complexity introduced by concurrency and and-crossing. We then compose and verify a set of requirements (e.g., correctness, safety, liveliness, etc.) on the resulting systems of all the modeling approaches to empirically compare the different modeling alternatives with the use of and-cross transitions.
   Results: We can encode and formally analyse complex state machines with and-cross transition(s). We observed a large reduction in the number of required transitions for encoding the SSUA, as opposed to the alternative approaches. We asserted that solutions derived from the approaches are identical behavior-wise even though each approach models the SSUA differently. Each of the approaches yielded the same result for potentially conflicting pairs which is a false positive (i.e., the SSUAs are deterministic). We observe that each approach maintains the same global state-space irrespective of the variations in their number of transitions. Furthermore, we observe that it is untrue that a more abstract method applied to an SSUA outperforms its less abstract counterpart whenever parameters (such as execution time, memory usage and the number of Binary Decision Diagrams - BDDs) are the factors under consideration.

TI Fuzzy support vector machine for classification of EEG signals using
   wavelet-based features
SO MEDICAL ENGINEERING & PHYSICS
AB Translation of electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings into control signals for brain-computer interface (BCI) systems needs to be based on a robust classification of the various types of information. EEG-based BCI features are often noisy and likely to contain outliers. This contribution describes the application of a fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) with a radial basis function kernel for classifying motor imagery tasks, while the statistical features over the set of the wavelet coefficients were extracted to characterize the time-frequency distribution of EEG signals. In the proposed FSVM classifier, a low fraction of support vectors was used as a criterion for choosing the kernel parameter and the trade-off parameter, together with the membership parameter based solely on training data. FSVM and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers outperformed the winner of the BCI Competition 2003 and other similar studies on the same Graz dataset, in terms of the competition criterion of the mutual information (MI), while the FSVM classifier yielded a better performance than the SVM approach. FSVM and SVM classifiers perform much better than the winner of the BCI Competition 2005 on the same Graz dataset for the subject 03 according to the competition criterion of the maximal MI steepness, while the FSVM classifier outperforms the SVM method. The proposed FSVM model has potential in reducing the effects of noise or outliers in the online classification of EEG signals in BCIs. (C) 2009 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Critical Evaluation of Auditory Event-Related Potential Deficits in
   Schizophrenia: Evidence From Large-Scale Single-Subject Pattern
   Classification
SO SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN
AB Event-related potential (ERP) deficits associated with auditory oddball and click-conditioning paradigms are among the most consistent findings in schizophrenia and are discussed as potential biomarkers. However, it is unclear to what extend these ERP deficits distinguish between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls on a single-subject level, which is of high importance for potential translation to clinical routine. Here, we investigated 144 schizophrenia patients and 144 matched controls with an auditory click-conditioning/oddball paradigm. P50 and N1 gating ratios as well as target-locked N1 and P3 components were submitted to conventional general linear models and to explorative machine learning algorithms. Repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed significant between-group differences for the oddball-locked N1 and P3 components but not for any gating measure. Machine learning-assisted analysis achieved 77.7% balanced classification accuracy using a combination of target-locked N1 and P3 amplitudes as classifiers. The superiority of machine learning over repeated-measures analysis for classifying schizophrenia patients was in the range of about 10% as quantified by receiver operating characteristics. For the first time, our study provides large-scale single-subject classification data on auditory click-conditioning and oddball paradigms in schizophrenia. Although our study exemplifies how automated inference may substantially improve classification accuracy, our data also show that the investigated ERP measures show comparably poor discriminatory properties in single subjects, thus illustrating the need to establish either new analytical approaches for these paradigms or other paradigms to investigate the disorder.

TI Deep Learning-Based Job Placement in Distributed Machine Learning
   Clusters With Heterogeneous Workloads
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING
AB Nowadays, most leading IT companies host a variety of distributed machine learning (ML) workloads in ML clusters to support Al-driven services, such as speech recognition, machine translation, and image processing. While multiple jobs are executed concurrently in a shared cluster to improve resource utilization, interference among co-located ML jobs can lead to significant performance downgrade. Existing cluster schedulers, such as YARN and Mesos, are interference-agnostic in their job placement, leading to suboptimal resource efficiency and usage. Some literature has studied interference-aware job placement policy, but relies on detailed workload profiling and interference modeling, which is not a general solution. In this work, we present Harmony, a deep learning-driven ML cluster scheduler that places heterogeneous training jobs (either with parameter server architecture or all-reduce architecture) in a manner that minimizes interference and maximizes performance (i.e., training completion time minimization). The design of Harmony is based on a carefully designed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework enhanced with reward modeling. The DRL integrates a dynamic sequence-to-sequence model with the state-of-the-art techniques to stabilize training and improve convergence, including actor-critic algorithm, job-aware action space exploration, multi-head attention, and experience replay. In view of a common lack of reward samples corresponding to different placement decisions, we build an auxiliary sequence-to-sequence reward prediction model, which is trained with historical samples and used for producing reward for unseen placement. Experiments using real ML workloads in a Kubernetes cluster of 6 GPU servers show that Harmony outperforms representative schedulers by 16%-42% in terms of average job completion time.

TI A Non-Parametric Software Reliability Modeling Approach by Using Gene
   Expression Programming
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Software reliability growth models (SRGMs) are very important for estimating and predicting software reliability. However, because the assumptions of traditional parametric SRGMs (PSRMs) are usually not consistent with the real conditions, the prediction accuracy of PSRMs are hence not very satisfying in most cases. In contrast to PSRMs, the non-parametric SRGMs (NPSRMs) which use machine learning (ML) techniques, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and genetic programming (GP), for reliability modeling can provide better prediction results across various projects. Gene Expression Programming (GEP) which is a new evolutionary algorithm based on Genetic algorithm (GA) and GP, has been acknowledged as a powerful ML and widely used in the field of data mining. Thus, we apply GEP into non-parametric software reliability modeling in this paper due to its unique and pretty characters, such as genetic encoding method, translation process of chromosomes. This new GEP-based modeling approach considers some important characters of reliability modeling in several main components of GEP, i.e. function set, terminal criteria, fitness function, and then obtains the final NPSRM (GEP-NPSRM) by training on failure data. Finally, on several real failure data-sets based on time or coverage, four case studies are proposed by respectively comparing GEP-NPSRM with several representative PSRMs, NPSRMs based on ANN, SVM and GP in the form of fitting and prediction power which show that compared with the comparison models, the GEP-NPSRM provides a significantly better power of reliability fitting and prediction. In other words, the GEP is promising and effective for reliability modeling. So far as we know, it is the first time that GEP is applied into constructing NPSRM.

TI A Systematic Mapping of Translation-Enabling Technologies for Sign
   Languages
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Sign languages (SL) are the first language for most deaf people. Consequently, bidirectional communication among deaf and non-deaf people has always been a challenging issue. Sign language usage has increased due to inclusion policies and general public agreement, which must then become evident in information technologies, in the many facets that comprise sign language understanding and its computational treatment. In this study, we conduct a thorough systematic mapping of translation-enabling technologies for sign languages. This mapping has considered the most recommended guidelines for systematic reviews, i.e., those pertaining software engineering, since there is a need to account for interdisciplinary areas of accessibility, human computer interaction, natural language processing, and education, all of them part of ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) computing classification system directly related to software engineering. An ongoing development of a software tool called SYMPLE (SYstematic Mapping and Parallel Loading Engine) facilitated the querying and construction of a base set of candidate studies. A great diversity of topics has been studied over the last 25 years or so, but this systematic mapping allows for comfortable visualization of predominant areas, venues, top authors, and different measures of concentration and dispersion. The systematic review clearly shows a large number of classifications and subclassifications interspersed over time. This is an area of study in which there is much interest, with a basically steady level of scientific publications over the last decade, concentrated mainly in the European continent. The publications by country, nevertheless, usually favor their local sign language.

TI Turning machines: a simple algorithmic model for molecular robotics
SO NATURAL COMPUTING
AB Molecular robotics is challenging, so it seems best to keep it simple. We consider an abstract molecular robotics model based on simple folding instructions that execute asynchronously. Turning Machines are a simple 1D to 2D folding model, also easily generalisable to 2D to 3D folding. A Turning Machine starts out as a line of connected monomers in the discrete plane, each with an associated turning number. A monomer turns relative to its neighbours, executing a unit-distance translation that drags other monomers along with it, and through collective motion the initial set of monomers eventually folds into a programmed shape. We provide a suite of tools for reasoning about Turning Machines by fully characterising their ability to execute line rotations: executing an almost-full line rotation of 5 pi/3 radians is possible, yet a full 2p rotation is impossible. Furthermore, line rotations up to 5 pi/3 are executed efficiently, in O(log n) expected time in our continuous time Markov chain time model. We then show that such line-rotations represent a fundamental primitive in the model, by using them to efficiently and asynchronously fold shapes. In particular, arbitrarily large zig-zag-rastered squares and zigzag paths are foldable, as are y-monotone shapes albeit with error (bounded by perimeter length). Finally, we give shapes that despite having paths that traverse all their points, are in fact impossible to fold, as well as techniques for folding certain classes of (scaled) shapes without error. Our approach relies on careful geometric-based analyses of the feats possible and impossible by a very simple robotic system, and pushes conceptional hardness towards mathematical analysis and away from molecular implementation.

TI VECTOR PERFORMANCE ESTIMATION FOR CRAY X-MP/Y-MP SUPERCOMPUTERS .2.
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
AB The conventional method of assessing supercomputer performance by measuring the execution time of software has many shortcomings. First, effort is required to write and debug the software. Second, time on the machine is required, and additional effort is needed to verify the validity of the test. Third, alterations to the algorithm require changing the code and retiming. Fourth, a black box approach to determining machine performance leaves the user with little confidence in how well the software was optimized. We present a pencil and paper methodology for computing the execution time of vectorized loops on a Cray Research X-MP/Y-MP. With this methodology a user can accurately compute the processing rate of an algorithm before the software is actually written. When several implementations of an algorithm are designed, this methodology can be used to select the best one for development, preventing wasted coding effort on less efficient implementations. Since this methodology computes optimal machine performance, it can be used to verify the efficiency of compiler translation. Changes to algorithms are easily appraised to determine their effect on performance. While the purpose of the methodology is to compute an algorithm's execution time, a side benefit is that this technique induces the user to think in terms of optimization. Bottlenecks in the code are pinpointed, and possible options for increased performance become obvious At E-Systems, this methodology has become an integral part of the software development of vector-intensive code. This article is written specifically for Cray Research X-MP/Y-MP supercomputers, but many of the general concepts are applicable to other machines and therefore should benefit a number of supercomputer users.

TI Machine and deep learning methods for radiomics
SO MEDICAL PHYSICS
AB Radiomics is an emerging area in quantitative image analysis that aims to relate large-scale extracted imaging information to clinical and biological endpoints. The development of quantitative imaging methods along with machine learning has enabled the opportunity to move data science research towards translation for more personalized cancer treatments. Accumulating evidence has indeed demonstrated that noninvasive advanced imaging analytics, that is, radiomics, can reveal key components of tumor phenotype for multiple three-dimensional lesions at multiple time points over and beyond the course of treatment. These developments in the use of CT, PET, US, and MR imaging could augment patient stratification and prognostication buttressing emerging targeted therapeutic approaches. In recent years, deep learning architectures have demonstrated their tremendous potential for image segmentation, reconstruction, recognition, and classification. Many powerful open-source and commercial platforms are currently available to embark in new research areas of radiomics. Quantitative imaging research, however, is complex and key statistical principles should be followed to realize its full potential. The field of radiomics, in particular, requires a renewed focus on optimal study design/reporting practices and standardization of image acquisition, feature calculation, and rigorous statistical analysis for the field to move forward. In this article, the role of machine and deep learning as a major computational vehicle for advanced model building of radiomics-based signatures or classifiers, and diverse clinical applications, working principles, research opportunities, and available computational platforms for radiomics will be reviewed with examples drawn primarily from oncology. We also address issues related to common applications in medical physics, such as standardization, feature extraction, model building, and validation.

TI Improving AutoDock Vina Using Random Forest: The Growing Accuracy of
   Binding Affinity Prediction by the Effective Exploitation of Larger Data
   Sets
SO MOLECULAR INFORMATICS
AB There is a growing body of evidence showing that machine learning regression results in more accurate structure-based prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity. Docking methods that aim at optimizing the affinity of ligands for a target rely on how accurate their predicted ranking is. However, despite their proven advantages, machine-learning scoring functions are still not widely applied. This seems to be due to insufficient understanding of their properties and the lack of user-friendly software implementing them. Here we present a study where the accuracy of AutoDock Vina, arguably the most commonly-used docking software, is strongly improved by following a machine learning approach. We also analyse the factors that are responsible for this improvement and their generality. Most importantly, with the help of a proposed benchmark, we demonstrate that this improvement will be larger as more data becomes available for training Random Forest models, as regression models implying additive functional forms do not improve with more training data. We discuss how the latter opens the door to new opportunities in scoring function development. In order to facilitate the translation of this advance to enhance structure-based molecular design, we provide software to directly re-score Vina-generated poses and thus strongly improve their predicted binding affinity. The software is available at http://istar.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/rf-score-3.tgz and http://crcm.marseille.inserm.fr/fileadmin/rf-score-3.tgz

TI Applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning in
   orthodontics: a scoping review
SO PROGRESS IN ORTHODONTICS
AB Introduction This scoping review aims to provide an overview of the existing evidence on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in orthodontics, its translation into clinical practice, and what limitations do exist that have precluded their envisioned application. Methods A scoping review of the literature was carried out following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. PubMed was searched until July 2020. Results Sixty-two articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A total of 43 out of the 62 studies (69.35%) were published this last decade. The majority of these studies were from the USA (11), followed by South Korea (9) and China (7). The number of studies published in non-orthodontic journals (36) was more extensive than in orthodontic journals (26). Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were found to be the most commonly utilized AI/ML algorithm (13 studies), followed by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Support Vector Machine (SVM) (9 studies each), and regression (8 studies). The most commonly studied domains were diagnosis and treatment planning-either broad-based or specific (33), automated anatomic landmark detection and/or analyses (19), assessment of growth and development (4), and evaluation of treatment outcomes (2). The different characteristics and distribution of these studies have been displayed and elucidated upon therein. Conclusion This scoping review suggests that there has been an exponential increase in the number of studies involving various orthodontic applications of AI and ML. The most commonly studied domains were diagnosis and treatment planning, automated anatomic landmark detection and/or analyses, and growth and development assessment.

TI Accuracy of diagnostic classification algorithms using cognitive-,
   electrophysiological-, and neuroanatomical data in antipsychotic-naive
   schizophrenia patients
SO PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE
AB Background. A wealth of clinical studies have identified objective biomarkers, which separate schizophrenia patients from healthy controls on a group level, but current diagnostic systems solely include clinical symptoms. In this study, we investigate if machine learning algorithms on multimodal data can serve as a framework for clinical translation.
   Methods. Forty-six antipsychotic-naive, first-episode schizophrenia patients and 58 controls underwent neurocognitive tests, electrophysiology, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients underwent clinical assessments before and after 6 weeks of antipsychotic monotherapy with amisulpride. Nine configurations of different supervised machine learning algorithms were applied to first estimate the unimodal diagnostic accuracy, and next to estimate the multimodal diagnostic accuracy. Finally, we explored the predictability of symptom remission.
   Results. Cognitive data significantly dassified patients from controls (accuracies = 60-69%; p values = 0.0001-0.009). Accuracies of electrophysiology, structural MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging did not exceed chance level. Multimodal analyses with cognition plus any combination of one or more of the remaining three modalities did not outperform cognition alone. None of the modalities predicted symptom remission.
   Conclusions. In this multivariate and multimodal study in antipsychotic-nalve patients, only cognition significantly discriminated patients from controls, and no modality appeared to predict short-term symptom remission. Overall, these findings add to the increasing call for cognition to be included in the definition of schizophrenia. To bring about the full potential of machine learning algorithms in first-episode, antipsychotic-nalve schizophrenia patients, careful a priori variable selection based on independent data as well as inclusion of other modalities may be required.

TI Thy-Wise: An interpretable machine learning model for the evaluation of
   thyroid nodules
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB Current risk stratification systems for thyroid nodules suffer from low specificity and high biopsy rates. Recently, machine learning (ML) is introduced to assist thyroid nodule diagnosis but lacks interpretability. Here, we developed and validated ML models on 3965 thyroid nodules, as compared to the American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging, Reporting and Data System (ACR TI-RADS). Subsequently, a SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) algorithm was leveraged to interpret the results of the best-performing ML model. Clinical characteristics including thyroid-function tests were collected from medical records. Five ACR TI-RADS ultrasonography (US) categories plus nodule size were assessed by experienced radiologists. Random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were used to build US-only and US-clinical ML models. The ML models and ACR TI-RADS were compared in terms of diagnostic performance and unnecessary biopsy rate. Among the ML models, the US-only RF model (hereafter, Thy-Wise) achieved the optimal performance. Compared to ACR TI-RADS, Thy-Wise showed higher accuracy (82.4% vs 74.8% for the internal validation; 82.1% vs 73.4% for external validation) and specificity (78.7% vs 68.3% for internal validation; 78.5% vs 66.9% for external validation) while maintaining sensitivity (91.7% vs 91.2% for internal validation; 91.9% vs 91.1% for external validation), as well as reduced unnecessary biopsies (15.3% vs 32.3% for internal validation; 15.7% vs 47.3% for external validation). The SHAP-based interpretation of Thy-Wise enables clinicians to better understand the reasoning behind the diagnosis, which may facilitate the clinical translation of this model.

   Materials and methods: This retrospective study consisted of 1874 persons-under-investigation for COVID-19 between February 7, 2020, and May 27, 2020 at Stony Brook University Hospital, New York. Two primary outcomes were ICU admission and mortality compared to COVID-19 positive patients in general hospital admission. Demographic, vitals, symptoms, imaging findings, comorbidities, and laboratory tests at presentation were collected. Predictions of mortality and ICU admission were made using machine learning with 80% training and 20% testing. Performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC).
   Results: A total of 635 patients were included in the analysis (age 60 +/- 11, 40.2% female). The top 6 mortality predictors were age, procalcitonin, C-creative protein, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer and lymphocytes. The top 6 ICU admission predictors are procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, C-creative protein, pulse oxygen saturation, temperature and ferritin. The best machine learning algorithms predicted mortality with 89% AUC and ICU admission with 79% AUC.
   Conclusion: This study identifies key independent clinical parameters that predict ICU admission and mortality associated with COVID-19 infection. The predictive model is practical, readily enhanced and retrained using additional data. This approach has immediate translation and may prove useful for frontline physicians in clinical decision making under time-sensitive and resource-constrained environment.

TI Cognitive distortions among pathological sports bettors compared with
   slot machine gamblers - an analysis based on the Gamblers' Beliefs
   Questionnaire
SO SUCHT-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR WISSENSCHAFT UND PRAXIS
AB Objective: International gambling research has shown that cognitive distortions correlate with problem gambling. However, studies focussing on specific groups of gamblers which prefer certain forms of gambling are rather scarce. This is the first study to analyse and discuss cognitive distortions among pathological sports bettors and slot machine gamblers in a group comparison. Methods: The article presents the results of paper-and-pencil interviews with 72 slot machine gamblers and 37 sports bettors. The respondents met a minimum of five DSM-IV-criteria. The Gamblers' Beliefs Questionnaire (GBQ) was used to assess the cognitive experiences of the study participants. This instrument consists of two subscales which distinguish between the domains "luck/perseverance" and "illusion of control". Furthermore, a global score which represents the total of both subscores can be reported. Statistical significance of differences between the two groups of gamblers was tested using chi-square tests (for ordinal scale variables) or variance analyses (for metric variables). Results: The global score was significantly higher for the sports bettors than for the slot machine gamblers (96.0 vs. 81.4), i.e., cognitive distortions are stronger in this group than in the second group. With regard to the subscales, the sports bettors reach higher scores for both luck/perseverance (56.9 vs. 50.7) and illusion of control (39.2 vs. 30.7). Conclusions: Therapeutic processing of cognitive distortions should play a considerable role in the treatment of pathological gambling. This is particularly the case for pathological sports bettors. Furthermore, preventive interventions should be implemented in order to avoid the development of erroneous beliefs and illusions of control.

TI Integrated machine learning, molecular docking and 3D-QSAR based
   approach for identification of potential inhibitors of trypanosomal
   N-myristoyltransferase
SO MOLECULAR BIOSYSTEMS
AB N-Myristoyltransferase (NMT) catalyzes the transfer of myristate to the amino-terminal glycine of a subset of proteins, a co-translational modification involved in trafficking substrate proteins to membrane locations, stabilization and protein-protein interactions. It is a studied and validated pre-clinical drug target for fungal and parasitic infections. In the present study, a machine learning approach, docking studies and CoMFA analysis have been integrated with the objective of translation of knowledge into a pipelined workflow towards the identification of putative hits through the screening of large compound libraries. In the proposed pipeline, the reported parasitic NMT inhibitors have been used to develop predictive machine learning classification models. Simultaneously, a TbNMT complex model was generated to establish the relationship between the binding mode of the inhibitors for LmNMT and TbNMT through molecular dynamics simulation studies. A 3D-QSAR model was developed and used to predict the activity of the proposed hits in the subsequent step. The hits classified as active based on the machine learning model were assessed as the potential anti-trypanosomal NMT inhibitors through molecular docking studies, predicted activity using a QSAR model and visual inspection. In the final step, the proposed pipeline was validated through in vitro experiments. A total of seven hits have been proposed and tested in vitro for evaluation of dual inhibitory activity against Leishmania donovani and Trypanosoma brucei. Out of these five compounds showed significant inhibition against both of the organisms. The common topmost active compound SEW04173 belongs to a pyrazole carboxylate scaffold and is anticipated to enrich the chemical space with enhanced potency through optimization.

TI Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and body composition
SO CURRENT OPINION IN CLINICAL NUTRITION AND METABOLIC CARE
AB Purpose of review
   Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry is now widely adopted for the measurement of the fat, fat-free soft tissue and bone mineral compartments of the body. Whereas it is regarded by many as a reference technique for such measurements, it is not without limitations. Inter and intra-manufacturer differences have been areas of concern. This review focuses on recent literature addressing these areas and the issue of validity.
   Recent findings Body composition measurements using newer generation dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry machines compared between different manufacturers and compared with earlier instruments continue to show differences that may be unacceptable, particularly for investigators upgrading their machines or involved in multicentre studies using different machines. In terms of validity, significant deviations at a group level are reported when compared with reference four-component models, and perhaps more importantly, wide limits of agreement are seen that are a concern for the interpretation of results at an individual level.
   Summary It is important that investigators recognize the limitations of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry technology in the interpretation of their results. There is a continuing need both for inter-machine comparisons and validation studies against accepted criterion methods, particularly as new software or technological changes are introduced. Such studies permit the development of translation equations for the cross-calibration of devices, and may be vital for cross-sectional studies. For longitudinal studies in many populations, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry is without question a valuable technique for the measurement of compositional changes, both at the total body and regional levels.

TI Machine Learning Enabled Leukocyte Quantification Using Smartphone
   Coupled 3D Printed Microfluidic Biosensor
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Leukocyte quantification from whole blood can aid in detecting and managing infections, cardiovascular diseases, and immune system responses. In addition to traditional leukocyte quantification devices such as flow cytometers and benchtop fluorescent microscopes, smartphone-based particle quantifiers are becoming popular because they provide results at a fraction of the cost. One major limitation of these smartphone-based devices is their dependence on desktop computers for data processing, which keeps them from reaching their true translation potential as point of care (POC) devices. In this paper, we present a computer vision and machine learning-enabled methodology to count particles imaged from our 3D printed smartphone-coupled fluorescent microscope. Multiple convolution neural networks (CNN) using different filter sizes were implemented and trained with various learning rates (0.001, 0.0001) and batch sizes (8,16,32). The performance of these trained networks was then tested on green fluorescent microparticles and leukocytes and compared against the ground truth obtained using ImageJ. An R-2 value of 0.99 was observed. Next, when cross-validation was done to validate the efficacy of the designed CNN architecture, and the predicted results showed a good correlation (R-2 = 0.99) when compared against the ground truth. The performance of the trained model was also evaluated on particles conjugated with a different fluorophore and an R-2 value of 0.99 was observed, showcasing its efficacy and versatility. This trained model was then integrated into an Application Programming Interface (API) and is available online for the broader community usage.

AB Three Dimensional (3D) maintenance data provides a link between design and technical documentation creating interactive 3D graphical training and maintenance material. It becomes difficult for an operator to always go through huge paper manuals or come running to the computer for doing maintenance of a machine which makes the maintenance work fatigue. Above being the case, a 3D animation makes maintenance work very simple since, there is no language harrier. The research deals with the generation of 3D maintenance data of any given machine. The best tool for obtaining the 3L) maintenance is selected and the tool is analyzed. Using the same tool, a detailed process for extracting the 3D maintenance data for any machine is set. This project aims at selecting the best tool for obtaining 3D maintenance data and to select the detailed process for obtaining 3D maintenance data. 3D maintenance reduces use of big volumes of manuals which creates human errors and makes the work of an operator fatiguing. Hence 3-D maintenance would help in training and maintenance and would increase productivity. 3Dvia when compared with Cortona 3D and Deep Exploration proves to be better than them. 3Dvia is good in data translation and it has the best renderings compared to the other two 3D maintenance software. 3Dvia is very user friendly and it has various options for creating 3D animations. Its Interactive Electronic Technical Publication (IETP) integration is also better than the other two software. Hence 3Dvia proves to be the best software for obtaining 3D maintenance data of any machine.

TI Machine Learning Applications for Differentiation of Glioma from Brain
   Metastasis-A Systematic Review
SO CANCERS
AB Simple Summary We present a systematic review of published reports on machine learning (ML) applications for the differentiation of gliomas from brain metastases by summarizing study characteristics, strengths, and pitfalls. Based on these findings, we present recommendations for future research in this field. Glioma and brain metastasis can be difficult to distinguish on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to the similarity of imaging features in specific clinical circumstances. Multiple studies have investigated the use of machine learning (ML) models for non-invasive differentiation of glioma from brain metastasis. Many of the studies report promising classification results, however, to date, none have been implemented into clinical practice. After a screening of 12,470 studies, we included 29 eligible studies in our systematic review. From each study, we aggregated data on model design, development, and best classifiers, as well as quality of reporting according to the TRIPOD statement. In a subset of eligible studies, we conducted a meta-analysis of the reported AUC. It was found that data predominantly originated from single-center institutions (n = 25/29) and only two studies performed external validation. The median TRIPOD adherence was 0.48, indicating insufficient quality of reporting among surveyed studies. Our findings illustrate that despite promising classification results, reliable model assessment is limited by poor reporting of study design and lack of algorithm validation and generalizability. Therefore, adherence to quality guidelines and validation on outside datasets is critical for the clinical translation of ML for the differentiation of glioma and brain metastasis.

TI Application of machine learning methods to bridge the gap between
   non-interventional studies and randomized controlled trials in
   ophthalmic patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration
SO CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS
AB Purpose: The effectiveness of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents is usually lower in real world settings compared with randomized clinical trials (RCTs), often limiting the use of real-world evidence (RWE) in regulatory and healthcare decisions. The current analysis aimed to develop and validate an algorithm to explain the difference in outcomes between RWE studies and RCTs in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration.
   Methods: The algorithm was developed using ranibizumab real world data (RWD) from the US and validated on Australian and UK RWD. A decision model was developed using machine learning principles, in which the model learns how to partition the most influential factors (out of 59 variables) so that they maximally relate to the change in visual acuity (VA) over 12 months.
   Results: The algorithm identified baseline VA <73 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters, presence of baseline subretinal fluid, and administration of three loading doses by Day 90 from drug initiation as the characteristics with the greatest impact on VA at month 12. When applying the different criteria, RWE outcomes became similar to those obtained in known RCTs.
   Conclusion: Machine learning techniques can be used to classify real world cohorts and identify subsets of patients who benefit to the same extent as that reported in RCTs. This methodology may support the translation of clinical trial findings to treatment performance in the clinical practice setting.

TI Machine vs. deep learning comparision for developing an international
   sign language translator
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB This study aims to enable deaf and hard-of-hearing people to communicate with other individuals who know and do not know sign language. The mobile application was developed for video classification by using MediaPipe Library in the study. While doing this, considering the problems that deaf and hearing loss individuals face in Turkey and abroad modelling and training stages were carried out with the English language option. With the real-time translation feature added to the study individuals were provided with instant communication. In this way, communication problems experienced by hearing-impaired individuals will be greatly reduced. Machine learning and Deep learning concepts were investigated in the study. Model creation and training stages were carried out using VGG16, OpenCV, Pandas, Keras, and Os libraries. Due to the low success rate in the model created using VGG16, the MediaPipe library was used in the formation and training stages of the model. The reason for this is that, thanks to the solutions available in the MediaPipe library, it can normalise the coordinates in 3D by marking the regions to be detected in the human body. Being able to extract the coordinates independently of the background and body type in the videos in the dataset increases the success rate of the model in the formation and training stages. As a result of an experiment, the accuracy rate of the deep learning model is 85% and the application can be easily integrated with different languages. It is concluded that deep learning model is more accure than machine learning one and the communication problem faced by hearing-impaired individuals in many countries can be reduced easily.

TI Overview of image-to-image translation by use of deep neural networks:
   denoising, super-resolution, modality conversion, and reconstruction in
   medical imaging
SO RADIOLOGICAL PHYSICS AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Since the advent of deep convolutional neural networks (DNNs), computer vision has seen an extremely rapid progress that has led to huge advances in medical imaging. Every year, many new methods are reported at conferences such as the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention and Machine Learning for Medical Image Reconstruction, or published online at the preprint server arXiv. There is a plethora of surveys on applications of neural networks in medical imaging (see [1] for a relatively recent comprehensive survey). This article does not aim to cover all aspects of the field, but focuses on a particular topic, image-to-image translation. Although the topic may not sound familiar, it turns out that many seemingly irrelevant applications can be understood as instances of image-to-image translation. Such applications include (1) noise reduction, (2) super-resolution, (3) image synthesis, and (4) reconstruction. The same underlying principles and algorithms work for various tasks. Our aim is to introduce some of the key ideas on this topic from a uniform viewpoint. We introduce core ideas and jargon that are specific to image processing by use of DNNs. Having an intuitive grasp of the core ideas of applications of neural networks in medical imaging and a knowledge of technical terms would be of great help to the reader for understanding the existing and future applications. Most of the recent applications which build on image-to-image translation are based on one of two fundamental architectures, called pix2pix and CycleGAN, depending on whether the available training data are paired or unpaired (see Sect. 1.3). We provide codes ([2, 3]) which implement these two architectures with various enhancements. Our codes are available online with use of the very permissive MIT license. We provide a hands-on tutorial for training a model for denoising based on our codes (see Sect. 6). We hope that this article, together with the codes, will provide both an overview and the details of the key algorithms and that it will serve as a basis for the development of new applications.

TI Correlation of Condylar Translation During Maximal Mouth Opening with
   Presence of Signs of Temporomandibular Joint Disorders in an
   Asymptomatic Population of 18-25 Years Age Group of Northern India
SO OPEN DENTISTRY JOURNAL
AB Objective(s):
   The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of "subluxation" and presence of clinical signs of Temporomandibular Joint Disorder (TMD) in asymptomatic individuals and its distribution according to age and sex.
   Materials and Methods:
   The material investigated comprised of 200 asymptomatic subjects with 400 joints. The subjects were divided into two groups of 18-25 years and 50-60 years of age consisting of equal number of males and females. Clinical examination involved measurement of maximal inter-incisal distance, joint sounds and deviation. For radiological examination, Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) open mouth close mouth view option (TMJ1/2) was used on a Digital Panoramic Machine. All the radiographs were traced to assess subluxation and anterior translation of the condyle. The statistical analysis was carried out using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, version 15.0 for Windows).
   Results:
   The prevalence of the signs of TMDs in the asymptomatic population was found to be very high and more predominant in females as compared to males. Furthermore, the older age group had comparatively less signs of TMDs. It was of interest that the subjects presenting with clinical signs of TMD were significantly less as compared to the subjects presenting with subluxation. The value of anterior translation was found to be more in females in the younger age group as compared to the males. Similarly, it was more in males as compared to females in older age group. But the mean anterior translation difference in females in 18-25 years and 50-60 years showed a statistically significant difference with P-value 0.017.
   Conclusion:
   Subluxation is a very common feature found in almost all the subjects in this study with a high prevalence. Hence, we may assume that the increased incidence of TMDs could be a direct result of the phenomena of subluxation. The decrease in mandibular length could be the cause of decreased mouth opening and increased subluxation.

AB Lack of applications has always been a serious concern for designing machines with a new but incompatible ISA. To address this concern, binary translation is one common technique to migrate applications from one legacy ISA to new ones. In the past, dynamic binary translation (DBT) has been more widely adopted for migrating applications since it avoids some challenging problems for binary translation such as code discovery for variable length ISA and code location issues for handling indirect branches. Static binary translation (SBT) is usually regarded as a less general solution and has not been actively researched on. However, SBT has advantages of performing more aggressive optimizations, which could yield more compact code and greater code quality. In general, SBT translated applications are likely to consume less memory, processor cycles and power, and can be started more quickly. All the above advantages are more critical for embedded systems than for general systems. Therefore, we believe that even though SBT is not as general as DBT, it has a unique role to play for migrating applications in embedded systems.
   In this paper, we designed and implemented a new portable SBT tool, called LLBT, which translates source binary into LLVM IR and then retargets the LLVM IR to various ISAs by using the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Using the LLVM compiler infrastructure, LLBT successfully leverages two important functionalities from LLVM: the comprehensive optimizations and the retargetability. For example, most DBTs map guest architecture states into the host registers to minimize accessing guest architecture states with memory operations, but must deal with guest architecture state saving/reloading at trace/block entry/exit points. LLBT can treat the complete application binary as a single function and uses the global register allocation optimization in LLVM to consistently map guest architecture states in host registers so as to avoid the costly state saving and reloading at trace/block exits.
   In this paper, we have shown our ARM-based LLBT can effectively migrate EEMBC benchmark Suite from ARMv5 to Intel IA32, Intel x64, MIPS, and other ARMs such as ARMv7. On the Intel i7 based host systems, the LLBT generated code can run 3 to 64 times faster than emulating with QEMU, which uses the DBT technique.

AB Specifications for digital systems are provided in natural language, and engineers undertake significant efforts to translate these into the programming languages understood by compilers for digital systems. Automating this process allows designers to work with the language in which they are most comfortable - the original natural language - and focus instead on other downstream design challenges. We explore the use of state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) to automatically derive Verilog snippets from English via fine-tuning GPT-2, a natural language ML system. We describe our approach for producing a suitable dataset of novice-level digital design tasks and provide a detailed exploration of GPT-2, finding encouraging translation performance across our task sets (94.8 % correct), with the ability to handle both simple and abstract design tasks.

AB The preprocessing pipelines in Natural Language Processing usually involve a step of removing sentences consisted of illegal characters. The definition of illegal characters and the specific removal strategy depend on the task, language, domain, etc, which often lead to tiresome and repetitive scripting of rules. In this paper, we introduce a simple statistical method, uniblock1, to overcome this problem. For each sentence, uniblock generates a fixed-size feature vector using Unicode block information of the characters. A Gaussian mixture model is then estimated on some clean corpus using variational inference. The learned model can then be used to score sentences and filter corpus. We present experimental results on Sentiment Analysis, Language-Modeling and Machine Translation, and show the simplicity and effectiveness of our method.

AB We present an approach to automate the process of discovering optimization methods, with a focus on deep learning architectures. We train a Recurrent Neural Network controller to generate a string in a specific domain language that describes a mathematical update equation based on a list of primitive functions, such as the gradient, running average of the gradient, etc. The controller is trained with Reinforcement Learning to maximize the performance of a model after a few epochs. On CIFAR-10, our method discovers several update rules that are better than many commonly used optimizers, such as Adam, RMSProp, or SGD with and without Momentum on a ConvNet model. These optimizers can also be transferred to perform well on different neural network architectures, including Google's neural machine translation system.

TI Extracting Parallel Sentences from Nonparallel Corpora Using Parallel
   Hierarchical Attention Network
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB Collecting parallel sentences from nonparallel data is a long-standing natural language processing research problem. In particular, parallel training sentences are very important for the quality of machine translation systems. While many existing methods have shown encouraging results, they cannot learn various alignment weights in parallel sentences. To address this issue, we propose a novel parallel hierarchical attention neural network which encodes monolingual sentences versus bilingual sentences and construct a classifier to extract parallel sentences. In particular, our attention mechanism structure can learn different alignment weights of words in parallel sentences. Experimental results show that our model can obtain state-of-the-art performance on the English-French, English-German, and English-Chinese dataset of BUCC 2017 shared task about parallel sentences' extraction.

We develop a model of virtualization that accounts for virtual addresses, physical and machine addresses, memory mappings, page tables, translation lookaside buffer, and cache; and provides an operational semantics for a representative set of actions, including reads and writes, allocation and deallocation, context switching, and hypercalls. We prove a non-interference result on the model that shows that an adversary cannot discover secret information using cache side-channels, from a constant-time victim.

We present a reliable method based on a novel set of features belonging to two different categories, linearity and regularity, invariant to translation and scaling. Specifically, a novel linearity measure derived from the histogram of straight line segment lengths is introduced. The resulting framework is independent of the document layout and supports any latin language used. Its performances are assessed on real documents dataset comprising heterogeneous administrative images. Experimental results demonstrate its accuracy, allowing up to 90% recognition rate.

The disadvantage of the MLD model is the different model of one system. The paper focus on giving a normal procedure to model of system. In order to use the MLD we model the hybrid system as four part: Switched affine system(SAS), Finite state machine(FSM), The event generator(EG) and the mode selector(MS). We discussed the translation method of the four components to MLD model by giving the normal function. Finally we give the step to produce the MLD model.

AB Di(acylamino) pyridines successfully template the formation of hydrogen-bonded rotaxanes through five-component clipping reactions. A solid-state study showed the participation of the pyridine nitrogen atom in the stabilization of the mechanical bond between the thread and the benzylic amide macrocycle. The addition of external complementary binders to a series of interlocked bis(2,6-di(acylamino)pyridines) promoted restraint of the back and forward ring motion. The original translation can be restored through a competitive recognition event by the addition of a preorganized bis(di(acylamino) pyridine) that forms stronger ADA-DAD complexes with the external binders.

AB For many languages, an expert-defined phonetic lexicon may not exist. One popular alternative is the use of a grapheme-based lexicon. However, there may be a significant difference between the orthography and the pronunciation of the language. In our previous work, we proposed a statistical machine translation based approach to improving grapheme-based pronunciations. Without knowledge of true target pronunciations, a phrase table was created where each individual rule improved the likelihood of the training data when applied. The approach improved recognition accuracy, but required significant computational cost. In this work, we propose an improvement that increases the speed of the process by more than 80 times without decreasing recognition accuracy.

AB Molecular machines that assemble polymers in a programmed sequence are fundamental to life. They are also an achievable goal of nanotechnology. Here, we report synthetic molecular machinery made from DNA that controls and records the formation of covalent bonds. We show that an autonomous cascade of DNA hybridization reactions can create oligomers, from building blocks linked by olefin or peptide bonds, with a sequence defined by a reconfigurable molecular program. The system can also be programmed to achieve combinatorial assembly. The sequence of assembly reactions and thus the structure of each oligomer synthesized is recorded in a DNA molecule, which enables this information to be recovered by PCR amplification followed by DNA sequencing.

This article mainly introduces numbering the sememes and presents a more accurate method of decomposing the concept description type. The experiment shows that the algorithm of word similarity presented in this article is simple and feasible, and the computed results are relatively consistent with awareness.

AB Understanding the behavior of source code written in an unfamiliar programming language is difficult. One way to aid understanding of difficult code is to add corresponding pseudo-code, which describes in detail the workings of the code in a natural language such as English. In spite of its usefulness, most source code does not have corresponding pseudo-code because it is tedious to create. This paper demonstrates a tool Pseudogen that makes it possible to automatically generate pseudo-code from source code using statistical machine translation (SMT).(1) Pseudogen currently supports generation of English or Japanese pseudo-code from Python source code, and the SMT framework makes it easy for users to create new generators for their preferred source code/pseudo-code pairs.

AB In safety-critical machine learning applications, it is crucial to defend models against adversarial attacks - small modifications of the input that change the predictions. Besides rigorously studied l(p)-bounded additive perturbations, semantic perturbations (e.g. rotation, translation) raise a serious concern on deploying ML systems in real-world. Therefore, it is important to provide provable guarantees for deep learning models against semantically meaningful input transformations. In this paper, we propose a new universal probabilistic certification approach based on Chernoff-Cramer bounds that can be used in general attack settings. We estimate the probability of a model to fail if the attack is sampled from a certain distribution. Our theoretical findings are supported by experimental results on different datasets.

AB The spell checker is used in the pre-processing phase of Natural Language Processing systems for applications like Opinion Mining, Text Summarization, Machine Translation, Chathot etc. A traditional spell checker tool compares the inputted string with an available dictionary of correct words. But as it works on string matching concepts, it is not able to handle inflected words. So, there is a need for a spell checker that overcomes this limitation. In this paper, the Gujarati spell checker tool 'Jodani' is proposed which works on root words, uses string similarity measures to identify wrongly spelled words, and attempts to auto-correct the word or suggest syntactically relevant words.

AB Attentional models are distinctly characterized by their ability to learn relative importance, i.e., assigning a different weight to input values. This paper proposes a new quasi-attention that is compositional in nature, i.e., learning whether to add, subtract or nullify a certain vector when learning representations. This is strongly contrasted with vanilla attention, which simply re-weights input tokens. Our proposed Compositional De-Attention (CoDA) is fundamentally built upon the intuition of both similarity and dissimilarity (negative affinity) when computing affinity scores, benefiting from a greater extent of expressiveness. We evaluate CoDA on six NLP tasks, i.e. open domain question answering, retrieval/ranking, natural language inference, machine translation, sentiment analysis and text2code generation. We obtain promising experimental results, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several tasks/datasets.

AB The ribosome as a complex molecular machine undergoes significant conformational changes while synthesizing a protein molecule. Molecular dynamics simulations have been used as complementary approaches to X-ray crystallography and cryoelectron microscopy, as well as biochemical methods, to answer many questions that modern structural methods leave unsolved. In this review, we demonstrate that all-atom modeling of ribosome molecular dynamics is particularly useful in describing the process of tRNA translocation, atomic details of behavior of nascent peptides, antibiotics, and other small molecules in the ribosomal tunnel, and the putative mechanism of allosteric signal transmission to functional sites of the ribosome.

Under the driving of electromagnetic force and restricting of the oldham coupling mechanism, the rotor was constrained to move by circle translation and drives the cycloid machine to output big torque. The control method was found, and the flux linkage characteristic was calculated through finite element method; additionally, the static torque was calculated utilizing the magnetic coenergy principle. The theory analysis is identical with the results obtained from the prototype experiments results. The prototype experiment and analysis testify the designed motor.

The language specific components, the lexicon and the rules, can be combined with a runtime engine applicable to all languages. Building Morphological analyzer/generator for morphologically complex and agglutinative language like Kannada is highly challenging. The major types of morphological process like inflection, derivation, and compounding are handled in this system.

AB This paper describes a methodology for constructing aligned German-Chinese corpora from movie subtitles. The corpora will be used to train a special machine translation system with intention to automatically translate the subtitles between German and Chinese. Since the common length-based algorithm for alignment shows weakness on short spoken sentences, especially on those from different language families, this paper studies to use dynamic programming based on time-shift information in subtitles, and extends it with statistical lexical cues to align the subtitle. In our experiment with around 4,000 Chinese and German sentences, the proposed alignment approach yields 83.8% precision. Furthermore, it is unrelated to languages, and leads to a general method of parallel corpora building between different language families.

In addition we propose an effective combination schema for them. We study how much combination approach scores correlate to human scorings and other evaluation metrics. In spite of the simplicity of these shallow NLP methods, they achieve state-of-the art correlations to the teacher's scores while keeping the language-independence and without requiring any domain specific knowledge.

The basic idea of the application reflects the concept of interactive interfaces mediating the redistribution of cognitive tasks between people and machines. As the proactive principle advocate computers toward monitoring the user instead of waiting for his/her commands, we present a framework for the realization of this system by analysing gaze patterns with the help of time series analysis techniques and using a safe gaze tracking system that does not affect the user's eyes if used during long hours.

AB This paper addresses the efficiency challenge of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) by formulating the task as a ranking problem. Previous methods require numerous training examples to estimate the accurate performance of architectures, although the actual goal is to find the distinction between "good" and "bad" candidates. Here we do not resort to performance predictors. Instead, we propose a performance ranking method (RankNAS) via pairwise ranking. It enables efficient architecture search using much fewer training examples. Moreover, we develop an architecture selection method to prune the search space and concentrate on more promising candidates. Extensive experiments on machine translation and language modeling tasks show that RankNAS can design high-performance architectures while being orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art NAS systems.

TI Charging the code - tRNA modification complexes
SO CURRENT OPINION IN STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY
AB All types of cellular RNAs are post-transcriptionally modified, constituting the so called 'epitranscriptome'. In particular, tRNAs and their anticodon stem loops represent major modification hotspots. The attachment of small chemical groups at the heart of the ribosomal decoding machinery can directly affect translational rates, reading frame maintenance, co-translational folding dynamics and overall proteome stability. The variety of tRNA modification patterns is driven by the activity of specialized tRNA modifiers and large modification complexes. Notably, the absence or dysfunction of these cellular machines is correlated with several human pathophysiologies. In this review, we aim to highlight the most recent scientific progress and summarize currently available structural information of the most prominent eukaryotic tRNA modifiers.

   This article presents undergoing work aiming at providing security guaranties to different users utilizing different cores in a manycore architecture. The proposed solution is using physical isolation and a hypervisor with minimum rights, although the work described in the paper focuses only on hardware mechanisms. We present a hardware module providing an address translation service allowing to fully virtualize operating systems, while offering advantages compared to a classical memory management unit within our context. Experiments made on a virtual prototype shows that our solution has a low time overhead - typically 3% on average.

AB Phonetization is a crucial step for oral document processing. In this paper, a new letter-to-phoneme conversion approach is proposed; it is automatic, simple, portable and efficient. It relies on a machine learning technique initially developed for transliteration and translation; the system infers rewriting rules from examples of words with their phonetic representations. This approach is evaluated in the framework of the Pronalsyl Pascal challenge, which includes several datasets on different languages. The obtained results equal or outperform those of the best known systems. Moreover, thanks to the simplicity of our technique, the inference time of our approach is much lower than those of the best performing state-of-the-art systems.

AB The ribosome is a complex molecular machine, with moving parts, many of which are structural elements of rRNA. We compared the X-ray crystal structures of three different functional states of the 30 S ribosomal subunit - two from crystal structures of the isolated 30 S subunit from the Ramakrishnan group and one from a complex of the 70 S ribosome. Even though all three structures are in what could be called the 'ground state' of the subunit, many conformational differences are found, distributed over the whole structure. A striking example is the undulating movement of the penultimate stem of 16S rRNA, which forms several intersubunit bridges with the 50 S subunit.

AB Automatic surgical instruction generation is a prerequisite towards intra-operative context-aware surgical assistance. However, generating instructions from surgical scenes is challenging, as it requires jointly understanding the surgical activity of current view and modelling relationships between visual information and textual description. Inspired by the neural machine translation and imaging captioning tasks in open domain, we introduce a transformer-backboned encoder-decoder network with self-critical reinforcement learning to generate instructions from surgical images. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on DAISI dataset, which includes 290 procedures from various medical disciplines. Our approach outperforms the existing baseline over all caption evaluation metrics. The results demonstrate the benefits of the encoder-decoder structure backboned by transformer in handling multimodal context.

AB Neural network models have achieved a human-level performance in many application domains, including image classification, speech recognition and machine translation. However, in credit scoring application, neural network approach has been useless because of its black box nature that the relationship between contextual input and output cannot be completely understood. In this study, we investigate the advanced neural network approach and its' explanation for credit scoring. We use the LIME technique to interpret the black box of such neural network and verify its' trustworthiness by comparing a high interpretable logistic model. The results show that neural network models give higher accuracy and equivalent explanation with the logistic model.

AB As we strive for sophisticated machine translation and reliable information extraction, we have launched a subproject pertaining to modelling human interpreters. The model is based on ReALIS, a new "post-Montagovian" discourse-semantic theory concerning the formal interpretation of sentences constituting coherent discourses, with a lifelong model of lexical, interpersonal and cultural / encyclopedic knowledge of interpreters in its center including their reciprocal knowledge on each other. After the introduction of ReALIS, we provide linguistic data in order to show that intelligent language processing requires a realistic model of human interpreters. Then we put down some principles of the implementation (in progress) and demonstrate how to apply our model in computational linguistics.

AB In this paper we present a voice command and mouth gesture based robot command interface which is capable of controlling three degrees of freedom. The gesture set was designed in order to avoid head rotation and translation, and thus relying solely in mouth movements. Mouth segmentation is performed by using the normalized a* component, as in [1]. The gesture detection process is carried out by a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based classifier. After that, a state machine stabilizes the system response by restricting the number of possible movements depending on the initial state. Voice commands are modeled using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) isolated word recognition scheme. The interface was designed taking into account the specific pose restrictions found in the DaVinci Assisted Surgery command console.

SO TRENDS IN BIOCHEMICAL SCIENCES
AB The structural properties that enable DNA to serve so effectively as genetic material can also be used for other purposes. The complementarity that leads to the pairing of the strands of the DNA double helix can be exploited to assemble more complex motifs, based on branched structures. These structures have been used as the basis of larger 2D and 3D constructions. In addition, they have been used to make nanomechanical devices. These devices range from DNA-based shape-shifting structures to gears and walkers, a DNA-stress gauge and even a translation device. The devices are activated by mechanisms as diverse as small molecules, proteins and, most intriguingly, other molecules of DNA.

AB Parallel corpora have become an essential resource for work in multi lingual natural language processing. However, sentence aligned parallel corpora are more efficient than nonaligned parallel corpora for cross language information retrieval and machine translation applications. In this paper, we present a new approach to aligning sentences in bilingual parallel corpora based on the text character length between successive punctuates. A probabilistic score is assigned to each proposed correspondence of texts, based on the scaled difference of lengths of the two texts (in characters) and the variance of this difference. Using this score, the time required for punctuates matching decreased and the sentence alignment precision increased. Using this new approach, we could achieve 21.8% improvement over length based approach when applied on English-Arabic parallel documents.

TI Kinetic measurement of ribosome motor stalling force
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We measure the ribosome motor stalling forces to unzip mRNA polymers during gene expression. An approach of using the changes in the reaction rate constants to determine the molecular motor forces is presented. Specific antisense DNA oligomers complementary to mRNA templates are used as kinetic barriers for estimating the ribosome forces using real time bioluminescence detection of luciferase gene expression. The rate constants are determined by comparing the experimental data with numerical simulation of gene expression to deduce the ribosome force (26.5+/-1 pN) required to unzip mRNA polymers. Understanding the forces generated by the ribosome may also enable the construction of information-based artificial nanoscale machines. (C) 2004 American Institute of Physics.

New benchmark performances are reported on a daily basis ranging from machine translation to question-answering. Yet, some of the unsolved practical research questions are not in the spotlight and this includes, for example, issues arising at the interface between spoken and written language processing.
   We identify sentence boundary detection and speaker change detection applied to automatically transcribed texts as two NLP problems that have not yet received much attention but are nevertheless of practical relevance. We frame both problems as binary tagging tasks that can be addressed by fine-tuning a transformer model and we report promising results.

TI Cross-lingual implicit discourse relation recognition with co-training
SO FRONTIERS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING
AB A lack of labeled corpora obstructs the research progress on implicit discourse relation recognition (DRR) for Chinese, while there are some available discourse corpora in other languages, such as English. In this paper, we propose a cross-lingual implicit DRR framework that exploits an available English corpus for the Chinese DRR task. We use machine translation to generate Chinese instances from a labeled English discourse corpus. In this way, each instance has two independent views: Chinese and English views. Then we train two classifiers in Chinese and English in a co-training way, which exploits unlabeled Chinese data to implement better implicit DRR for Chinese. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

AB A Treebank is a linguistic resource that is composed of a large collection of manually annotated and verified syntactically analyzed sentences. Statistical Natural Language Processing ( NLP) approaches have been successful in using these annotations for developing basic NLP tasks such as tokenization, diacritization, part-of-speech tagging, parsing, among others. In this paper, we address the problem of exploiting Treebank resources for statistical parsing of Modern Standard Arabic ( MSA) sentences. Statistical parsing is significant for NLP tasks that use parsed text as an input such as Information Retrieval, and Machine Translation. We conducted an experiment on Pen Arabic Treebank ( PATB) and the parsing performance obtained in terms of Precision, Recall, and F-measure was 82.4%, 86.6%, 84.4%, respectively.

Dravidian and Indo-Aryan respectively. Tamil and Hindi differ extensively at the clausal construction level and transferring the structure is difficult. The syntactic structure transfer described here is a hybrid approach where we use CRFs for identifying the clause boundaries in the source language, Transformation Based Learning (TBL) for extracting the rules and use semantic classification of Postpositions (PSP) for choosing semantically appropriate structure in constructions where there are one to many mapping in the target language. We have evaluated the system using web data and the results are encouraging.

AB Parsing can be defined as the decomposition of complex structures into their constituent parts. Parsing is a central research area in the automatic processing of human languages. Parsers are being used in many application areas, for example, question answering, extraction of information from texts, speech recognition and understanding, and machine translation, etc. Shallow parsing is a new parsing approach which has emerged for linguistic analysis. Unlike a full parser, a shallow parser aims to identify local structures in a sentence only and has the ability to obtain syntactic information more efficiently and reliably. In this paper, we present a Chinese shallow parser based on an improved chart parsing algorithm, which fulfills the process of Chinese syntactic analysis.

Coded-InvNet leverages recent findings in the deep learning literature such as invertible neural networks, Manifold Mixup, and domain translation algorithms, identifying interesting research directions that span across machine learning and systems. Our experimental results show that Coded-InvNet can outperform existing approaches, especially when the compute resource overhead is as low as 10%. For instance, without knowing which of ten workers is going to fail, our algorithm can design a backup task to correctly recover the missing prediction with an accuracy of 85.9%, significantly outperforming the previous SOTA by 32.5%.

AB In this paper we address the problem of diacritic error detection and restoration-the task of identifying and correctingmissing accents in text. In particular, we evaluate the performance of a simple part-ofspeech tagger-based technique comparing it to other established methods for error detection/restoration: unigram frequency, decision lists, discriminative classifiers, a machine-translation based method, and graphemebased approaches. In languages such as Spanish (the focus here), diacritics play a key role in disambiguation and results show that a straightforward modification to an n-gram tagger can be used to achieve good performance in diacritic error identification without resorting to any specialized machinery. Ourmethod should be applicable to any language where diacritics distribute comparably and perform similar roles of disambiguation.

Our algorithms produce translations of words in a source language to plentiful target languages using available Wordnets and a machine translator (MT). Since our approaches rely on just one input dictionary, available Wordnets and an MT, they are applicable to any bilingual dictionary as long as one of the two languages is English or has a Wordnet linked to the Princeton Wordnet. Starting with 5 available bilingual dictionaries, we create 48 new bilingual dictionaries. Of these, 30 pairs of languages are not supported by the popular MTs: Google(1) and Bing(2).

SO COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE
AB Coreference resolution is a challenging part of natural language processing (NLP) with applications in machine translation, semantic search and other information retrieval, and decision support systems. Coreference resolution requires linguistic preprocessing and rich language resources for automatically identifying and resolving such expressions. Many rarer and under-resourced languages (such as Lithuanian) lack the required language resources and tools. We present a method for coreference resolution in Lithuanian language and its application for processing e-health records from a hospital reception. Our novelty is the ability to process coreferences with minimal linguistic resources, which is important in linguistic applications for rare and endangered languages. The experimental results show that coreference resolution is applicable to the development of NLP-powered online healthcare services in Lithuania.

AB Cross-cultural differences and similarities are common in cross-lingual natural language understanding, especially for research in social media. For instance, people of distinct cultures often hold different opinions on a single named entity. Also, understanding slang terms across languages requires knowledge of cross-cultural similarities. In this paper, we study the problem of computing such cross-cultural differences and similarities. We present a lightweight yet effective approach, and evaluate it on two novel tasks: 1) mining cross-cultural differences of named entities and 2) finding similar terms for slang across languages. Experimental results show that our framework substantially outperforms a number of baseline methods on both tasks. The framework could be useful for machine translation applications and research in computational social science.

AB In this paper, we present the work on transfer grammar, one of the most challenging issues in MT, in a bidirectional Tamil- Hindi translation system-Sampark. Transfer grammar between the above languages can be categorized into two levels (1) the structure transfer and (2) lexical level transfer. Tamil and Hindi differ extensively at the clausal construction level and at the verb formation level since Tamil is an agglutinative language and Hindi is not. Transfer grammar described here uses a hybrid approach using CRF a machine learning algorithm and linguistic rules for structure transfer, a rule based approach for word level transfer. We tested the approach in the Sampark system using web data and the results are encouraging.

AB Nowadays, virtualization is a technology that is applied for sharing the capabilities of physical computers by splitting the resources among OSs. The concept of Virtual Machines (VMs) started back in 1964 with a IBM project called CP/CMS system. Currently, there are several virtualization techniques that can be used for supporting the execution of entire operating systems. We classify the virtualization techniques from the OS view. First, we discuss two techniques that executes modified guest OSs: operating system-level virtualization and para-virtualization. Second, we discuss two techniques that executes unmodified guest OSs: binary translation and hardware assisted. Finally, we present a summary of resource management facilities for capacity planning and consolidation of server applications. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Bilingual Co-Training for Sentiment Classification of Chinese Product

AB The lack of reliable Chinese sentiment resources limits research progress on Chinese sentiment classification. However, there are many freely available English sentiment resources on the Web. This article focuses on the problem of cross-lingual sentiment classification, which leverages only available English resources for Chinese sentiment classification. We first investigate several basic methods (including lexicon-based methods and corpus-based methods) for cross-lingual sentiment classification by simply leveraging machine translation services to eliminate the language gap, and then propose a bilingual co-training approach to make use of both the English view and the Chinese view based on additional unlabeled Chinese data. Experimental results on two test sets show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which can outperform basic methods and transductive methods.

The MOL implements a global logical name space for message passing and distributed directories to assist in the translation of logical to physical addresses. Our data show that the latency of the MOL primitives is within 10-14% of the latency of the underlying communication substrate. The MOL is a lightweight, portable library designed to minimize maintenance costs for very large-scale parallel adaptive applications. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sign language is the way of communication for hearing impaired people. There is a challenge for common people to communicate with deaf people which makes this system helpful in assisting them. This project aims at implementing computer vision which can take the sign from the users and convert them into text in real time. The proposed system contains four modules such as: image capturing, pre-processing classification and prediction. By using image processing the segmentation can be done. Sign gestures are captured and processed using OpenCV python library. The captured gesture is resized, converted to grey scale image and the noise is filtered to achieve prediction with high accuracy. The classification and predication are done using convolution neural network.

AB The traditional method of lexical interpretation is to use a few words to explain some other words. Its lexical semantic information cannot be applied to natural language processing oriented towards physical contexts, on the basis of which the paper proposes a lexical semantic representation model based on graphic feature vectors and its learning algorithm Sal-F. The algorithm applies cross-situational learning to the alignment of word-graph features, establishes visual semantic model of words (Lsm-G) on the basis of the feature selection results and constructs semantic dictionary based on graphic features. According to evaluation methods such as machine translation, the algorithm achieves a word average accuracy of 70% and the highest sentence accuracy of 16%.

AB Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging is the process of labelling syntactic categories to each word in a sentence. Identifying POS tags for words is the fundamental task for various natural language processing applications such as grammar checking and machine translation etc. A novel POS tagging approach for Tamil language is proposed in this paper to determine the hierarchical POS tags for words. This approach uses Hidden Markov Model, Viterbi algorithm, Tamil grammar rules, N-gram and Stemming techniques. Test results show that the POS tags for Tamil words determined by this approach are found to be with 96% accuracy as approved by a Scholar in Tamil.

In this context our system is based on two main components: a lexicon including 2443 attested verbs, and a set of rules covering the morphotactic and morphological phenomena observed in standard amazigh verbs. The choice of finite-state technology makes our system bidirectional (analyzer / generator) and able to cover all variations of amazigh mood, aspect, gender, and person, and to realize an important accuracy (system recognition) which has reached about 79.07%. This system is an added value for the implementation for other applications like spellchecking, machine translation, and computer aided language learning.

AB There is mounting evidence that existing neural network models, in particular the very popular sequence-to-sequence architecture, struggle to systematically generalize to unseen compositions of seen components. We demonstrate that one of the reasons hindering compositional generalization relates to representations being entangled. We propose an extension to sequence-to-sequence models which encourages disentanglement by adaptively re-encoding (at each time step) the source input. Specifically, we condition the source representations on the newly decoded target context which makes it easier for the encoder to exploit specialized information for each prediction rather than capturing it all in a single forward pass. Experimental results on semantic parsing and machine translation empirically show that our proposal delivers more disentangled representations and better generalization. (1)

AB Pronouns arc often dropped in Chinese sentences, and this happens more frequently in conversational genres as their referents can be easily understood from context. Recovering dropped pronouns is essential to applications such as Information Extraction where the referents of these dropped pronouns need to be resolved. or Machine Translation when Chinese is the source language. In this work, we present a novel end-to-end neural network model to recover dropped pronouns in conversational data. Our model is based on a structured attention mechanism that models the referents of dropped pronouns utilizing both sentence level and word-level information. Results on three different conversational genres show that our approach achieves a significant improvement over the current state of the art.

In this paper, we study how the attention mechanism benefits in product phrase generation with attributes. We present a phrase generation model consisting of convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and the attention mechanism to look into the detail of the image. We construct attribute rich phrases from metadata in Etsy dataset that consist of an adjective, a material tag, and product category, and learn the model to describe products. Our empirical results suggest that our model improves the description quality in both machine-translation metric and human evaluation.

In this paper, we explore training algorithms that instead optimize reward functions that explicitly consider different aspects of the style-transferred outputs. In particular, we leverage semantic similarity metrics originally used for fine-tuning neural machine translation models to explicitly assess the preservation of content between system outputs and input texts. We also investigate the potential weaknesses of the existing automatic metrics and propose efficient strategies of using these metrics for training. The experimental results show that our model provides significant gains in both automatic and human evaluation over strong baselines, indicating the effectiveness of our proposed methods and training strategies.(1)

This label can be used as contextual features for several computational linguistic research - for example, word sense disambiguation, chunking, machine translation, and sequence classification. Our work is done by using bidirectional long short-term memory to do the part of speech tagging task for Bahasa Indonesia. We use deep learning model for Indonesia language POS tagging because deep learning can achieve excellent performance on it. We could reach 96.92% of F1 Score based on our approach.

This analysis plays a crucial role to represent the actual interpretation of the sentence structure and hence helps to improve the accuracy of machine translation. In this paper, we propose a semantic analyzer to perform the semantic analysis of Bengali sentences. We introduce a set of rules for composition functions to the constituent parts of a sentence with the semantic features of the word for this purpose. The system has experimented with more than 2000 Bengali sentences and the success rates in over 88%.

We discuss how to train very large RNNs on GPUs and address the questions of how RNNLMs scale with respect to model size, training-set size, computational costs and memory. Our analysis shows that despite being more costly to train, RNNLMs obtain much lower perplexities on standard benchmarks than n-gram models. We train the largest known RNNs and present relative word error rates gains of 18% on an ASR task. We also present the new lowest perplexities on the recently released billion word language modelling benchmark, 1 BLEU point gain on machine translation and a 17% relative hit rate gain in word prediction.

TI CALIBRATING A MOBILE CAMERAS PARAMETERS
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION
AB The calibration of the relative rotation and translation between a camera and a mobile robot's coordinate systems is addressed, as well as the camera's intrinsic parameters, from a sequence of monocular images and robot movements. Existing hand/eye calibration procedures for robot arms are not directly applicable because they require the robot hand to have at least two rotational degrees of freedom. A suitable representation for camera rotation is used, and the calibration task is decomposed into two stages. Furthermore, to recover the camera's rotation motion, the inverse perspective geometry constraints of a rectangular corner are employed. Complicated calibration patterns are thus not needed. The calibration procedures are tested using both synthetic and real data.

AB Those who live with Type 1 Diabetes have lost the possibility of producing insulin; they are dependent on non-living and living prostheses-machines, human beings and animals-that constantly read, measure, translate and interpret the fluctuations of their blood sugar to avoid hypoglycemia, which can be lethal, or hyperglycemia, which can lead to long-term complications. This philosophical essay, based on interviews and observations in a training facility, follows how dogs become "biocompatible patient friendly alarm systems" for hypoglycemia. It also explores how different modes of translation operate in the creation of a symbiosis between a human and an animal and how, along with them, a new conception of responsibility, accuracy, and of the subject emerge.

AB Self-attention networks (SANs) have drawn increasing interest due to their high parallelization in computation and flexibility in modeling dependencies. SANs can be further enhanced with multi-head attention by allowing the model to attend to information from different representation subspaces. In this work, we propose novel convolutional self-attention networks, which offer SANs the abilities to 1) strengthen dependencies among neighboring elements, and 2) model the interaction between features extracted by multiple attention heads. Experimental results of machine translation on different language pairs and model settings show that our approach outperforms both the strong Transformer baseline and other existing models on enhancing the locality of SANs. Comparing with prior studies, the proposed model is parameter free in terms of introducing no more parameters.

TI Fallback Variable History NNLMs: Efficient NNLMs by precomputation and

SO PLOS ONE
AB This paper presents a new method to reduce the computational cost when using Neural Networks as Language Models, during recognition, in some particular scenarios. It is based on a Neural Network that considers input contexts of different length in order to ease the use of a fallback mechanism together with the precomputation of softmax normalization constants for these inputs. The proposed approach is empirically validated, showing their capability to emulate lower order N-grams with a single Neural Network. A machine translation task shows that the proposed model constitutes a good solution to the normalization cost of the output softmax layer of Neural Networks, for some practical cases, without a significant impact in performance while improving the system speed.

Word completion utilities, writing aids, and language translation are among the most common applications of word prediction. In this paper, we describe a new method to predict the correct word given its context. A data mining tool is used as a classification mean to predict the correct word in the given context. The method has been implemented; the testing results are promising. The approach requires a very small training text size compared with similar methods to produce an accuracy that approaches 93% correct predictions.

AB In this paper we develop a method for cross-lingual (Russian and English) text reuse detection. The method is based on the monolingual approach - translation of texts into one language and reduction to the text similarity problem. We split texts into non-overlapping fragments and compare fragments to each other by means of different metrics - BLEU(1-2), METEOR, cosine similarity between bag-of-words representations of each snippet, and cosine similarity between vectors obtained from doc2vec-trained model. We explore the impact of choice of metric on the quality of text reuse detection. We assess quality of the method on a sample of a hundred scientific documents, originally in Russian, machine translated into English. Preliminary findings demonstrate feasibility of the approach.

We start from system virtualization and process virtualization and we gradually develop a vision in which the two merge into one virtualization layer for embedded systems. Such a unified virtualization offers solutions for consolidation, performance optimization, software engineering and dealing with legacy hardware components. Four adoption requirements are identified: support for real-time execution, low performance overhead, virtualization of accelerator cores and finally trustworthiness. Finally, we define four research challenges: full virtualization of heterogeneous multi-core platforms, portable performance for heterogeneous multi-cores, virtual machine management interfaces, and standards for embedded virtualization.

TI Information processing algorithms in the brain
SO TRENDS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCES
AB If the brain is a machine that processes information, then its cognitive activity can be interpreted as a set of information processing states linking stimulus to response (i.e. as a mechanism or an algorithm). The cornerstone of this research agenda is the existence of a method to translate the measurable states of brain activity into the information processing states of a cognitive theory. Here, we contend that reverse correlation methods can provide this translation and we frame the transitions between information processing states in the context of automata theory. We illustrate, using examples from visual cognition, how this novel framework can be applied to understand the information processing algorithms of the brain in cognitive neuroscience.

AB This paper presents a wide range of statistical word alignment experiments incorporating morphosyntactic information. By means of parallel corpus transformations according to information of POS-tagging, lernmatization or stemming, we explore which linguistic information helps improve alignment error rates. For this, evaluation against a human word alignment reference is performed, aiming at an improved machine translation training scheme which eventually leads to improved SMT performance. Experiments are carried out in a Spanish-English European Parliament Proceedings parallel corpus, both in a large and a small data track. As expected, improvements due to introducing morphosyntactic information are bigger in case of data scarcity, but significant improvement is also achieved in a large data task, meaning that certain linguistic knowledge is relevant even in situations of large data availability.

AB In Language Technology, theoretical concepts have to be matched with practical limits and possibilities. It is explained that there are low-level fields like spelling check, automatic hyphenation or free text indexing where word based techniques can play a considerable part even without integrating syntactic or semantic analysis. On the other hand it is claimed that, without the integration of syntactico-semantic features and world knowledge, higher sophisticated tools like machine translation (not to speak of speech recognition) will not reach a functionally acceptable level. The work and the semantically based theory of A. Hoppe is compared with these considerations and it is shown that his conception as well as the practical results can be of extreme usability for high quality language technology development.

AB Network Functions have traditionally been deployed as software packages inside virtual machines or containers. In order to make them cloud-native and exploit the low-cost, scalability and resiliency of the cloud, Network Functions need to be disaggregated. Such disaggregation enables flexible deployment and resource allocation policies for critical components of a Network Function. However, growing interest of vendor neutrality and interoperability from vendors and operators, requires standardisation of well-defined interfaces. In this paper, we propose an abstraction layer for the disaggregation of a broadband network gateway (BNG). In the proposed architecture, this layer abstracts the BNG functions, and provides a stable translation target for configuring and managing subscriber sessions by adding forwarding rules or specifying Quality of Service parameters.

AB The large attention-based encoder-decoder network (Transformer) has become prevailing recently due to its effectiveness. But the high computation complexity of its decoder raises the inefficiency issue. By examining the mathematic formulation of the decoder, we show that under some mild conditions, the architecture could be simplified by compressing its sub-layers, the basic building block of Transformer, and achieves a higher parallelism. We thereby propose Compressed Attention Network, whose decoder layer consists of only one sub-layer instead of three. Extensive experiments on 14 WMT machine translation tasks show that our model is 1.42x faster with performance on par with a strong baseline. This strong baseline is already 2x faster than the widely used standard baseline without loss in performance.

These stemmers include: Information Science Research Institute (ISRI), Tashaphyne, Khoja, AL-stem, Light10, Motaz, Assem, Farasa, and ARLStem. Each stemmer was studied independently using the EveTAR dataset on a specific information retrieval task to obtain relevant query tweets. The performance of the nine stemmers was evaluated using BM25, precision at 30, and Mean Average Precision (MAP). The results show that root-based stemmers (i.e. ISRI and Khoja) outperformed others.

AB Recently, neural approaches to coherence modeling have achieved state-of-the-art results in several evaluation tasks. However, we show that most of these models often fail on harder tasks with more realistic application scenarios. In particular, the existing models under-perform on tasks that require the model to be sensitive to local contexts such as candidate ranking in conversational dialogue and in machine translation. In this paper, we propose a unified coherence model that incorporates sentence grammar, inter-sentence coherence relations, and global coherence patterns into a common neural framework. With extensive experiments on local and global discrimination tasks, we demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms existing models by a good margin, and establish a new state-of-the-art.

AB Potential negative outcomes of machine learning and algorithmic bias have gained deserved attention. However, there are still relatively few standard processes to assess and address algorithmic biases in industry practice. Practical tools that integrate into engineers' workflows are needed. As a case study, we present two tooling efforts to create tools for teams in practice to address algorithmic bias. Both intend to increase understanding of data, models, and outcome measurement decisions. We describe the development of 1) a prototype checklist based on existing literature frameworks; and 2) dashboarding for quantitatively assessing outcomes at scale. We share both technical and organizational lessons learned on checklist perceptions, data challenges and interpretation pitfalls.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EXPERT SYSTEMS
AB This paper describes a multi-level design, that is a non-uniform approach to interlingual machine translation (MT), in which distinct representational languages are used for different types of knowledge. We demonstrate that a linguistically-motivated ''division of labor'' across multiple representation levels has not complicated, but rather has readily facilitated, the identification and construction of systematic relations at the interface between each level. Our approach assumes an interlingua derived from the lexical semantics and predicate decomposition approaches of Jackendoff(1983, 1990) and Levin and Rappaport-Hovav (1995a,b). We describe a model of interpretation and representation of natural language sentences which has been implemented as part of an interlingual MT system called PRINCITRAN.

AB In this paper, we present a new strategy for automatic classification of weld defects in radiographs based on Gentle Adaboost algorithm. Radiographic images were segmented and moment-based features were extracted and given as input to Gentle Adaboost classifier. The performance of our classification system is evaluated using hundreds of radiographic images. The classifier is trained to classify each defect pattern into one of four classes: Crack, Lack of penetration, Porosity, and Solid inclusion. The experimental results show that the Gentle Adaboost classifier is an efficient automatic weld defect classification algorithm and can achieve high accuracy and is faster than support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, for the tested data.

AB The analysis of the contents of news outlets has been the focus of social scientists for a long time. However, content analysis is often performed on hand-coded documents, which limits the size of the data accessible to the investigation and consequently limits the possibility of detecting macro-trends. The use of text categorisation, clustering and statistical machine translation (SMT) enables us to operate automatically on vast amounts of news items, and consequently to analyse patterns in the content of outlets in different languages, over long time periods. We report on experiments involving hundreds of European media in 22 different languages, demonstrating how it is possible to detect similarities and differences between outlets, and between countries, based on the contents of their articles.

AB The compound nouns are freely composed in Korean, since it is possible to concatenate independent nouns without a postposition. Therefore, the systems that handle compound nouns such as machine translation and information retrieval have to decompose them into single nouns for the further correct analysis of texts. This paper proposes the GECORAM (GEneralized COmbination of Rule-based learning And Memory-based learning) algorithm for Korean compound noun decomposition using only syllabic information. The merit of rule-based learning algorithms is high comprehensibility, but they shows low performance in many application tasks. To tackle this problem, GECORAM combines the rule-based learning and memory-based learning. According to the experimental results, GECORAM shows higher accuracy than rule-based learning or memory-based learning alone.

TI Korean Grammatical Error Correction Based on Transformer with Copying
   Mechanisms and Grammatical Noise Implantation Methods
SO SENSORS
AB Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) is the task of detecting and correcting various grammatical errors in texts. Many previous approaches to the GEC have used various mechanisms including rules, statistics, and their combinations. Recently, the performance of the GEC in English has been drastically enhanced due to the vigorous applications of deep neural networks and pretrained language models. Following the promising results of the English GEC tasks, we apply the Transformer with Copying Mechanism into the Korean GEC task by introducing novel and effective noising methods for constructing Korean GEC datasets. Our comparative experiments showed that the proposed system outperforms two commercial grammar check and other NMT-based models.

AB Text normalization (TN) is an important step in conversational systems. It converts written text to its spoken form to facilitate speech recognition, natural language understanding and text-to-speech synthesis. Finite state transducers (FSTs) are commonly used to build grammars that handle text normalization (Sproat, 1996; Roark et al., 2012). However, translating linguistic knowledge into grammars requires extensive effort. In this paper, we frame TN as a machine translation task and tackle it with sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models. Previous research focuses on normalizing a word (or phrase) with the help of limited word-level context, while our approach directly normalizes full sentences. We find subword models with additional linguistic features yield the best performance (with a word error rate of 0.17%).

AB We seek to detect text in images using multiple techniques and recognize characters using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Individual characters are combined to form words, which can then be used in a variety of applications, such as automated translation. Text recognition is difficult when different types of text formats and conditions are involved, such as fonts, orientation, color, complex backgrounds, and low-quality images. Our contribution is a novel combination of techniques to perform text detection and a CNN model to classify text characters. Experiments show that both the detection algorithm and machine learning model generally succeed with clear text. The system has more difficulty detecting text from complex and low-resolution images, as well as parsing words whose characters are connected together, since this causes segmentation issues.

AB Pseudo-code written in natural language and mathematical expressions is a useful description of source code. Pseudocode aids programmers in understanding the code written in a programming language they are not familiar with. However, writing pseudo-code for each code statement is labour intensive. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automatically generate pseudo-code from source code using Neural Machine Translation. Our model is built upon the deep learning encoder-decoder using the attention-based Long Short-Term Memory architecture to capture the long-term dependencies in both source code and pseudo-code. An empirical evaluation on a real Python dataset demonstrates the applicability of our approach in practice.

AB Recently, human action recognition in videos has attracted much attention. This paper proposed a framework for human action recognition based on procrustes analysis and Fisher vector encoding. First, we apply a pose based feature extracted from silhouette image by employing Procrustes analysis and local preserving projection. It can preserve the discriminative shape information and local manifold structure of human pose and is invariant to translation, rotation and scaling. After the pose feature is extracted, a recognition framework based on Fisher vector encoding and multi-class supporting vector machine is employed for classifying the human action. Experimental results on benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB The Japanese language is written without the use of articles. Therefore, when translating from Japanese to languages with articles by either humans or machines, issues in article selection arise, which are affected by the information structure (definiteness, specificity, and others) of the source language. This paper presents the annotation data of the information structure (information status, commonness, definiteness, specificity, animacy, sentience, agentivity) of the "Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese," to address article selection issues in translation. We present the annotation schema and statistics. Evaluation using the Kappa value demonstrates that there is a correspondence between the information status, commonness, definiteness, and specificity. Thus, we conclude that these grammatical labels affect article selection.

AB We present a novel technique for automatic program correction in MOOCs, capable of fixing both syntactic and semantic errors without manual, problem specific correction strategies. Given an incorrect student program, it generates candidate programs from a distribution of likely corrections, and checks each candidate for correctness against a test suite.
   The key observation is that in MOOCs many programs share similar code fragments, and the seq2seq neural network model, used in the natural-language processing task of machine translation, can be modified and trained to recover these fragments.
   Experiment shows our scheme can correct 29% of all incorrect submissions and out-performs state of the art approach which requires manual, problem specific correction strategies.

TI Bessel-Fourier moment-based robust image zero-watermarking
SO MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Aiming to resist various signal processing operations and geometric transformations, this paper proposes a robust zero-watermarking algorithm based on a new image moment called Bessel-Fourier moment. First, image normalization is used for the invariance of translation and scaling, then the magnitudes of Bessel-Fourier moments of normalized image are computed, which have rotation invariance and are used to construct the feature image regarded as watermarking. Experimental results and analyses show that the proposed method has strong robustness to various attacks, such as blurring, JPEG compression, Gaussian noise, rotation, scaling, Stirmark and print_photocopy_scan. Compared to the congener zero-watermarking schemes and Zernike moment, the developed method has better performance.

AB Studies on Chinese sentences with shi (A) as predicate have been profoundly fruitful from the perspective of syntax, semantics and pragmatics. In a broader sense, however, a large number of sentences with shi functioning as other syntactic roles adverb, conjunction, auxiliary and even interjection are practically used, and stand as barriers to natural language processing (NLP) and machine translation (MT). The special fragments consisting of shi plus punctuation are divided into "shi plus comma" and "comma plus shi"', which are examined and discussed with the instruments of corpora, illustrations and comparison. Two exceptional fragments are also briefed to improve the precision in computer identification of these shi-pluspunctuation fragments.

The proposed manipulator has three Degrees of Freedom (DOFs), including the rotations of a moving platform about the x and y axes and a translation of this platform along the z axis. A reconfigurable driving mechanism is introduced into this new parallel manipulator in order to adapt the actuator vector so that the various configurations can be applied for different task. Constraint analysis is investigated, inverse kinematic problem is solved and Jacobian analysis is conducted. Finally, the dynamic simulations are performed using Adams/View to verify dynamic performance.

AB In this paper, we address the task of incremental language modeling for automatic transcription of broadcast news speech. Daily broadcast news naturally contains new words that are not in the lexicon of the speech recognition system but are important for downstream applications such as information retrieval or machine translation. To recognize those new words, the lexicon and the language model of the speech recognition system need to be updated periodically. We propose a method of estimating a list of words to be added to the lexicon based on some time-series text data. The experimental results on the RT04 Broadcast News data and other TV audio data showed that this method provided a decent and stable reduction in both out-of-vocabulary rates and speech recognition word error rates.

AB It is widely agreed that anaphora and ellipsis resolution is an important problem that is still to be solved in Natural Language Processing systems, such as Machine Translation and Information Extraction applications. Zero-pronouns are a special kind of anaphora, whose resolution also lies in ellipsis phenomenon since they do not appear explicitly in the text. They must first be detected (ellipsis), and then resolved just like any other pronoun (anaphora). This kind of pronoun occurs in Spanish texts when they occupy the grammatical position of the subject. In this paper, we propose an approach that resolves zero-pronouns in Spanish texts and subsequently generates them into English. A success rate of 75% has been obtained in the generation of Spanish zero-pronouns into English.

AB In recent years, automatic generation of image descriptions (captions), that is, image captioning, has attracted a great deal of attention. In this paper, we particularly consider generating Japanese captions for images. Since most available caption datasets have been constructed for English language, there are few datasets for Japanese. To tackle this problem, we construct a large-scale Japanese image caption dataset based on images from MS-COCO, which is called STAIR Captions. STAIR Captions consists of 820,310 Japanese captions for 164,062 images. In the experiment, we show that a neural network trained using STAIR Captions can generate more natural and better Japanese captions, compared to those generated using English-Japanese machine translation after generating English captions.

We focus on the resolution of lexical ambiguity that arises when a given keyword has several different meanings. Our approach combines some knowledge-based methods (Lesk algorithm and Hyponym Heuristics) and semantic measures, in order to achieve successful disambiguation. Experimental results and performance evaluation are 95.16 % accuracy for professional images and 87.40 % accuracy for social images, for keywords included in WordNet. This approach can be used for improving machine translation of tags or image similarity measurement.

Compared to bunsetsu-based dependency parsing, which is predominantly used in Japanese NLP, it provides a natural way of extracting syntactic constituents, which is useful for downstream applications such as statistical machine translation. It also makes it possible to jointly decide dependency and predicate-argument structure, which is usually implemented as two separate steps. We convert an existing treebank to the new dependency scheme and report parsing results as a baseline for future research. We achieved a better accuracy for assigning function labels than a predicate-argument structure analyzer by using grammatical functions as dependency label.

AB Grammatical error correction (GEC) systems strive to correct both global errors in word order and usage, and local errors in spelling and inflection. Further developing upon recent work on neural machine translation, we propose a new hybrid neural model with nested attention layers for GEC. Experiments show that the new model can effectively correct errors of both types by incorporating word and character-level information, and that the model significantly outperforms previous neural models for GEC as measured on the standard CoNLL-14 benchmark dataset. Further analysis also shows that the superiority of the proposed model can be largely attributed to the use of the nested attention mechanism, which has proven particularly effective in correcting local errors that involve small edits in orthography.

AB Bilingual word embedding, which maps word embedding of two languages into one vector space, has been widely applied in the domain of machine translation, word sense disambiguation and so on. However, no model has been universally accepted for learning bilingual word embedding. In this work, we propose a novel model named CJ-BOC to learn Chinese-Japanese word embeddings. Given Chinese and Japanese share a large portion of common characters, we exploit them in our training process. We demonstrated the effectiveness of such exploitation through theoretical and also experimental study. To evaluate the performance of CJ-BOC, we conducted a comprehensive experiment, which reveals its speed advantage, and high quality of acquired word embeddings as well.

TI Modeling the Paraphrase Detection Task over a Heterogeneous Graph
   Network with Data Augmentation
SO INFORMATION
AB Paraphrase detection is a Natural-Language Processing (NLP) task that aims at automatically identifying whether two sentences convey the same meaning (even with different words). For the Portuguese language, most of the works model this task as a machine-learning solution, extracting features and training a classifier. In this paper, following a different line, we explore a graph structure representation and model the paraphrase identification task over a heterogeneous network. We also adopt a back-translation strategy for data augmentation to balance the dataset we use. Our approach, although simple, outperforms the best results reported for the paraphrase detection task in Portuguese, showing that graph structures may capture better the semantic relatedness among sentences.

SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB In this paper, we propose a novel phrase-based model for Korean morphological analysis by considering a phrase as the basic processing unit, which generalizes all the other existing processing units. The impetus for using phrases this way is largely motivated by the success of phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT), which convincingly shows that the larger the processing unit, the better the performance. Experimental results using the SEJONG dataset show that the proposed phrase-based models outperform the morpheme-based models used as baselines. In particular, when combined with the conditional random field (CRF) model, our model leads to statistically significant improvements over the state-of-the-art CRF method.

AB Posthuman theory encourages scholars and practitioners to look at human and non-human actors with equal weight, acknowledging that as humans and technology have become less distinguishable from each other, the boundaries between bodies, objects, and contexts blur. Though usability has long been dominated by human centered needs, non-human agents interact with digital content as well. This paper includes strategies to strengthen our pedagogy around non-human centric writing in a way that both assists technology in its job and strengthens the applicability of content for the human users that interact with it. It encourages teaching students to write with a multimodal perspective that accommodates alternate forms of reading, machine translation, and search engines.

AB Language identification is an important task for web information retrieval services. This paper presents the implementation of a platform for language identification in multi-lingual documents on web. The platform consists of five modules to achieve the tasks automatically. Furthermore, artificial neural networks were used for the identification of languages in multi-lingual documents. Results for six languages including Turkish, French, Italian, Danish and Deutsch are present. The major benefit of the approach is that the ANN based language identification system could meet the expectations in real-time language identification accuracy with the help of a developed system. Experiments have shown that system achieves the tasks in high accuracy in discriminating different languages and converting them other languages on web pages.

AB Language modeling plays a critical role in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text prediction, machine translation and speech recognition. Traditional statistical language models (e.g. n-gram models) can only offer words that have been seen before and can not capture long word context. Neural language model provides a promising solution to surpass this shortcoming of statistical language model. This paper investigates Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) language model for Vietnamese, at character and syllable-levels. Experiments were conducted on a large dataset of 24M syllables, constructed from 1,500 movie subtitles. The experimental results show that our RNN-based language models yield reasonable performance on the movie subtitle dataset. Concretely, our models outperform n-gram language models in term of perplexity score.

AB Several design aspects of a recently introduced magnetic device are studied in this paper. The device, named Trans-Rotary Magnetic Gear (TROMAG), resembles a mechanical lead-screw. It can convert linear motion to rotation, and vice-versa, through magnetic fields, while offering a gearing action. For instance, high force, low speed translation can be converted to high speed, low torque rotation. Once integrated with a conventional winding, the resultant system may be used as a compact machine for high force linear motion applications. The paper investigates the design of the TROMAG by means of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Piece-wise helix effects, 2D approximation, demagnetization possibility, magnet dimensions impact, scaling, and flux density distribution are studied.

In this paper, an automatic domain term extraction method is proposed based on condition random fields. We treat domain terms extraction as a sequence labeling problem, and terms distribution characteristics as features of the CRF model. Then we used the CRF tool to train a template for the term extraction. Experimental results showed that the method is simple, with common domains, and good results were achieved. In the open test, the precision rate achieved was 79.63%, recall rate was 73.54%, and F-measure was 76.46%.

The algorithm achieves this goal by extracting object features using Gabor wavelets and self-organizing maps in a hierarchical manner. Object features are learned in an unsupervised way which is consistent with the feature learning process in the visual cortex. The algorithm is analyzed for robustness.

AB Across various domains, the relational model for databases is employed extensively for the purpose of storing, managing and retrieving data. The translation, however, of data modeling schemes such as entity-relationship (ER) diagrams into relational databases is accompanied by a certain loss of semantics as expressed by these models. With the growth of the semantic web, an effort has to be made in the direction of expressing these relational databases in a form and language that may be machine processable and such that they make the semantics as expressed by the database more explicit. This paper presents a methodology for expressing relational databases in the Resource Description Framework (RDF) language, which has even been referred to as the language of the Semantic Web.

AB Learning a programming language is difficult for the beginner of the computer. Therefore, it is necessary to build an intelligent programming environment in which the program can be written directly in the grammar of one's mother tongue. In this paper, we propose a model of an intelligent programming environment that is oriented to the Japanese. In this model, the text that describes in Japanese the layout of multimedia contents and the relationship between two multimedia contents can be parsed with the technology of machine translation, translated into an executable program, and executed. As an application of the proposed model, an environment culled ACORNS is implemented. The performance study of ACORNS is performed. The results of the performance study shows that the proposed model is robust.

AB Recent studies have shed some light on a common pitfall of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models, stemming from their struggle to disambiguate polysemous words without lapsing into their most frequently occurring senses in the training corpus. In this paper, we first provide a novel approach for automatically creating high-precision sense-annotated parallel corpora, and then put forward a specifically tailored fine-tuning strategy for exploiting these sense annotations during training without introducing any additional requirement at inference time. The use of explicit senses proved to be beneficial to reduce the disambiguation bias of a baseline NMT model, while, at the same time, leading our system to attain higher BLEU scores than its vanilla counterpart in 3 language pairs.

AB This paper introduces OpusTools, a package for downloading and processing parallel corpora included in the OPUS corpus collection. The package implements tools for accessing compressed data in their archived release format and make it possible to easily convert between common formats. OpusTools also includes tools for language identification and data filtering as well as tools for importing data from various sources into the OPUS format. We show the use of these tools in parallel corpus creation and data diagnostics. The latter is especially useful for the identification of potential problems and errors in the extensive data set. Using these tools, we can now monitor the validity of data sets and improve the overall quality and consistency of the data collection.

AB Extracting and formalising legal norms from legal documents is a time-consuming and complex procedure. Therefore, the automatic methods that can accelerate this process are in high demand. In this paper, we address two major questions related to this problem: (i) what are the challenges in formalising legal documents into a machine understandable formalism? (ii) to what extent can the data-driven state-of-theart approaches developed in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community be used to automate the normative mining process. The results of our experiments indicate that NLP technologies such as relation extraction and semantic parsing are promising research avenues to advance research in this area.

AB Distributed data-parallel algorithms aim to accelerate the training of deep neural networks by parallelizing the computation of large mini-batch gradient updates across multiple nodes. Approaches that synchronize nodes using exact distributed averaging (e.g., via ALLREDUCE) are sensitive to stragglers and communication delays. The PUSH-SUM gossip algorithm is robust to these issues, but only performs approximate distributed averaging. This paper studies Stochastic Gradient Push (SGP), which combines Pus HS um with stochastic gradient updates. We prove that SGP converges to a stationary point of smooth, nonconvex objectives at the same sub-linear rate as SGD, and that all nodes achieve consensus. We empirically validate the performance of SGP on image classification (ResNet-50, ImageNet) and machine translation (Transformer, WMT'16 En-De) workloads.

AB Achieving crisp interactive response in resource-intensive applications such as augmented reality, language translation, and speech recognition is a major challenge on resource-poor wearable hardware. In this paper we describe a solution based on multi-fidelity computation supported by predictive resource management. We show that such an approach can substantially reduce both the mean and the variance of response time. On a benchmark representative of augmented reality, we demonstrate a 60% reduction in mean latency and a 30% reduction in the coefficient of variation. We also show that a history-based approach to demand prediction is the key to this performance improvement: by applying simple machine learning techniques to logs of measured resource demand, we are able to accurately model resource demand as a function of fidelity.

We experiment with data from the BIOASQ challenge, which we augment with training instances obtained from an artificial biomedical machine reading comprehension dataset, or via back-translation, information retrieval, word substitution based on WORD2VEC embeddings or masked language modeling, question generation, or extending the given passage with additional context. We show that DA can lead to very significant performance gains, even when using large pretrained Transformers, contributing to a broader discussion of if/when DA benefits large pretrained models. One of the simplest DA methods, WORD2VEc based word substitution, performed best and is recommended. We release our artificial training instances and code.

AB Cross-lingual named-entity lexica are an important resource to multilingual NLP tasks such as machine translation and cross-lingual wikification. While knowledge bases contain a large number of entities in high-resource languages such as English and French, corresponding entities for lower-resource languages are often missing. To address this, we propose Lexical-Semantic-Phonetic Align (LSP-Align), a technique to automatically mine cross-lingual entity lexica from mined web data. We demonstrate LSP-Align outperforms baselines at extracting cross-lingual entity pairs and mine 164 million entity pairs from 120 different languages aligned with English. We release these cross-lingual entity pairs along with the massively multilingual tagged named entity corpus as a resource to the NLP community.

AB Artificial neural networks are machine-learning algorithms inspired by biological neural networks. Their main inconvenient is their "black-box" nature: while they are very efficient for making predictions, it is difficult to explain these predictions. In this paper, we propose a visual translation of the reasoning performed by simple neural networks, i.e. without hidden layers. This visualization relies on rainbow boxes, a recently-introduced technique for set visualization, and on three improvements we propose for rainbow boxes, including interactivity. We also present a small application of the proposed approach to decision support in antibiotherapy, for helping a physician to choose an antibiotic in urinary infections.

AB Text alignment is crucial to the accuracy of Machine Translation (MT) systems, some NLP tools or any other text processing tasks requiring bilingual data. This research proposes a language independent sentence alignment approach based on Polish (not position-sensitive language) to English experiments. This alignment approach was developed on the TED Talks corpus, but can be used for any text domain or language pair. The proposed approach implements various heuristics for sentence recognition. Some of them value synonyms and semantic text structure analysis as a part of additional information. Minimization of data loss was ensured. The solution is compared to other sentence alignment implementations. Also an improvement in MT system score with text processed with described tool is shown.

This process is based on two sub-tasks, (1) the recognition of the Domain Action (a speech act and a sequence of concepts) and (2) the extraction of arguments consisting of feature-value information. Statistical models are used for the former, while a knowledge-based approach is employed for the latter. This paper proposes an algorithms that improves the analysis in terms of robustness and performance: it combines the scores of the statistical models with the extracted arguments, taking in account the well-formedness constraints defined by the interlingua formalism.

AB The widespread adoption of whole slide imaging has increased the demand for effective and efficient gigapixel image analysis. Deep learning is at the forefront of computer vision, showcasing significant improvements over previous methodologies on visual understanding. However, whole slide images have billions of pixels and suffer from high morphological heterogeneity as well as from different types of artifacts. Collectively, these impede the conventional use of deep learning. For the clinical translation of deep learning solutions to become a reality, these challenges need to be addressed. In this paper, we review work on the interdisciplinary attempt of training deep neural networks using whole slide images, and highlight the different ideas underlying these methodologies.

The expressive power of compositions of such transducers with and without regular look-ahead is investigated. In particular, the restrictions of epsilon-freeness, strictness, and nondeletion are considered. The composition hierarchy turns out to be finite for all epsilon-free (all rules consume input) variants of these transducers except for the nondeleting epsilon-free transducers. The least number of transducers needed for the full expressive power of arbitrary compositions is presented. In all remaining cases (incl. the nondeleting epsilon-free transducers) the composition hierarchy does not collapse.

AB Anaphora resolution is an important part of natural language processing used in machine translation, semantic search and various other information retrieval and understanding systems. Anaphora resolution algorithms usually require linguistic pre-processing tools and various expensive resources for automatically identifying anaphoric expressions. Many smaller languages, like Lithuanian, lack such resources and tools. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed that requires only morphological annotations and recognized named entities. The paper presents experimental results showing the relevance of the solution for specific domains, and considers the further immediate ways towards dealing with the overall anaphora resolution problem for Lithuanian language.

By using a distributed architecture, we take advantages of the parallelism in the different levels of the natural language processing system, for modeling a community of conceptually autonomous agents. Every agent has an individual representation of the environment, and they are related through the coordinating effect of communication between agents with partial autonomy. The aim of our linguistic agents is to participate in a society of entities with different skills, and to collaborate in the interpretation of natural language sentences in a prototype of an automatic German-Spanish translator.

AB Automatic image annotation is an important and promising solution to narrow the semantic gap between low-level visual feature and high-level semantic concept. Here we propose an improved relevance model to solve image annotation problem. Unlike the classical approaches including classification. and translation model, the improved model is capable of discovering the correlation between blobs (segmented regions) and textual keywords so as to automatically generate keywords for un-annotated image according to joint probabilities. Moreover, it has the ability to detect and remove false keyword(s) by considering the co-occurrence of keywords through machine learning. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the previous algorithms for image annotation.

AB Ribosomes, which are central to protein synthesis and convert transcribed mRNAs into polypeptide chains, have been the focus of structural and biochemical studies for more than 50 years. The structure of its larger subunit revealed that the ribosome is a ribozyme with RNA at the heart of its enzymatic activity that catalyses peptide bond formation. Numerous initiation, elongation and release factors ensure that protein synthesis occurs progressively and with high specificity. In the past few years, high-resolution structures have provided molecular snapshots of different intermediates in ribosome-mediated translation in atomic detail. Together, these studies have revolutionized our understanding of the mechanism of protein synthesis.

TI IDL-expressions: A formalism for representing and parsing finite
   languages in natural language processing
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
AB We propose a formalism for representation of finite languages, referred to as the class of IDL-expressions, which combines concepts that were only considered in isolation in existing formalisms. The suggested applications are in natural language processing, more specifically in surface natural language generation and in machine translation, where a sentence is obtained by first generating a large set of candidate sentences, represented in a compact way, and then filtering such a set through a parser. We study several formal properties of IDL-expressions and compare this new formalism with more standard ones. We also present a novel parsing algorithm for IDL-expressions and prove a non-trivial upper bound on its time complexity.

AB Artificial neural networks have been used for a multitude of regression tasks, and their descendants have expanded the domain to many applications such as image and speech recognition, filtering of social networks, and machine translation. While conventional and recurrent neural networks work well on data represented in Euclidean space, they struggle with data in non-Euclidean space. Graph Neural Networks (GNN) expand recurrent neural networks to directly process sparse representations of graphs, but they are computationally expensive, which invites the use of powerful hardware accelerators. In this paper, we investigate the viability of the Graphcore Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU) for efficient implementation of SpatioTemporal Graph Convolutional Networks. The results show that IPUs are well suited for this task.

AB Automatic Cognate Detection helps NLP tasks of Machine Translation, Information Retrieval, and Phylogenetics. Cognate words are defined as word pairs across languages which exhibit partial or full lexical similarity and mean the same (e.g., hund-hound in German-English). In this paper, we use a Siamese Feed-forward neural network with word-embeddings to detect such word pairs. Our experiments with various embedding dimensions show larger embedding dimensions can only be used for large corpora sizes for this task. On a dataset built using linked Indian Wordnets, our approach beats the baseline approach with a significant margin (up to 71%) with the best F-score of 0.85% on the Hindi-Gujarati language pair.

TI Classical Many-Body Time Crystals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Discrete time crystals are a many-body state of matter where the extensive system's dynamics are slower than the forces acting on it. Nowadays, there is a growing debate regarding the specific properties required to demonstrate such a many-body state, alongside several experimental realizations. In this work, we provide a simple and pedagogical framework by which to obtain many-body time crystals using parametrically coupled resonators. In our analysis, we use classical period-doubling bifurcation theory and present a clear distinction between single-mode time-translation symmetry breaking and a situation where an extensive number of degrees of freedom undergo the transition. We experimentally demonstrate this paradigm using coupled mechanical oscillators, thus providing a clear route for time crystal realizations in real materials.

TI Probabilistic Finite-State morphological segmenter for Wixarika
   (huichol) language
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
AB In this work, we present a morphological segmenter for the Mexican indigenous languageWixarika. Segmentation is fundamental for rich morphological languages, a common aspect of the native American languages, to improve other tasks like machine translation, dialogue systems, summarization, etc. On top of the agglutinative nature of the language, the low amount of resources and the lack of an orthographic standard among dialects add to the challenge. Our proposal is based on a probabilistic finite-state approach that exploits regular agglutinative patterns and requires little linguistic knowledge. We show that our approach outperforms unsupervised and semi-supervised methods in a low-resource context. The dataset used in this work was openly released for future work by the community.

While these applications now support multiple languages, they, only allow users to communicate using the same language. A communication barrier and breakdowns occur when users do not speak the same language. This paper describes the design of Multilingual Instant Messaging Application (MIMA), and measure the level of acceptance of the application. Respondents agree that MIMA is both useful and easy to use, and this application is an essential tool to bridge the communication gap between speakers of different languages.

Therefore, identification and, classification of "De" structure certainly contribute very much to the Chinese sentence analysis. In this paper, firstly, we present a definition of different kinds of "Pronoun+De" structures. Secondly, we propose a model to identify and extract such structures in Chinese sentences. Then we show the general classification on them. Experiment results show that our proposed method of identification works well which will. contribute to Chinese sentence analysis certainly.

AB This paper addresses the problem of evaluating the quality of automatically generated subtitles, which includes not only the quality of the machine-transcribed or translated speech, but also the quality of line segmentation and subtitle timing. We propose SubER - a single novel metric based on edit distance with shifts that takes all of these subtitle properties into account. We compare it to existing metrics for evaluating transcription, translation, and subtitle quality. A careful human evaluation in a post-editing scenario shows that the new metric has a high correlation with the post-editing effort and direct human assessment scores, outperforming baseline metrics considering only the subtitle text, such as WER and BLEU, and existing methods to integrate segmentation and timing features.

TI Partial discharge pattern analysis using multi-class support vector
   machine to estimate cavity size and position in solid insulation
SO SOFT COMPUTING
AB Partial discharge (PD) measurement is used for a diagnosis and performance assessment of the solid insulation material inside the high-voltage (HV) equipment. PD measurement indicates the presence of voids, cracks and imperfection present in solid insulation material. The major problem associated with this measured PD signal is heavily contaminated by noise which results in reduction in PD pattern recognition. The objective of this work is to measure and de-noise the PD signal due to cavity and recognize two different size of cavities present in three different locations, namely near HV electrode, center and lower electrode. In first part, the measured PD signal is de-noised using translation invariant wavelet transform. In second part, the three-dimensional (phi-q-n) PD patterns are extracted from the de-noised PD data. Then, it is subjected to canny edge detection technique, and the features like horizontal and vertical fractal dimension averages are evaluated using fractal image compression-based semi-variance technique. For classification, multi-class nonlinear support vector machine has been proposed to classify position and size of the cavity based on the PD fingerprints. The findings of this proposed work can be used to design a solid basis for an recognition of cavity size and position in an electrical apparatus.

TI Machine Perfusion and the Pancreas: Will It Increase the Donor Pool?
SO CURRENT DIABETES REPORTS
AB Purpose of ReviewPancreas transplantation enables complete patient independence from exogenous insulin administration and increases both patient survival and quality of life. Despite this, there has been a decline in pancreas transplantation for the past 20years, influenced by changing donor demographics with more high-risk extended criteria (ECD) and donation after cardiac death (DCD) donors. This review discusses whether the advent of machine perfusion (MP), if extended to the pancreas, can increase the pool of suitable donor organs.Recent FindingsHypothermic and normothermic MP, as forms of preservation deemed superior to cold storage for high-risk kidney and liver donor organs, have opened the avenue for translation of this work into the pancreas. Recent experimental models of porcine and human ex-vivo pancreatic MP are promising. Applications of MP to the pancreas however need refinement-focusing on perfusion protocols and viability assessment tools.SummaryEmerging research shows pancreatic MP can potentially offer superior preservation capacity, the ability to both resuscitate and manipulate organs, and assess functional and metabolic organ viability. The future of MP will lie in organ assessment and resuscitation after retrieval, where ultimately organs initially considered high risk and unsuitable for transplantation will be optimised and transformed, making them then available for clinical use, thus increasing the pool of suitably viable pancreata for transplantation.

TI Combining sentence similarities measures to identify paraphrases
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB Paraphrase identification consists in the process of verifying if two sentences are semantically equivalent or not. It is applied in many natural language tasks, such as text summarization, information retrieval, text categorization, and machine translation. In general, methods for assessing paraphrase identification perform three steps. First, they represent sentences as vectors using bag of words or syntactic information of the words present the sentence. Next, this representation is used to measure different similarities between two sentences. In the third step, these similarities are given as input to a machine learning algorithm that classifies these two sentences as paraphrase or not. However, two important problems in the area of paraphrase identification are not handled: (i) the meaning problem: two sentences sharing the same meaning, composed of different words; and (ii) the word order problem: the order of the words in the sentences may change the meaning of the text. This paper proposes a paraphrase identification system that represents each pair of sentence as a combination of different similarity measures. These measures extract lexical, syntactic and semantic components of the sentences encompassed in a graph. The proposed method was benchmarked using the Microsoft Paraphrase Corpus, which is the publicly available standard dataset for the task. Different machine learning algorithms were applied to classify a sentence pair as paraphrase or not. The results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art systems.

TI System Architecture for Brain-Computer Interface based on Machine
   Learning and Internet of Things
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB Brain functions are required to be read for curing neurological illness. Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) connects the brain to the digital world for brain signals receiving, recording, processing, and comprehending. With a Brain Computer Interface (BCI), the information from the user's brain is fed into actuation devices, which then carry out the actions programmed into them. The Internet of Things (IoT) has made it possible to connect a wide range of everyday devices. Asynchronous BCIs can benefit from an improved system architecture proposed in this paper. Individuals with severe motor impairments will particularly get benefit from this feature. Control commands were translated using a rule-based translation algorithm in traditional BCI systems, which relied only on EEG recordings of brain signals. Examining BCI technology's various and cross-disciplinary applications, this argument produces speculative conclusions about how BCI instruments combined with machine learning algorithms could affect the forthcoming procedures and practices. Compressive sensing and neural networks are used to compress and reconstruct ECoG data presented in this article. The neural networks are used to combine the classifier outputs adaptively based on the feedback. A stochastic gradient descent solver is employed to generate a multi-layer perceptron regressor. An example network is shown to take a 50% compression ratio and 89% reconstruction accuracy after training with real-world, medium-sized datasets as shown in this paper.

TI iPseU-Layer: Identifying RNA Pseudouridine Sites Using Layered Ensemble
   Model
SO INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCES-COMPUTATIONAL LIFE SCIENCES
AB Pseudouridine represents one of the most prevalent post-transcriptional RNA modifications. The identification of pseudouridine sites is an essential step toward understanding RNA functions, RNA structure stabilization, translation process, and RNA stability; however, high-throughput experimental techniques remain expensive and time-consuming in lab explorations and biochemical processes. Thus, how to develop an efficient pseudouridine site identification method based on machine learning is very important both in academic research and drug development. Motived by this, we present an effective layered ensemble model designated as iPseU-Layer for identification of RNA pseudouridine sites. The proposed iPseU-Layer approach is essentially based on three different machine learning layers including: feature selection layer, feature extraction and fusion layer, and prediction layer. The feature selection layer reduces the dimensionality, which can be regarded as a data pre-processing stage. The feature extraction and fusion layer utilizes an ensemble method which is implemented through various machine learning algorithms to generate some outputs. The prediction layer applies classic random forest to identify the final results. Furthermore, we systematically conduct the validation experiments using cross-validation tests and independent test with the current state-of-the-art models. The proposed iPseU-Layer provides a promising predictive performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient. Collectively, these findings indicate that the framework of iPseU-Layer is a feasible and effective strategy for the prediction of RNA pseudouridine sites.

TI Expert-augmented automated machine learning optimizes hemodynamic
   predictors of spinal cord injury outcome
SO PLOS ONE
AB Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) is becoming increasingly more accessible to biomedical researchers with significant potential to transform biomedicine through optimization of highly-accurate predictive models and enabling better understanding of disease biology. Automated machine learning (AutoML) in particular is positioned to democratize artificial intelligence (AI) by reducing the amount of human input and ML expertise needed. However, successful translation of AI/ML in biomedicine requires moving beyond optimizing only for prediction accuracy and towards establishing reproducible clinical and biological inferences. This is especially challenging for clinical studies on rare disorders where the smaller patient cohorts and corresponding sample size is an obstacle for reproducible modeling results. Here, we present a model-agnostic framework to reinforce AutoML using strategies and tools of explainable and reproducible AI, including novel metrics to assess model reproducibility. The framework enables clinicians to interpret AutoML-generated models for clinical and biological verifiability and consequently integrate domain expertise during model development. We applied the framework towards spinal cord injury prognostication to optimize the intraoperative hemodynamic range during injury-related surgery and additionally identified a strong detrimental relationship between intraoperative hypertension and patient outcome. Furthermore, our analysis captured how evolving clinical practices such as faster time-to-surgery and blood pressure management affect clinical model development. Altogether, we illustrate how expert-augmented AutoML improves inferential reproducibility for biomedical discovery and can ultimately build trust in AI processes towards effective clinical integration.

SO AAPS JOURNAL
AB The exponential increase in our ability to harness multi-dimensional biological and clinical data from experimental to real-world settings has transformed pharmaceutical research and development in recent years, with increasing applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Patient-centered iterative forward and reverse translation is at the heart of precision medicine discovery and development across the continuum from target validation to optimization of pharmacotherapy. Integration of advanced analytics into the practice of Translational Medicine is now a fundamental enabler to fully exploit information contained in diverse sources of big data sets such as "omics" data, as illustrated by deep characterizations of the genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, microbiome, and exposome. In this commentary, we provide an overview of ML applications in drug discovery and development, aligned with the three strategic pillars of Translational Medicine (target, patient, dose) and offer perspectives on their potential to transform the science and practice of the discipline. Opportunities for integrating ML approaches into the discipline of Pharmacometrics are discussed and will revolutionize the practice of model-informed drug discovery and development. Finally, we posit that joint efforts of Clinical Pharmacology, Bioinformatics, and Biomarker Technology experts are vital in cross-functional team settings to realize the promise of AI/ML-enabled Translational and Precision Medicine.

AB LinkedIn Groups provide a platform an which professionals with similar background, target and specialities can share content, take part in discussions and establish opinions on industry topics. As in most online social communities, spam content in LinkedIn Groups poses great challenges to the user experience and could eventually lead to substantial loss of active users. Building an intelligent and scalable span detection system is highly desirable but faces difficulties such as lack of labeled training data, particularly for languages other than English. In this paper, we take the spam (Spanish) job posting detection as the target problem and build a generic machine learning pipeline for multi-lingual spam detection. The main components are feature generation and knowledge migration via transfer learning. Specifically, in the feature generation phase, a relatively large labeled data set is generated via machine translation. Together with a large set of unlabeled human written Spanish data, unigram features are generated based on the frequency. In the second phase, machine translated data are properly reweighted to capture the discrepancy from human written ones and classifiers can be built on top of them. To make effective use of a small portion of labeled data available in human written Spanish, an adaptive transfer learning algorithm is proposed to further improve the performance. We evaluate the proposed method on LinkedIn's production data and the promising results verify the efficacy of our proposed algorithm. The pipeline is ready for production.

TI Blood serum lipid profiling may improve the management of recurrent
   miscarriage: a combination of machine learning of mid-infrared spectra
   and biochemical assays
SO ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The present article is focused on developing and validating an efficient, credible, minimally invasive technique based on spectral signatures of blood samples of women with recurrent miscarriage vs. those of healthy individuals who were followed in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology for 2 years. For this purpose, blood samples from a total of 120 participants, including healthy women (n=60) and women with diagnosed recurrent miscarriage (n=60), were obtained. The lipid profile (high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglyceride, and total cholesterol levels) and lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde and glutathione levels) were evaluated with a Beckman Coulter analyzer system for chemical analysis. Biomolecular structure and composition were determined using an attenuated total reflectance sampling methodology with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy alongside machine learning technology to advance toward clinical translation. Here, we developed and validated instrumentation for the analysis of recurrent miscarriage patient serum that was able to differentiate recurrent miscarriage and control patients with an accuracy of 100% using a Fourier transform infrared region corresponding to lipids. We found that predictors of lipid profile abnormalities in maternal serum could significantly improve this patient pathway. The study also presents preliminary results from the first prospective clinical validation study of its kind.

TI Transcriptome-Wide Annotation of m(5)C RNA Modifications Using Machine
   Learning
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB The emergence of epitranscriptome opened a new chapter in gene regulation. 5-methylcytosine (m(5)C), as an important post-transcriptional modification, has been identified to be involved in a variety of biological processes such as subcellular localization and translational fidelity. Though high-throughput experimental technologies have been developed and applied to profile m(5)C modifications under certain conditions, transcriptome-wide studies of m(5)C modifications are still hindered by the dynamic and reversible nature of m(5)C and the lack of computational prediction methods. In this study, we introduced PEA-m5C, a machine learning-based m(5)C predictor trained with features extracted from the flanking sequence of m(5)C modifications. PEA-m5C yielded an average AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic) of 0.939 in 10-fold cross-validation experiments based on known Arabidopsis m(5)C modifications. A rigorous independent testing showed that PEA-m5C (Accuracy [Acc] = 0.835, Matthews correlation coefficient [MCC] = 0.688) is remarkably superior to the recently developed m(5)C predictor iRNAm5C-PseDNC (Acc = 0.665, MCC = 0.332). PEA-m(5)C has been applied to predict candidate m(5)C modifications in annotated Arabidopsis transcripts. Further analysis of these m(5)C candidates showed that 4nt downstream of the translational start site is the most frequently methylated position.

TI Categorical Variable Mapping Considerations in Classification Problems:
   Protein Application
SO MATHEMATICS
AB The mapping of categorical variables into numerical values is common in machine learning classification problems. This type of mapping is frequently performed in a relatively arbitrary manner. We present a series of four assumptions (tested numerically) regarding these mappings in the context of protein classification using amino acid information. This assumption involves the mapping of categorical variables into protein classification problems without the need to use approaches such as natural language process (NLP). The first three assumptions relate to equivalent mappings, and the fourth involves a comparable mapping using a proposed eigenvalue-based matrix representation of the amino acid chain. These assumptions were tested across a range of 23 different machine learning algorithms. It is shown that the numerical simulations are consistent with the presented assumptions, such as translation and permutations, and that the eigenvalue approach generates classifications that are statistically not different from the base case or that have higher mean values while at the same time providing some advantages such as having a fixed predetermined dimensions regardless of the size of the analyzed protein. This approach generated an accuracy of 83.25%. An optimization algorithm is also presented that selects an appropriate number of neurons in an artificial neural network applied to the above-mentioned protein classification problem, achieving an accuracy of 85.02%. The model includes a quadratic penalty function to decrease the chances of overfitting.

CL Brooklyn, NY
AB We introduce a new approach to the problem of collision detection between a rotating milling-cutter of an NC-machine and a model of a solid workpiece, as the rotating cutter continuously moves near the workpiece. Having five degrees of motion freedom, this problem is hard to solve exactly and we approximate the motion of the tool by a sequence of sub-paths of pure translations interleaved with pure rotations. The collision-detection problem along each sub-path is then solved by using radial projection of the obstacles (the workpiece and the static parts of the NC-machine) around the tool axis to obtain a collection of critical surface patches in R-3, and by examining planar silhouettes of these surface patches. We thus reduce the problem to successive computations of the lower envelope of a set of planar curves, which we intersect with the profile of the tool. Our reduction is exact, and incurs no loss of accuracy. We have implemented our algorithm in the IRIT environment for solid modeling, using an extension package of the CGAL library for computing envelopes. The algorithm, combined with the proper data structures, solves the collision detection problem in a robust manner, yet it yields efficient computation times as our experiments show. Our approach produces exact results in case of purely translational motion, and provides guaranteed (and good) approximation bounds in case the motion includes rotation.

TI Error recovery in parsing expression grammars through labeled failures
   and its implementation based on a parsing machine
SO JOURNAL OF VISUAL LANGUAGES AND COMPUTING
AB Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs) are a formalism used to describe top-down parsers with backtracking. As PEGs do not provide a good error recovery mechanism, PEG-based parsers usually do not recover from syntax errors in the input, or recover from syntax errors using ad-hoc, implementation-specific features. The lack of proper error recovery makes PEG parsers unsuitable for use with Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), which need to build syntactic trees even for incomplete, syntactically invalid programs.
   We discuss a conservative extension, based on PEGs with labeled failures, that adds a syntax error recovery mechanism for PEGs. This extension associates recovery expressionsto labels, where a label now not only reports a syntax error but also uses this recovery expression to reach a synchronization point in the input and resume parsing. We give an operational semantics of PEGs with this recovery mechanism, as well as an operational semantics for a parsing machinethat we can translate labeled PEGs with error recovery to, and prove the correctness of this translation. We use an implementation of labeled PEGs with error recovery via a parsing machine to build robust parsers, which use different recovery strategies, for the Lua language. We evaluate the effectiveness of these parsers, alone and in comparison with a Lua parser with automatic error recovery generated by ANTLR, a popular parser generator.

AB Virtualization technology is a key component for data center management which allows for multiple users and applications to share a single, physical machine. Modern virtual machine monitors utilize both software and hardware-assisted paging for memory virtualization, however neither paging mode is always preferable. Previous studies have shown that dynamic selection, which at runtime selects paging modes according to relevant performance metrics, can be effective in tailoring memory virtualization to program workload. However, these approaches require low-level manual analysis, or depend on prior knowledge of workload characteristics and phasing.
   We map the problem of dynamic paging mode selection to the contextual bandit, a model for sequential decision making in environments with limited feedback. Utilizing random profiling, which executes a workload while regularly selecting paging modes at random, we construct a paging mode selection policy that dynamically optimizes workload performance given page fault and translation lookaside buffer miss counts. Our approach yields an effective policy, DSP-OFFSET, for the dynamic paging mode selection problem. When trained and evaluated on subsets of the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark suite, DSP-OFFSET achieves speedups up to 44% compared to static paging mode selections, which is equivalent to the performance of the state-of-the-art ASP-SVM model. In addition, DSP-OFFSET requires at most a tenth of the profiling time of ASP-SVM (2.5 hours compared to over 24 hours) to achieve equivalent performance.

TI Analysis of potential genetic biomarkers and molecular mechanism of
   smoking-related postmenopausal osteoporosis using weighted gene
   co-expression network analysis and machine learning
SO PLOS ONE
AB Objectives Smoking is a significant independent risk factor for postmenopausal osteoporosis, leading to genome variations in postmenopausal smokers. This study investigates potential biomarkers and molecular mechanisms of smoking-related postmenopausal osteoporosis (SRPO).
   Materials and methods The GSE13850 microarray dataset was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Gene modules associated with SRPO were identified using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis, and pathway and functional enrichment analyses. Feature genes were selected using two machine learning methods: support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) and random forest (RF). The diagnostic efficiency of the selected genes was assessed by gene expression analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve.
   Results Eight highly conserved modules were detected in the WGCNA network, and the genes in the module that was strongly correlated with SRPO were used for constructing the PPI network. A total of 113 hub genes were identified in the core network using topological network analysis. Enrichment analysis results showed that hub genes were closely associated with the regulation of RNA transcription and translation, ATPase activity, and immune-related signaling. Six genes (HNRNPC, PFDN2, PSMC5, RPS16, TCEB2, and UBE2V2) were selected as genetic biomarkers for SRPO by integrating the feature selection of SVM-RFE and RF.
   Conclusion The present study identified potential genetic biomarkers and provided a novel insight into the underlying molecular mechanism of SRPO.

TI The Role of the Control Framework for Continuous Teleoperation of a
   Brain-Machine Interface-Driven Mobile Robot
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS
AB Despite the growing interest in brain-machine interface (BMI)-driven neuroprostheses, the translation of the BMI output into a suitable control signal for the robotic device is often neglected. In this article, we propose a novel control approach based on dynamical systems that was explicitly designed to take into account the nature of the BMI output that actively supports the user in delivering real-valued commands to the device and, at the same time, reduces the false positive rate. We hypothesize that such a control framework would allow users to continuously drive a mobile robot and it would enhance the navigation performance. 13 healthy users evaluated the system during three experimental sessions. Users exploit a 2-class motor imagery BMI to drive the robot to five targets in two experimental conditions: with a discrete control strategy, traditionally exploited in the BMI field, and with the novel continuous control framework developed herein. Experimental results show that the new approach: 1) allows users to continuously drive the mobile robot via BMI; 2) leads to significant improvements in the navigation performance; and 3) promotes a better coupling between user and robot. These results highlight the importance of designing a suitable control framework to improve the performance and the reliability of BMI-driven neurorobotic devices.

TI Visual evoked potentials determine chronic signal quality in a
   stent-electrode endovascular neural interface
SO BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS & ENGINEERING EXPRESS
AB Brain-machine interfaces directly communicate between the brain and external devices. An effective trade-offbetween signal quality and safety required for successful clinical translation has yet to be achieved, and represents a great challenge for engineers, neuroscientists, and clinicians. The Stentrode (TM), an endovascular neural interface that allows neural signals to be recorded from within a cortical vessel, has demonstrated feasibility with safety for up to six months in a large animal model. Easily-obtained electrophysiological signals to evaluate the effect of implant duration on recording performance are essential for ongoing evaluation of the device. In this work, we demonstrate that a non-invasive and quick visual stimulation technique can be used to assess chronic signal quality of an endovascular neural interface in awake freely moving animals. Visual stimulation requires little or no training to elicit a large, consistent, and well-characterized response. We report the stability of recording quality with the Stentrode over 30 days using voltage measures of signal-to-noise ratio (18.78 +/- 1.92 dB, mean +/- std) and peak-to-peak voltages (56.07 +/- 9.56 mu V) computed on visual evoked responses. Signal amplitude and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy suggest that stabilization of the electrode-tissue interface occurred over the first 20 days. However, during this stabilization period, recording quality was minimally impacted.

TI Surface roughness modeling in Laser-assisted End Milling of Inconel 718
SO MACHINING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Inconel 718 is a difficult-to-machine material while products of this material require good surface finish. Therefore, it is essential for the evaluation and prediction of surface roughness of machined Inconel 718 workpiece to be developed. An analytical model for the prediction of surface roughness under laser-assisted end milling of Inconel 718 is proposed based on kinematics of tool movement and elastic response of workpiece. The actual tool trajectory is first predicted with the consideration of overall tool movement, elastic deformation of tool, and the tool tip profile. The tool movements include the translation in feed direction and the rotation along its axis. The elastic deformation is calculated based on the previously established milling force prediction model. The tool tip profile is predicted based on the tool tip radius and angle. The machined surface profile is simulated based on the tool trajectory with elastic recovery, which is considered through the comparison between the minimum thickness and actual cutting thickness. Experiments are conducted in both conventional and laser-assisted milling under seven different sets of cutting parameters. Through the comparison between the analytical predictions and experimental measurements, the proposed model has high accuracy with the maximum error less than 27%, which is more accurate for lower feed rate with error less than 3%. The proposed analytical model is valuable for providing a fast, credible, and physics-based method for the prediction of surface roughness in milling process.

TI AN ASSOCIATIVE ARCHITECTURE FOR GENETIC ALGORITHM-BASED MACHINE LEARNING
SO COMPUTER
AB In the realm of machine-based learning, system architects seek to design machines with ever-greater levels of human-like autonomy and intelligence.  Recent advances in massively parallel computing, coupled with massively parallel artificial intelligence, may one day lead to vast computational resources that will offer new solutions to problems in autonomous agents, database mining, speech processing and translation, adaptive vision systems, visualization systems, and animation.
   In this article, the author presents his investigation of a Learning Classifier System that he developed, through modeling and simulation, based on hybrid AI algorithms computationally matched to a specialized associative architecture he designed.
   A key characteristic of Learning Classifier Systems is that they have intense computational requirements, often in the form of highly repetitive yet simple search operations, which is why an associative architecture was selected.  The proposed architecture couples a 64-bit content-addressable memory with a very basic 1-bit processing element and includes a reconfigurable bus under the autonomous control of each PE.  In the programming model for mapping parallel data onto the architecture, groups of physical PEs are organized as single logical PEs to provide a flexible means of meeting varied memory requirements.
   A simulator for the associative architecture and LCS algorithms was built with a MasPar MP-1 system that consisted of 8,192 4-bit processors.  The LCS implementation was tested on a difficult letter prediction problem that challenged the adaptive abilities of the LCS.  The article addresses the successful outcome and evaluates the performance of the algorithm simulations.

TI Unsupervised learning based feature extraction for differential
   diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases: A case study on early-stage
   diagnosis of Parkinson disease
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS
AB Background: The development of MRI based methods could prove extremely valuable for identification of reliable biomarkers to aid diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). A great deal of current research has been aimed at identification biomarkers for both diagnosis at early stage and evaluation of the progression of NDs.
   New method: We present here a novel synergetic paradigm integrating Kohonen self organizing map (KSOM) and least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) for individual-level clinical diagnosis of NDs. Feature are extracted in an unsupervised manner using KSOM on preprocessed brain MRIs. Thereafter, these features are fed as input to LSSVM for subject classification.
   Results: The applicability of the proposed methodology has been demonstrated using 831 T1-weighted MRIs obtained from Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database. We have achieved classification accuracy of up to 99% for differential diagnosis of Parkinson disease with confidence interval of 99.9%.
   Comparison with other existing methods: The potential for translation of similar research findings to clinical application is greatly dependent upon two factors (1) accuracy of subject classification achieved and (2) size of the dataset used. Here, we report very high accuracy achieved on one of the largest MRI datasets using multivariate analysis tools.

TI Machine learning assistive rapid, label-free molecular phenotyping of
   blood with two-dimensional NMR correlational spectroscopy
SO COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY
AB Weng Kung Peng et al. present a novel scheme using two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy for rapid and label-free testing of biological fluids (e.g., red blood cells) at point-of-care. They demonstrate its clinical utility (e.g., with haemoglobin disorders) and report a unique and specific 'molecular fingerprint' through direct analysis of a single drop of blood (<5 mu l). Machine learning is used to facilitate simpler decision making.
   Translation of the findings in basic science and clinical research into routine practice is hampered by large variations in human phenotype. Developments in genotyping and phenotyping, such as proteomics and lipidomics, are beginning to address these limitations. In this work, we developed a new methodology for rapid, label-free molecular phenotyping of biological fluids (e.g., blood) by exploiting the recent advances in fast and highly efficient multidimensional inverse Laplace decomposition technique. We demonstrated that using two-dimensional T-1-T(2)correlational spectroscopy on a single drop of blood (<5 mu L), a highly time- and patient-specific 'molecular fingerprint' can be obtained in minutes. Machine learning techniques were introduced to transform the NMR correlational map into user-friendly information for point-of-care disease diagnostic and monitoring. The clinical utilities of this technique were demonstrated through the direct analysis of human whole blood in various physiological (e.g., oxygenated/deoxygenated states) and pathological (e.g., blood oxidation, hemoglobinopathies) conditions.

TI Computational approaches for the analysis of RNA-protein interactions: A
   primer for biologists
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in the control of gene expression and the coordination of different layers of post-transcriptional regulation. Interactions between certain RBPs and mRNA transcripts are notoriously difficult to predict, as any given protein-RNA interaction may rely not only on RNA sequence, but also on three-dimensional RNA structures, competitive inhibition from other RBPs, and input from cellular signaling pathways. Advanced and high-throughput technologies for the identification of RNA-protein interactions have come to the rescue, but the identification of binding sites and downstream functional effects of RBPs from the resulting data can be challenging. In this review, we discuss statistical inference and machine-learning approaches and tools relevant for the study of RBPs and the analysis of large-scale RNA-protein interaction datasets. This primer is intended for life scientists who are interested in incorporating these tools into their own research. We begin with the demystification of regression models, as used in the analysis of next-generation sequencing data, and progress to a discussion of Hidden Markov Models, which are of particular value in analyzing cross-linking followed by immunoprecipitation data. We then continue with examples of machine learning techniques, such as support vector machines and gradient tree boosting. We close with a brief discussion of current trends in the field, including deep learning architectures.

TI Robust and accurate decoding of hand kinematics from entire spiking
   activity using deep learning
SO JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING
AB Objective. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) seek to restore lost motor functions in individuals with neurological disorders by enabling them to control external devices directly with their thoughts. This work aims to improve robustness and decoding accuracy that currently become major challenges in the clinical translation of intracortical BMIs. Approach. We propose entire spiking activity (ESA)-an envelope of spiking activity that can be extracted by a simple, threshold-less, and automated technique-as the input signal. We couple ESA with deep learning-based decoding algorithm that uses quasi-recurrent neural network (QRNN) architecture. We evaluate comprehensively the performance of ESA-driven QRNN decoder for decoding hand kinematics from neural signals chronically recorded from the primary motor cortex area of three non-human primates performing different tasks. Main results. Our proposed method yields consistently higher decoding performance than any other combinations of the input signal and decoding algorithm previously reported across long-term recording sessions. It can sustain high decoding performance even when removing spikes from the raw signals, when using the different number of channels, and when using a smaller amount of training data. Significance. Overall results demonstrate exceptionally high decoding accuracy and chronic robustness, which is highly desirable given it is an unresolved challenge in BMIs.

TI Choosing the right word: Using bidirectional LSTM tagger for writing
   support systems
SO ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Scientific writing is difficult. It is even harder for those for whom English is a second language (ESL learners). Scholars around the world spend a significant amount of time and resources proofreading their work before submitting it for review or publication.
   In this paper we present a novel machine learning based application for proper word choice task. Proper word choice is a generalization the lexical substitution (LS) and grammatical error correction (GEC) tasks. We demonstrate and evaluate the usefulness of applying bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) tagger, for this task. While state-of-the-art grammatical error correction uses error-specific classifiers and machine translation methods, we demonstrate an unsupervised method that is based solely on a high quality text corpus and does not require manually annotated data. We use a bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM for learning the proper word choice based on a word's sentential context. We demonstrate and evaluate our application in various settings, including both a domain-specific (scientific), writing task and a general-purpose writing task. We perform both strict machine and human evaluation. We show that our domain-specific and general-purpose models outperform state-of-the-art general context learning. As an additional contribution of this research, we also share our code, pre-trained models, and a new ESL learner test set with the research community.

TI Recognizing the Differentiation Degree of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem
   Cell-Derived Retinal Pigment Epithelium Cells Using Machine Learning and
   Deep Learning-Based Approaches
SO CELLS
AB Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be differentiated into mesenchymal stem cells (iPSC-MSCs), retinal ganglion cells (iPSC-RGCs), and retinal pigmental epithelium cells (iPSC-RPEs) to meet the demand of regeneration medicine. Since the production of iPSCs and iPSC-derived cell lineages generally requires massive and time-consuming laboratory work, artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted approach that can facilitate the cell classification and recognize the cell differentiation degree is of critical demand. In this study, we propose the multi-slice tensor model, a modified convolutional neural network (CNN) designed to classify iPSC-derived cells and evaluate the differentiation efficiency of iPSC-RPEs. We removed the fully connected layers and projected the features using principle component analysis (PCA), and subsequently classified iPSC-RPEs according to various differentiation degree. With the assistance of the support vector machine (SVM), this model further showed capabilities to classify iPSCs, iPSC-MSCs, iPSC-RPEs, and iPSC-RGCs with an accuracy of 97.8%. In addition, the proposed model accurately recognized the differentiation of iPSC-RPEs and showed the potential to identify the candidate cells with ideal features and simultaneously exclude cells with immature/abnormal phenotypes. This rapid screening/classification system may facilitate the translation of iPSC-based technologies into clinical uses, such as cell transplantation therapy.

TI Hyperspectral imaging for tissue classification, a way toward smart
   laparoscopic colorectal surgery
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS
AB In the last decades, laparoscopic surgery has become the gold standard in patients with colorectal cancer. To overcome the drawback of reduced tactile feedback, real-time tissue classification could be of great benefit. In this ex vivo study, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) was used to distinguish tumor tissue from healthy surrounding tissue. A sample of fat, healthy colorectal wall, and tumor tissue was collected per patient and imaged using two hyperspectral cameras, covering the wavelength range from 400 to 1700 nm. The data were randomly divided into a training (75%) and test (25%) set. After feature reduction, a quadratic classifier and support vector machine were used to distinguish the three tissue types. Tissue samples of 32 patients were imaged using both hyperspectral cameras. The accuracy to distinguish the three tissue types using both hyperspectral cameras was 0.88 (STD = 0.13) on the test dataset. When the accuracy was determined per patient, a mean accuracy of 0.93 (STD = 0.12) was obtained on the test dataset. This study shows the potential of using HSI in colorectal cancer surgery for fast tissue classification, which could improve clinical outcome. Future research should be focused on imaging entire colon/rectum specimen and the translation of the technique to an intraoperative setting. (C) The Authors.

TI Design and analysis of a class of redundant collaborative manipulators
   with 2D large rotational angles
SO FRONTIERS OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
AB The parallel spindle heads with high rotational capability are demanded in the area of multi-axis machine tools and 3D printers. This paper focuses on designing a class of 2R1T (R: Rotation; T: Translation) parallel spindle heads and the corresponding collaborative 5-axis manipulators with 2-dimension (2D) large rotational angles. In order to construct 2D rotational degrees of freedom (DOFs), a platform with 2D revolute joints is proposed first. Based on the constraint screw theory, the feasible limbs that can be connected in the platform are synthesized. In order to provide constant rotational axis for the platform, a class of redundant limbs are designed. A class of redundant 2R1T parallel spindle heads is obtained by connecting the redundant limbs with the platform and the redundant characteristics are verified by the modified Grubler-Kutzbach criterion. The corresponding 5-axis collaborative manipulators are presented by constructing a 2-DOF series translational bottom moving platform. The inverse kinematics and the orientation workspace as well as the decoupling characteristics of this type of 2R1T parallel spindle heads are analyzed. The results show that these manipulators have large 2D rotational angles than the traditional A3/Z3 heads and can be potentially used in the application of multi-axis machine tools and the 3D printers.

TI Attention-Based Recurrent Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine for
   Radar High Resolution Range Profile Sequence Recognition
SO SENSORS
AB The High Resolution Range Profile (HRRP) recognition has attracted great concern in the field of Radar Automatic Target Recognition (RATR). However, traditional HRRP recognition methods failed to model high dimensional sequential data efficiently and have a poor anti-noise ability. To deal with these problems, a novel stochastic neural network model named Attention-based Recurrent Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine (ARTRBM) is proposed in this paper. RTRBM is utilized to extract discriminative features and the attention mechanism is adopted to select major features. RTRBM is efficient to model high dimensional HRRP sequences because it can extract the information of temporal and spatial correlation between adjacent HRRPs. The attention mechanism is used in sequential data recognition tasks including machine translation and relation classification, which makes the model pay more attention to the major features of recognition. Therefore, the combination of RTRBM and the attention mechanism makes our model effective for extracting more internal related features and choose the important parts of the extracted features. Additionally, the model performs well with the noise corrupted HRRP data. Experimental results on the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) dataset show that our proposed model outperforms other traditional methods, which indicates that ARTRBM extracts, selects, and utilizes the correlation information between adjacent HRRPs effectively and is suitable for high dimensional data or noise corrupted data.

TI Intelligent Techniques Analysis for Glycosylation Site Prediction
SO CURRENT BIOINFORMATICS
AB Background: Glycosylation is one of the most common post-translation modifications (PTMs) in organism cells. It plays important roles in several biological processes including cell-cell interaction, protein folding, antigen recognition, and immune response. In addition, glycosylation is associated with many human diseases such as cancer, diabetes and coronaviruses. The experimental techniques for identifying glycosylation sites are time-consuming, extensive laboratory work, and expensive. Therefore, computational intelligence techniques are becoming very important for glycosylation site prediction. Objective: This paper is a theoretical discussion of the technical aspects of the biotechnological (e.g., using artificial intelligence and machine learning) to digital bioinformatics research and intelligent biocomputing. The computational intelligent techniques have shown efficient results for predicting N linked, O-linked and C-linked glycosylation sites. In the last two decades, many studies have been conducted for glycosylation site prediction using these techniques. In this paper, we analyze and compare a wide range of intelligent techniques of these studies from multiple aspects. The current challenges and difficulties facing the software developers and knowledge engineers for predicting glycosylation sites are also included. Methods: The comparison between these different studies is introduced including many criteria such as databases, feature extraction and selection, machine learning classification methods, evaluation measures and the performance results. Results and Conclusions: Many challenges and problems are presented. Consequently, more efforts are needed to get more accurate prediction models for the three basic types of glycosylation sites.

TI Enhancing brain-machine interface (BMI) control of a hand exoskeleton
   using electrooculography (EOG)
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION
AB Background: Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) allow direct translation of electric, magnetic or metabolic brain signals into control commands of external devices such as robots, prostheses or exoskeletons. However, non-stationarity of brain signals and susceptibility to biological or environmental artifacts impede reliable control and safety of BMIs, particularly in daily life environments. Here we introduce and tested a novel hybrid brain-neural computer interaction (BNCI) system fusing electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) to enhance reliability and safety of continuous hand exoskeleton-driven grasping motions.
   Findings: 12 healthy volunteers (8 male, mean age 28.1 +/- 3.63y) used EEG (condition #1) and hybrid EEG/EOG (condition #2) signals to control a hand exoskeleton. Motor imagery-related brain activity was translated into exoskeleton-driven hand closing motions. Unintended motions could be interrupted by eye movement-related EOG signals. In order to evaluate BNCI control and safety, participants were instructed to follow a visual cue indicating either to move or not to move the hand exoskeleton in a random order. Movements exceeding 25% of a full grasping motion when the device was not supposed to be moved were defined as safety violation. While participants reached comparable control under both conditions, safety was frequently violated under condition #1 (EEG), but not under condition #2 (EEG/EOG).
   Conclusion: EEG/EOG biosignal fusion can substantially enhance safety of assistive BNCI systems improving their applicability in daily life environments.

TI Comparison of a Novel Modified All-Suture Construct versus Suspensory
   Suture-button Fixation in a Syndesmotic Injury Model
SO JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC TRAUMA
AB Objectives:To biomechanically investigate a novel modified all-suture construct compared with commercially available suspensory button fixation for stabilization of the syndesmosis.Methods:Eight matched pairs of cadaver lower limbs were obtained. We used a material testing machine and Optotrak optoelectronic 3D motion measurement system for testing. Syndesmotic injuries were simulated, and specimens were fixed with either a suspensory suture button or modified all-suture construct. Repaired specimens were then cyclically loaded for 500 cycles. Spatial relationship of the tibia and fibula were continuously monitored for the intact, destabilized, and repaired states. The results were analyzed using independent samples t test.Results:There was no significant difference in sagittal or coronal plane translation between intact and either repair. Compared with the intact state, both repair techniques demonstrated significantly more external rotation of the fibula relative to the tibia and decreased construct stiffness. Cycling of the specimens did not significantly increase coronal or sagittal plane translation; however, external rotation of the fibula relative to the tibia increased and stiffness decreased with cycling for both repair techniques.Conclusions:Our data suggest that sagittal and coronal plane translation is no different from the intact state for both fixation techniques. However, rotation of the fibula relative to the tibia was increased, and construct stiffness was decreased compared with the intact state for both fixation techniques. These findings suggest that an all-suture construct could offer syndesmotic fixation comparable with proprietary suspensory button fixation in a cadaver model.

TI Cross-language information retrieval models based on latent topic models
   trained with document-aligned comparable corpora
SO INFORMATION RETRIEVAL
AB In this paper, we study different applications of cross-language latent topic models trained on comparable corpora. The first focus lies on the task of cross-language information retrieval (CLIR). The Bilingual Latent Dirichlet allocation model (BiLDA) allows us to create an interlingual, language-independent representation of both queries and documents. We construct several BiLDA-based document models for CLIR, where no additional translation resources are used. The second focus lies on the methods for extracting translation candidates and semantically related words using only per-topic word distributions of the cross-language latent topic model. As the main contribution, we combine the two former steps, blending the evidences from the per-document topic distributions and the per-topic word distributions of the topic model with the knowledge from the extracted lexicon. We design and evaluate the novel evidence-rich statistical model for CLIR, and prove that such a model, which combines various (only internal) evidences, obtains the best scores for experiments performed on the standard test collections of the CLEF 2001-2003 campaigns. We confirm these findings in an alternative evaluation, where we automatically generate queries and perform the known-item search on a test subset of Wikipedia articles. The main importance of this work lies in the fact that we train translation resources from comparable document-aligned corpora and provide novel CLIR statistical models that exhaustively exploit as many cross-lingual clues as possible in the quest for better CLIR results, without use of any additional external resources such as parallel corpora or machine-readable dictionaries.

TI A decade of progress in understanding the structural basis of protein
   synthesis
SO PROGRESS IN BIOPHYSICS & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB The key reaction of protein synthesis, peptidyl transfer, is catalysed in all living organisms by the ribosome - an advanced and highly efficient molecular machine. During the last decade extensive X-ray crystallographic and NMR studies of the three-dimensional structure of ribosomal proteins, ribosomal RNA components and their complexes with ribosomal proteins, and of several translation factors in different functional states have taken us to a new level of understanding of the mechanism of function of the protein synthesis machinery. Among the new remarkable features revealed by structural studies, is the mimicry of the tRNA molecule by elongation factor G, ribosomal recycling factor and the eukaryotic release factor 1. Several other translation factors, for which three-dimensional structures are not yet known, are also expected to show some form of tRNA mimicry. The efforts of several crystallographic and biochemical groups have resulted in the determination by X-ray crystallography of the structures of the 30S and 50S subunits at moderate resolution, and of the structure of the 70S subunit both by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (EM). In addition, low resolution cryo-EM models of the ribosome with different translation factors and tRNA have been obtained. The new ribosomal models allowed for the first time a clear identification of the functional centres of the ribosome and of the binding sites for tRNA and ribosomal proteins with known three-dimensional structure. The new structural data have opened a way for the design of new experiments aimed at deeper understanding at an atomic level of the dynamics of the system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Reconstructed 3D ultrasound of prostate gland finds application in several medical areas such as image guided biopsy, therapy planning and dose delivery [1]. In our application, we use an end-fire probe rotated about its axis to acquire a sequence of rotational slices to reconstruct 3D TRUS (Transrectal Ultrasound) image. The image acquisition system consists of an ultrasound transducer situated on a cradle directly attached to a rotational sensor. However, due to system tolerances, axis of probe does not align exactly with the designed axis of rotation resulting in artifacts in the 3D reconstructed ultrasound volume.
   We present a rigid registration based automatic probe calibration approach. The method uses a sequence of phantom images, each pair acquired at angular separation of 180 degrees and registers corresponding image pairs to compute the deviation from designed axis. A modified shadow removal algorithm is applied for preprocessing. An attribute vector is constructed from image intensity and a speckle-insensitive information-theoretic feature. We compare registration between the presented method and expert-corrected images in 16 prostate phantom scans. Images were acquired at multiple resolutions, and different misalignment settings from two ultrasound machines. Screenshots from 3D reconstruction are shown before and after misalignment correction. Registration parameters from automatic and manual correction were found to be in good agreement. Average absolute differences of translation and rotation between automatic and manual methods were 0.27 mm and 0.65 degree, respectively. The registration parameters also showed lower variability for automatic registration (pooled standard deviation sigma(translation) = 0.50 mm, sigma(rotation) = 0.52 degree) compared to the manual approach (pooled standard deviation sigma(translation) = 0.62 mm, sigma(rotation) = 0.78 degree).

TI DeepGRP: engineering a software tool for predicting genomic repetitive
   elements using Recurrent Neural Networks with attention
SO ALGORITHMS FOR MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Background Repetitive elements contribute a large part of eukaryotic genomes. For example, about 40 to 50% of human, mouse and rat genomes are repetitive. So identifying and classifying repeats is an important step in genome annotation. This annotation step is traditionally performed using alignment based methods, either in a de novo approach or by aligning the genome sequence to a species specific set of repetitive sequences. Recently, Li (Bioinformatics 35:4408-4410, 2019) developed a novel software tool dna-brnn to annotate repetitive sequences using a recurrent neural network trained on sample annotations of repetitive elements. Results We have developed the methods of dna-brnn further and engineered a new software tool DeepGRP. This combines the basic concepts of Li (Bioinformatics 35:4408-4410, 2019) with current techniques developed for neural machine translation, the attention mechanism, for the task of nucleotide-level annotation of repetitive elements. An evaluation on the human genome shows a 20% improvement of the Matthews correlation coefficient for the predictions delivered by DeepGRP, when compared to dna-brnn. DeepGRP predicts two additional classes of repeats (compared to dna-brnn) and is able to transfer repeat annotations, using RepeatMasker-based training data to a different species (mouse). Additionally, we could show that DeepGRP predicts repeats annotated in the Dfam database, but not annotated by RepeatMasker. DeepGRP is highly scalable due to its implementation in the TensorFlow framework. For example, the GPU-accelerated version of DeepGRP is approx. 1.8 times faster than dna-brnn, approx. 8.6 times faster than RepeatMasker and over 100 times faster than HMMER searching for models of the Dfam database. Conclusions By incorporating methods from neural machine translation, DeepGRP achieves a consistent improvement of the quality of the predictions compared to dna-brnn. Improved running times are obtained by employing TensorFlow as implementation framework and the use of GPUs. By incorporating two additional classes of repeats, DeepGRP provides more complete annotations, which were evaluated against three state-of-the-art tools for repeat annotation.

TI Pneumococcal RNase R globally impacts protein synthesis by regulating
   the amount of actively translating ribosomes
SO RNA BIOLOGY
AB Ribosomes are macromolecular machines that carry out protein synthesis. After each round of translation, ribosome recycling is essential for reinitiating protein synthesis. Ribosome recycling factor (RRF), together with elongation factor G (EF-G), catalyse the transient split of the 70S ribosome into subunits. This splitting is then stabilized by initiation factor 3 (IF3), which functions as an anti-association factor. The correct amount of these factors ensures the precise level of 70S ribosomes in the cell. RNase R is a highly conserved exoribonuclease involved in the 3MODIFIER LETTER PRIME to 5MODIFIER LETTER PRIME degradation of RNAs. In this work we show that pneumococcal RNase R directly controls the expression levels of frr, fusA and infC mRNAs, the corresponding transcripts of RRF, EF-G and IF3, respectively. We present evidences showing that accumulation of these factors leads to a decreased amount of 70S active particles, as demonstrated by the altered sucrose gradient ribosomal pattern in the RNase R mutant strain. Furthermore, the single deletion of RNase R is shown to have a global impact on protein synthesis and cell viability, leading to a similar to 50% reduction in bacterial CFU/ml. We believe that the fine-tuned regulation of these transcripts by RNase R is essential for maintaining the precise amount of active ribosomal complexes required for proper mRNA translation and thus we propose RNase R as a new auxiliary factor in ribosome reassociation. Considering the overall impact of RNase R on protein synthesis, one of the main targets of antibiotics, this enzyme may be a promising target for antimicrobial treatment.

AB Google Translate is a worldwide languages translation tool. We expected this tool can be used in communication among Thai pharmacists and Myanmar patients in drugstores. However, limitations of using in health and medical domains have been found. The aims of this study were to evaluate Google Translate for translating pharmaceutical texts between Thai and Myanmar with two levels of language structure, i.e., word and sentence and to test performance of translation with two methods, i.e., direct (directly translating from languages A to B) and indirect method (through English as intermediate). In the level of word, translating from Thai to Myanmar with the direct method was not significantly different when compared with the indirect method. The averages of acceptance rates were 38.84% and 40.26%, respectively. On the other hand, directly translating from Myanmar to Thai was more significantly accurate than the indirect method (p-value = 0.009). The averages of acceptance rate were 58.33% and 56.55%, respectively. The results of translating in the sentence level presented both semantic and syntactic errors. Adequacy scores of 1.91 and 1.94 as well as fluency scores of 1.89 and 1.92 (from the maximum score of 5) were obtained from the direct method Thai to Myanmar translation and the indirect method, respectively. Adequacy scores in directly translating from Myanmar to Thai and indirectly were 1.91 and 1.93 while fluency scores were 1.84 and 1.86, respectively. From the results, accuracy of Google Translate was limited to use in pharmacy domain. Therefore, it should be improved before applying in real situation because interpretations have an effect on quality of health care service to patients.

TI Combining in silico prediction and ribosome profiling in a genome-wide
   search for novel putatively coding sORFs
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB Background: It was long assumed that proteins are at least 100 amino acids (AAs) long. Moreover, the detection of short translation products (e. g. coded from small Open Reading Frames, sORFs) is very difficult as the short length makes it hard to distinguish true coding ORFs from ORFs occurring by chance. Nevertheless, over the past few years many such non-canonical genes (with ORFs < 100 AAs) have been discovered in different organisms like Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Drosophila melanogaster. Thanks to advances in sequencing, bioinformatics and computing power, it is now possible to scan the genome in unprecedented scrutiny, for example in a search of this type of small ORFs.
   Results: Using bioinformatics methods, we performed a systematic search for putatively functional sORFs in the Mus musculus genome. A genome-wide scan detected all sORFs which were subsequently analyzed for their coding potential, based on evolutionary conservation at the AA level, and ranked using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning model. The ranked sORFs are finally overlapped with ribosome profiling data, hinting to sORF translation. All candidates are visually inspected using an in-house developed genome browser. In this way dozens of highly conserved sORFs, targeted by ribosomes were identified in the mouse genome, putatively encoding micropeptides.
   Conclusion: Our combined genome-wide approach leads to the prediction of a comprehensive but manageable set of putatively coding sORFs, a very important first step towards the identification of a new class of bioactive peptides, called micropeptides.

TI Epigenetic Classifiers for Precision Diagnosis of Brain Tumors
SO EPIGENETICS INSIGHTS
AB DNA methylation profiling has proven to be a powerful analytical tool, which can accurately identify the tissue of origin of a wide range of benign and malignant neoplasms. Using microarray-based profiling and supervised machine learning algorithms, we and other groups have recently unraveled DNA methylation signatures capable of aiding the histomolecular diagnosis of different tumor types. We have explored the methylomes of metastatic brain tumors from patients with lung cancer, breast cancer, and cutaneous melanoma and primary brain neoplasms to build epigenetic classifiers. Our brain metastasis methylation (BrainMETH) classifier has the ability to determine the type of brain tumor, the origin of the metastases, and the clinical-therapeutic subtype for patients with breast cancer brain metastases. To facilitate the translation of these epigenetic classifiers into clinical practice, we selected and validated the most informative genomic regions utilizing quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (qMSP). We believe that the refinement, expansion, integration, and clinical validation of BrainMETH and other recently developed epigenetic classifiers will significantly contribute to the development of more comprehensive and accurate systems for the personalized management of patients with brain metastases.

TI Single-Molecule Pull-Down FRET to Dissect the Mechanisms of Biomolecular
   Machines
SO STRUCTURES OF LARGE RNA MOLECULES AND THEIR COMPLEXES
SE Methods in Enzymology
AB Spliceosomes are multimegadalton RNA-protein complexes responsible for the faithful removal of noncoding segments (introns) from pre-messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs), a process critical for the maturation of eukaryotic mRNAs for subsequent translation by the ribosome. Both the spliceosome and ribosome, as well as many other RNA and DNA processing machineries, contain central RNA components that endow biomolecular complexes with precise, sequence-specific nucleic acid recognition, and versatile structural dynamics. Single-molecule fluorescence (or Forster) resonance energy transfer (smFRET) microscopy is a powerful tool for the study of local and global conformational changes of both simple and complex biomolecular systems involving RNA. The integration of biochemical tools such as immunoprecipitation with advanced methods in smFRET microscopy and data analysis has opened up entirely new avenues toward studying the mechanisms of biomolecular machines isolated directly from complex biological specimens, such as cell extracts. Here, we detail the general steps for using prism-based total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy in exemplary single-molecule pull-down FRET studies of the yeast spliceosome and discuss the broad application potential of this technique.

AB Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are an important class of small non-coding RNAs which play a crucial role in gene regulation at the translational level. Both perfect and nearly perfect binding of miRNAs through base complementary could cause translation inhibition. Identification of miRNAs in organisms has mostly been focused on precursors of miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). These pre-miRNAs are found only in non-coding regions. However, pseudo pre-miRNAs, which are RNA sequences in the coding region, can be folded as hairpin structures. The classification of real and pseudo miRNAs is more complicated for plants, when compared to animals, due to their wider diversity. This study aims to extract the features of pre-miRNAs for classifying real and pseudo pre-miRNAs in plants and compare classification performance of five different machine learning approaches. Stochastic-based Random Forest and Naive Bayes Classifier showed the best classification performance with over 90% accuracy using 10-fold cross-validation and over 85% accuracy using cross-dataset validation.

TI Are Translators Afraid of Artificial Intelligence?
SO SOCIETIES
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is a leading technology in the digital transformation. AI is expected to cause job losses in general, initially in professions associated with routine activities, and subsequently in the field of creative professions. The present article analysed the results of the authors' own empirical sociological survey of the attitude of Bulgarian translators towards AI, and the ways in which it will change their profession. Most of them perceive artificial intelligence and automatization as threats to the profession. According to them, digital technologies and AI will modify the profession by relieving human translators of the routine, technical part of the job. Hence, translators will predominantly edit machine-translated texts, and teach artificial intelligence to perform machine translation. The conclusion of the analysis demonstrates that, in the case of Bulgarian translators, such pessimistic scenarios about mass jobs destruction are not justified. In addition, expectations of a deterioration in quality of work as a result of digitalization in the near future are not justified in the case of the translating profession. The present survey results serve as a basis for further research about the impact of artificial intelligence on other creative professions.

TI Unb-DPC: Identify mycobacterial membrane protein types by incorporating
   un-biased dipeptide composition into Chou's general PseAAC
SO JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY
AB This study investigates an efficient and accurate computational method for predicating mycobacterial membrane protein. Mycobacterium is a pathogenic bacterium which is the causative agent of tuberculosis and leprosy. The existing feature encoding algorithms for protein sequence representation such as composition and translation, and split amino acid composition cannot suitably express the mycobacterium membrane protein and their types due to biasness among different types. Therefore, in this study a novel un-biased dipeptide composition (Unb-DPC) method is proposed. The proposed encoding scheme has two advantages, first it avoid the biasness among the different mycobacterium membrane protein and their types. Secondly, the method is fast and preserves protein sequence structure information. The experimental results yield SVM based classification accurately of 97.1% for membrane protein types and 95.0% for discriminating mycobacterium membrane and non-membrane proteins by using jackknife cross validation test. The results exhibit that proposed model achieved significant predictive performance compared to the existing algorithms and will lead to develop a powerful tool for anti-mycobacterium drugs.

AB Kernel P systems (or kP systems) bring together relevant features from several P systems flavours into a unified kernel model which allows solving complex problems using a straightforward code programming approach. kPWorkbench is a software suite enabling specification, parsing and simulation of kP systems models defined in the kernel P-Lingua (or kP-Lingua) programming language. It has been shown that any computation of a kP system involving only rewriting and communication rules can be simulated by a family of Communicating Stream X-Machines (or CSXM), which are the core of FLAME agent based simulation environment. Following this, kPWorkbench enables translating kP-Lingua specifications into FLAME models, which can be simulated in a sequential or parallel (MPI based) way by using the FLAME framework. Moreover, FLAME GPU framework enables efficient simulation of CSXM on CUDA enabled GPGPU devices. In this paper we present an extension of kPWorkbench framework to generate FLAME models from kP-Lingua specifications including structural rules; and consider translation of FLAME specifications into FLAME GPU models. Also, we conduct a performance evaluation regarding simulation of equivalent kP systems and CSXM models in kPWorkbench and FLAME respectively.

TI Non-referential, self-compared shape defect inspection for bond pads
   with deformed shapes
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB Automated visual inspection algorithms for printed circuit boards have long been focused on geometric defects of conductive paths that comprise regularly straight line and circular arc segments. In this study, we aim at defect inspection of substrate bond pads consisting of rotated and deformed shapes. A non-referential, self-comparison machine vision scheme is proposed in this paper for shape defect detection of bond pads. It is invariant to translation and orientation, and is tolerable to shape deformation of faultless objects. A shape reconstruction technique based on Fourier transforms is first applied to restore an inspection object with varying smoothness. Two discrimination features are then extracted from the point-to-point distances between the original and reconstructed shapes. The first discrimination feature measures the global irregularity of the whole boundary of the inspection object, and the second feature measures the maximum local deviation of the object boundary. Experimental results of numerous real bond pad samples have shown that the proposed self-comparison scheme with the two discrimination features can well separate the clusters of faultless and defective samples.

AB When users seek to find specific resources in a digital library, they often use the library catalog to locate them. These catalog queries are defined as known item queries. As known item queries search for specific resources, it is important to manage them differently from other search types, such as area searches. We study how to identify known item queries in the context of a large academic institution's online public access catalog (OPAC), in which queries are issued via a simple keyword interface. We also examine how to recognize when a known item query has retrieved the item in question. Our approach combines techniques in machine learning, language modeling and machine translation evaluation metrics to build a classifier capable of distinguishing known item queries and correctly classifies titles for whether they are the known item sought with an 80% and 95% correlation to human performance, respectively on each task. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such work, which has the potential to streamline the user interface of both OPACs and digital libraries in support of known item searches.

AB High-level synthesis (HLS) is playing an ever-increasing role in hardware design, but concerns have been raised about its reliability. Seeking to address these, Herklotz et al. have developed an HLS compiler called Vericert that has been mechanically proven (using the Coq proof assistant) to output Verilog designs that are behaviourally equivalent to the input C program. Unfortunately, Vericert cannot compete performance-wise with established HLS tools, and a major reason for this is Vericert's complete lack of support for resource sharing.
   This paper introduces Vericert-Fun: Vericert extended with function-level resource sharing. Where original Vericert creates one block of hardware per function call, Vericert-Fun creates one block of hardware per function definition. To enable this, we extend Vericert's intermediate language HTL with the ability to represent multiple state machines, and we implement function calls by transferring control between these state machines. We are working to extend Vericert's correctness proof to cover the translation from C into this extended HTL and thence to Verilog. Benchmarking on the PolyBench/C suite indicates that Vericert-Fun generates hardware with about 0.8x the resource usage of Vericert's on average, with minimal impact on execution time.

AB Bengali, one of the most spoken languages, lacks tools and resources for sentiment analysis. To date, the Bengali language does not have any sentiment lexicon of its own; only the translated versions of English lexica are available. Therefore, in this work, we focus on developing a Bengali sentiment lexicon from a large Bengali review corpus utilizing a cross-lingual approach. To build the sentiment dictionary, we first created a Bengali corpus of around 42000 drama reviews; among them, we manually annotated around 12000 reviews. Utilizing a machine translation system, labeled and unlabeled Bengali review corpus, English sentiment lexica, pointwise mutual information (PMI), and supervised machine learning (ML) classifiers in different phases, we develop a Bengali sentiment lexicon of around 1000 sentiment words. We compare the coverage of our lexicon with the translated English lexica in two evaluation datasets. The proposed lexicon achieves 70%-74% coverage in document-level and around 65% coverage in word-level, which is approximately 30%-100% improvement over the translated lexica in word-level and 30%-50% in document-level. The results demonstrate that our developed lexicon is highly effective in recognizing sentiments in the Bengali text.

TI Delayed Graft Function After Kidney Transplantation: The Clinical
   Perspective
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF KIDNEY DISEASES
AB Delayed graft function continues to pose a significant challenge to clinicians in the context of kidney transplantation. With the present disparity between supply and demand for organs, transplantation is proceeding with more marginal kidneys and therefore the problem of delayed graft function is likely to increase in the future. Although our understanding of the mechanism and risk factors for delayed graft function has improved, translation of this understanding into targeted clinical therapy to attenuate or manage established delayed graft function has been elusive. Based on current trends, the use of kidneys from expanded criteria or cardiac death donors will continue to expand, which will increase the prevalence of delayed graft function in the immediate postoperative setting. The aim of this article is to discuss and critique the available clinical evidence for targeted intervention in the prevention and management of delayed graft function and review emerging and experimental therapies.

TI 2D AND 3D OPTIMAL PARALLEL IMAGE WARPING
SO JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING
AB Spatial image warping is useful for image processing and graphics.  In this paper, we present concurrent-read-exclusive-write (CREW) and exclusive-read-exclusive-write (EREW) parallel-random-access-machine (PRAM) algorithms that achieve O(1) asymptotic run time.  The significant result is the creative processor assignment that results in an EREW PRAM algorithm.  The forward algorithm calculates any nonscaling affine transform including arbitrary skewings, translations, and rotations.  The EREW algorithm is the most efficient in practice, and the MasPar MP-1 with 16K processors rotates a 4-million-element image in under a second and a 2-million-element volume in one-half of a second.  This high performance allows interactive viewing of volumes from arbitrary viewpoints and illustrates linear speedup.  This practical efficiency is analyzed and illustrated by using a bridging model of computation.  We develop the mixed cost communication machine (MCCM) to quantify the communication costs and correlate these costs to the MasPar MP-1.  The forward algorithm has provable N = 1 congestion on the MCCM, while the backward algorithm has congestion N > 1 which varies with the transform.  There are also important quality advantages using our direct warping techniques; empirical measurements are given to provide comparisons to multipass warps.  (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.

AB Dynamic Binary Translation (DBT) is the key technology behind cross-platform virtualization and allows software compiled for one Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) to be executed on a processor supporting a different ISA. Under the hood, DBT is typically implemented using Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation of frequently executed program regions, also called traces. The main challenge is translating frequently executed program regions as fast as possible into highly efficient native code. As time for JIT compilation adds to the overall execution time, the JIT compiler is often de-coupled and operates in a separate thread independent from the main simulation loop to reduce the overhead of JIT compilation. In this paper we present two innovative contributions. The first contribution is a generalized trace compilation approach that considers all frequently executed paths in a program for JIT compilation, as opposed to previous approaches where trace compilation is restricted to paths through loops. The second contribution reduces JIT compilation cost by compiling several hot traces in a concurrent task farm. Altogether we combine generalized light-weight tracing, large translation units, parallel JIT compilation and dynamic work scheduling to ensure timely and efficient processing of hot traces. We have evaluated our industry-strength, LLVM-based parallel DBT implementing the ARCompact IsA against three benchmark suites (EEMBC, BIOPERF and SPEC CPU2006) and demonstrate speedups of up to 2.08 on a standard quad-core Intel Xeon machine. Across short- and long-running benchmarks our scheme is robust and never results in a slowdown. In fact, using four processors total execution time can be reduced by on average 11.5% over state-of-the-art decoupled, parallel (or asynchronous) JIT compilation.

AB Research in the field of computer linguistics is relevant due to the rapid growth of information in natural languages on the Internet and social networks. Currently, there is an increase in the amount of information that humans and machines create in natural language. Information retrieval systems, dialog systems, machine translation, and automatic resume tools, spelling check modules analyze and process texts in natural languages. Thus, the range of automatic word processing systems is wide and covers a variety of tasks. One of the most important tasks of natural language processing (NLP) is to find errors in texts and including words, identify and correct incorrect words. The article provides an overview of semi-structured data, methods, and technologies for detecting incorrect words in natural languages. An approach for identifying incorrect words in the Kazakh language was developed and the features and capabilities of this approach were analyzed. A comparative analysis of texts on the Internet and social networks and of technologies that identify incorrect words in natural languages has been carried out.

AB This paper gives an overview of Morpho Challenge 2008 competition and results. The goal of the challenge was to evaluate unsupervised algorithms that; provide morpheme analyses for words in different languages. For morphologically complex languages, such as Finnish, Turkish and Arabic, morpheme analysis is particularly important for lexical modeling of words in speech recognition, information retrieval and machine translation. The evaluation in Morpho Challenge competitions consisted of both a linguistic and an application oriented performance analysis. In addition to the Finnish, Turkish, German and English evaluations performed in Morpho Challenge 2007, the competition this year had an additional evaluation for Arabic. The results in linguistic evaluation in 2008 show that although the level of precision and recall varies substantially between the tasks in different languages; the best methods seem to deal quite well with all languages involved. The results in information retrieval evaluation indicate that the morpheme analysis has a significant effect in all the tested languages (Finnish, English and German). The best unsupervised and language-independent morpheme analysis methods can also rival the best language-dependent word normalization methods. The Morpho Challenge was part of the EU Network of Excellence PASCAL Challenge Program and organized in collaboration with CLEF.

AB In the modern area of fast-moving technology we can do things that we never thought we couldn't do before and automation has taken over everything in day-to-day life. One such creation is the virtual assistant. It has become a boon for everyone in this new era of the 21st century. The improvement has gone up to the capabilities of becoming a personal companion to humans. We can ask questions from machines and can interact with machines using this technology of virtual assistance. This technology spread rapidly in smartphones, laptops, computers, etc. Some iconic virtual assistants are Siri, Google Assistant, Cortana, and Alexa. Voice recognition, speech identification, and the relevant reaction is the basis for virtual assistance. Some of the issues regarding the available virtual assistances are the incompatibility with certain languages. Sinhala is one such language at the moment not included in a virtual assistance environment. The proposed project is designed to associate some Sinhala commands with their corresponding responses to guide a Sinhala user. Furthermore, for global reach, the project will be deployed on a cloud basis for the public to reach the global Sinhala language users.

AB We propose a novel obstacle categorization model combining global feature with local feature to identify cars, pedestrians and unknown backgrounds. A new obstacle identification method, which is hybrid the global feature and local feature, is proposed for robustly recognizing an obstacle with and without occlusion. For the global analysis, we propose the modified GIST based on biologically motivated the C1 feature, which is robust to image translation. We also propose the local feature based categorization model for recognizing partially occluded obstacle. The local feature is composed of orientation information at a salient position based on the C1 feature. A classifier based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) is designed to classify these two features as cars, pedestrians and unknown backgrounds. Finally, all classified results are combined. Mainly, the obstacle categorization model makes a decision based on the global feature analysis. Since the global feature cannot express partially occluded obstacle, the local feature based model verifies the result of the global feature based model when the result is an unknown background. Experimental results show that the proposed model successfully categorizes obstacles including partially occluded obstacles.

AB Home emergencies affect greatly the health of inhabitants (mostly children, elderly and dependent persons). Nowadays, the deployment of smart home doesn't require purchasing expensive devices due to advances in communication and computing technologies. However, implementing a customized home emergencies management system is not an easy task. Indeed, it involves two disciplines: (i) Medicine and (ii) Information and Communication Technologies as mentioned by the World Health Organization.
   In this paper, we propose an approach that hybridizes the two concepts: FSM theory and set theory. The aim is being to facilitate (i) the design of the system behavior for the health professionals, (ii) the translation of the human readable format (emergency management rules) to a machine readable format for the computer specialist, and (iii) mainly the verification of the FSM properties for reducing human errors for both of them. The paper gives the formal description of the setbased FSM, properties that have to be taken into account and the representation of process algebra expressions. Finally, we describe a case study to illustrate the benefits of the proposed FSM.

AB Since we were babies, we intuitively develop the ability to correlate the input from different cognitive sensors such as vision, audio, and text. However, in machine learning, this cross-modal learning is a nontrivial task because different modalities have no homogeneous properties. Previous works discover that there should be bridges among different modalities. From a neurology and psychology perspective, humans have the capacity to link one modality with another one, e.g., associating a picture of a bird with the only hearing of its singing and vice versa. Is it possible for machine learning algorithms to recover the scene given the audio signal?
   In this paper, we propose a novel Cascade Attention-Guided Residue GAN (CAR-GAN), aiming at reconstructing the scenes given the corresponding audio signals. Particularly, we present a residue module to mitigate the gap between different modalities progressively. Moreover, a cascade attention guided network with a novel classification loss function is designed to tackle the crossmodal learning task. Our model keeps consistency in the high-level semantic label domain and is able to balance two different modalities. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves the state-of-the-art cross-modal audio-visual generation on the challenging Sub-URMP dataset.

AB One of the biggest obstacles on the path to digitalization in an industrial environment is the lack of communication standards. This is particularly evident where several domains meet. In this case, conventional machine tools, robotics and computer vision have to interact over a common interface. We propose a structure based on OPC UA, which unifies the procedure of programming for the human operator, regardless of whether the task is performed by a robot or a machine tool in the end. The idea is to use OPC UA skills for the manufacturing of components, that consist of common standard geometric features such as holes or pockets. Our approach enables the translation of required manufacturing parameters directly from a CAD model to OPC UA skills instead of using CAM. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate suitable CAD interfaces as well as enabling an autonomous implementation of the process on a manufacturing system. From this approach, the definition of an OPC UA Companion Specification for manufacturing processes could be derived. The implementation of the concept is carried out on a flexible robot cell.

AB Given the high labor costs of developing new lexical resources for Machine Translation (MT) and language processing systems, it is desirable to make the most of those resources already in existence. This paper describes the work being carried out on two MT projects that share a common goal: the creation, maintenance and reuse of lexical information. This goal calls into play a range of tasks from dictionary mining of machine-readable dictionaries (MRDs) to the definition of a repository capable of housing this diverse lexical information. This paper outlines the two efforts, focusing on the problems encountered and the intermediate results achieved. While the ultimate goal of the automated processing of on-line resources into multi-purpose lexical repositories is far from being achieved, our experience has shown that there are significant applications that can make use of the partially processed information produced en route. We will describe our experience with two projects, with a focus on one which utilized multiple lexical resources to provide the basis for two natural language processing (NLP) tools: a segmenter and a glosser for Thai. Finally, we make recommendations for future resource development, with a view toward mitigating the difficulties of merging information from diverse sources.

AB Owing to the growing need of acquiring medical data from clinical records, processing such documents is an important topic in natural language processing (NLP). However, for general NLP methods to work, a proper, normalized input is required. Otherwise the system is overwhelmed by the unusually high amount of noise generally characteristic of this kind of text. The different types of this noise originate from non-standard language use: short fragments instead of proper sentences, usage of Latin words, many acronyms and very frequent misspellings.
   In this paper, a method is described for the automated correction of spelling errors in Hungarian clinical records. First, a word-based algorithm was implemented to generate a ranked list of correction candidates for word forms regarded as incorrect. Second, the problem of spelling correction was modelled as a translation task, where the source language is the erroneous text and the target language is the corrected one. A Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) decoder performed the task of error correction. Since no orthographically correct proofread text from this domain is available, we could not use such a corpus for training the system. Instead, the word-based system was used to create translation models. In addition, a 3-gram token-based language model was used to model lexical context. Due to the high number of abbreviations and acronyms in the texts, the behaviour of these abbreviated forms was further examined both in the case of the context-unaware word-based and the SMT-decoder-based implementations.
   The results show that the SMT-based method outperforms the first candidate accuracy of the word-based ranking system. However, the normalization of abbreviations should be handled as a separate task. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The vast and fast-growing STEM literature makes it imperative to develop systems for automated math-semantics extraction from technical content, and for semantically-enabled processing of such content. Grammar-based techniques alone are inadequate for the task. We present a new project for using deep learning (DL) for that purpose. It will explore a number of DL and representation-learning models, which have shown superior performance in applications that involve sequences of data. As math and science involve sequences of text, symbols and equations, such as deep learning models are expected to deliver good performance in math-semantics extraction and processing.
   The project has several goals: (1) to apply different DL models to math-semantics extraction and processing, designing more suitable models as needed, for such foundational tasks as accurate tagging and automated translation from LATEX to semantically-resolved machine understandable forms such as cMathML; (2) to create and make available to the public labeled math-content datasets for model training and testing, and Word2Vec/Math2Vec representations derived from large math datasets; and (3) to conduct extensive comparative performance evaluations gaining insights into which DL models, data representations, and traditional machine learning models, are best for the above-stated goals.

TI Hypernetworks: A molecular evolutionary architecture for cognitive
   learning and memory
SO IEEE COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE MAGAZINE
AB Recent interest in human-level intelligence suggests a rethink of the role of machine learning in computational intelligence. We argue that without cognitive learning the goal of achieving human-level synthetic intelligence is far from completion. Here we review the principles underlying human learning and memory, and identify three of them, i.e., continuity, glocality, and compositionality, as the most fundamental to human-level machine learning. We then propose the recently-developed hypernet-work model as a candidate architecture for cognitive learning and memory. Hypernetworks are a random hypergraph structure higher-order probabilistic relations of data by an evolutionary self-organizing process based on molecular self-assembly. The chemically-based massive interaction for information organization and processing in the molecular hypernetworks, referred to as hyperinteractionism, is contrasted with the symbolist, connectionist, and dynamicist approaches to mind and intelligence. We demonstrate the generative learning capability of the hypernetworks to simulate linguistic recall memory, visual imagery, and language-vision crossmodal translation based on a video corpus of movies and dramas in a multimodal memory game environment. We also offer prospects for the hyperinteractionistic molecular mind approach to a unified theory of cognitive learning.

TI Spectral-Spatial Classification of Hyperspectral Images via Spatial
   Translation-Invariant Wavelet-Based Sparse Representation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
AB For hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, it is challenging to adopt the methodology of sparse-representation-based classification. In this paper, we first propose an l(1)-minimization-based spectral-spatial classification method for HSIs via a spatial translation-invariant wavelet (STIW)-based sparse representation (STIW-SR), wherein both the spectrum dictionary and the analyzed signal are formed with STIW features. Due to the capability of a STIW to reduce both the observation noise and the spatial nonstationarity while maintaining the ideal spectra, which is proved with our signal-interference-noise spectrum model involved, it is expected that the pixels in the same class congregate in a lower dimensional subspace, and the separations among class-specific subspaces are enhanced, thus yielding a highly discriminative sparse representation. Then, we develop an approach to evaluate the sparsity recoverability of an l(1)-minimization on HSIs in a probabilistic framework. This approach takes into account not only the recovery probability under the given support length of the l(0)-norm solution but also the a priori probability of the support length; consequently, it overcomes the inability of traditional mutual/cumulative coherence conditions to address high-coherence HSIs. This paper reveals that the higher sparsity recoverability of a STIW-SR leads to its higher classification accuracy and that the increasing coherence does not necessarily lead to a reduced sparsity recovery probability, and this paper verifies the connection between l(0) and l(1)-minimizations on HSIs. Experimental results from real-world HSIs suggest that our classification method significantly outperforms several representative spectral-spatial classifiers and support vector machines.

TI Deep recurrent neural networks with word embeddings for Urdu named
   entity recognition
SO ETRI JOURNAL
AB Named entity recognition (NER) continues to be an important task in natural language processing because it is featured as a subtask and/or subproblem in information extraction and machine translation. In Urdu language processing, it is a very difficult task. This paper proposes various deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) learning models with word embedding. Experimental results demonstrate that they improve upon current state-of-the-art NER approaches for Urdu. The DRRN models evaluated include forward and bidirectional extensions of the long short-term memory and back propagation through time approaches. The proposed models consider both language-dependent features, such as part-of-speech tags, and language-independent features, such as the "context windows" of words. The effectiveness of the DRNN models with word embedding for NER in Urdu is demonstrated using three datasets. The results reveal that the proposed approach significantly outperforms previous conditional random field and artificial neural network approaches. The best f-measure values achieved on the three benchmark datasets using the proposed deep learning approaches are 81.1%, 79.94%, and 63.21%, respectively.

TI ORFpred: A Machine Learning Program to Identify Translatable Small Open
   Reading Frames in Intergenic Regions of the Plasmodium falciparum Genome
SO CURRENT BIOINFORMATICS
AB Motivation: Small Open Reading Frames (smORFs) are involved in a variety of cellular processes varying from metabolism to gene regulation and eukaryotic genomes have been predicted to contain a large number of smORFs. Only a meager 174 smORFs have been annotated in the genome of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Although millions of smORFs can be extracted from the parasite genome, the identification of translatable smORFs from the P. falciparum genome is a challenging task due to low accuracy of existing smORF predictors when applied to an AT biased genome.
   Result: We developed ORFpred, a machine learning algorithm which calculates the probability of translation initiation and elongation of ORFs in the P. falciparum genome. ORFpred identified 2204 translatable smORFs and when compared to available predictors, showed higher accuracy. We believe that ORFpred will help in identification of probable protein coding smORFs in other eukaryotic genomes.

TI Artificial Intelligence Algorithms to Diagnose Glaucoma and Detect
   Glaucoma Progression: Translation to Clinical Practice
SO TRANSLATIONAL VISION SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Purpose: This concise review aims to explore the potential for the clinical implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) strategies for detecting glaucoma and monitoring glaucoma progression.
   Methods: Nonsystematic literature review using the search combinations "Artificial Intelligence," "Deep Learning," "Machine Learning," "Neural Networks," "Bayesian Networks," "Glaucoma Diagnosis," and "Glaucoma Progression." Information on sensitivity and specificity regarding glaucoma diagnosis and progression analysis as well as methodological details were extracted.
   Results: Numerous AI strategies provide promising levels of specificity and sensitivity for structural (e.g. optical coherence tomography [OCT] imaging, fundus photography) and functional (visual field [VF] testing) test modalities used for the detection of glaucoma. Area under receiver operating curve (AROC) values of > 0.90 were achieved with every modality. Combining structural and functional inputs has been shown to even more improve the diagnostic ability. Regarding glaucoma progression, AI strategies can detect progression earlier than conventional methods or potentially from one single VF test.
   Conclusions: AI algorithms applied to fundus photographs for screening purposes may provide good results using a simple and widely accessible test. However, for patients who are likely to have glaucoma more sophisticated methods should be used including data from OCT and perinnetry. Outputs may serve as an adjunct to assist clinical decision making, whereas also enhancing the efficiency, productivity, and quality of the delivery of glaucoma care. Patients with diagnosed glaucoma may benefitfronn future algorithms to evaluate their risk of progression. Challenges are yet to be overcome, including the external validity of AI strategies, a move from a "black box" toward "explainable AI," and likely regulatory hurdles. However, it is clear that AI can enhance the role of specialist clinicians and will inevitably shape the future of the delivery of glaucoma care to the next generation.
   Translational Relevance: The promising levels of diagnostic accuracy reported by AI strategies across the modalities used in clinical practice for glaucoma detection can pave the way for the development of reliable models appropriate for their translation into clinical practice. Future incorporation of AI into healthcare models may help address the current limitations of access and timely management of patients with glaucoma across the world.

AB Metaphor is a literary device that allows us to express a concept in terms of another. In other words, it is based on similarity between concepts. Metaphorical expressions represent a great variety and they are used in conventional metaphors, which we reproduce and comprehend every day, poetic, novel, and Holy Qur'an. The use of metaphor is ubiquitous in natural language text and it is a serious bottleneck in automatic text understanding, and developing methods to identify and deal with metaphors is an open problem in Arabic natural language processing, especially Machine Translation. Due to the complexities involved in metaphor, it semantically influenced the meaning of machine-translated text. This makes metaphor an important research area for computational and cognitive linguistics, and its automatic identification and interpretation is indispensable for any semantics-oriented Arabic natural language processing. In this paper, we present the challenges of Arabic NLP of metaphors, which is very important in developing a computational NLP-based system for in Classical Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic and Dialect Arabic. We also highlight main problems that arises when translating an Arabic metaphor to another language.

TI Incorporating plasmonic featurization with machine learning to achieve
   accurate and bidirectional prediction of nanoparticle size and size
   distribution
SO NANOSCALE HORIZONS
AB Determination of nanoparticle size and size distribution is important because these key parameters dictate nanomaterials' properties and applications. Yet, it is only accomplishable using low-throughput electron microscopy. Herein, we incorporate plasmonic-domain-driven feature engineering with machine learning (ML) for accurate and bidirectional prediction of both parameters for complete characterization of nanoparticle ensembles. Using gold nanospheres as our model system, our ML approach achieves the lowest prediction errors of 2.3% and +/- 1.0 nm for ensemble size and size distribution respectively, which is 3-6 times lower than previously reported ML or Mie approaches. Knowledge elicitation from the plasmonic domain and concomitant translation into featurization allow us to mitigate noise and boost data interpretability. This enables us to overcome challenges arising from size anisotropy and small sample size limitations to achieve highly generalizable ML models. We further showcase inverse prediction capabilities, using size and size distribution as inputs to generate spectra with LSPRs that closely match experimental data. This work illustrates a ML-empowered total nanocharacterization strategy that is rapid (<30 s), versatile, and applicable over a wide size range of 200 nm.

In our case study, the Guideline 36 sequences yield 30% lower annual site LIVAC energy use, under comparable comfort, than sequences published earlier by ASHRAE. The 30% differences in annual HVAC energy consumption due to changes in the control sequences raises the question of whether the idealization of control sequences that is common practice in today's building energy simulation leads to trustworthy energy use predictions.

TI A novel word sense disambiguation approach using WordNet knowledge graph
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB Various applications in computational linguistics and artificial intelligence rely on high performing word sense disambiguation techniques to solve challenging tasks such as information retrieval, machine translation, question answering, and document clustering. While text comprehension is intuitive for humans, machines face tremendous challenges in processing and interpreting a human's natural language. This paper presents a novel knowledge-based word sense disambiguation algorithm, namely Sequential Contextual Similarity Matrix Multiplication (SCSMM). The SCSMM algorithm combines semantic similarity, heuristic knowledge, and document context to respectively exploit the merits of local sense-based context between consecutive terms, human knowledge about terms, and a document's main topic in disambiguating terms. Unlike other algorithms, the SCSMM algorithm guarantees the capture of the maximum sentence context while maintaining the terms' order within the sentence. The proposed algorithm outperformed all other algorithms when disambiguating nouns on the combined gold standard datasets, while demonstrating comparable results to current stateof-the-art word sense disambiguation systems when dealing with each dataset separately. Furthermore, the paper discusses the impact of granularity level, ambiguity rate, sentence size, and part of speech distribution on the performance of the proposed algorithm.

TI On the use of automatically acquired examples for all-nouns Word Sense
   Disambiguation
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
AB This article focuses on Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), which is a Natural Language Processing task that is thought to be important for many Language Technology applications, such as Information Retrieval, Information Extraction, or Machine Translation. One of the main issues preventing the deployment of WSD technology is the lack of training examples for Machine Learning systems, also known as the Knowledge Acquisition Bottleneck. A method which has been shown to work for small samples of words is the automatic acquisition of examples. We have previously shown that one of the most promising example acquisition methods scales up and produces a freely available database of 150 million examples from Web snippets for all polysemous nouns in WordNet. This paper focuses on the issues that arise when using those examples, all alone or in addition to manually tagged examples, to train a supervised WSD system for all nouns. The extensive evaluation on both lexical-sample and all-words Senseval benchmarks shows that we are able to improve over commonly used baselines and to achieve top-rank performance. The good use of the prior distributions from the senses proved to be a crucial factor.

AB With the increasing computational demands of neural networks, many hardware accelerators for the neural networks have been proposed. Such existing neural network accelerators often focus on popular neural network types such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs); however, not much attention has been paid to attention mechanisms, an emerging neural network primitive that enables neural networks to retrieve most relevant information from a knowledge-base, external memory, or past states. The attention mechanism is widely adopted by many state-of-the-art neural networks for computer vision, natural language processing, and machine translation, and accounts for a large portion of total execution time. We observe today's practice of implementing this mechanism using matrix-vector multiplication is suboptimal as the attention mechanism is semantically a content-based search where a large portion of computations ends up not being used. Based on this observation, we design and architect A(3), which accelerates attention mechanisms in neural networks with algorithmic approximation and hardware specialization. Our proposed accelerator achieves multiple orders of magnitude improvement in energy efficiency (performance/watt) as well as substantial speedup over the state-of-the-art conventional hardware.

AB DNS poisoning attacks inject malicious entries into the DNS resolution system, allowing an attacker to redirect clients to malicious servers. These attacks typically target a DNS resolver allowing attackers to poison a DNS entry for all machines that use the compromised resolver. However, recent defenses can effectively protect resolvers rendering classical DNS poisoning attacks ineffective. In this paper, we present a new class of DNS poisoning attacks targeting the client-side DNS cache. The attack initiates DNS poisoning on the client cache, which is used in all main stream operating systems to improve DNS performance, circumventing defenses targeting resolvers. Our attack allows an off-path attacker to collaborate with a piece of an unprivileged malware to poison the OS-wide DNS cache on a client machine. We developed the attack on Windows, Mac OS, and Ubuntu Linux. Interestingly, the behaviors of the three operating systems are distinct and the vulnerabilities require different strategies to exploit. We also generalize the attack to work even when the client is behind a Network Address Translation (NAT) router. Our results show that we can reliably inject malicious DNS mappings, with on average, an order of tens of seconds. Finally, we propose a defense against this type of poisoning attacks.

TI Interspecific comparison of gene expression profiles using machine
   learning
SO PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
AB Interspecific gene comparisons are the keystones for many areas of biological research and are especially important for the translation of knowledge from model organisms to economically important species. Currently they are hampered by the low resolution of methods based on sequence analysis and by the complex evolutionary history of eukaryotic genes. This is especially critical for plants, whose genomes are shaped by multiple whole genome duplications and subsequent gene loss. This requires the development of new methods for comparing the functions of genes in different species. Here, we report ISEEML (Interspecific Similarity of Expression Evaluated using Machine Learning)-a novel machine learning-based algorithm for interspecific gene classification. In contrast to previous studies focused on sequence similarity, our algorithm focuses on functional similarity inferred from the comparison of gene expression profiles. We propose novel metrics for expression pattern similarity-expression score (ES)-that is suitable for species with differing morphologies. As a proof of concept, we compare detailed transcriptome maps of Arabidopsis thaliana, the model species, Zea mays (maize) and Fagopyrum esculentum (common buckwheat), which are species that represent distant clades within flowering plants. The classifier resulted in an AUC of 0.91; under the ES threshold of 0.5, the specificity was 94%, and sensitivity was 72%.
   Author summaryInterspecific gene comparisons are keystone for many areas of biological research, being especially important for the translation of knowledge from model organisms to economically important species. Currently, they are based on the concept of orthology-the orthologs are assumed to have similar functions (the so called Ortholog Conjecture). This approach is problematic for two reasons: 1) the universal applicability of Ortholog Conjecture is arguable 2) the accuracy of orthology inference is complicated due to multiple whole genome duplications and subsequent gene loss-the typical processes for most eukaryotic organisms. We report a novel machine-learning-based algorithm for the interspecific gene comparison. In contrast to previous studies, which focus on sequence similarity, it focuses on the similarity of function at the organismic level approximated by the expression patterns. As source of information for the classification, we use detailed gene expression maps. Our study for the first time proposes a metrics for comparison of expression maps suitable for species with differing morphologies and/or developmental rates. Without this, the comparisons of expression maps were possible only either for closely related species with similar morphology or for very low resolution maps. In contrast, our approach is suitable for the wide range of organisms with no limitations of their morphology and the resolution of expression maps.

TI Collaborative optimization with PSO for named entity recognition-based
   applications
SO INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS
AB Named entity recognition (NER) as a crucial technology is widely used in many application scenarios, including information extraction, information retrieval, text summarization, and machine translation assisted in AI-based smart communication and networking systems. As people pay more and more attention to NER, it has gradually become an independent and important research field. Currently, most of the NER models need to manually adjust their hyper-parameters, which is not only time-consuming and laborious, but also easy to fall into a local optimal situation. To deal with such problem, this paper proposes a machine learning-guided model to achieve NER, where the hyper-parameters of model are automatically adjusted to improve the computational performance. Specifically, the proposed model is implemented by using bi-directional encoder representation from transformers (BERT) and conditional random field (CRF). Meanwhile, the collaborative computing paradigm is also fused in the model, while utilizing the particle swarm optimization (PSO) to automatically search for the best value of hyper-parameters in a collaborative way. The experimental results demonstrate the satisfactory performance of our proposed model.

TI The Ribosome as an Allosterically Regulated Molecular Machine
SO BIOCHEMISTRY-MOSCOW
AB The ribosome as a complex molecular machine undergoes significant conformational rearrangements during the synthesis of polypeptide chains of proteins. In this review, information obtained using various experimental methods on the internal consistency of such rearrangements is discussed. It is demonstrated that allosteric regulation involves all the main stages of the operation of the ribosome and connects functional elements remote by tens and even hundreds of angstroms. Data obtained using Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) show that translocation is controlled in general by internal mechanisms of the ribosome, and not by the position of the ligands. Chemical probing data revealed the relationship of such remote sites as the decoding, peptidyl transferase, and GTPase centers of the ribosome. Nevertheless, despite the large amount of experimental data accumulated to date, many details and mechanisms of these phenomena are still not understood. Analysis of these data demonstrates that the development of new approaches is necessary for deciphering the mechanisms of allosteric regulation of the operation of the ribosome.

TI Disease detection of Cercospora Leaf Spot in sugar beet by robust
   template matching
SO COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
AB In a multidisciplinary scheme linking computer science with agricultural engineering, a novel approach based on orientation code matching (OCM) for robust, continuous, and site-specific observations of disease development in sugar beet plants is presented. Differing from conventional plant disease detection approaches, we introduce the robust template matching method of OCM in this paper to not only realize continuous and site-specific observations of disease progress, but also to demonstrate its excellent robustness for non-rigid plant object searching in scene illumination, translation, slight rotation, and occlusion changes. Furthermore, a single-feature two-dimensional xy-color histogram is proposed and input into support vector machine (SVM) classifier for pixel-wise disease classification and quantification. Experimental results with high precision and recall rates demonstrate the feasibility and potential of our proposed algorithm, which could be further implemented in real sugar beet fields with robust detection and precise quantization of foliar disease development, for better analysis of disease mechanism and optimal fungicide-spraying management.

TI OBJECT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT OF ARCHITECTURE TRANSPARENT SOFTWARE FOR
   DISTRIBUTED PARALLEL SYSTEMS
SO COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS
AB Compared with programming sequential computers, programming distributed parallel computing systems has additional complexity due to the considerations of parallelism, synchronization, the network configuration of the distributed computing system, and the topology of the parallel processors. Current programming practices, however, are not sufficient to make effective use of such computing systems. In this paper, an approach to software development for distributed parallel processing systems which is architecture transparent is presented. This approach is based on the object-oriented concept, and facilitates the design and coding of software by separating the architecture-dependent issues from the semantics of the software. This makes the software system independent of the target machine or the network configuration. and easily portable to other machines. In our approach, the parallelism is implicit in the program, and the programmer does not need to be concerned with issues such as synchronization, network configuration or the topology of the parallel processors. Our approach can reduce the communication and synchronization errors caused by the programmer by automatically embedding the proper codes during the translation and allocation phases of the software development cycle.

SO DATABASE-THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL DATABASES AND CURATION
AB Tracking scientific research publications on the evaluation, utility and implementation of genomic applications is critical for the translation of basic research to impact clinical and population health. In this work, we utilize state-of-the-art machine learning approaches to identify translational research in genomics beyond bench to bedside from the biomedical literature. We apply the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and support vectormachines (SVMs) to the bench/bedside article classification on the weekly manual annotation data of the Public Health Genomics Knowledge Base database. Both classifiers employ salient features to determine the probability of curation-eligible publications, which can effectively reduce the workload of manual triage and curation process. We applied the CNNs and SVMs to an independent test set (n = 400), and the models achieved the F-measure of 0.80 and 0.74, respectively. We further tested the CNNs, which perform better results, on the routine annotation pipeline for 2 weeks and significantly reduced the effort and retrieved more appropriate research articles. Our approaches provide direct insight into the automated curation of genomic translational research beyond bench to bedside. The machine learning classifiers are found to be helpful for annotators to enhance the efficiency of manual curation.

AB Automatic text generation has received much attention owing to rapid development of deep neural networks. In general, text generation systems based on statistical language model will not consider anthropomorphic characteristics, which results in machine-like generated texts. To fill the gap, we propose a conditional language generation model with Big Five Personality (BFP) feature vectors as input context, which writes human-like short texts. The short text generator consists of a layer of long short memory network (LSTM), where a BFP feature vector is concatenated as one part of input for each cell. To enable supervised training generation model, a text classification model based convolution neural network (CNN) has been used to prepare BFP-tagged Chinese micro-blog corpora. Validated by a BFP linguistic computational model, our generated Chinese short texts exhibit discriminative personality styles, which are also syntactically correct and semantically smooth with appropriate emoticons. With combination of natural language generation with psychological linguistics, our proposed BFP-dependent text generation model can be widely used for individualization in machine translation, image caption, dialogue generation and so on.

TI Recognition of radar active-jamming through convolutional neural
   networks
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING-JOE
AB Radar application in modern warfare becomes more and more rigorous because of the rapidly developed radar countermeasures, especially active jamming in recent years. It costs a radar many resources for anti-jamming in order to detect a target. Hence, it is of great value to recognise the active jamming and thereafter take measures to distinguish target from the numerous jamming. Traditional methods of recognition jamming are blamed for its low efficiency and low accuracy. Radar researchers are looking forward to a new way to do the recognition work. Machine learning has made great advancements in many areas such as image classification, language translation, signal processing and many other recognition tasks, due to its great performance and high accuracy. The authors applied a machine learning method, i.e. convolutional neural networks, to recognise active jamming here. The authors' results demonstrate that convolutional neural networks have strong ability to distinguish active jamming and thus provide them adequate preparation for anti-jamming process.

AB Optical coherence tomography (OCT) can provide high-resolution cross-sectional images for analyzing superficial plaques in coronary arteries. Commonly, plaque characterization using intra-coronary OCT images is performed manually by expert observers. This manual analysis is time consuming and its accuracy heavily relies on the experience of human observers. Traditional machine learning based methods, such as the least squares support vector machine and random forest methods, have been recently employed to automatically characterize plaque regions in OCT images. Several processing steps, including feature extraction, informative feature selection, and final pixel classification, are commonly used in these traditional methods. Therefore, the final classification accuracy can be jeopardized by error or inaccuracy within each of these steps. In this study, we proposed a convolutional neural network (CNN) based method to automatically characterize plaques in OCT images. Unlike traditional methods, our method uses the image as a direct input and performs classification as a single-step process. The experiments on 269 OCT images showed that the average prediction accuracy of CNN-based method was 0.866, which indicated a great promise for clinical translation.

Sign language gestures are characterised and expressed by five distinct parameters: hand location; hand orientation; hand shape; hand movement and facial expressions.
   The aim of this research is to recognise facial expressions and to compare the following feature descriptors: local binary patterns; compound local binary patterns and histogram of oriented gradients in two testing environments, a subset of the BU3D-FE dataset and the CK+ dataset. The overall accuracy, accuracy across facial expression classes, robustness to test subjects, and the ability to generalise of each feature descriptor within the context of automatic facial expression recognition are analysed as part of the comparison procedure. Overall, HOG proved to be a more robust feature descriptor to the LBP and CLBP. Furthermore, the CLBP can generally be considered to be superior to the LBP, but the LBP has greater potential in terms of its ability to generalise.

AB Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a solid-state joining process; i.e., no melting occurs. The welding process is promoted by the rotation and translation of an axis-symmetric non-consumable tool along the weld centerline. Thus, the FSW process is performed at much lower temperatures than conventional fusion welding, nevertheless it has some disadvantages.
   The laser Assisted Friction Stir Welding (LAFSW) combines a Friction Stir Welding machine and a laser system. Laser power is used to preheat and to plasticize the volume of the workpiece ahead of the rotating tool; the workpiece is then joined in the same way as in the conventional FSW process.
   In this work an Ytterbium fiber laser with maximum power of 4 kW and a commercial FSW machine were coupled. Both FSW and LAFSW tests were conducted on 3 mm thick 5754H111 aluminum alloy plates in lap joint configuration with a constant tool rotation rate and with different feed rates. The two processes were compared and evaluated in terms of differences in the microstructure and in the micro-hardness profile.

AB Over the past decade, many laboratories have begun to explore brain-computer interface (BCI) technology as a radically new communication option. BCI can help users send messages and commands to the external world without using their brain's normal output channels or muscles. The central element in each BCI system is to rind a reliable method to detect the specific feature patterns extracted from the raw brain signals, and then translate it into usable control signals. In this paper, we introduce our approach to detect N170 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP) based on its spatiotemporal patterns in single-trial EEG signals. Common spatial pattern (CSP) method and machine-learning technique support vector machine (SVM) are adopted for N170 feature extraction and translation, i.e. they convert electrophysiological input from the user into on-off signal to control external devices. Our results indicate that the CSP can effectively extract discriminatory information, and SVM has an efficient performance for N170 classification. Comparing to several other methods, high performances of our framework show that the temporal and spatial features of N170 are very stable and it is promising for new type BCI applications.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short (similar to 22 nucleotides), endogenously-initiated non-coding RNAs that control gene expression post transcriptionally, either by the degradation of target miRNAs or by the inhibition of protein translation. The prediction of miRNA genes is a challenging problem towards the understanding of post transcriptional gene regulation. The present paper focuses on developing a computational method for the identification of miRNA precursors.
   We propose a machine learning algorithm based on Random Forests (RF) for miRNA prediction. The prediction algorithm relies on a set of features; compiled from known features as well as others introduced for the first time; that results in a performance that is better than most well known miRNA classifiers. The method achieves 91.3% accuracy, 86% fmeasure, 97.2% specificity, 93.4% precision and 79.6% sensitivity, when tested on real data. Our method succeeds in getting better results than MiPred (the best currently known RF algorithm in literature), TripletSVM and Virgo and EumiR.
   The obtained results indicate that Random Forests is a better alternative to Support VectorMachines (SVM) for miRNA prediction, especially from the point of view of accuracy and f-measure metrics.

As a consequence, under assumption that P not equal NP, the standard space translation between unary and binary languages does not work for alternating machines with small space; the equivalence L is an element of ASPACE(s(n))  UN-L is an element of ASPACE(S (logn)) is valid only if s(n) is an element of Omega (n). This is quite different from deterministic and nondeterministic machines, for which the corresponding equivalence holds for each s(n) is an element of Omega(logn), and hence for s(logn) is an element of Omega(log log n). ITnder assumption that NP not equal co-NP, we also show that binary versions of unary languages in ASPACE (log logo) form a complexity class not. contained in NP.

TI A CONCEPT OF INFORMATIONAL MACHINE
SO CYBERNETICA
AB This essay is an introduction to concepts of informational machine (IM), the descendant broadening and improvement of today computer system, as it might be implemented in the coming decades. IM as a technological entity is an informational phenomenon and informs and is informed in itself and together with the user environment (actual and possible worlds) in an informationally phenomenal way (exerting its informational externalism, internalism, metaphysicalism, and phenomenalism). For this purpose if needs : a massively parallel structured interconnection net of high-performance microprocessors (e.g., 64-bit, three- or multidimentional RISC); specifically (informationally, intelligently) designed processor interconnection network; an operating system offering informational, counterinformational, and informationally embedding support to informing entities (operands and operators) and translating phenomenal informational formula language; an informational (called, in the Japanese terminology also electronic) dictionary of informational entities with formal and natural language translation facilities; and lastly, a powerful peripheral equipment system capable to accept (memorize) and transmit (broadcast) all kinds of information (picture, sound, data, signal, control, linguistic information, etc.). The goal of IM design is to achieve the state of <<intellingence>>, by which IM is an understanding (observing, perceiving, conceiving, and comprehending) device operating (performing, behaving, adapting) within the surrounding and its internal world.

TI BengSentiLex and BengSwearLex: creating lexicons for sentiment analysis
   and profanity detection in low-resource Bengali language
SO PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Bengali is a low-resource language that lacks tools and resources for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as sentiment analysis or profanity identification. In Bengali, only the translated versions of English sentiment lexicons are available. Moreover, no dictionary exists for detecting profanity in Bengali social media text. This study introduces a Bengali sentiment lexicon, BengSentiLex, and a Bengali swear lexicon, BengSwearLex. For creating BengSentiLex, a cross-lingual methodology is proposed that utilizes a machine translation system, a review corpus, two English sentiment lexicons, pointwise mutual information (PMI), and supervised machine learning (ML) classifiers in various stages. A semi-automatic methodology is presented to develop BengSwearLex that leverages an obscene corpus, word embedding, and part-of-speech (POS) taggers. The performance of BengSentiLex compared with the translated English lexicons in three evaluation datasets. BengSentiLex achieves 5%-50% improvement over the translated lexicons. For identifying profanity, BengSwearLex achieves documentlevel coverage of around 85% in an document-level in the evaluation dataset. The experimental results imply that BengSentiLex and BengSwearLex are effective resources for classifying sentiment and identifying profanity in Bengali social media content, respectively.

AB Farming is the backbone of agriculture country like India. Farmers lose their yield due to lack of knowledge about new technologies and plantation parameters which help them to increase their yield. The proposed system, Aruvi, performs machine learning analysis and applies Ontology-based mapping to assist the farmers in order to increase their yield. Aruvi is basically a chatbot that can mimic a virtual conversation with user (farmer) using regional language (Tamil). Aruvi is trained and made to learn on its own using ontology based mapping. Based on the user query it gives relevant answers, which is more useful for farmers in remote places. Using the proposed system, the user can know about the crops, their atmospheric conditions and suitable soil by querying the system in their own regional language to the chatbot. Another advantage of Aruvi, users can converse with it apart through menus or buttons via text or speech on websites or through mobile apps. Based on the trained dataset and real time scenario the accuracy of the system is 83.25%. This can be improved by collecting the real time conditions in that particular region and training Aruvi using them.

   not getting lost in translation
SO BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES
AB The Seventh International Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Meeting was held May 21-25th, 2018 at the Asilomar Conference Grounds, Pacific Grove, California, United States. The interactive nature of this conference was embodied by 25 workshops covering topics in BCI (also called brain-machine interface) research. Workshops covered foundational topics such as hardware development and signal analysis algorithms, new and imaginative topics such as BCI for virtual reality and multi-brain BCIs, and translational topics such as clinical applications and ethical assumptions of BCI development. BCI research is expanding in the diversity of applications and populations for whom those applications are being developed. BCI applications are moving toward clinical readiness as researchers struggle with the practical considerations to make sure that BCI translational efforts will be successful. This paper summarizes each workshop, providing an overview of the topic of discussion, references for additional information, and identifying future issues for research and development that resulted from the interactions and discussion at the workshop.

AB Generating description for an image can be regard as visual understanding. It is across artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing and many other areas. In this paper, we present a model that generates description for images based on RNN (recurrent neural network) with object attention and multi-feature of images. The deep recurrent neural networks have excellent performance in machine translation, so we use it to generate natural sentence description for images. The proposed method uses single CNN (convolution neural network) that is trained on ImageNet to extract image features. But we think it can not adequately contain the content in images, it may only focus on the object area of image. So we add scene information to image feature using CNN which is trained on Places205. Experiments show that model with multi-feature extracted by two CNNs perform better than which with a single feature. In addition, we make saliency weights on images to emphasize the salient objects in images. We evaluate our model on MSCOCO based on public metrics, and the results show that our model performs better than several state-of-the-art methods.

AB Dynamic Binary Translation (DBT) is the key technology behind cross-platform virtualization and allows software compiled for one Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) to be executed on a processor supporting a different ISA. Under the hood, DBT is typically implemented using Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation of frequently executed program regions, also called traces. The main challenge is translating frequently executed program regions as fast as possible into highly efficient native code. As time for JIT compilation adds to the overall execution time, the JIT compiler is often decoupled and operates in a separate thread independent from the main simulation loop to reduce the overhead of JIT compilation. In this paper we present two innovative contributions. The first contribution is a generalized trace compilation approach that considers all frequently executed paths in a program for JIT compilation, as opposed to previous approaches where trace compilation is restricted to paths through loops. The second contribution reduces JIT compilation cost by compiling several hot traces in a concurrent task farm. Altogether we combine generalized light-weight tracing, large translation units, parallel JIT compilation and dynamic work scheduling to ensure timely and efficient processing of hot traces. We have evaluated our industry-strength, LLVM-based parallel DBT implementing the ARCompact ISA against three benchmark suites (EEMBC, BIOPERF and SPEC CPU2006) and demonstrate speedups of up to 2.08 on a standard quad-core Intel Xeon machine. Across short-and long-running benchmarks our scheme is robust and never results in a slowdown. In fact, using four processors total execution time can be reduced by on average 11.5% over state-of-the-art decoupled, parallel (or asynchronous) JIT compilation.

TI Leveraging Multimodal Out-of-Domain Information to Improve Low-Resource
   Speech Translation
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB Speech translation (ST) is a bimodal conversion task from source speech to the target text. Generally, deep learning-based ST systems require sufficient training data to obtain a competitive result, even with a state-of-the-art model. However, the training data is usually unable to meet the completeness condition due to the small sample problems. Most low-resource ST tasks improve data integrity with a single model, but this optimization has a single dimension and limited effectiveness. In contrast, multimodality is introduced to leverage different dimensions of data features for multiperspective modeling. This approach mutually addresses the gaps in the different modalities to enhance the representation of the data and improve the utilization of the training samples. Therefore, it is a new challenge to leverage the enormous multimodal out-of-domain information to improve the low-resource tasks. This paper describes how to use multimodal out-of-domain information to improve low-resource models. First, we propose a low-resource ST framework to reconstruct large-scale label-free audio by combining self-supervised learning. At the same time, we introduce a machine translation (MT) pretraining model to complement text embedding and fine-tune decoding. In addition, we analyze the similarity at the decoder side. We reduce multimodal invalid pseudolabels by performing random depth pruning in the similarity layer to minimize error propagation and use additional CTC loss in the nonsimilarity layer to optimize the ensemble loss. Finally, we study the weighting ratio of the fusion technique in the multimodal decoder. Our experiment results show that the proposed method is promising for low-resource ST, with improvements of up to +3.6 BLEU points compared to baseline low-resource ST models.

TI A machine learning-based particle-particle collision model for
   non-spherical particles with arbitrary shape
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
AB In this study, contacts between identical non-spherical particles are investigated by machine learning approaches. Artificial neural network models are developed to correlate relative positions and orientations of the pair with contact occurrence and properties (mean contact point, mean norm, and interpenetration depth). To evaluate the idea, eight different particles are generated by super-ellipsoid and spherical harmonic expansion. With these methods, pairs of non-spherical particles (regular or irregular shaped) are generated, and the contact properties are computed through vertices-based calculation. Using random translation and rotation, 80000 datasets are collected for each case and are utilized for training, validating, and evaluating the models. After training the proposed models, they enable accurate and rapid predictions of the contact occurrence and properties of non-spherical particles with arbitrary shape. It requires a smaller amount of data than discrete element method (DEM) applications. This study provides collision models that can be applied to large-scale DEM simulations. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Formal grammar and information theory: together again?
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON SERIES
   A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB In the last 40 years, research on models of spoken and written language has been split between two seemingly irreconcilable traditions: formal linguistics in the Chomsky tradition, and information theory in the Shannon tradition. Zellig Harris had advocated a close alliance between grammatical and information-theoretic principles in the analysis of natural language, and early formal-language theory provided another strong link between information theory and linguistics. Nevertheless, in most research on language and computation, grammatical and information-theoretic approaches had moved far apart.
   Today, after many years on the defensive, the information-theoretic approach has gained new strength and achieved practical successes in speech recognition, information retrieval, and, increasingly, in language analysis and machine translation. The exponential increase in the speed and storage capacity of computers is the proximate cause of these engineering successes, allowing the automatic estimation of the parameters of probabilistic models of language by counting occurrences of linguistic events in very large bodies of text and speech. However, I will argue that information-theoretic and computational ideas are also playing an increasing role in the scientific understanding of language, and will help bring together formal-linguistic and information-theoretic perspectives.

AB The recent success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in image and video applications led to the development of numerous variants specialised for particular tasks, such as conditional GANs for image-to-image translation. In spite of the research done in fine-tuning architectures and applying them to different subjects, techniques still deal with stand-alone images, such as nature scenes, city landmarks, faces and others. The task of producing contiguous colour data - namely adjacent parts of the same image, not textures - has not been attempted before in literature related to generative machine learning techniques. Achieving this feat would allow large images to be processed in smaller parts, hence removing the architectural maximum to the output resolution that can be achieved by the network. Concurrent state-of-the-art architectures for conditional image-to-image translation are in the range of 2k X 1k pixels and typically take several days to train on powerful hardware. The proposed contiguous technique, in this case applied on fantasy maps for roleplaying games, can achieve higher resolutions with smaller networks that can be trained faster, within a single day. The technique is capable of maintaining as much quality as allowed by the detail of the semantic layouts provided, even at 4k and higher, but it suffers when detail in these is too sparse. A sample of images produced by the system were shown to survey participants who judged their appeal as 3.49 on a Likert scale of 5, and segmentation analysis reported an average weighted inter-class accuracy score of 0.689 (0.448 unweighted).

TI Deleterious single nucleotide polymorphisms of protein kinase R
   identified by the computational approach
SO MOLECULAR IMMUNOLOGY
AB The human protein kinase R (PKR) recognizes invading RNA viruses and mediates the antiviral immune response by phosphorylating the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF-2 alpha), thus blocking protein translation in infected cells and thus preventing viral replication. The observation that individuals show different degrees of susceptibility to viral infections gives rise to the hypothesis that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the protein kinase R may alter the response to an infection. Using different available servers (e.g. SIFT, PROVEAN, Polyphen2, SNAP2, SNP&GOs, SNP-PhD, I-Mutant Suite), 14 SNPs were identified that were predicted to have deleterious effects on the protein kinase R. Five SNPs, namely D266Y, Y323D, 1398 K, Y465C and Y472C, were selected for homology modeling and the generated models were investigated with regard to their secondary structure, residue fluctuations and eIF-2 alpha binding. Analysis with computational tools POLYVIEW-MM, SAAPdap, SRIDE, CMView, elNemo, NMsim and PatchDock revealed structural changes in all mutants yielding a more stable structure at the cost of reduced flexibility (except Y465C) and less conformational freedom compared to the native protein. The conformational changes in the mutant protein structures and the displacement of functional residues from their strategic positions are predicted to affect the functionality of PKR, and consequently will affect the efficiency of the individual's antiviral immune response negatively. This study will aid the physicians in precision medicine field to tailor optimal treatment for the patients.

TI Kinematic design of a 5-DOF hybrid robot with large
   workspace/limb-stroke ratio
SO JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN
AB This paper deals with the conceptual and kinematic designs of a 5-degree of freedom (DOF) reconfigurable hybrid robot. The robot is composed of a 2-DOF parallel spherical mechanism that is serially connected with a 3-DOF open loop kinematic chain via a prismatic joint. Somewhat similar to the well-known Tricept robot, this design has the merit that a relatively large workspace/limb-stroke ratio can be achieved thanks to the decomposition of the motions of the output link into the 2-DOF rotation and 1-DOF translation. As with the Tricept, the robot is well suited for use as a plug-and-play module to configure different machines. The dimensional synthesis of the 2-DOF spherical parallel mechanism is carried out by the monotonical analysis of the design variables versus a global conditioning index represented by the mean of the minimum singular value of the Jacobian, leading to the solution of two nonlinear equations due to the limb length constraint and nearly axial symmetry requirement of the kinematic performance. The results of the dimensional synthesis are given via examples.

TI Verb ellipsis resolution in Japanese sentence using surface expressions
   and examples
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB Verb phrases are sometimes omitted in natural language (ellipsis). It is necessary to resolve the verb phrase ellipses in language understanding, machine translation, and dialogue processing. This paper describes a practical way to resolve verb phrase ellipses by using surface, expressions and examples. To make heuristic rules for ellipsis resolution we classified verb phrase ellipses by checking whether the referent of a verb phrase ellipsis appears in the surrounding sentences or not. We experimented with the resolution of verb phrase elipses on a novel and obtained a recall rate of 73% and a precision rate of 66% on test sentences. In the case when the referent of a verb phrase ellipsis appeared in the surrounding sentences the accuracy rate was high. But, in the case when the referent of a verb phrase ellipsis did not appear in the surrounding sentences the accuracy rate was not so high. Since the analysis of this phenomena is very difficult, it is valuable to propose a way of solving the problem to a certain extent, When the size of corpus becomes larger and the machine performance becomes greater the method of using corpus will become effective.

AB Data exploration is an important step of every data science and machine learning project, including those involving textual data. We provide a novel language tool, in the form of a publicly available Python library for extracting patterns from textual data. The library integrates a first public implementation of the existing GrASP algorithm. It allows users to extract patterns using a number of general-purpose built-in linguistic attributes (such as hypernyms, part-of-speech tags, and syntactic dependency tags), as envisaged for the original algorithm, as well as domain-specific custom attributes which can be incorporated into the library by implementing two functions. The library is equipped with a web-based interface empowering human users to conveniently explore data via the extracted patterns, using complementary pattern-centric and example-centric views: the former includes a reading in natural language and statistics of each extracted pattern; the latter shows applications of each extracted pattern to training examples. We demonstrate the usefulness of the library in classification (spam detection and argument mining), model analysis (machine translation), and artifact discovery in datasets (SNLI and 20Newsgroups).

TI Artificial intelligence models in chronic lymphocytic leukemia -
   recommendations toward state-of-the-art
SO LEUKEMIA & LYMPHOMA
AB Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and predictive modeling are becoming enabling technologies in many day-to-day applications. Translation of these advances to the patient's bedside for AI assisted interventions is not yet the norm. With specific emphasis on CLL, here, we review the progress of prognostic models in hematology and highlight sources of stagnation that may be limiting significant improvements in prognostication in the near future. We discuss issues related to performance, trust, modeling simplicity, and prognostic marker robustness and find that the major limiting factor in progressing toward state-of-the-art prognostication within the hematological community, is not the lack of able AI algorithms but rather, the lack of their adoption. Current models in CLL still deal with the 'average' patient while the use of patient-centric approaches remains absent. Using lessons from research areas where machine learning has become an enabling technology, we derive recommendations and propose methods for achieving state-of-the-art predictions in modeling health data, that can be readily adopted by the CLL modeling community.

AB We design a generic method to reduce the task of finding weighted matchings to that of finding short augmenting paths in unweighted graphs. This method enables us to provide efficient implementations for approximating weighted matchings in the massively parallel computation (MPC) model and in the streaming model.
   For the MPC and the multi-pass streaming model, we show that any algorithm computing a (1- delta)-approximate unweighted matching in bipartite graphs can be translated into an algorithm that computes a (1 - epsilon(delta))-approximate maximum weighted matching. Furthermore, this translation incurs only a constant factor (that depends on epsilon > 0) overhead in the complexity. Instantiating this with the current best MPC algorithm for unweighted matching yields a (1 - epsilon)-approximation algorithm for maximum weighted matching that uses O-epsilon (log logn) rounds, O(m/n) machines per round, and Oe (n poly(logn)) memory per machine. This improves upon the previous best approximation guarantee of (1/2 - epsilon) for weighted graphs. In the context of single-pass streaming with random edge arrivals, our techniques yield a (1/2 + c)-approximation algorithm thus breaking the natural barrier of 1/2.

AB Co-speech gestures are a principal component in conveying messages and enhancing interaction experiences between humans and critical ingredients in human-agent interaction, including virtual agents and robots. Existing machine learning approaches have yielded only marginal success in learning speech-to-motion at the frame level. Current methods generate repetitive gesture sequences that lack appropriateness with respect to the speech context. To tackle this challenge, we take inspiration from successes in natural language processing on context and long-term dependencies, and propose a new framework that views text-to-gesture as machine translation, where gestures are words in another (non-verbal) language. We propose a vector-quantized variational autoencoder structure as well as training techniques to learn a rigorous representation of gesture sequences. We then translate input text into a discrete sequence of associated gesture chunks in the learned gesture space. Ultimately, we use translated gesture tokens from the input text as an input to the autoencoder's decoder to produce gesture sequences. Subjective and objective evaluations confirm the success of our approach in terms of appropriateness, human-likeness, and diversity. We also introduce new objective metrics using the quantized gesture representation.

AB The work presented in this paper deals with a proactive network monitoring for security and protection of computing infrastructures. We provide an exploitation of an intelligent module, in the form of a as a machine learning application using deep learning modeling, in order to enhance functionality of intrusion detection system supervising network traffic flows. Currently, intrusion detection systems work well for network monitoring in near real-time and they effectively deal with threats in a reactive way. Deep learning is the emerging generation of artificial intelligence techniques and one of the most promising candidates for intelligence integration into traditional solutions leading to quality improvement of the original solutions. The work presented in this paper faces the challenge of cooperation between deep learning techniques and large-scale data processing. The outcomes obtained from extensive and careful experiments show the applicability and feasibility of simultaneously modelled multiple monitoring channels using deep learning techniques. The proper joining of deep learning modelling with scalable data preprocessing ensures high quality and stability of model performance in dynamic and fast-changing environments such as network traffic flow monitoring.

AB Role of natural language processing (NLP) in machine learning is very important and its task's such as Parts-of-Speech (POS) tagging, tokenization of (words, sentences, paragraph) etc. Parts-of-speech tagging performed as a pre-processing steps in natural language processing, such as syntactic parsing, information extraction (IE) and machine translation (MT). The Romanized Sindhi lexicon for computational processing is not available. In this research work of POS tagging of Romanized Sindhi text based on online Python tool were used and performed the task of POS tagging. By applying rule based model for analyzing the text and extract the text from given input text. POS Tagging algorithms were also designed for implementation of Romanized Sindhi Text (RST). Construction of RST data of 100 sentences and these sentences are depends on the (Noun-Verb-Determinant) for POS tagging and have important task towards computational RST processing. The rule based model was used for the POS tagging of RST and it worked in easiest way generate appropriate results of RST. This result will promote the need for further research to perform different task in different domain.

TI Word Embeddings for Automatic Equalization in Audio Mixing
SO JOURNAL OF THE AUDIO ENGINEERING SOCIETY
AB In recent years, machine learning has been widely adopted to automate the audio mixing process. Automatic mixing systems have been applied to various audio effects such as gainadjustment, equalization, and reverberation. These systems can be controlled through visual interfaces, audio examples being provided, usage of knobs, and semantic descriptors. Using semantic descriptors or textual information to control these systems is an effective way for artists to communicate their creative goals. In this paper, the novel idea of using word embeddings to represent semantic descriptors is explored. Word embeddings are generally obtained by training neural networks on large corpora of written text. These embeddings serve as the input layer of the neural network to create a translation from words to equalizer (EQ) settings. Using this technique, the machine learning model can also generate EQ settings for semantic descriptors that it has not seen before. The EQ settings of humans are compared with the predictions of the neural network to evaluate the quality of predictions. The results showed that the embedding layer enables the neural network to understand semantic descriptors. It was observed that the models with embedding layers perform better than those without embedding layers but still not as well as human labels.

TI The Communication Problem
SO RIVISTA ITALIANA DI FILOSOFIA DEL LINGUAGGIO
AB Analysis, interpretation and construction of artificial and natural languages have been central concerns of artificial intelligence since the 1950s.
   Current applications for automated language progressing range from real-time translation of spoken language through automated discovery of sentiment in online postings to conversational agents embedded in everyday devices. Recent developments in machine learning, combined with the availability of large amounts of labelled training data, have enabled non-structural approaches to largely surpass classical techniques based on formal grammars, conceptual ontologies and symbolic representations. As the complexity and opaqueness of those stochastic models becomes more and more evident, however, the question arises if we trade gains in observable performance with a literal loss of understanding.
   This article presents a distinction-based approach to critically re-visit fundamental theoretical concepts such as code, information, language, communication and meaning. I will follow Niklas Luhmann's theory of social systems by locating communication firmly within social systems. Departing from Luhmann, I do invite machines as participants into some of these systems. Finally, I propose to employ Friedemann Schulz von Thun's 4-sided communication model in order to overcome the current information-theoretic emphasis of communication.

TI Prediction of Individual Finger Forces Based on Decoded Motoneuron
   Activities
SO ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Accurate prediction of motor output based on neural signals is critical in human-machine interactions. The objective was to evaluate the performance of predicting individual finger forces through an estimation of the descending neural drive to the spinal motoneuron pool. High-density surface electromyogram (EMG) signals of the extensor digitorum communis muscle were obtained, and were then decomposed into individual motor unit discharge events. The frequency of the composite discharge events at the population level was used to derive the descending neural drive, which was then used to predict the finger forces. The global EMG-based approach was used as a control condition. Compared with the EMG-based approach, the experimental results show that the neural-drive-based approach can better predict the individual finger forces with higher R-2 values across different force levels and across different force trajectories (steady and varying forces). These findings indicate that the neural drive estimation based on motoneuron firing activities can be used as a reliable neural-machine interface signal involving individual fingers. However, real-time implementation of this approach is needed for future clinical translation.

TI Disrupting data sharing for a healthier ocean
SO ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE
AB Ocean ecosystems are in decline, yet we also have more ocean data, and more data portals, than ever before. To make effective decisions regarding ocean management, especially in the face of global environmental change, we need to make the best use possible of these data. Yet many data are not shared, are hard to find, and cannot be effectively accessed. We identify three classes of challenges to data sharing and use: uploading, aggregating, and navigating. While tremendous advances have occurred to improve ocean data operability and transparency, the effect has been largely incremental. We propose a suite of both technical and cultural solutions to overcome these challenges including the use of natural language processing, automatic data translation, ledger-based data identifiers, digital community currencies, data impact factors, and social networks as ways of breaking through these barriers. One way to harness these solutions could be a combinatorial machine that embodies both technological and social networking solutions to aggregate ocean data and to allow researchers to discover, navigate, and download data as well as to connect researchers and data users while providing an open-sourced backend for new data tools.

TI The assembly of kinesin-based nanotransport systems
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB At the nano-scale many proteins act as biological actuators for rotation or translation. Among these proteins, the building blocks of self-assembled, highly efficient natural motors, kinesin is considered a promising tool in the development of synthetic nanorobots. Conversion of chemical energy into mechanical work, harnessed by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate, propels kinesin along a cytoplasmic system of fibers, known as a microtubule. Even though recent efforts were made to engineer tailor-made artificial nanotransport systems using kinesin, no systematic study investigated how these systems can be organized from the bottom up using the surface plasmon resonance technique. Here, we show that it is possible to quantitatively evaluate how each component of such nanoscopic machines is sequentially assembled by monitoring the individual association of its components, focusing specifically on the kinesin association to microtubules as well as the cargo-kinesin association. Furthermore, the kinetic parameters reported here for the microtubules and recombinant biotinylated kinesin binding process properties are of utmost importance due to the current widespread use of biotinylated kinesin in the construction of synthetic nano-machines.

TI Classifying publications from the clinical and translational science
   award program along the translational research spectrum: a machine
   learning approach
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
AB Background: Translational research is a key area of focus of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), as demonstrated by the substantial investment in the Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) program. The goal of the CTSA program is to accelerate the translation of discoveries from the bench to the bedside and into communities. Different classification systems have been used to capture the spectrum of basic to clinical to population health research, with substantial differences in the number of categories and their definitions. Evaluation of the effectiveness of the CTSA program and of translational research in general is hampered by the lack of rigor in these definitions and their application. This study adds rigor to the classification process by creating a checklist to evaluate publications across the translational spectrum and operationalizes these classifications by building machine learning-based text classifiers to categorize these publications.
   Methods: Based on collaboratively developed definitions, we created a detailed checklist for categories along the translational spectrum from T0 to T4. We applied the checklist to CTSA-linked publications to construct a set of coded publications for use in training machine learning-based text classifiers to classify publications within these categories. The training sets combined T1/T2 and T3/T4 categories due to low frequency of these publication types compared to the frequency of T0 publications. We then compared classifier performance across different algorithms and feature sets and applied the classifiers to all publications in PubMed indexed to CTSA grants. To validate the algorithm, we manually classified the articles with the top 100 scores from each classifier.
   Results: The definitions and checklist facilitated classification and resulted in good inter-rater reliability for coding publications for the training set. Very good performance was achieved for the classifiers as represented by the area under the receiver operating curves (AUC), with an AUC of 0.94 for the T0 classifier, 0.84 for T1/T2, and 0.92 for T3/T4.
   Conclusions: The combination of definitions agreed upon by five CTSA hubs, a checklist that facilitates more uniform definition interpretation, and algorithms that perform well in classifying publications along the translational spectrum provide a basis for establishing and applying uniform definitions of translational research categories. The classification algorithms allow publication analyses that would not be feasible with manual classification, such as assessing the distribution and trends of publications across the CTSA network and comparing the categories of publications and their citations to assess knowledge transfer across the translational research spectrum.

TI Can We Quickly Learn to ?Translate? Bioactive Molecules with Transformer
   Models?
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING
AB Meaningful exploration of the chemical space of druglike molecules in drug design is a highly challenging task due to a combinatorial explosion of possible modifications of molecules. In this work, we address this problem with transformer models, a type of machine learning (ML) model originally developed for machine translation. By training transformer models on pairs of similar bioactive molecules from the public ChEMBL data set, we enable them to learn medicinal-chemistry-meaningful, context-dependent transformations of molecules, including those absent from the training set. By retrospective analysis on the performance of transformer models on ChEMBL subsets of ligands binding to COX2, DRD2, or HERG protein targets, we demonstrate that the models can generate structures identical or highly similar to most active ligands, despite the models having not seen any ligands active against the corresponding protein target during training. Our work demonstrates that human experts working on hit expansion in drug design can easily and quickly employ transformer models, originally developed to translate texts from one natural language to another, to "translate" from known molecules active against a given protein target to novel molecules active against the same target.

TI Cross-lingual Text Reuse Detection Using Translation Plus Monolingual
   Analysis for English-Urdu Language Pair
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB Cross-Lingual Text Reuse Detection (CLTRD) has recently attracted the attention of the research community due to a large amount of digital text readily available for reuse in multiple languages through online digital repositories. In addition, efficient machine translation systems are freely and readily available to translate text from one language into another, which makes it quite easy to reuse text across languages, and consequently difficult to detect it. In the literature, the most prominent and widely used approach for CLTRD is Translation plus Monolingual Analysis (T+MA). To detect CLTR for English-Urdu language pair, T+MA has been used with lexical approaches, namely, N-gram Overlap, Longest Common Subsequence, and Greedy String Tiling. This clearly shows that T+MA has not been thoroughly explored for the English-Urdu language pair. To fulfill this gap, this study presents an in-depth and detailed comparison of 26 approaches that are based on T+ MA. These approaches include semantic similarity approaches (semantic tagger based approaches, WordNet-based approaches), probabilistic approach (Kullback-Leibler distance approach), monolingual word embedding-based approaches siamese recurrent architecture, and monolingual sentence transformer-based approaches for English-Urdu language pair. The evaluation was carried out using the CLEU benchmark corpus, both for the binary and the ternary classification tasks. Our extensive experimentation shows that our proposed approach that is a combination of 26 approaches obtained an F-1 score of 0.77 and 0.61 for the binary and ternary classification tasks, respectively, and outperformed the previously reported approaches [41] (F-1= 0.73) for the binary and (F-1 = 0.55) for the ternary classification tasks) on the CLEU corpus.

TI Face Recognition via Multi-Level 3D-GAN Colorization
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Rapid development in sketch-to-image translation methods boosts the investigation procedure in law enforcement agencies. But, the large modality gap between manually generated sketches makes this task challenging. Generative adversarial network (GAN) and encoder-decoder approach are usually incorporated to accomplish sketch-to-image generation with promising results. This paper targets the sketch-to-image translation with heterogeneous face angles and lighting effects using a multi-level conditional generative adversarial network. The proposed multi-level cGAN work in four different phases. Three independent cGANs' networks are incorporated separately into each stage, followed by a CNN classifier. The Adam stochastic gradient descent mechanism was used for training with a learning rate of 0.0002 and momentum estimates $\beta $ and $\beta $ as 0.5 and 0.999, respectively. The multi-level 3D-convolutional architecture help to preserve spatial facial attributes and pixel-level details. The 3D convolution and deconvolution guide the G1, G2 and G3 to use additional features and attributes for encoding and decoding. This helps to preserve the direction, postures of targeted image attributes and special relationships among the whole image's features. The proposed framework process the 3D-Convolution and 3D-Deconvolution using vectorization. This process takes the same time as 2D convolution but extracts more features and facial attributes. We used pre-trained ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and Mobile-Net to classify generated high-resolution images from sketches. We have also developed, and state-of-the-art Pakistani Politicians Face-sketch Dataset (PPFD) for experimental purposes. Result reveals that the proposed cGAN model's framework outperforms with respect to Accuracy, Structural similarity index measure (SSIM), Signal to noise ratio (SNR), and Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).

TI Evaluation, Tuning, and Interpretation of Neural Networks for Working
   with Images in Meteorological Applications
SO BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
AB The method of neural networks (aka deep learning) has opened up many new opportunities to utilize remotely sensed images in meteorology. Common applications include image classification, e.g., to determine whether an image contains a tropical cyclone, and image-to-image translation, e.g., to emulate radar imagery for satellites that only have passive channels. However, there are yet many open questions regarding the use of neural networks for working with meteorological images, such as best practices for evaluation, tuning, and interpretation. This article highlights several strategies and practical considerations for neural network development that have not yet received much attention in the meteorological community, such as the concept of receptive fields, underutilized meteorological performance measures, and methods for neural network interpretation, such as synthetic experiments and layer-wise relevance propagation. We also consider the process of neural network interpretation as a whole, recognizing it as an iterative meteorologist-driven discovery process that builds on experimental design and hypothesis generation and testing. Finally, while most work on neural network interpretation in meteorology has so far focused on networks for image classification tasks, we expand the focus to also include networks for image-to-image translation.

TI Contribution of Palmar Radiocarpal and Ulnocarpal Ligaments to the
   Stability of the Canine Antebrachiocarpal Joint
SO VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ORTHOPAEDICS AND TRAUMATOLOGY
AB Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of the palmar radiocarpal ligament and the palmar ulnocarpal ligament to canine antebrachiocarpal joint stability. Materials and Methods The right carpus of four dog cadavers, free of musculoskeletal pathology, was stripped of muscle. Each specimen was placed into a custom-made joint testing machine and tested at 15 degrees extension, and 0 degrees and 15 degrees flexion. A single motion tracking sensor was fixed to the metacarpal bones. All specimens were tested with all ligaments intact and after transection of the palmar radiocarpal and ulnocarpal ligaments. A range of weights between 0.2 and 2.0 kg was used to test the carpi in three directions (axial, medial/lateral and cranial/caudal) and two moments (pronation/supination and valgus/varus). Results No differences were found between the translations and rotations of the manus relative to the radius and ulna with the ligaments intact and the ligaments transected at any of the carpal angles tested, except at 15 degrees of flexion. Increasing the angle of flexion resulted in a significant increase in cranial and caudal translation of the manus relative to the radius and ulna both in the intact and transected specimens.

TI Role of ribosomal protein mutations in tumor development (Review)
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY
AB Ribosomes are cellular machines essential for protein synthesis. The biogenesis of ribosomes is a highly complex and energy consuming process that initiates in the nucleolus. Recently, a series of studies applying whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing techniques have led to the discovery of ribosomal protein gene mutations in different cancer types. Mutations in ribosomal protein genes have for example been found in endometrial cancer (RPL22), T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (RPL10, RPL5 and RPL11), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (RPS15), colorectal cancer (RPS20), and glioma (RPL5). Moreover, patients suffering from Diamond-Blackfan anemia, a bone marrow failure syndrome caused by mutant ribosomal proteins are also at higher risk for developing leukemia, or solid tumors. Different experimental models indicate potential mechanisms whereby ribosomal proteins may initiate cancer development. In particular, deregulation of the p53 tumor suppressor network and altered mRNA translation are mechanisms likely to be involved. We envisage that changes in expression and the occurrence of ribosomal protein gene mutations play important roles in cancer development. Ribosome biology constitutes a re-emerging vital area of basic and translational cancer research.

AB Spiral Architecture, a hexagonal image structure is a novel and powerful approach to machine vision system. The pixels on Spiral architecture are geometrically arranged using a 1D (Spiral) addressing scheme in an ascending order along a spiral-like curve. Spiral addition and Spiral multiplication are defined based on the Spiral addresses on Spiral Architecture. These two fundamental operations result in fast and easy translation, rotation and separation on images, and hence play very important roles for image processing on Spiral Architecture. Moreover, 2D coordinates according to rows and columns defined on Spiral Structure provide a good mapping to the ordinary 2D coordinates defined on the common square image structure. Therefore, how to convert the 1D Spiral addresses from and to the 2D coordinates on Spiral Architecture has become very important to apply the theory developed on a hexagonal image structure for image processing (e.g., rotation). In this paper, we perform a fast way to correctly locate any hexagonal pixel when its Spiral address is known, and compute the Spiral address of any hexagonal pixel when its location is known. As an illustration of the use of conversions, we demonstrate the accurate image translation and rotation using experimental results.

TI GANmapper: geographical data translation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
AB We present a new method to create spatial data using a generative adversarial network (GAN). Our contribution uses coarse and widely available geospatial data to create maps of less available features at the finer scale in the built environment, bypassing their traditional acquisition techniques (e.g. satellite imagery or land surveying). In the work, we employ land use data and road networks as input to generate building footprints and conduct experiments in 9 cities around the world. The method, which we implement in a tool we release openly, enables the translation of one geospatial dataset to another with high fidelity and morphological accuracy. It may be especially useful in locations missing detailed and high-resolution data and those that are mapped with uncertain or heterogeneous quality, such as much of OpenStreetMap. The quality of the results is influenced by the urban form and scale. In most cases, the experiments suggest promising performance as the method tends to truthfully indicate the locations, amount, and shape of buildings. The work has the potential to support several applications, such as energy, climate, and urban morphology studies in areas previously lacking required data or inpainting geospatial data in regions with incomplete data.

TI Motion generators of quadric surfaces
SO MECHANISM AND MACHINE THEORY
AB This paper presents research work on synthesis of the mechanisms that generate translations on circular, cylindrical, and conical surfaces. As these three kinds of surfaces are all basic quadrics, the synthesized mechanisms are called motion generators of quadric surfaces. Firstly, the characteristics of these quadrics are analyzed, which result in an easy way to express them. Secondly, the motion sets of one-degree-of-freedom (one-DoF) joints are described by finite screws, leading to a simple and non-redundant manner for mechanisms' motion description. Based upon this, the motion generators of circular, cylindrical, and conical surfaces are respectively synthesized, and all the serial kinematic chains that generate these quadrics are obtained. The results are verified through simulations in MATLAB software. Finally, as an application of the motion generators of quadrics, closed-loop linkages constituted by the generators of cylindrical and circular surfaces with specific geometric conditions are synthesized, which purely generate one-DOF translations along ellipse curves. Some new serial kinematic chains and closed-loop linkages are invented in this paper. These new mechanisms have simple mechanical structures, and they have potential applications in design of robots used in machining and manufacturing of complex surfaces and curves.

TI Deep learning for time series forecasting: The electric load case
SO CAAI TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY
AB Management and efficient operations in critical infrastructures such as smart grids take huge advantage of accurate power load forecasting, which, due to its non-linear nature, remains a challenging task. Recently, deep learning has emerged in the machine learning field achieving impressive performance in a vast range of tasks, from image classification to machine translation. Applications of deep learning models to the electric load forecasting problem are gaining interest among researchers as well as the industry, but a comprehensive and sound comparison among different-also traditional-architectures is not yet available in the literature. This work aims at filling the gap by reviewing and experimentally evaluating four real world datasets on the most recent trends in electric load forecasting, by contrasting deep learning architectures on short-term forecast (one-day-ahead prediction). Specifically, the focus is on feedforward and recurrent neural networks, sequence-to-sequence models and temporal convolutional neural networks along with architectural variants, which are known in the signal processing community but are novel to the load forecasting one.

AB Recently, the concept of teaching has been introduced into machine learning, in which a teacher model is used to guide the training of a student model (which will be used in real tasks) through data selection, loss function design, etc. Learning to reweight, which is a specific kind of teaching that reweights training data using a teacher model, receives much attention due to its simplicity and effectiveness. In existing learning to reweight works, the teacher model only utilizes shallow/surface information such as training iteration number and loss/accuracy of the student model from training/validation sets, but ignores the internal states of the student model, which limits the potential of learning to reweight. In this work, we propose an improved data reweighting algorithm, in which the student model provides its internal states to the teacher model, and the teacher model returns adaptive weights of training samples to enhance the training of the student model. The teacher model is jointly trained with the student model using meta gradients propagated from a validation set. Experiments on image classification with clean/noisy labels and neural machine translation empirically demonstrate that our algorithm makes significant improvement over previous methods.

AB This With the popularity of artificial intelligence in recent years, Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology has also become the focus of research. NLP technology's unique machine translation and text sentiment analysis functions can prevent people from experiencing poor language communication when travelling abroad and help artificial intelligence understand people's language better. This article has made corresponding practice and analysis for the critical requirement of "text classification" in NLP. In the experiment, we used the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) film review forum as the dataset. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and the corresponding variants of RNN (Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)) are analyzed and compared from the theoretical aspect. Moreover, we introduced a bidirectional mechanism to optimize RNN and reduce the influence of parameter changes on model training by comparing specific neural network structures. We found the benefits of LSTM in text classification applications compared with RNN and simple neural networks by comparing experiments. Besides, we explored the role of the bidirectional mechanism for RNN. Finally, we create a two-way LSTM model for text classification model and obtain the model training results indicating less overfitting and less loss than other structures.

AB The objective of our study is to recognize the sign language and retranscribe it into a written or oral language in order to make mobile communication possible between a deaf-mute and people who don't know the sign language. For that, we used a method of correlation based on a multidecision segmented filter The latter has been used for a long time to recognize a target image. However an adaptation of this technique is necessary to take into account particular characteristics of gestures and to be able to send it with a high transmission rate.
   Moreover in this application the target image to recognize evolves/moves in real time. Thus to take the right decision, it is necessary to carry out a very large number of correlations therefore slowing down the translation process. To reduce this processing time, we propose, in this article, to implement our system by using the multi-station technique. This technique enables us to distribute the required computing effort on various parallel stations using (PVM) a Parallel Virtual Machine. Our Results show that we succeeded in validating our system, using multidecision filtering and multi-station by using real gesture.

TI OPTIMIZATION AND LEARNING WITH NONLOCAL CALCULUS
SO FOUNDATIONS OF DATA SCIENCE
AB Nonlocal models have recently had a major impact in nonlinear continuum mechanics and are used to describe physical systems/processes which cannot be accurately described by classical, calculus based "local" approaches. In part, this is due to their multiscale nature that enables aggregation of micro-level behavior to obtain a macro-level description of singular/irregular phenomena such as peridynamics, crack propagation, anomalous diffusion and transport phenomena. At the core of these models are nonlocal differential operators, including nonlocal analogs of the gradient/Hessian. This paper initiates the use of such nonlocal operators in the context of optimization and learning. We define and analyze the convergence properties of nonlocal analogs of (stochastic) gradient descent and Newton's method on Euclidean spaces. Our results indicate that as the nonlocal interactions become less noticeable, the optima corresponding to nonlocal optimization converge to the "usual" optima. At the same time, we argue that nonlocal learning is possible in situations where standard calculus fails. As a stylized numerical example of this, we consider the problem of non-differentiable parameter estimation on a non-smooth translation manifold and show that our nonlocal gradient descent recovers the unknown translation parameter from a non-differentiable objective function.

TI A Practical Robotic Grasping Method by Using 6-D Pose Estimation With
   Protective Correction
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS
AB The pose estimation is the critical technology in industrial robot. Nowadays, many machine vision-based approaches have applied the technology and achieved excellent results. However, the rapid detection of the pose estimation in complex multiscene environments is still a challenge, due to the interference of multiangle light and multibackground. To address these issues, this article proposes a practical robotic grasping method by using the 6-D pose estimation with protective correction. In this method, the synthetic dataset by self-production is used to train the improved deep object pose estimation network and then use the standard perspective-n-point algorithm to estimate the 6-DoF pose for each object instance. Meanwhile, in order to prevent grasp collisions cause by misrecognition, we propose the corrected grasping pose algorithm for protective correction by measured translation and predicted translation. Finally, the proposed grasping method has an average grasping success rate of 83.3% for the three objects under normal light, and the network for single-image detection speed has been to 1.490 frames/s. The code is available at https://github.com/aimiplus/Practical_Robotic_Grasping_Method.

SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB We propose new methods to exploit contemporaneous text, such as on-line news articles, to improve language models for automatic speech recognition and other natural language processing applications. In particular, we investigate the use of text from a resource-rich language to sharpen language models for processing a news story or article in a language with scarce linguistic resources. We demonstrate that even with fairly crude cross-language information retrieval and simple machine translation, one can construct story-specific Chinese language models which exploit cues from a side-corpus of English newswire to significantly improve the performance of language models estimated from a static Chinese corpus. Our investigations cover cases when the amount of available Chinese text is small, and a case when a large Chinese text corpus is available. We examine the effectiveness of our techniques both when the side-corpus contains English documents that are near-translations of the Chinese documents being processed, and when the English side-corpus is merely from contemporaneous and independent news sources. We present experimental results for automatic transcription of speech from the Mandarin Broadcast News corpus. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Large language models have led to remarkable progress on many NLP tasks, and researchers are turning to ever-larger text corpora to train them. Some of the largest corpora available are made by scraping significant portions of the internet, and are frequently introduced with only minimal documentation. In this work we provide some of the first documentation for the Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4; Raffel et al., 2020), a dataset created by applying a set of filters to a single snapshot of Common Crawl. We begin by investigating where the data came from, and find a significant amount of text from unexpected sources like patents and US military websites. Then we explore the content of the text itself, and find machine-generated text (e.g., from machine translation systems) and evaluation examples from other benchmark NLP datasets. To understand the impact of the filters applied to create this dataset, we evaluate the text that was removed, and show that blocklist filtering disproportionately removes text from and about minority individuals. Finally, we conclude with some recommendations for how to created and document web-scale datasets from a scrape of the internet.

AB The accurate characterization of the translational mechanism is crucial for enhancing our understanding of the relationship between genotype and phenotype. In particular, predicting the impact of the genetic variants on gene expression will allow to optimize specific pathways and functions for engineering new biological systems. In this context, the development of accurate methods for predicting the translation efficiency and/or protein expression from the nucleotide sequence is a key challenge in computational biology. In this work we present PGExpress, a new regression method for predicting the log2-fold-change of the translation efficiency of an mRNA sequence in E. coli. PGExpress algorithm takes as input 12 features corresponding to the predicted RNA secondary structure and anti-Shine-Dalgarno hybridization free energies. The method was trained on a set of 1,772 sequence variants (WT-High) of 137 essential E. coli genes. For each gene, we considered 13 sequence variants of the first 33 nucleotides encoding for the same amino acids followed by the superfolder GFP. Each gene variant is represented sequence blocks that include the Ribosome Binding Site (RBS), the first 33 nucleotides of the coding region (C33), the remaining part of the coding region (CC), and their combinations. Our gradient-boosting-based tool (PGExpress) was trained using a 10-fold gene-based cross-validation procedure on the WT-High dataset. In this test PGExpress achieved a correlation coefficient of 0.60, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.3. When the regression task is cast as a classification problem, PGExpress reached an overall accuracy of 0.74 a Matthews correlation coefficient 0.48 and an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.81. In the regression task, PGExpress results in better performance than RBSCalculator in the prediction of the log2-fold-change of the translational efficiency and its variation on the WT-High dataset. Finally, we validated our method by performing in-house experiments on five newly generated mRNA sequence variants. The predictions of the expression level of the new variants are in agreement with our experimental results in E. coli.

TI Hybrid Algorithm for English Translation Speech Recognition Based on
   Deep Learning Model and Clustering
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB Speech recognition is the most important research direction in human-computer interaction. It is the key to the connection between human beings and machines and the expression of intelligence and automation in the information society. Taking English as the research object, using the related knowledge of speech recognition, it is based on the hidden Markov model technology of deep learning and clustering analysis algorithm and evaluated according to the cross-language English phonemic recognition system of sparse autoencoder (SA) method. By studying the speech recognition algorithm of the English translation, the influence of the speech recognition environment on the accuracy of speech recognition is confirmed. This provides a direction for humans to study speech recognition at a deeper level. Based on the language model of Transformer and the language model based on Seq2Seq, it sets different vocabularies, and the data are collected in the laboratory and outdoors, respectively, and the posttest template library is formed after collection. In the task of restoring phonetic symbols to English characters when phonemes are modeling units, the error rate is the lowest. The error rate on the test set reached 9.54%, which was 6.97 percentage points higher than that of the syllable modeling unit.

AB Idiomatic expressions (IEs) play an essential role in natural language. In this paper, we study the task of idiomatic sentence paraphrasing (ISP), which aims to paraphrase a sentence with an IE by replacing the IE with its literal paraphrase. The lack of large-scale corpora with idiomatic-literal parallel sentences is a primary challenge for this task, for which we consider two separate solutions. First, we propose an unsupervised approach to ISP, which leverages an IE's contextual information and definition and does not require a parallel sentence training set. Second, we propose a weakly supervised approach using back-translation to jointly perform paraphrasing and generation of sentences with IEs to enlarge the small-scale parallel sentence training dataset. Other significant derivatives of the study include a model that replaces a literal phrase in a sentence with an IE to generate an idiomatic expression and a large scale parallel dataset with idiomatic/literal sentence pairs. The effectiveness of the proposed solutions compared to competitive baselines is seen in the relative gains of over 5.16 points in BLEU, over 8.75 points in METEOR, and over 19.57 points in SARI when the generated sentences are empirically validated on a parallel dataset using automatic and manual evaluations. We demonstrate the practical utility of ISP as a preprocessing step in En-De machine translation.

AB The compilation of synchronous block diagrams into sequential imperative code has been addressed in the early eighties and can now be considered as folklore. However, separate, or modular, code generation, though largely used in existing compilers and particularly in industrial ones, has never been precisely described or entirely formalized. Such a formalization is now fundamental in the long-term goal to develop a mathematically certified compiler for a synchronous language as well as in simplifying existing implementations.
   This article presents in full detail the modular compilation of synchronous block diagrams into sequential code. We consider a first-order functional language reminiscent of LUSTRE, which it extends with a general n-ary merge operator, a reset construct, and a richer notion of clocks. The clocks are used to express activation of computations in the program and are specifically taken into account during the compilation process to produce efficient imperative code. We introduce a generic machine-based intermediate language to represent transition functions, and we present a concise clock-directed translation from the source to this intermediate language. We address the target code generation phase by describing a translation from the intermediate language to JAVA and C.

TI mRNA degradation machines in eukaryotic cells
SO BIOCHIMIE
AB The steady-state levels of mRNAs depend upon their combined rates of synthesis and processing, transport from the nucleus to cytoplasm, and decay in the cytoplasm. In eukaryotic cells, the degradation of mRNA is an essential determinant in the regulation of gene expression, and it can be modulated in response to developmental, environmental, and metabolic signals. This level of regulation is particularly important for proteins that are active for a brief period, such as growth factors, transcription factors, and proteins that control cell cycle progression. The mechanisms by which mRNAs are degraded and the sequence elements within the mRNAs that affect their stability are the subject of this review. We will summarize the current state of knowledge regarding cis-acting elements in mRNA and trans-acting factors that contribute to mRNA regulation decay. We will then consider the mechanisms by which specific signaling proteins seem to contribute to a dynamic organization of the mRNA degradation machinery in response to physiological stimuli.

TI A male germ-cell-specific ribosome controls male fertility
SO NATURE
AB Ribosomes are highly sophisticated translation machines that have been demonstrated to be heterogeneous in the regulation of protein synthesis(1,2). Male germ cell development involves complex translational regulation during sperm formation(3). However, it remains unclear whether translation during sperm formation is performed by a specific ribosome. Here we report a ribosome with a specialized nascent polypeptide exit tunnel, Ribosome(ST), that is assembled with the male germ-cell-specific protein RPL39L, the paralogue of core ribosome (Ribosome(Core)) protein RPL39. Deletion of Ribosome(ST) in mice causes defective sperm formation, resulting in substantially reduced fertility. Our comparison of single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structures of ribosomes from mouse kidneys and testes indicates that Ribosome(ST) features a ribosomal polypeptide exit tunnel of distinct size and charge states compared with Ribosome(Core). Ribosome(ST) predominantly cotranslationally regulates the folding of a subset of male germ-cell-specific proteins that are essential for the formation of sperm. Moreover, we found that specialized functions of Ribosome(ST) were not replaceable by Ribosome(Core). Taken together, identification of this sperm-specific ribosome should greatly expand our understanding of ribosome function and tissue-specific regulation of protein expression pattern in mammals.

SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB While active efforts are advancing medical AI model development and clinical translation, safety issues of medical AI models have emerged. Here, the authors investigate the effects on an AI model and on human experts of potential fake/adversarial images for breast cancer diagnosis.
   While active efforts are advancing medical artificial intelligence (AI) model development and clinical translation, safety issues of the AI models emerge, but little research has been done. We perform a study to investigate the behaviors of an AI diagnosis model under adversarial images generated by Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models and to evaluate the effects on human experts when visually identifying potential adversarial images. Our GAN model makes intentional modifications to the diagnosis-sensitive contents of mammogram images in deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of breast cancer. In our experiments the adversarial samples fool the AI-CAD model to output a wrong diagnosis on 69.1% of the cases that are initially correctly classified by the AI-CAD model. Five breast imaging radiologists visually identify 29%-71% of the adversarial samples. Our study suggests an imperative need for continuing research on medical AI model's safety issues and for developing potential defensive solutions against adversarial attacks.

TI p100 increases AT1R expression through interaction with AT1R 3 '-UTR
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB p100 protein (SND1, Tudor-SN) is a multifunctional protein that functions as a co-activator for several transcription factors, has a role in mRNA processing and participates in RNAi-induced silencing complex (RISC) with yet unknown function. In this study we identified a novel function for p100 as a regulator of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) expression. The binding of p100 to AT1R 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) via staphylococcal nuclease-like (SN-like) domains increased receptor expression by decreasing the rate of mRNA decay and enhancing its translation. Overexpression of p100 increased AT1R expression, whereas decrease in p100 binding to 3'-UTR either by p100 silencing or by the deletion of p100 binding site downregulated receptor expression. The effect of p100 through AT1R 3'-UTR was independent of Argonaute2 (Ago2), a known p100 partner, and was thus RISC-independent. Nucleotides 118 to 120 of the AT1R 3'-UTR were found to be critical for the binding of p100 to 3'-UTR. In summary, p100 is a multifunctional regulator of gene expression that regulates transcription, mRNA maturation, and as described in this article, also mRNA stability and translation.

AB This paper presents robust click-point linking: a novel localized registration framework that allows users to interactively prescribe where the accuracy has to be high. By emphasizing locality and interactivity, our solution is faithful to how the registration results are used in practice. Given a user-specified point, the click-point linking provides a single point-wise correspondence between a data pair In order to link visually dissimilar local regions, a correspondence is sought by using only geometrical context without comparing the local appearances. Our solution is formulated as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) without estimating a domain transformation explicitly. A spatial likelihood of Gaussian mixture form is designed to capture geometrical configurations between the point-of-interest and a hierarchy of global-to-local 3D landmarks that are detected using machine learning and entropy based feature detectors. A closed-form-formula is derived to specify each Gaussian component by exploiting geometric invariances under specific group of domain transformation via RANSAC-like random sampling. A mean shift algorithm is applied to robustly and efficiently solve the local MLE problem, replacing the standard consensus step of the RANSAC Two transformation groups of pure translation and scaling/translation are considered in this paper We test feasibility of the proposed approach with 16 pairs of whole-body CT data, demonstrating the effectiveness.

TI Ribosome Hibernation as a Stress Response of Bacteria
SO PROTEIN AND PEPTIDE LETTERS
AB Ribosome is primarily regarded as the committing organelle for the translation process. Besides the expansion of its function from a translational machine for protein synthesis to a regulatory platform for protein quality control, the activity regulation and recycling of ribosome have been deepened significantly. Recent advances have confirmed a novel mechanism in the regulation of ribosome activity when a cell encounters adverse conditions. Due to the binding of certain protein factors onto a ribosome, the structural and functional change of the ribosome inside the cell will take place, thereby leading to the formation of inactive ribosomes (70S monomer or 100S dimer), or ribosome hibernation. By ribosome hibernation, the overall protein synthesis rate of a cell could be slowed down. The resistance to adverse conditions or chemicals of the host cell will be enhanced. In this paper, we discussed the phenomenon, molecular mechanism, and physiological effect of ribosome hibernation when cells are under stresses. And then, we discussed the resuscitation of a hibernating ribosome and the role of ribosome hibernation in the treatment of antimicrobial infection.

TI DuReSE: Rewriting Incomplete Utterances via Neural Sequence Editing
SO NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS
AB Utterance rewriting condenses a sparse, multi-turn context into a single, self-contained utterance. It has demonstrated superb effectiveness in response generation. Prior techniques mainly rely on machine translation technology to translate the last (incomplete) utterance in the context into a complete utterance. Such a rewriting paradigm contrasts with the main characteristic of the task, that is, the source and target utterances are mostly the same with only a small portion of local edits. Therefore, they rely heavily on large amounts of data to fit the translation model. This paper proposes DuReSE (dialogue utterance rewritten via sequence editing), a neural utterance editor designed for utterance rewriting. DuReSE shapes utterance rewriting as a sentence editing task and then predicts a small set of edit operations for each word in the dialogue context. The model edits the incomplete utterance in two phases where (1) an in-place editor performs word-level editing, and (2) a post-editor then refines the rewritten utterance. Experiments on three benchmark data sets have suggested that DuReSE outperforms baseline models in terms of EM, BLEU, and ROUGE. Specifically, DuReSE outperforms the baselines by up to 14.1% in EM, indicating that it can retrieve more informative and important information, compared with existing techniques.

TI Interrogation of Eukaryotic Stop Codon Readthrough Signals by in Vitro
   RNA Selection
SO BIOCHEMISTRY
AB RNA signals located downstream of stop codons in eukaryotic mRNAs can stimulate high levels of translational readthrough by the ribosome, thereby giving rise to functionally distinct C-terminally extended protein products. Although many readthrough events have been previously discovered in Nature, a broader description of the stimulatory RNA signals would help to identify new reprogramming events in eukaryotic genes and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of readthrough. Here, we explore the RNA reprogramming landscape by performing in vitro translation selections to enrich RNA readthrough signals de novo from a starting randomized library comprising >10(13) unique sequence variants. Selection products were characterized using high-throughput sequencing, from which we identified primary sequence and secondary structure readthrough features. The activities of readthrough signals, including three novel sequence motifs, were confirmed in cellular reporter assays. Then, we used machine learning and our HTS data to predict readthrough activity from human 3'-untranslated region sequences. This led to the discovery of >1.5% readthrough in four human genes (CDKN2B, LEPROTL1, PVRL3, and SFTA2). Together, our results provide valuable insights into RNA-mediated translation reprogramming, offer tools for readthrough discovery in eukaryotic genes, and present new opportunities to explore the biological consequences of stop codon readthrough in humans.

AB Many recent works have demonstrated the benefits of knowledge graph embeddings in completing monolingual knowledge graphs. Inasmuch as related knowledge bases are built in several different languages, achieving cross-lingual knowledge alignment will help people in constructing a coherent knowledge base, and assist machines in dealing with different expressions of entity relationships across diverse human languages. Unfortunately, achieving this highly desirable cross-lingual alignment by human labor is very costly and error-prone. Thus, we propose MTransE, a translation-based model for multilingual knowledge graph embeddings, to provide a simple and automated solution. By encoding entities and relations of each language in a separated embedding space, MTransE provides transitions for each embedding vector to its cross-lingual counterparts in other spaces, while preserving the functionalities of monolingual embeddings. We deploy three different techniques to represent cross-lingual transitions, namely axis calibration, translation vectors, and linear transformations, and derive five variants for MTransE using different loss functions. Our models can be trained on partially aligned graphs, where just a small portion of triples are aligned with their cross-lingual counterparts. The experiments on cross-lingual entity matching and triple-wise alignment verification show promising results, with some variants consistently outperforming others on different tasks. We also explore how MTransE preserves the key properties of its monolingual counterpart TransE.

TI Ribosome Biogenesis: A Central Player in Cancer Metastasis and
   Therapeutic Resistance
SO CANCER RESEARCH
AB Ribosomes are a complex ensemble of rRNA and ribosomal proteins that function as mRNA translation machines. Ribosome biogenesis is a multistep process that begins in the nucleolus and concludes in the cytoplasm. The process is tightly controlled by multiple checkpoint and surveillance pathways. Perturbations in these checkpoints and pathways can lead to hyperactivation of ribosome biogenesis. Emerging evidence suggests that cancer cells harbor a specialized class of ribosomes (onco-ribosomes) that facilitates the oncogenic translation program, modulates cellular functions, and promotes metabolic rewiring. Mutations in ribo-somal proteins, rRNA processing, and ribosome assembly factors result in ribosomopathies that are associated with an increased risk of developing malignancies. Recent studies have linked mutations in ribosomal proteins and aberrant ribosomes with poor prognosis, highlighting ribosome-targeted therapy as a promising approach for treating patients with cancer. Here, we summarize various aspects of dysregulation of ribosome biogenesis and the impact of resultant onco-ribosomes on malignant tumor behavior, therapeu-tic resistance, and clinical outcome. Ribosome biogenesis is a promising therapeutic target, and understanding the important determinants of this process will allow for improved and perhaps selective therapeutic strategies to target ribosome biosynthesis.

AB Domain specific languages (DSLs) excel at programming productivity because they provide large-grain composite data structures, e.g., a, graphics image) and large-grain operators for composition (e.g., image addition or convolution). As a result, extensive computations can be written as APL-like one-liners that are equivalent to tens or hundreds of lines of code (LOC) when written in a conventional language like Java. The problem with DSL specifications is that they de-localize the code components making unoptimized machine translations significantly slower than for the human optimized equivalent. Specifically, operations on DSL composites imply multiple control structures (e.g., loops) that process the individual elements of large-grain composites and those multiple, implicit control structures are distributed (i.e., de-localized) across the expression of operators and operands. Human programmers recognise the relation among these distributed control structures and merge them to minimise the redundancy of control. For example, merged control structures may perform several operations on several large-grain data structures in a single pass. This merging is the process of control localization. This paper discusses strategies for automating localization without large search spaces and outlines a domain specific example of transformation rules for localizing control. The example is based on the localization method in the Anticipatory Optimization Generator (AOG) system [3-8].

AB Idiomatic expressions have always been a bottleneck for language comprehension and natural language understanding, specifically for tasks like Machine Translation (MT). MT systems predominantly produce literal translations of idiomatic expressions as they do not exhibit generic and linguistically deterministic patterns which can be exploited for comprehension of the non-compositional meaning of the expressions. These expressions occur in parallel corpora used for training, but due to the comparatively high occurrences of the constituent words of idiomatic expressions in literal context, the idiomatic meaning gets overpowered by the compositional meaning of the expression. State of the art Metaphor Detection Systems are able to detect non-compositional usage at word level but miss out on idiosyncratic phrasal idiomatic expressions. This creates a dire need for a dataset with a wider coverage and higher occurrence of commonly occurring idiomatic expressions, the spans of which can be used for Metaphor Detection. With this in mind, we present our English Possible Idiomatic Expressions (EPIE) corpus containing 25,206 sentences labelled with lexical instances of 717 idiomatic expressions. These spans also cover literal usages for the given set of idiomatic expressions. We also present the utility of our dataset by using it to train a sequence labelling module and testing on three independent datasets with high accuracy, precision and recall scores.

TI Predicting unplanned medical visits among patients with diabetes:
   translation from machine learning to clinical implementation
SO BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING
AB Background Diabetes is a medical and economic burden in the United States. In this study, a machine learning predictive model was developed to predict unplanned medical visits among patients with diabetes, and findings were used to design a clinical intervention in the sponsoring healthcare organization. This study presents a case study of how predictive analytics can inform clinical actions, and describes practical factors that must be incorporated in order to translate research into clinical practice. Methods Data were drawn from electronic medical records (EMRs) from a large healthcare organization in the Northern Plains region of the US, from adult (>= 18 years old) patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who received care at least once during the 3-year period. A variety of machine-learning classification models were run using standard EMR variables as predictors (age, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), glycohemoglobin (A1C), smoking status, number of diagnoses and number of prescriptions). The best-performing model after cross-validation testing was analyzed to identify strongest predictors. Results The best-performing model was a linear-basis support vector machine, which achieved a balanced accuracy (average of sensitivity and specificity) of 65.7%. This model outperformed a conventional logistic regression by 0.4 percentage points. A sensitivity analysis identified BP and HDL as the strongest predictors, such that disrupting these variables with random noise decreased the model's overall balanced accuracy by 1.3 and 1.4 percentage points, respectively. These recommendations, along with stakeholder engagement, behavioral economics strategies, and implementation science principles helped to inform the design of a clinical intervention targeting behavioral changes. Conclusion Our machine-learning predictive model more accurately predicted unplanned medical visits among patients with diabetes, relative to conventional models. Post-hoc analysis of the model was used for hypothesis generation, namely that HDL and BP are the strongest contributors to unplanned medical visits among patients with diabetes. These findings were translated into a clinical intervention now being piloted at the sponsoring healthcare organization. In this way, this predictive model can be used in moving from prediction to implementation and improved diabetes care management in clinical settings.

TI Multi-assignment clustering: Machine learning from a biological
   perspective
SO JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB A common approach for analyzing large-scale molecular data is to cluster objects sharing similar characteristics. This assumes that genes with highly similar expression profiles are likely participating in a common molecular process. Biological systems are extremely complex and challenging to understand, with proteins having multiple functions that sometimes need to be activated or expressed in a time-dependent manner. Thus, the strategies applied for clustering of these molecules into groups are of key importance for translation of data to biologically interpretable findings. Here we implemented a multi-assignment clustering (MAsC) approach that allows molecules to be assigned to multiple clusters, rather than single ones as in commonly used clustering techniques. When applied to high-throughput transcriptomics data, MAsC increased power of the downstream pathway analysis and allowed identification of pathways with high biological relevance to the experimental setting and the biological systems studied. Multi-assignment clustering also reduced noise in the clustering partition by excluding genes with a low correlation to all of the resulting clusters. Together, these findings suggest that our methodology facilitates translation of large-scale molecular data into biological knowledge. The method is made available as an R package on GitLab (https://gitlab.com/wolftower/masc).

AB Work offloading allows a mobile device, i.e., the client, to execute its computation-intensive code remotely on a more powerful server to improve its performance and to extend its battery life. However, the difference in instruction set architectures (ISAs) between the client and the server poses a great challenge to work offloading. Most of the existing solutions rely on language-level virtual machines to hide such differences. Therefore, they have to tie closely to the specific programming languages. Other approaches try to recompile the mobile applications to achieve the specific goal of offloading, so their applicability is limited to the availability of the source code.
   To overcome the above limitations, we propose to extend the capability of dynamic binary translation across clients and servers to offload the identified computation-intensive binary code regions automatically to the server at runtime. With this approach, the native binaries on the client can be offloaded to the server seamlessly without the limitations mentioned above. A prototype has been implemented using an existing retargetable dynamic binary translator. Experimental results show that our system achieves 1.93X speedup with 48.66% reduction in energy consumption for six real-world applications, and 1.62X speedup with 42.4% reduction in energy consumption for SPEC CINT2006 benchmarks.

AB Data from clinical real-world settings is characterized by variability in quality, machine-type, setting, and source. One of the primary goals of medical computer vision is to develop and validate artificial intelligence (AI) based algorithms on real-world data enabling clinical translations. However, despite the exponential growth in AI based applications in healthcare, specifically in ophthalmology, translations to clinical settings remain challenging. Limited access to adequate and diverse real-world data inhibits the development and validation of translatable algorithms. In this paper, we present a new multi-modal longitudinal ophthalmic imaging dataset, the Illinois Ophthalmic Database Atlas (I-ODA), with the goal of advancing state-of-the-art computer vision applications in ophthalmology, and improving upon the translatable capacity of AI based applications across different clinical settings. We present the infrastructure employed to collect, annotate, and anonymize images from multiple sources, demonstrating the complexity of real-world retrospective data and its limitations. I-ODA includes 12 imaging modalities with a total of 3; 668; 649 ophthalmic images of 33; 876 individuals from the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences at the Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary of the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) over the course of 12 years.

AB JAUS is an open architecture designed to support interoperability between unmanned vehicles, payloads and controllers. 1 However, it competes against a plethora of other open architecture technologies and standards. In many cases, there is much to be gained by merging multiple open architecture components within a single system. One such case is with the Navy's Common Control System (CCS) architecture utilized by the Multi-robot Operator Control Unit version 4 (MOCU4). CCS has primarily focused on Group 3-5 aircraft whereas MOCU4 is focused on ground and maritime unmanned vehicles. To utilize both of these architectures within a single system, a translation architecture called the SAE JAUS Vehicle Interface Service (VIS) has been designed and implemented by the MOCU4 team at the Space and Naval Warfare Systems (SPAWAR) Center Pacific (SSC Pacific). This paper will explore the design considerations and decisions of this VIS, as well as provide details of its implementation. It will also describe briefly how the VIS has been developed and utilized for the following projects: Navy Common Control System (CCS) integration with Large Training Vehicle (LTV), Control Station Human Machine Interface (CaSHMI), and the Universal Tactical Controller (UTC) for the Common Robotic System - Individual (CRS(I)).

AB Speakers of different languages must attend to and encode strikingly different aspects of the world in order to use their language correctly (Sapir, 1921; Slobin, 1996). One such difference is related to the way gender is expressed in a language. Saying "I am happy" in English, does not encode any additional knowledge of the speaker that uttered the sentence. However, many other languages do have grammatical gender systems and so such knowledge would be encoded. In order to correctly translate such a sentence into, say, French, the inherent gender information needs to be retained/recovered. The same sentence would become either "Je suis heureux", for a male speaker or "Je suis heureuse" for a female one. Apart from morphological agreement, demographic factors (gender, age, etc.) also influence our use of language in terms of word choices or even on the level of syntactic constructions (Tannen, 1991; Pennebaker et al., 2003). We integrate gender information into NMT systems. Our contribution is twofold: (1) the compilation of large datasets with speaker information for 20 language pairs, and (2) a simple set of experiments that incorporate gender information into NMT for multiple language pairs. Our experiments show that adding a gender feature to an NMT system significantly improves the translation quality for some language pairs.

AB The goal of the cross-lingual summarization (CLS) is to convert a document in one language (e.g., English) to a summary in another one (e.g., Chinese). Essentially, the CLS task is the combination of machine translation (MT) and monolingual summarization (MS), and thus there exists the hierarchical relationship between MT&MS and CLS. Existing studies on CLS mainly focus on utilizing pipeline methods or jointly training an end-to-end model through an auxiliary MT or MS objective. However, it is very challenging for the model to directly conduct CLS as it requires both the abilities to translate and summarize. To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical model for the CLS task, based on the conditional variational auto-encoder. The hierarchical model contains two kinds of latent variables at the local and global levels, respectively. At the local level, there are two latent variables, one for translation and the other for summarization. As for the global level, there is another latent variable for cross-lingual summarization conditioned on the two local-level variables. Experiments on two language directions (English.Chinese) verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. In addition, we show that our model is able to generate better cross-lingual summaries than comparison models in the fewshot setting.

AB In this paper we introduce an innovative application of translation techniques applied to the problem of forensics analysis of smartphones. This analysis has the specific objective of determining which messages (either text or vocal), transmitted from and received by a specific device, seized for forensic analysis, may contain data that are relevant in a criminal investigation. The problems that make this analysis difficult are three: (1) the content could be written in a language that is not spoken by the analyst, (2) the number of messages actually containing pertinent and relevant traits is a small percentage on a potentially quite large space and (3) texts could be rather noisy in terms of content, for they could contain emoticons, language loans, and slang terms (beyond the fact that they could also be written in obscure languages such as specific dialects or languages spoken by small communities). We adopt a machine translation approach by providing an algorithm that takes messages of a smartphone as input, and processes them to a target language in an innovative way. We then show that the application is effective when applied to a set of real world cases, demonstrating a performance increase in terms of accuracy that could exceed 30% when compared to traditional approaches.

TI An Indoor Wi-Fi Localization Algorithm Using Ranging Model Constructed
   With Transformed RSSI and BP Neural Network
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS
AB This paper focuses on improving indoor Wi-Fi localization by mitigating the effect of fluctuation of received signal strength indication (RSSI). The RSSI data collected at each reference point is first transformed through translation and scaling. The BP (Back Propagation) neural network is then used to construct the ranging model using the transformed RSSI to determine the distances between the target point and each reference point. A genetic algorithm (GA) is developed to optimize the initial values of weights and biases of the BP neural network. For convenience, our proposed ranging model is denoted as GTBPD. A new localization algorithm is then proposed, which uses the GTBPD model and the sequential quadratic programming (SQP, an iterative nonlinear optimization algorithm), and the algorithm is denoted as GTBPD-LSQP for simplicity. Experiments were conducted in three areas of two different teaching buildings with complex environments. The performance of the proposed GTBPD-LSQP algorithm is evaluated and compared with four existing algorithms. The experimental results show that our proposed GTBPD-LSQP algorithm achieves significantly higher location accuracy than the four existing algorithms.

TI Multilingualism 2.0: language policies and the use of online translation
   tools on global platforms
SO ARGENTINIAN JOURNAL OF APPLIED LINGUISTICS
AB At present, the existing 2.0 Web is far more multilingual than was ever anticipated in the early days of the Internet (Hale, 2014; Hale & Eleta, 2017). Indeed, the increasing variety of languages is a phenomenon that signals the end of the first stages of the digital era in which the Internet was characterized by English-language dominance (Leppanen & Peuronen, 2012). This study primarily aims to present the emerging topics in multilingual research that focus on 2.0 platforms. It presents a literature review and discusses a number of multilingual strategies adopted by different platforms. Five popular platforms have been considered, namely Wikipedia, Facebook, Instagram, Booking. com and TripAdvisor, with close attention paid to travel platforms (and TripAdvisor, in particular). For 2.0 platform providers such as TripAdvisor, multilingualism constitutes a challenge. Typically, these platforms do not opt for an English-only rule, but rather develop linguistic policies in order to accommodate their multilingual users (Cenni & Goethals, 2017). The case of TripAdvisor is particularly striking, not least because it is characterized by the coexistence of two divergent multilingual strategies on the same platform.

TI Decoding the Neural Representation of Story Meanings across Languages
SO HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING
AB Drawing from a common lexicon of semantic units, humans fashion narratives whose meaning transcends that of their individual utterances. However, while brain regions that represent lower-level semantic units, such as words and sentences, have been identified, questions remain about the neural representation of narrative comprehension, which involves inferring cumulative meaning. To address these questions, we exposed English, Mandarin, and Farsi native speakers to native language translations of the same stories during fMRI scanning. Using a new technique in natural language processing, we calculated the distributed representations of these stories (capturing the meaning of the stories in high-dimensional semantic space), and demonstrate that using these representations we can identify the specific story a participant was reading from the neural data. Notably, this was possible even when the distributed representations were calculated using stories in a different language than the participant was reading. Our results reveal that identification relied on a collection of brain regions most prominently located in the default mode network. These results demonstrate that neuro-semantic encoding of narratives happens at levels higher than individual semantic units and that this encoding is systematic across both individuals and languages.

AB Prior research showed that to migrate Java code to C# by directly applying phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) on the lexemes of source code produces much semantically incorrect code. In this work, we conduct empirical studies on several open-source projects to investigate the use of well-defined semantics in programming languages to guide the translation process in SMT. We have investigated five types of features forming the contexts involving the (semantic) relations among code tokens including occurrence association among code tokens, data and control dependencies among program entities, visibility constraints of entities, and the consistency in declarations and accesses of variables, fields and methods. We use the Direct Maximum Entropy (DME) approach for feature integration.
   Our empirical results show that as individual features added to the baseline SMT model, token association and data dependencies contribute much with highest relative improvement in semantic correctness of up to 18.3% and 18.5%, respectively. The integration of three feature types (token association, data dependencies, and visibility) into the baseline model has highest relative improvement with up to 26.4% improvement in semantic correctness. Generally, 43.5-80.7% of the total translated methods are semantically correct. Our results show a good direction of using SMT with semantic features at different levels of abstraction to improve its accuracy.

AB In this paper, we propose the use of the Maximum Entropy approach for the task of automatic image annotation. Given labeled training data, Maximum Entropy is a statistical technique which allows one to predict the probability of a label given test data. The techniques allow for relationships between features to be effectively captured. and has been successfully applied to a number of language tasks including machine translation. In our case, we view the image annotation task as one where a training data set of images labeled with keywords is provided and we need to automatically label the test images with keywords. To do this, we first represent the image using a language of visterms and then predict the probability of seeing an English word given the set of visterms forming the image. Maximum Entropy allows us to compute the probability and in addition allows for the relationships between visterms to be incorporated. The experimental results show that Maximum Entropy outperforms one of the classical translation models that has been applied to this task and the Cross Media Relevance Model. Since the Maximum Entropy model allows for the use of a large number of predicates to possibly increase performance even further, Maximum Entropy model is a promising model for the task of automatic image annotation.

TI Automatic validation for binary translation
SO COMPUTER LANGUAGES SYSTEMS & STRUCTURES
AB Binary translation is an important technique for porting programs as it allows binary code for one platform to execute on another. It is widely used in virtual machines and emulators. However, implementing a correct (and efficient) binary translator is still very challenging because many delicate details must be handled smartly. Manually identifying mistranslated instructions in an application program is difficult, especially when the application is large. Therefore, automatic validation tools are needed urgently to uncover hidden problems in a binary translator. We developed a new validation tool for binary translators. In our validation tool, the original binary code and the translated binary code run simultaneously. Both versions of the binary code continuously send their architecture states and the stored values, which are the values stored into memory cells, to a third process, the validator. Since most mistranslated instructions will result in wrong architecture states during execution, our validator can catch most mistranslated instructions emitted by a binary translator by comparing the corresponding architecture states. Corresponding architecture states may differ due to (1) translation errors, (2) different (but correct) memory layouts, and (3) return values of certain system calls. The need to differentiate the three sources of differences makes comparing architecture states very difficult, if not impossible. in our validator, we take special care to make memory layouts exactly the same and make the corresponding system calls always return exactly the same values in the original and in the. translated binaries. Therefore, any differences in the corresponding architecture states indicate mistranslated instructions emitted by the binary translator. Besides solving the architecture-state-comparison problems, we also propose several methods to speed up the automatic validation. The first is the validation-block method, which reduces the number of validations while keeping the accuracy of instruction-level validation. The second is quick validation, which provides extremely fast validation at the expense of less accurate error information. Our validator can be applied to different binary translators. In our experiment, the validator has successfully validated programs translated by static, dynamic, and hybrid binary translators. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper addresses the problem of using visual information to estimate vehicle motion (a.k.a. visual odometry) from a machine learning perspective. The vast majority of current visual odometry algorithms are heavily based on geometry, using a calibrated camera model to recover relative translation (up to scale) and rotation by tracking image features over time. Our method eliminates the need for a parametric model by jointly learning how image structure and vehicle dynamics affect camera motion. This is achieved with a Gaussian Process extension, called Coupled GP, which is trained in a supervised manner to infer the underlying function mapping optical flow to relative translation and rotation. Matched image features parameters are used as inputs and linear and angular velocities are the outputs in our non-linear multi-task regression problem. We show here that it is possible, using a single uncalibrated camera and establishing a first-order temporal dependency between frames, to jointly estimate not only a full 6 DoF motion (along with a full covariance matrix) but also relative scale, a non-trivial problem in monocular configurations. Experiments were performed with imagery collected with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flying over a deserted area at speeds of 100120 km/h and altitudes of 80-100 m, a scenario that constitutes a challenge for traditional visual odometry estimators.

AB Arathorn developed a new theory to address the translation, rotation, scale and perspective invariance problem in vision. According to it, both natural and machine vision systems may be built using a basic block which he calls the map-seeking circuit. In his recent book(1), he informally describes the circuit and a number of simulation studies to illustrate his ideas and support his claims. In this paper, we complement his work by providing mathematical analysis of the circuit. We first construct difference equations describing its dynamics and study when they converge to a steady state which represents the circuit's interpretation of the input scene image. We then show that the state corresponds to the minimum of an upper bound on the difference between the input image and its reconstruction done by the circuit using its built-in banks of object memories and construction operators. The fact that the upper bound can be constructed and minimized directly in a computationally efficient and numerically robust manner, without having to recourse to the map-seeking circuit simulation, makes our alternative approach attractive for applications. We explain why the upper bound is not always tight, which leads to the collusion and other matching errors noticed by Arathorn.

TI Fixation strength of three different graft types used in posterior
   cruciate ligament reconstruction
SO KNEE SURGERY SPORTS TRAUMATOLOGY ARTHROSCOPY
AB Surgical reconstruction is generally recommended for PCL and associated ligament injuries. A variety of graft choices exist for PCL reconstruction surgery. This study evaluated the initial fixation strength of three grafts using in PCL reconstruction in a porcine model. Twenty fresh porcine knees were harvested and randomly assigned to four groups: bone-patellar tendon-bone graft, quadruple tendons graft, Achilles tendon graft, and normal PCL. After reconstruction the knee was tested on an NITS testing machine by translating the tibia posteriorly until failure at 30degrees of flexion, neutral rotation, and anatomical vertical alignment. Biomechanical parameters including maximal failure load, stiffness, and failure modes, were analyzed and compared. In the maximal failure load, the four-strand tendon group was significantly greater than the other two grafts. However, it had greatest translation. There were no significant differences between the three grafts in stiffness. All three of these commonly used grafts had weaker initial fixation strength and stiffness than normal PCL. Graft failure occurred mainly at the tendon-bone junction and tendon-suture sites. The Patellar tendon group had significantly least translation during continuing loading.

AB We propose a test generation strategy from natural language (NL) requirements via translation into Coloured Petri Nets (CPN), an extension of Petri Nets that supports model structuring and provides a mature theory and powerful tool support. This approach extends our previous work on the NAT2TEST framework, which involves syntactic and semantic analyses of NL requirements and the generation of Data-Flow Reactive Systems (DFRS) as an intermediate representation, from which target formal models can be obtained for the purpose of test case generation. Our contributions include automating a systematic translation of DFRS5 into CPN models, an extension to deal with time aspects, besides an empirical analysis of the CPN-based test generation strategy. The analyses considered examples both from the literature (a vending machine and a nuclear power plant control system), and from the aerospace and the automotive domain (a priority command control system and a turn indicator control system, respectively). We analysed performance and the ability to detect defects generated via mutation. The results provide evidence that the contribution proposed here is more efficient, besides being able to detect at least as many defects as our previous efforts. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Sentiment analysis is a subfield of data mining and natural language processing with the aim of extracting people's opinion and appraisals from their comments on the Web. Contrary to machine learning approach, lexicon-based methods have some important advantages like domain-independency and being needless of a large annotated training corpus and hence are faster. This makes lexicon-based approach prevalent in the sentiment analysis community. However, for Persian language, in contrast to English, using lexicon-based method is a new discipline. There are limited lexicons available for sentiment analysis in Persian, almost all of them are directly translated from English. In the current study, four lexicons are compared to show the importance of lexicons in the performance of document-level sentiment analysis. Specifically, the Persian version of NRC lexicon, SentiStrength, CNRC, and Adjectives are compared in a pure lexicon-based scenario. Experiments are carried out on the document-level edition of SPerSent dataset. Results show that direct translation used in NRC leads the poorest performance while pre-processing and refining lexicons used in SentiStrength and CNRC improves the performance. Also, the results show that using just adjectives leads to higher results in comparison to using NRC.

TI Integrating stereolithography and direct print technologies for 3D
   structural electronics fabrication
SO RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a hybrid manufacturing system that integrates stereolithography (SL) and direct print (DP) technologies to fabricate three-dimensional (3D) structures with embedded electronic circuits. A detailed process was developed that enables fabrication of monolithic 3D packages with electronics without removal from the hybrid SL/DP machine during the process. Successful devices are demonstrated consisting of simple 555 timer circuits designed and fabricated in 2D (single layer of routing) and 3D (multiple layers of routing and component placement).
   Design/methodology/approach - A hybrid SL/DP system was designed and developed using a 3D Systems SL 250/50 machine and an nScrypt micro-dispensing pump integrated within the SL machine through orthogonally-aligned linear translation stages. A corresponding manufacturing process was also developed using this system to fabricate 2D and 3D monolithic structures with embedded electronic circuits. The process involved part design, process planning, integrated manufacturing (including multiple starts and stops of both SL and DP and multiple intermediate processes), and post-processing. SL provided substrate/mechanical structure manufacturing while interconnections were achieved using DP of conductive inks. Simple functional demonstrations involving 2D and 3D circuit designs were accomplished.
   Findings - The 3D micro-dispensing DP system provided control over conductive trace deposition and combined with the manufacturing flexibility of the SL machine enabled the fabrication of monolithic 3D electronic structures. To fabricate a 3D electronic device within the hybrid SL/DP machine, a process was developed that required multiple starts and stops of the SL process, removal of uncured resin from the SL substrate, insertion of active and passive electronic components, and DP and laser curing of the conductive traces. Using this process, the hybrid SL/DP technology was capable of successfully fabricating, without removal from the machine during fabrication, functional 2D and 3D 555 timer circuits packaged within SL substrates.
   Research limitations/implications - Results indicated that fabrication of 3D embedded electronic systems is possible using the hybrid SL/DP machine. A complete manufacturing process was developed to fabricate complex, monolithic 3D structures with electronics in a single set-up, advancing the capabilities of additive manufacturing (AM) technologies. Although the process does not require removal of the structure from the machine during fabrication, many of the current sub-processes are manual. As a result, further research and development on automation and optimization of many of the sub-processes are required to enhance the overall manufacturing process.
   Practical implications - A new methodology is presented for manufacturing non-traditional electronic systems in arbitrary form, while achieving miniaturization and enabling rugged structure. Advanced applications are demonstrated using a semi-automated approach to SL/DP integration. Opportunities exist to fully automate the hybrid SL/DP machine and optimize the manufacturing process for enhancing the commercial appeal for fabricating complex systems.
   Originality/value - This work broadly demonstrates what can be achieved by integrating multiple AM technologies together for fabricating unique devices and more specifically demonstrates a hybrid SL/DP machine that can produce 3D monolithic structures with embedded electronics and printed interconnects.

AB Sequence-to-sequence methods have been extensively used in end-to-end (E2E) speech processing for recognition, translation, and synthesis work. In speech recognition, the Transformer model, which supports parallel computation and has intrinsic attention, is frequently used nowadays. This technology's primary aspects are its quick learning efficiency and absence of sequential operation, unlike Deep Neural Networks (DNN). This study concentrated on Transformer, an emergent sequential model that excels in applications for natural language processing (NLP) and neural machine translation (NMT) applications. To create a framework for the automated recognition of spoken Hindi utterances, an end-to-end and Transformer based model to understand the phenomenon classification was considered. Hindi is one of several agglutinative languages, and there isn't much information available for speech/voice recognition algorithms. According to several research, the Transformer approach enhances the performance of the system for languages with limited resources. As per the analyses done by us, it was found that the Hindi-based speech recognition system performed better when Transformers were used along with the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) models altogether. Further, when a language model was included, the Word Error Rate (WER) on a clean dataset was at its lowest i.e., 3.2% .

TI Mutations at the accommodation gate of the ribosome impair RF2-dependent
   translation termination
SO RNA
AB During protein synthesis, aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) and release factors 1 and 2 (RF1 and RF2) have to bind at the catalytic center of the ribosome on the 50S subunit where they take part in peptide bond formation or peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis, respectively. Computer simulations of aa-tRNA movement into the catalytic site (accommodation) suggested that three nucleotides of 23S rRNA, U2492, C2556, and C2573, form a "gate" at which aa-tRNA movement into the A site is retarded. Here we examined the role of nucleotides C2573 of 23S rRNA, a part of the putative accommodation gate, and of the neighboring A2572 for aa-tRNA binding followed by peptide bond formation and for the RF2-dependent peptide release. Mutations at the two positions did not affect aa-tRNA accommodation, peptide bond formation, or the fidelity of aa-tRNA selection, but impaired RF2-catalyzed peptide release. The data suggest that the ribosome is a robust machine that allows rapid aa-tRNA accommodation despite the defects at the accommodation gate. In comparison, peptide release by RF2 appears more sensitive to these mutations, due to slower accommodation of the factor or effects on RF2 positioning in the A site.

TI A compression algorithm using integrated record information for
   translation dictionaries
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB A Trie structure is a well-known method for retrieving natural language (NL) dictionaries for morphological analysis, machine translation and so on. With the development of a variety of NL processing systems, some types of dictionaries in a computer hard disk have a lot of common information. This paper presents a method of merging individual dictionaries into the generalized dictionary. It enables us to reduce the total dictionary size and to expand the usage of individual dictionaries to that of the other applications. For key retrieval of the merged dictionary, there are many long strings such as compound words and idioms which take much space for a huge set of keys when stored in the Trie, so a fast trie structure, called a double-array structure is introduced and its compression scheme is proposed by replacing long strings into corresponding leaf node numbers of the Trie. Although the size of the presented records grows, the total number of them is extremely decreased by merging common information. The presented method is evaluated by the observation experimental results for nine dictionaries show that new method is more efficient than previous ones. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI A Learning to rank framework based on cross-lingual loss function for
   cross-lingual information retrieval
SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE
AB Learning to Rank (LTR) techniques use machine learning to rank documents. In this paper, we propose a new LTR based framework for cross-language information retrieval (CLIR). The core idea of the proposed framework is the use of the knowledge of training queries in the target language as well as the training queries in the source language to extract features and to construct the ranking model instead of using only the training queries in the source language. The proposed framework is composed of two main components. The first component extracts monolingual and cross-lingual features from the queries and the documents. To extract the cross-lingual features, we introduce a general approach based on translation probabilities where translation knowledge, which is created from a combination of probabilistic dictionary extracted from translation resources with the translation knowledge available in the queries in the target language, is used to fill the gap between the documents and the queries. The second component of the proposed framework trains a ranking model to optimize the proposed loss function for an input LTR algorithm, and the features. The new loss function is proposed for any listwise LTR algorithm to construct a ranking model for CLIR. To this end, the loss function of the LTR algorithm is calculated for both training data in the target language and training data in the source language. We propose a linear interpolation of the harmonic mean of two loss functions (monolingual and cross-lingual) and the ratio of these two loss functions as the new loss function. The output of this framework is a cross-lingual ranking model that is created with the goal of minimizing the proposed loss function. Experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms the baseline information retrieval methods and other LTR ranking models in terms of Mean Average Precision (MAP). The findings also indicate that the use of cross-lingual features considerably increases the efficiency of the framework in terms of MAP and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG).

AB Elongation factor G (EF-G) promotes the movement of two tRNAs and the mRNA through the ribosome in each cycle of peptide elongation. During translocation, the tRNAs transiently occupy intermediate positions on both small (30S) and large (50S) ribosomal subunits. How EF-G and GTP hydrolysis control these movements is still unclear. We used fluorescence labels that specifically monitor movements on either 30S or 50S subunits in combination with EF-G mutants and translocation-specific antibiotics to investigate timing and energetics of translocation. We show that EF-G-GTP facilitates synchronous movements of peptidyl-tRNA on the two subunits into an early post-translocation state, which resembles a chimeric state identified by structural studies. EF-G binding without GTP hydrolysis promotes only partial tRNA movement on the 50S subunit. However, rapid 30S translocation and the concomitant completion of 50S translocation require GTP hydrolysis and a functional domain 4 of EF-G. Our results reveal two distinct modes for utilizing the energy of EF-G binding and GTP hydrolysis and suggest that coupling of GTP hydrolysis to translocation is mediated through rearrangements of the 30S subunit.

TI Predicting coauthorship using bibliographic network embedding
SO JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Coauthorship prediction applies predictive analytics to bibliographic data to predict authors who are highly likely to be coauthors. In this study, we propose an approach for coauthorship prediction based on bibliographic network embedding through a graph-based bibliographic data model that can be used to model common bibliographic data, including papers, terms, sources, authors, departments, research interests, universities, and countries. A real-world dataset released by AMiner that includes more than 2 million papers, 8 million citations, and 1.7 million authors were integrated into a large bibliographic network using the proposed bibliographic data model. Translation-based methods were applied to the entities and relationships to generate their low-dimensional embeddings while preserving their connectivity information in the original bibliographic network. We applied machine learning algorithms to embeddings that represent the coauthorship relationships of the two authors and achieved high prediction results. The reference model, which is the combination of a network embedding size of 100, the most basic translation-based method, and a gradient boosting method achieved an F1 score of 0.9 and even higher scores are obtainable with different embedding sizes and more advanced embedding methods. Thus, the strengths of the proposed approach lie in its customizable components under a unified framework.

AB The modern ribosome is a complex biological machine that is responsible for chiral synthesis of cellular proteins according to the genetic code as specified by a mRNA. Major portions of the ribosomal machinery were likely in place before the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of life. The early evolution of the ribosome has implications for the origin of the genetic code, the emergence of chirality in peptide synthesis, and the emergence of LUCA. Although codon assignments may remain a mystery, the history of the ribosome provides a context for dating the first usage of mRNA. In the case of chirality, the modern ribosome suggests that a small initial chiral preference for L-amino acids in the environment may have been greatly enhanced by a two step process in which the charging of a primitive tRNA and the subsequent synthesis of a peptide bond both had the same chiral preference. The resulting ability to make largely chiral peptides may have provided an advantage over other prebiotic mechanisms for making peptides. Finally, the late addition of factors such as EF-G may have greatly accelerated the emerging ribosome's ability to synthesize proteins, thereby allowing entities with this novel capability to emerge as the LUCA.

TI Stop codon-mediated suppression of splicing is a novel nuclear scanning
   mechanism not affected by elements of protein synthesis and NMD
SO RNA
AB The pre-mRNA splicing machine must frequently discriminate between normal and many potential 5' splice sites that match the consensus sequence but remain latent. Suppression of splicing (SOS) at such latent 5' splice sites is required for the maintenance of an open reading frame, and to ensure that only RNAs that encode for functional proteins will be formed. In this study we show that SOS is a novel mechanism distinct from the known RNA surveillance mechanisms. First, SOS is distinct from nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) because it is not dependent on translation and is not affected by RNAi-mediated down-regulation of hUpf1 and hUpf2-two key components of the NMD pathway. Second, SOS is distinct from nonsense-associated alternative splicing (NAS), because a mutant of hUpf1, which was shown to abrogate NAS, does not activate latent splicing. Elucidating the mechanism of SOS is pertinent to human disease in view of the large number of human genes that harbor latent splice sites.

TI Delayed kidney graft function: from mechanism to translation
SO KIDNEY INTERNATIONAL
AB In as many as 50% of cases the immediate post-kidney transplant course is complicated by delayed graft function that is most commonly related to ischemia and reperfusion injury. In addition to the acute complications related to renal failure and the associated economic impact of prolonged hospitalization, the development of delayed graft function is associated with an increased risk of chronic allograft nephropathy and shortened allograft survival. Challenges in understanding its mechanisms include the complexity, as contributors are derived from both the donor and the recipient. This acute kidney injury is modulated and caused by a complex interplay of events that lead to hypoxic and ischemic injury as well as to altered repair mechanisms. New therapies primarily seek to suppress the inflammatory homing of adaptive immune cells to the kidney, limit cell death, and/or interrupt detrimental signaling of necrosis. Although there are several promising novel targets and innovative therapeutics available, many challenges remain in their translation from bench to bedside. Identifying organs at risk and clearly defined end points will be critical in designing interventional trials.

AB Due to the ever increasing growth rate of malwares, Memory Forensics has become unavoidable in a cyber crime investigation. This is because physical memory may contain crucial information that is available nowhere in the system hard disk. Memory Forensics deals with collection of forensically sound evidence from physical memory content of Suspect's system. This is a fast growing and challenging field in computer forensics where a live forensic methodology is adopted in order to acquire physical memory content. Analysis of the collected memory dump is very difficult due to the complex data structures in it, especially in Windows x64 systems. Also, the complexity involved in 64-bit address translation makes the analysis tougher. This translation can be done only after finding an artifact called Directory Table Base (DTB). Even though there are few methods available for finding DTB, none is efficient for adopting in a memory analysis tool. In this paper, a novel methodology for finding DTB in a 64-bit Windows system is described in detail. The paper also explains algorithms for retrieving forensically relevant information like running processes and its associated details from physical memory dump collected from Windows7 x64 machines.

TI The stability of the femoral component of a minimal invasive total hip
   replacement system
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART H-JOURNAL OF
   ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE
AB In this study, the initial stability of the femoral component of a minimal invasive total hip replacement was biomechanically evaluated during simulated normal walking and chair rising. A 20 mm diameter canal was created in the femoral necks of five fresh frozen human cadaver bones and the femoral heads were resected at the smallest cross-sectional area of the neck. The relatively short, polished, taper-shaped prostheses were cemented centrally in this canal according to a standardized procedure. A servohydraulic testing machine was used to apply dynamic loads to the prosthetic head. Radiostereophotogrammetric analysis was used to measure rotations and translations between the prosthesis and bone. In addition, the reconstructions were loaded until failure in a static, displacement-controlled test. During the dynamic experiments, the femoral necks did not fail and no macroscopical damage was detected. Maximal values were found for normal walking with a mean rotation of about 0.2 degrees and a mean translation of about 120 mu m. These motions stabilized during testing. The mean static failure load was 4714 N. The results obtained in this study are promising and warrant further development of this type of minimal invasive hip prosthesis.

TI eIF5B employs a novel domain release mechanism to catalyze ribosomal
   subunit joining
SO EMBO JOURNAL
AB eIF5B is a eukaryal translational GTPase that catalyzes ribosomal subunit joining to form elongation-competent ribosomes. Despite its central role in protein synthesis, the mechanistic details that govern the function of eIF5B or its archaeal and bacterial (IF2) orthologs remained unclear. Here, we present six high-resolution crystal structures of eIF5B in its apo, GDP- and GTP-bound form that, together with an analysis of the thermodynamics of nucleotide binding, provide a detailed picture of the entire nucleotide cycle performed by eIF5B. Our data show that GTP binding induces significant conformational changes in the two conserved switch regions of the G domain, resulting in the reorganization of the GTPase center. These rearrangements are accompanied by the rotation of domain II relative to the G domain and release of domain III from its stable contacts with switch 2, causing an increased intrinsic flexibility in the free GTP-bound eIF5B. Based on these data, we propose a novel domain release mechanism for eIF5B/IF2 activation that explains how eIF5B and IF2 fulfill their catalytic role during ribosomal subunit joining.

TI Toward a Critique of Algorithmic Violence
SO INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY
AB Questions about how algorithms contribute to (in)security are under discussion across international political sociology. Building upon and adding to these debates, our collective discussion foregrounds questions about algorithmic violence. We argue that it is important to examine how algorithmic systems feed (into) specific forms of violence, and how they justify violent actions or redefine what forms of violence are deemed legitimate. Bringing together different disciplinary and conceptual vantage points, this collective discussion opens a conversation about algorithmic violence focusing both on its specific instances and on the challenges that arise in conceptualizing and studying it. Overall, the discussion converges on three areas of concern-the violence undergirding the creation and feeding of data infrastructures; the translation processes at play in the use of computer/machine vision across diverse security practices; and the institutional governing of algorithmic violence, especially its organization, limitation, and legitimation. Our two-fold aim is to show the potential of a cross-disciplinary conversation and to move toward an interactional research agenda. While our approaches diverge, they also enrich each other. Ultimately, we highlight the critical purchase of studying the role of algorithmic violence in the fabric of the international through a situated analysis of algorithmic systems as part of complex, and often messy, practices.

TI Deficiency of mitoribosomal S10 protein affects translation and splicing
   in Arabidopsis mitochondria
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB The ribosome is not only a protein-making machine, but also a regulatory element in protein synthesis. This view is supported by our earlier data showing that Arabidopsis mitoribosomes altered due to the silencing of the nuclear RPS10 gene encoding mitochondrial ribosomal protein S10 differentially translate mitochondrial transcripts compared with the wild-type. Here, we used ribosome profiling to determine the contribution of transcriptional and translational control in the regulation of protein synthesis in rps10 mitochondria compared with the wild-type ones. Oxidative phosphorylation system proteins are preferentially synthesized in wild-type mitochondria but this feature is lost in the mutant. The rps10 mitoribosomes show slightly reduced translation efficiency of most respiration-related proteins and at the same time markedly more efficiently synthesize ribosomal proteins and MatR and TatC proteins. The mitoribosomes deficient in S10 protein protect shorter transcript fragments which exhibit a weaker 3-nt periodicity compared with the wild-type. The decrease in the triplet periodicity is particularly drastic for genes containing introns. Notably, splicing is considerably less effective in themutant, indicating an unexpected link between the deficiency of S10 and mitochondrial splicing. Thus, a shortage of the mitoribosomal S10 protein has wide-ranging consequences on mitochondrial gene expression.

AB Applications can accelerates up to hundreds of times faster by offloading some computation from CPU to execute at graphical processing units (GPUs). This technique is so called the general-purpose computation on graphic processing units (GPGPUs). Recent research on accelerating various applications by GPGPUs using a programming model from NVIDIA, called Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), have shown significant improvement on performance results. However, writing an efficient CUDA program requires in-depth understanding of GPU architecture in order to develop a suitable data-parallel strategy, and to express it in a low-level style of code. Thus, CUDA programming is still considered complex and error-prone. This paper proposes a new set of application program interfaces (APIs), called Griffon, and its compiler framework for automatic translation of C programs to CUDA-based programs. The Griffon APIs allow programmers to exploit the performance of multicore machines using OpenMP and offloads computations to GPUs using Griffon directives. The Griffon compiler framework uses a new graph algorithm for efficiently exploiting data locality. Experimental results on a 16-core NVIDIA Geforce 8400M GS using four workloads show that Griffon-based programs can accelerate up to 89 times faster than their sequential implementation.

TI Data augmentation with Mobius transformations
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Data augmentation has led to substantial improvements in the performance and generalization of deep models, and remains a highly adaptable method to evolving model architectures and varying amounts of data-in particular, extremely scarce amounts of available training data. In this paper, we present a novel method of applying Mobius transformations to augment input images during training. Mobius transformations are bijective conformal maps that generalize image translation to operate over complex inversion in pixel space. As a result, Mobius transformations can operate on the sample level and preserve data labels. We show that the inclusion of Mobius transformations during training enables improved generalization over prior sample-level data augmentation techniques such as cutout and standard crop-and-flip transformations, most notably in low data regimes.

AB In natural language processing, the problem of finding the intended meaning or "sense" of a word which is activated by the use of that word in a particular context is generally known as word sense disambiguation (WSD) problem. The solution to this problem impacts many other fields of natural language processing including sentiment analysis and machine translation. Here, WSD problem is modelled as a combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to find a sequence of meanings or senses that maximizes the semantic meaning among the targeted words. In this work, an algorithm is proposed that uses a combinatorial version of particle swarm optimization algorithm for solving WSD problem. The test results show that the algorithm performs better than existing methods.

The data were collected through questioners involving 104 engineering students, including the alumni at Politeknik Kota Malang, Indonesia. Furthermore, interviews were carried out to explain the details where necessary to support the primary data. It is found that the common problems faced by engineering students include 1) combining words into sentences, 2) identifying the most appropriate technical terms in engineering, and 3) applying grammar in context. To cope with those difficulties they demanded translation application machines, supported by peer-proofreaders. In addition, they considerably engaged personal tutoring with the lectures more than three times.

AB Handwriting recognition is a complicated process that many applications rely on, such as mail sorting, cheque processing, digitalisation and translation. The recognition of handwritten Arabic is still an ongoing challenge mainly due to the similarity among its letters and the variety of writing styles. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed that uses support vector machines (SVMs) with normalized poly kernel. The well-known Arabic handwritten database, IFN/ENIT-database, which contains 936 city names with more than 32,492 instances, is used to test the proposed system. The results of this novel approach are compared with the results of two different studies. The comparison shows that a higher accuracy rate is obtained using the proposed system.

AB In this paper, we report on a parallel implementation of XQuery. As XQuery is being used for processing large datasets, and/or for compute-intensive applications, efficiency of XQuery implementations is becoming an important issue. Our work has specifically focused on scientific data processing and data mining applications. Parallelization of this class of XQuery queries involves a number of challenges, which include data distribution, parallelization of generalized reductions, and translation to an imperative language like C/C++, so as to invoke efficient parallel communication libraries. In this paper, we report our solutions towards the above problems. By implementing the techniques in a compiler and generating code based on a C++ SAX parser and the Message Passing Interface (MPI), we are able to achieve efficient parallel execution on a cluster of machines.

TI Contestable AI by Design: Towards a Framework
SO MINDS AND MACHINES
AB As the use of AI systems continues to increase, so do concerns over their lack of fairness, legitimacy and accountability. Such harmful automated decision-making can be guarded against by ensuring AI systems are contestable by design: responsive to human intervention throughout the system lifecycle. Contestable AI by design is a small but growing field of research. However, most available knowledge requires a significant amount of translation to be applicable in practice. A proven way of conveying intermediate-level, generative design knowledge is in the form of frameworks. In this article we use qualitative-interpretative methods and visual mapping techniques to extract from the literature sociotechnical features and practices that contribute to contestable AI, and synthesize these into a design framework.

AB This paper presents the results of our experiments in the monolingual English, Spanish and Portuguese tasks and the Bilingual Spanish --> English, Spanish --> Portuguese, English --> Spanish and Portuguese --> Spanish tasks. We used the Terrier Information Retrieval Platform to run experiments for both tasks using the Inverse Document Frequency model with Laplace after-effect and normalization 2. Experiments included topics processed automatically as well as topics processed manually. Manual processing of topics was carried out, using gazetteers. For the bilingual task we developed a component based on the transfer approach in machine translation. Topics were pre-processed automatically to eliminate stopwords. Then topics in the source language were translated to the target language. Evaluation of results show that the approach worked well in general, but applying more natural language processing techniques would improve retrieval performance.

TI Constructing boosting algorithms from SVMs: An application to one-class
   classification
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB We show via an equivalence of mathematical programs that a support vector (SV) algorithm can be translated into an equivalent boosting-like algorithm and vice versa. We exemplify this translation procedure for a new algorithm-one-class leveraging-starting from the one-class support vector machine (1-SVIM). This is a first step toward unsupervised learning in a boosting framework. Building on so-called barrier methods known from the theory of constrained optimization, it returns a function, written as a convex combination of base hypotheses, that characterizes whether a given test point is likely to have been generated from the distribution underlying the training data. Simulations on one-class classification problems demonstrate the usefulness of our approach.

AB In multilingual communities, code-switching is a common phenomenon. Due to the increase in usage of social media, high level of code-switching is present in social media text as well. These code-switched social media texts are often seen written in monolingual script. Text normalization techniques of the conventional Text-to-Speech (TTS) and machine translation systems may not be able to handle such code-switched texts. Malayalam is a low resource Indic language. Conversational Malayalam contains high level of intersentential, intra-sentential as well as intra-word code-switching with English. This paper specifies the techniques for handling Malayalam-English code-switched text data. Evaluation results of experiments conducted on Malayalam-English code-switched data is also presented.

AB Recently, mT5 - a massively multilingual version of T5 - leveraged a unified text-to-text format to attain state-of-the-art results on a wide variety of multilingual NLP tasks. In this paper, we investigate the impact of incorporating parallel data into mT5 pre-training. We find that multi-tasking language modeling with objectives such as machine translation during pretraining is a straightforward way to improve performance on downstream multilingual and cross-lingual tasks. However, the gains start to diminish as the model capacity increases, suggesting that parallel data might not be as essential for larger models. At the same time, even at larger model sizes, we find that pre-training with parallel data still provides benefits in the limited labelled data regime.

TI Grammar rules for the isiZulu complex verb
SO SOUTHERN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS AND APPLIED LANGUAGE STUDIES
AB The isiZulu verb is known for its morphological complexity, which is a subject of on-going linguistics research, as well as for prospects of computational use, such as controlled natural language interfaces, machine translation and spellcheckers. To this end, we seek to answer the question as to what the precise grammar rules for the isiZulu complex verb are (and, by extension, the Bantu verb morphology). To this end, we iteratively specify the grammar as a Context-Free Grammar, and evaluate it computationally. The grammar presented in this paper covers the subject and object concords, negation, present tense, aspect, mood, and the causative, applicative, stative, and the reciprocal verbal extensions, politeness, the wh-question modifiers, and aspect doubling, ensuring their correct order as they appear in verbs. The grammar conforms to specification.

AB Collocation is the combination of words in which words appear together more often than by chance. Since collocations are blocks of meaning, they play an important role in natural language processing applications (word sense disambiguation, part of speech tagging, machine translation, etc). In this study, a corpus of Turkish is subjected to the following statistical techniques: frequency of occurrence, mutual information and hypothesis tests. We have utilized both stemmed and surface form of corpus to explore the effect of stemming in collocation extraction. The techniques are evaluated by recall and precision measures. Chi-square hypothesis test and mutual information methods have produced better results compared to other methods on Turkish corpus. In addition, we have found that a stemmed corpus facilitates discrimination between successful and unsuccessful collocation extraction methods.

AB We describe an approach to creating a small but diverse corpus in English that can be used to elicit information about any target language. The focus of the corpus is on structural information. The resulting bilingual corpus can then be used for natural language processing tasks such as inferring transfer mappings for Machine Translation. The corpus is sufficiently small that a bilingual user can translate and word-align it within a matter of hours. We describe how the corpus is created and how its structural diversity is ensured. We then argue that it is not necessary to introduce a large amount of redundancy into the corpus. This is shown by creating an increasingly redundant corpus and observing that the information gained converges as redundancy increases.

AB We introduce Picturebook, a large-scale lookup operation to ground language via `snapshots' of our physical world accessed through image search. For each word in a vocabulary, we extract the top-k images from Google image search and feed the images through a convolutional network to extract a word embedding. We introduce a multimodal gating function to fuse our Picturebook embeddings with other word representations. We also introduce Inverse Picturebook, a mechanism to map a Picturebook embedding back into words. We experiment and report results across a wide range of tasks: word similarity, natural language inference, semantic relatedness, sentiment/topic classification, image-sentence ranking and machine translation. We also show that gate activations corresponding to Picturebook embeddings are highly correlated to human judgments of concreteness ratings.

AB Natural Language Processing deals with the understanding and generation of texts through computer programs. There are many different functionalities used in this area, but among them there are some functions that are the support of the remaining ones. These methods are related to the core processing of the morphology of the language (such as lemmatization) and automatic identification of the part-of-speech tag. Thereby, this paper describes the implementation of a basic NLP toolkit for a new language, focusing in the features mentioned before, and testing them in an own corpus built for the occasion. The obtained results exceeded the expected results and could be used for more complex tasks such as machine translation.

AB Fast local and global motion estimation (ME) is crucial for a wide variety of different video processing applications, but poses significant requirements on CPU resources. Interestingly, application scenarios shift more and more from traditional PC processing to embedded devices, mostly driven by home automation, machine vision and autonomous navigation. In this paper, we demonstrate how to use DSP capabilities on embedded ARM-based OMAP Systems-On-Chip (SoCs) to provide motion analysis up to HD at speeds of 1530 fps. We show how to acquire reliable classification of motion types like zoom, rotation or translation, and how to calculate and decompose the so-called homography matrix for further refinement. Our focus lies on navigation sequences from automotive test scenarios, but we also demonstrate the accuracy of the approach on natural video sequences.

AB Bi-text alignment is useful to many Natural Language Processing tasks such as machine translation, bilingual lexicography and word sense disambiguation. This paper presents a Chinese-Japanese alignment at the level of clause. After describing some characteristics in Chinese-Japanese bilingual texts, we first investigate some statistical properties of Chinese-Japanese bilingual corpus, including the correlation test of text lengths between two languages and the distribution test of length ratio data. We then pay more attention to n-m(n>1 or m>1) alignment modes which are prone to mismatch. We propose a similarity measure based on Hanzi characters information for these kinds of alignment modes. By using dynamic programming, we combine statistical information and Hanzi character information to find the overall least cost in aligning. Experiments show our algorithm can achieve good alignment accuracy.

AB In general, wavelet transform method is usually used to decomposed an arbitrary function into its basic unit and the coefficients of the wavelet transform are obtained by dilation and translation of its basic unit known as the mother wavelet. A wavelet transform can indicate local transient-oscillation of a signal at a particular point, which is typical in a defective machine component such as the rolling element bearing. In this paper the application of wavelet transform method to diagnose the kind of defect present in a rolling element bearing is presented. The signature of defective bearing signals are captured using wavelet transform method and further analysis are carried out to determine the types of defect present in the bearing such as the rolling element defect, outer race defect or the inner race defect.

TI Design and Development of a Large Cross-Lingual Plagiarism Corpus for
   Urdu-English Language Pair
SO SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
AB Cross-lingual plagiarism occurs when the source (or original) text(s) is in one language and the plagiarized text is in another language. In recent years, cross-lingual plagiarism detection has attracted the attention of the research community because a large amount of digital text is easily accessible in many languages through online digital repositories and machine translation systems are readily available, making it easier to perform cross-lingual plagiarism and harder to detect it. To develop and evaluate cross-lingual plagiarism detection systems, standard evaluation resources are needed. The majority of earlier studies have developed cross-lingual plagiarism corpora for English and other European language pairs. However, for Urdu-English language pair, the problem of cross-lingual plagiarism detection has not been thoroughly explored although a large amount of digital text is readily available in Urdu and it is spoken in many countries of the world (particularly in Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh). To fulfill this gap, this paper presents a large benchmark cross-lingual corpus for Urdu-English language pair. The proposed corpus contains 2,395 source-suspicious document pairs (540 are automatic translation, 539 are artificially paraphrased, 508 are manually paraphrased, and 808 are nonplagiarized). Furthermore, our proposed corpus contains three types of cross-lingual examples including artificial (automatic translation and artificially paraphrased), simulated (manually paraphrased), and real (nonplagiarized), which have not been previously reported in the development of cross-lingual corpora. Detailed analysis of our proposed corpus was carried out using n-gram overlap and longest common subsequence approaches. Using Word unigrams, mean similarity scores of 1.00, 0.68, 0.52, and 0.22 were obtained for automatic translation, artificially paraphrased, manually paraphrased, and nonplagiarized documents, respectively. These results show that documents in the proposed corpus are created using different obfuscation techniques, which makes the dataset more realistic and challenging. We believe that the corpus developed in this study will help to foster research in an underresourced language of Urdu and will be useful in the development, comparison, and evaluation of cross-lingual plagiarism detection systems for Urdu-English language pair. Our proposed corpus is free and publicly available for research purposes.
