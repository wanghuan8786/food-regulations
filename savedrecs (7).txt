TI Automatic extraction of bilingual word pairs using inductive chain
   learning in various languages
SO INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT
AB In this paper, we propose a new learning method for extracting bilingual word pairs from parallel corpora in various languages. In cross-language information retrieval, the system must deal with various languages. Therefore, automatic extraction of bilingual word pairs from parallel corpora with various languages is important. However, previous works based on statistical methods are insufficient because of the sparse data problem. Our learning method automatically acquires rules, which are effective to solve the sparse data problem, only from parallel corpora without any prior preparation of a bilingual resource (e.g., a bilingual dictionary, a machine translation system). We call this learning method Inductive Chain Learning (ICL). Moreover, the system using ICL can extract bilingual word pairs even from bilingual sentence pairs for which the grammatical structures of the source language differ from the grammatical structures of the target language because the acquired rules have the information to cope with the different word orders of source language and target language in local parts of bilingual sentence pairs. Evaluation experiments demonstrated that the recalls of systems based on several statistical approaches were improved through the use of ICL. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We investigate combinations of teacher-student training, low-precision matrix products, auto-tuning and other methods to optimize the Transformer model on GPU and CPU. By further integrating these methods with the new averaging attention networks, a recently introduced faster Transformer variant, we create a number of high-quality, high-performance models on the GPU and CPU, dominating the Pareto frontier for this shared task.

TI Does GIZA++ Make Search Errors?
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Word alignment is a critical procedure within statistical machine translation (SMT). Brown et al. (1993) have provided the most popular word alignment algorithm to date, one that has been implemented in the GIZA (Al-Onaizan et al. 1999) and GIZA++ (Och and Ney 2003) software and adopted by nearly every SMT project. In this article, we investigate whether this algorithm makes search errors when it computes Viterbi alignments, that is, whether it returns alignments that are sub-optimal according to a trained model.

AB Word similarity plays an important role on fields of machine translation, semantic disambiguation, information retrieval and others. Singular value decomposition (SVD) is proposed to measure the Chinese words similarity so as to compensate for the data sparseness by vector space model (VSM). Firstly, the thesaurus is used to build the generation templates which represent the relationships between words. Word similarity scores are gotten by calculating the angle cosine between vectors. Experimental results that our accuracy is improved by 5% than traditional VSM.

AB Capturing behavior of malware is one of the essential prerequisites for dynamic malware analysis. In this paper, we study and design a system called Osiris, which makes use of virtual machine technique to capture malware behavior. In particularly, we monitor Windows API calls invoked by the process under analysis (or target program) to rebuild its behaviors. The monitor is implemented at the virtual machine manager layer rather than inside the Guest OS, which is an innovation compared to other available methods. Qemu, an open-source system emulator, is used as the emulator component of Osiris. By modifying Qemu's translation process, an API analysis framework is inserted to intercept API calls. Besides this, Osiris also collects security relevant OS kernel data directly from virtual memory for further analysis. Osiris has advantages over previous systems in that it requires no complex analysis environment and does not interfere the execution of target programs. It overcomes the deficiencies previous ones employed that the information collected is incomplete and imprecise. These features make Osiris an ideal tool for automatic malware analysis. It can provide fine data for behavior-based malware detection.

AB While various neural machine translation (NMT) methods have integrated mono-lingual syntax knowledge into the linguistic representation of sequence-to-sequence, no research is available on aligning the syntactic structures of target language with the corresponding source language syntactic structures. This work shows the first attempt of a source-target bilingual syntactic alignment approach SyntAligner by mutual information maximization-based self-supervised neural deep modeling. Building on the word alignment for NMT, our SyntAligner firstly aligns the syntactic structures of source and target sentences and then maximizes their mutual dependency by introducing a lower bound on their mutual information. In SyntAligner, the syntactic structure of span granularity is represented by transforming source or target word hidden state into a source or target syntactic span vector. A border-sensitive span attention mechanism then captures the correlation between the source and target syntactic span vectors, which also captures the self-attention between span border-words as alignment bias. Lastly, a self-supervised bilingual syntactic mutual information maximization-based learning objective dynamically samples the aligned syntactic spans to maximize their mutual dependency. Experiment results on three typical NMT tasks: WMT'14 English -> German, IWSLT' 14 German -> English, and NC' 11 English -> French show the SyntAligner effectiveness and universality of syntactic alignment.

The purpose of AMIS is to answer the following question: How to make the information in a foreign language accessible for everyone? This issue is not limited to translate a source video into a target language video since the objective is to provide only the main idea of an Arabic video in English. This objective necessitates developing research in several areas that are not, all arrived at a maturity state: Video summarization, Speech recognition, Machine translation, Audio summarization and Speech segmentation. In this article we present several possible architectures to achieve our objective, yet we focus on only one of them. The scientific locks are be presented, and we explain how to deal with them. One of the big challenges of this work is to conceive a way to evaluate objectively a system composed of several components knowing that each of them has its limits and can propagate errors through the first component. Also, a subjective evaluation procedure is proposed in which several annotators have been mobilized to test the quality of the achieved summaries.

TI Trajectories of the ribosome as a Brownian nanomachine
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB A Brownian machine, a tiny device buffeted by the random motions of molecules in the environment, is capable of exploiting these thermal motions for many of the conformational changes in its work cycle. Such machines are now thought to be ubiquitous, with the ribosome, a molecular machine responsible for protein synthesis, increasingly regarded as prototypical. Here we present a new analytical approach capable of determining the free-energy landscape and the continuous trajectories of molecular machines from a large number of snapshots obtained by cryogenic electron microscopy. We demonstrate this approach in the context of experimental cryogenic electron microscope images of a large ensemble of nontranslating ribosomes purified from yeast cells. The free-energy landscape is seen to contain a closed path of low energy, along which the ribosome exhibits conformational changes known to be associated with the elongation cycle. Our approach allows model-free quantitative analysis of the degrees of freedom and the energy landscape underlying continuous conformational changes in nanomachines, including those important for biological function.

TI Reinforced Transformer with Cross-Lingual Distillation for Cross-Lingual
   Aspect Sentiment Classification
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Though great progress has been made in the Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis(ABSA) task through research, most of the previous work focuses on English-based ABSA problems, and there are few efforts on other languages mainly due to the lack of training data. In this paper, we propose an approach for performing a Cross-Lingual Aspect Sentiment Classification (CLASC) task which leverages the rich resources in one language (source language) for aspect sentiment classification in a under-resourced language (target language). Specifically, we first build a bilingual lexicon for domain-specific training data to translate the aspect category annotated in the source-language corpus and then translate sentences from the source language to the target language via Machine Translation (MT) tools. However, most MT systems are general-purpose, it non-avoidably introduces translation ambiguities which would degrade the performance of CLASC. In this context, we propose a novel approach called Reinforced Transformer with Cross-Lingual Distillation (RTCLD) combined with target-sensitive adversarial learning to minimize the undesirable effects of translation ambiguities in sentence translation. We conduct experiments on different language combinations, treating English as the source language and Chinese, Russian, and Spanish as target languages. The experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on different target languages.

TI Dwell-Time Distribution, Long Pausing and Arrest of Single-Ribosome
   Translation through the mRNA Duplex
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Proteins in the cell are synthesized by a ribosome translating the genetic information encoded on the single-stranded messenger RNA (mRNA). It has been shown that the ribosome can also translate through the duplex region of the mRNA by unwinding the duplex. Here, based on our proposed model of the ribosome translation through the mRNA duplex we study theoretically the distribution of dwell times of the ribosome translation through the mRNA duplex under the effect of a pulling force externally applied to the ends of the mRNA to unzip the duplex. We provide quantitative explanations of the available single molecule experimental data on the distribution of dwell times with both short and long durations, on rescuing of the long paused ribosomes by raising the pulling force to unzip the duplex, on translational arrests induced by the mRNA duplex and Shine-Dalgarno(SD)-like sequence in the mRNA. The functional consequences of the pauses or arrests caused by the mRNA duplex and the SD sequence are discussed and compared with those obtained from other types of pausing, such as those induced by hungry codons or interactions of specific sequences in the nascent chain with the ribosomal exit tunnel.

AB Sentence similarity measures have applications in several tasks, including: Machine Translation, Paraphrase Identification, Speech Recognition, Question-answering and Text Summarization. However, measures designed for these tasks are aimed at assessing equivalence rather than resemblance, partly departing from human cognition of similarity. While this is reasonable for these activities, it hinders the applicability of sentence similarity measures to other tasks. We therefore propose a new sentence similarity measure specifically designed for resemblance evaluation, in order to cover these fields better. Experimental results are discussed.

TI Taking the Temperature on Machine Perfusion
SO CURRENT TRANSPLANTATION REPORTS
AB Purpose of Review Advances in machine perfusion technology have significantly improved organ utilization. However, consensus regarding the best dynamic preservation modality remains elusive. In this report, we evaluate recent results of clinical studies for different perfusion modalities and review new avenues of basic science aimed at organ rehabilitation. Recent Findings Randomized clinical trials of normothermic and hypothermic perfusion for liver preservation have demonstrated excellent patient and graft survival. Additional strategies that combine multiple preservation modalities show promise in maximizing utilization of severely injured grafts. Studies of machine perfusion with adjunct therapeutics for organ rehabilitation are being actively explored in the pre-clinical setting with potential for rapid translation into clinical trials. As machine perfusion becomes more widely incorporated into routine clinical use, graft utilization and transplant outcomes are likely to further improve. Logistics considerations that expand the use of this technology while minimizing costs will foster its broader adoption. Therapeutic strategies that aim to rehabilitate untransplantable grafts have the potential to greatly expand the pool of donor organs for transplantation, thereby easing the organ shortage.

AB In this paper we describe an approach for inferring the body posture using a 3D visual-hull constructed from a set of silhouettes. We introduce an appearance-based, view-independent, 3D shape description for classifying and identifying human posture using a support vector machine. The proposed global shape description is invariant to rotation, scale and translation and varies continuously with 3D shape variations. This shape representation is used for training a support vector machine allowing the characterization of human body postures from the computed visual hull. The main advantage of the shape description is its ability to capture human shape variation allowing the identification of body postures across multiple people. The proposed method is illustrated on a set of video streams of body postures captured by four synchronous cameras.

When shipping products, it is mandatory to specify a HS code for the purpose of producing a custom declaration. Currently the process is mostly carried out by human experts who take a decision on the HS code to be assigned to a shipment depending on the item description provided by the shipper. As such the process is time consuming and prone to errors due to generic, incomplete or non-interpretable descriptions. The objective of this research is to automate the classification of HS codes in order to increase productivity to cope with extra volume in the custom classification area. For the purpose of testing the developed models, we used an anonymized data set of shipments provided by DHL. The main contribution of this paper is we applied a deep learning model which have not been tried on tackling the HS code classification problem: an attention-based neural machine translation (NMT) model with integration of hierarchical loss. The model can classify around 29% percentage of the dataset where the model's accuracy can reach 85%.

AB This paper proposes a novel method for generating compact answers to open-domain why-questions, such as the following answer, "Because deep learning technologies were introducer to the question, "Why did Google's machine translation service improve so drastically'?" Although many works have dealt with why-question answering, most have focused on retrieving as answers relatively long text passages that consist of several sentences. Because of their length, such passages are not appropriate to be read aloud by spoken dialog systems and smart speakers; hence, we need to create a method that generates compact answers. We developed a novel neural summarizer for this compact answer generation task, It combines a recurrent neural network-based encoder decoder model with stacked convolutional neural networks and was designed to effectively exploit background knowledge, in this case a set of causal relations (e.g., "[Microsoft's machine translation has made great progress over the last few years](effect) since [it started to use deep learning.](cause)") that was extracted from a large web data archive (4 billion web pages). Our experimental results show that our method achieved significantly better ROUGE F-scores than existing encoder-decoder models and their variations that were augmented with query-attention and memory networks, which are used to exploit the background knowledge.

AB The discrepancy between maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and task measures such as BLEU score has been studied before for autoregressive neural machine translation (NMT) and resulted in alternative training algorithms (Ranzato et al., 2016; Norouzi et al., 2016; Shen et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2018). However, MLE training remains the de facto approach for autoregressive NMT because of its computational efficiency and stability. Despite this mismatch between the training objective and task measure, we notice that the samples drawn from an MLE-based trained NMT support the desired distribution - there are samples with much higher BLEU score comparing to the beam decoding output. To benefit from this observation, we train an energy-based model to mimic the behavior of the task measure (i.e., the energy-based model assigns lower energy to samples with higher BLEU score), which is resulted in a re-ranking algorithm based on the samples drawn from NMT: energy-based re-ranking (EBR). We use both marginal energy models (over target sentence) and joint energy models (over both source and target sentences). Our EBR with the joint energy model consistently improves the performance of the Transformer-based NMT: +3.7 BLEU points on IWSLT'14 German-English, +3.37 BELU points on Sinhala-English, +1.4 BLEU points on WMT'16 English-German tasks.

AB There are many kinds of so-called irregular expressions in natural dialogues. Even if the content of a conversation is the same in words, different meanings can be interpreted by a person's feeling or face expression. To have a good understanding of dialogues, it is required in a. flexible dialogue processing system to infer the speaker's view properly. However. it is difficult to obtain the meaning of the speaker's sentences in various scenes using traditional methods. In this paper, a new approach for dialogue processing that incorporates information from the speaker's face is presented. We first divide conversation statements into several simple tasks. Second, we process each simple task using an independent processor. Third, we employ some speaker's face information to estimate the view of the speakers to solve ambiguities in dialogues. The approach presented in this paper can work efficiently, because independent processors run in parallel, writing partial results to a shared memory, incorporating partial results at appropriate points, and complementing each other. A parallel algorithm and a method for employing the face information in a dialogue machine translation will be discussed, and some results will be included in this paper.

TI Multilingual Videos for MOOCs and OER
SO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY
AB Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and Open Educational Resources (OER) are rapidly growing, but are not usually offered in multiple languages due to the lack of cost-effective solutions to translate the different objects comprising them and particularly videos. However, current state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) techniques have reached a level of maturity which opens the possibility of producing multilingual video subtitles of publishable quality at low cost. This work summarizes authors' experience in exploring this possibility in two real-life case studies: a MOOC platform and a large video lecture repository. Apart from describing the systems, tools and integration components employed for such purpose, a comprehensive evaluation of the results achieved is provided in terms of quality and efficiency. More precisely, it is shown that draft multilingual subtitles produced by domainadapted ASR/MT systems reach a level of accuracy that make them worth post-editing, instead of generating them ex novo, saving approximately 25%-75% of the time. Finally, the results reported on user multilingual data consumption reflect that multilingual subtitles have had a very positive impact in our case studies boosting student enrolment, in the case of the MOOC platform, by 70% relative.

TI Integrating natural language processing with image document analysis:
   what we learned from two real-world applications
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON DOCUMENT ANALYSIS AND RECOGNITION
AB Automatically accessing information from unconstrained image documents has important applications in business and government operations. These real-world applications typically combine optical character recognition (OCR) with language and information technologies, such as machine translation (MT) and keyword spotting. OCR output has errors and presents unique challenges to late-stage processing. This paper addresses two of these challenges: (1) translating the output from Arabic handwriting OCR which lacks reliable sentence boundary markers, and (2) searching named entities which do not exist in the OCR vocabulary, therefore, completely missing from Arabic handwriting OCR output. We address these challenges by leveraging natural language processing technologies, specifically conditional random field-based sentence boundary detection and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) name detection. This approach significantly improves our state-of-the-art MT system and achieves MT scores close to that achieved by human segmentation. The output from OOV name detection was used as a novel feature for discriminative reranking, which significantly reduced the false alarm rate of OOV name search on OCR output. Our experiments also show substantial performance gains from integrating a variety of features from multiple resources, such as linguistic analysis, image layout analysis, and image text recognition.

The effective LIBS spectral data (190-720 nm) of fifteen tea samples are collected, and the spectra are preprocessed by window translation smoothing and peak shift function correction. Combined with principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction, the recognition rate of green tea, black tea and white tea is 98.3%. Different varieties of tea in the same species also achieve good recognition. The research results show that LIBS has a good prospect in the rapid identification of tea varieties.

AB Predicting the next activity of a running execution trace of a business process represents a challenging task in process mining. The problem has been already tackled by using different machine learning approaches. Among them, deep artificial neural networks architectures suited for sequential data, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), recently achieved the state of the art results. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures can outperform RNNs on tasks for sequence modeling, such as machine translation. In this paper we investigate the use of stacked inception CNN modules for the next-activity prediction problem. The proposed neural network architecture leads to better results when compared to RNNs architectures both in terms of computational efficiency and prediction accuracy on different real-world datasets.

AB Computer recognition of American Sign Language (ASL) is a computationally intensive task. This research investigates transcription of static ASL signs on a consumer-level mobile device. The application provides real-time sign to text translation by processing a live video stream to detect the ASL alphabet as well as custom signs to perform tasks on the device. The chosen classification algorithm uses Locality Preserving Projections (LPP) as manifold learning along with Support Vector Machine (SVM) multi-class classification. The algorithm is contrasted with and without cloud assistance. In comparison to the local mobile application, the cloud-assisted application increased classification speed, reduced memory usage, and kept the network usage low while barely increasing the power required.

AB We study the class of binary coded versions of unary languages that can be accepted by alternating machines with log log n space. We show that there exists a binary PSPACE-complete language L such that the unary coded version of L is in ASPACE(log log n). Consequently, the standard translation between unary languages accepted with log log n space and binary languages accepted with log n space works for alternating machines if and only if P = PSPACE. In general, if a binary language is accepted deterministically in 2(n).n(O(1)) time and, simultaneously, in n(O(1)) space-which covers many PSPACE-complete problems-then its unary coded version is accepted by an alternating Turing machine using an initially delimited worktape of size log log n. This unexpected power follows from the fact that, with an auxiliary worktape of size O(log log n) on a unary input 1(n), an alternating machine can simulate a stack with log n bits, representing the contents of the stack by its input head position. The standard push/pop operations on the stack are implemented by moving the head along the input.

TI Bi-view semi-supervised active learning for cross-lingual sentiment
   classification
SO INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT
AB Recently, sentiment classification has received considerable attention within the natural language processing research community. However, since most recent works regarding sentiment classification have been done in the English language, there are accordingly not enough sentiment resources in other languages. Manual construction of reliable sentiment resources is a very difficult and time-consuming task. Cross-lingual sentiment classification aims to utilize annotated sentiment resources in one language (typically English) for sentiment classification of text documents in another language. Most existing research works rely on automatic machine translation services to directly project information from one language to another. However, different term distribution between original and translated text documents and translation errors are two main problems faced in the case of using only machine translation. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel learning model based on active learning and semi-supervised co-training to incorporate unlabelled data from the target language into the learning process in a bi-view framework. This model attempts to enrich training data by adding the most confident automatically-labelled examples, as well as a few of the most informative manually-labelled examples from unlabelled data in an iterative process. Further, in this model, we consider the density of unlabelled data so as to select more representative unlabelled examples in order to avoid outlier selection in active learning. The proposed model was applied to book review datasets in three different languages. Experiments showed that our model can effectively improve the cross-lingual sentiment classification performance and reduce labelling efforts in comparison with some baseline methods.

TI Use of Modality and Negation in Semantically-Informed Syntactic MT
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB This article describes the resource- and system-building efforts of an 8-week Johns Hopkins University Human Language Technology Center of Excellence Summer Camp for Applied Language Exploration (SCALE-2009) on Semantically Informed Machine Translation (SIMT). We describe a new modality/negation (MN) annotation scheme, the creation of a (publicly available) MN lexicon, and two automated MN taggers that we built using the annotation scheme and lexicon. Our annotation scheme isolates three components of modality and negation: a trigger (a word that conveys modality or negation), a target (an action associated with modality or negation), and a holder (an experiencer of modality). We describe how our MN lexicon was semi-automatically produced and we demonstrate that a structure-based MN tagger results in precision around 86% (depending on genre) for tagging of a standard LDC data set.
   We apply our MN annotation scheme to statistical machine translation using a syntactic framework that supports the inclusion of semantic annotations. Syntactic tags enriched with semantic annotations are assigned to parse trees in the target-language training texts through a process of tree grafting. Although the focus of our work is modality and negation, the tree grafting procedure is general and supports other types of semantic information. We exploit this capability by including named entities, produced by a pre-existing tagger, in addition to the MN elements produced by the taggers described here. The resulting system significantly outperformed a linguistically naive baseline model (Hiero), and reached the highest scores yet reported on the NIST 2009 Urdu-English test set. This finding supports the hypothesis that both syntactic and semantic information can improve translation quality.

TI Kingdom-Wide Analysis of Fungal Protein-Coding and tRNA Genes Reveals
   Conserved Patterns of Adaptive Evolution
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB Protein-coding genes evolved codon usage bias due to the combined but uneven effects of adaptive and nonadaptive influences. Studies in model fungi agree on codon usage bias as an adaptation for fine-tuning gene expression levels; however, such knowledge is lacking for most other fungi. Our comparative genomics analysis of over 450 species supports codon usage and transfer RNAs (tRNAs) as coadapted for translation speed and this is most likely a realization of convergent evolution. Rather than drift, phylogenetic reconstruction inferred adaptive radiation as the best explanation for the variation of interspecific codon usage bias. Although the phylogenetic signals for individual codon and tRNAs frequencies are lower than expected by genetic drift, we found remarkable conservation of highly expressed genes being codon optimized for translation by the most abundant tRNAs, especially by inosine-modified tRNAs. As an application, we present a sequence-to-expression neural network that uses codons to reliably predict highly expressed transcripts. The kingdom Fungi, with over a million species, includes many key players in various ecosystems and good targets for biotechnology. Collectively, our results have implications for better understanding the evolutionary success of fungi, as well as informing the biosynthetic manipulation of fungal genes.

SO JOURNAL OF HAND SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME
AB The physical attributes of 3 subregions of the lunotriquetral ligament were tested in a computer-controlled multiaxis testing machine using 12 specimens. This allowed measurement of forces, moments, and displacements when ligaments were subjected to distraction, dorsopalmar translation, proximal-distal translation with a 20 N limit, and relation with a 0.5 Nm limit. After an intact test run, selected subregions were cut randomly. Together with an additional 12 bone-ligament-bone complexes, specimens were tested to failure with servohydraulic load at 5 mm/s. The palmar subregion was thickest (2.3 +/- 0.3 mm), the dorsal and proximal progressively less. Intact rotational displacement was 35 degrees +/- 5.1 degrees, dorsopalmar displacement was 1.6 +/- 0.4 mm and 1.2 +/- 0.5 mm, respectively, proximal-distal displacement was 1.8 +/- 0.5 mm and 1.3 +/- 0.5 mm, respectively, and distractional displacement was 0.3 +/- 0.1 mm. The dorsal subregion provided 62.3% +/- 27.1% of the relational resistance. The palmar subregion resisted 67.3% +/- 14.1% of palmar translation, while with dorsal translation both regions resisted equally. Rotational displacement increased 15.3 degrees +/- 5.6 degrees after dorsal subregion sectioning. The palmar component failure force was 301 +/- 36 N; the dorsal, 121 +/- 42 N; and the proximal, 64 +/- 14 N. Copyright (C) 1998 by the American Society for Surgery of the Hand.

TI Chemical documents: machine understanding and automated information
   extraction
SO ORGANIC & BIOMOLECULAR CHEMISTRY
AB Automatically extracting chemical information from documents is a challenging task, but an essential one for dealing with the vast quantity of data that is available. The task is least difficult for structured documents, such as chemistry department web pages or the output of computational chemistry programs, but requires increasingly sophisticated approaches for less structured documents, such as chemical papers. The identification of key units of information, such as chemical names, makes the extraction of useful information from unstructured documents possible.

TI MT Evaluation in the Context of Language Complexity
SO COMPLEXITY
AB Y The paper focuses on investigating the impact of artificial agent (machine translator) on human agent (posteditor) using a proposed methodology, which is based on language complexity measures, POS tags, frequent tagsets, association rules, and their summarization. We examine this impact from the point of view of language complexity in terms of word and sentence structure. By the proposed methodology, we analyzed 24 733 tags of English to Slovak translations of technical texts, corresponding to the output of two MT systems (Google Translate and the European Commission's MT tool). We used both manual (adequacy and fluency) and semiautomatic (HTER metric) MT evaluation measures as the criteria for validity. We show that the proposed methodology is valid based on the evaluation of frequent tagsets and rules of MToutputs produced by Google Translate or of the European Commission's MTtool, and both postedited MT (PEMT) outputs using baseline methods. Our results have also shown that PEMT output produced by Google Translate is characterized by more frequent tagsets such as verbs in the infinitive with modal verbs compared to its MToutput, which is characterized by masculine, inanimate nouns in locative of singular. In the MT output, produced by the European Commission's MT tool, the most frequent tagset was verbs in the infinitive compared to its postedited MToutput, where verbs in imperative and the second person of plural occurred. These findings are also obtained from the use of the proposed methodology for MT evaluation. The contribution of the proposed methodology is an identification of systematic not random errors. Additionally, the study can also serve as information for optimizing the translation process using postediting.

AB In this paper the existing systems of translation into sign language are analyzed. There are ViSiCAST project, Zardoz system, ASL Workbench, TEAM system. Their strengths and weaknesses are identified. A new translation way based on a comparison of syntactic constructions is described. Sentences in sounding language often describe complex situations, including some simple situations (for example, a few actions). The unit, which is processed about, is a proposal for a full participle. As a result of comparison of syntactic constructions is obtained a set of simple sentences in which all participles replace verb. A corresponding library to determine the syntax construction is developed. A new method for constructing a semantic unit of the computer system of sign language is proposed. The result of semantic analysis system is a list of correspondence "word-gesture". Among the many alternatives of words based on semantic analysis algorithm, every word is assigned a unique lexical meaning. For simple sentences algorithms of semantic analysis are designed and implemented. The most priority directions of modification module semantic analysis may include the following: broadening the base of gesture, the implementation of parsing complex sentences, taking into account specifics of the Russian-language.

AB Sentence alignment plays an extremely important role in machine translation. Most of the hybrid approaches get either a bad recall or low precision. We tackle disadvantages of several novel sentence alignment approaches, which combine length-based and word correspondences. Word clustering is applied in our method in order to improve the quality of the sentence aligner, especially when dealing with the sparse data problem. Our approach overcomes the limits of previous hybrid methods and obtains both highly recall and reasonable precision rates.

AB The paper discusses a complex of solutions aimed at ambiguity resolution in the parsing component of a multipurpose NLP system, ETAP-3. The main idea is to introduce a system of priorities, or weights, dynamically produced for the elements of the text processed and of the structure generated during all parsing phases. These weights, empirically assigned to lexical entries and fragments of parsing rules, help tune the parse to the generation of an optimal syntactic structure of an ambiguous sentence.

TI Analysis of User Control Attainment in SMR-based Brain Computer
   Interfaces
SO IRBM
AB Context: Sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) have been the neuronal phenomena of choice in non-invasive EEG-based endogenous brain computer interfaces (BCIs) for more than two decades and SMR-based BCIs have achieved the highest degree of freedom control so far. Nevertheless, they are subject to long periods of training prior to attaining a satisfactory level of control requiring users to learn to modulate their rhythms. The goal of this work is to analyse this problem, discuss the causes of the slow rise in performance and provide recommendations on alternative solutions to quicken control attainment.
   Methods: The study has been conducted by both theoretical and empirical analysis. A theoretical model has been developed that explains the principle operation of SMR-based BCIs focusing on major performance contributors respectively the user, periodic feature selection and the translation model thus contrasting user adaptation and machine learning. Five able-bodied subjects (age: 26 +/- 2.55) participated in six sessions of online computer cursor control experiments over three weeks to evaluate control attainment performances and gather data for statistical analysis (similar to 1152 trials per subject). Correlation (r(2)) between user control features and target position over sessions was assessed as an estimate of neural adaptation and the predictive power of the translation algorithm (10 x 10 fold cross-validation) was calculated over sessions as an estimate of machine adaptation. Auxiliary performance metrics were evaluated.
   Results: Features-target correlation increased over sessions, while at the same time the predictive accuracy (R-2) of the translation model remained averagely steady and very low (R-best(2)= 0.04) demonstrating continuous user adaptation and low model predictive accuracy. Periodic feature selection was theoretically discussed to be very instrumental and its relevance was empirically illustrated.
   Conclusions: The study concludes that the slow control attainment in SMR-based Bas is due to its reliance on user training (neural adaptation) which is adaptive but too slow in the context of SMR modulations and due to the weak decoding of the neuronal phenomenon utilised by the user. As a recommendation, the optimality of the feature selection algorithm could be looked at to guarantee the use of the most relevant features. However and most importantly the predictive power of the translation model should be significantly improved in order to quicken control attainment as thereafter the control attainment effort could be shifted from neural adaptation to machine learning.

TI The Stone Guest. The Soviet Rediscovery of Formal Linguistics Towards
   the Early Chomsky
SO STUDI SLAVISTICI
AB After Stalin's death, Soviet linguistics seemingly steered in a new direction, enthusiastically adopting mathematical methods within the upsurge of interest in machine translation. This fostered the acceptance of formal models disjointed from the rigid dictates of dialectical materialism and paved the way for the rediscovery of the scientific legacy of (post) structuralist Euroamerican schools. In the eyes of the protagonists of this epistemological change, linguistics seemed to be freed from the traditional methodological constraints imposed by philology and literature. This short-lived yet intense period, however, is characterized by the polyphonic coexistence of several ideas and personalities, whose research activity can be properly understood and evaluated only from a broader historical perspective, encompassing both earlier and later stages, thus substantially curtailing the explanatory power of historical and thematic periodization. The study aims at examining the salient characteristics of the scientific environment surrounding the early critical reception of Noam Chomsky's Syntactic Structures in the Soviet Union. By tackling specific terminological and epistemological issues, it is argued that the evolution of Soviet linguistics was not defined by abrupt saltational processes, but rather by a constant pendular oscillation which - depending on cultural, political, and historical circumstances - would grant temporary priority to some scientific approaches and orientations at the expense of others.

TI Evaluating the impacts of hugepage on virtual machines
SO SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Modern applications often require a large amount of memory. Conventional 4KB pages lead to large page tables and thus exert high pressure on TLB address translations. This pressure is more prominent in a virtualized system, which adds an additional layer of address translation. Page walks due to TLB misses can result in a significant performance overhead. One effort in reducing this overhead is to use hugepage. Linux kernel has supported transparent hugepage since 2.6.38, which provides an alternate large page size. Generally, hugepage demonstrates better performance on address translations and page table modifications. This paper first analyzes the impact of hugepage on native system, and then, compares the impact of hugepage on different memory virtualization approaches: hardware-assisted paging (HAP), shadow paging, and para-virtualization. We observe that the current implementation of transparent hugepage is inefficient. It cannot exploit the full performance advantage of hugepages. Worse yet, the conservative strategy of transparent hugepage may conflict with existing OS functions, which can lead to performance degradation. So, we propose a new memory allocation strategy, alignment-based hugepage (ABH) that promotes hugepage allocations. We apply ABH to different paging modes in virtualized systems. The results show that the new allocation strategy can significantly reduce TLB misses and up to 90% page walk cycles due to TLB misses and thus improve the performance in real world applications.

AB Transformer networks, originally developed in the community of machine translation to eliminate sequential nature of recurrent neural networks, have shown impressive results in other natural language processing and machine vision tasks. Self-attention is the core module behind visual transformers which globally mixes the image information. This module drastically reduces the intrinsic inductive bias imposed by CNNs, such as locality, while encountering insufficient robustness against some adversarial attacks. In this paper we introduce K-sparse attention to preserve low inductive bias, while robustifying transformers against adversarial attacks. We show that standard transformers attend values with dense set of weights, while the sparse attention, automatically selected by an optimization algorithm, can preserve generalization performance of the transformer and, at the same time, improve its robustness.

AB The dominant approach to sequence generation is to produce a sequence in some predefined order, e.g. left to right. In contrast, we propose a more general model that can generate the output sequence by inserting tokens in any arbitrary order. Our model learns decoding order as a result of its training procedure. Our experiments show that this model is superior to fixed order models on a number of sequence generation tasks, such as Machine Translation, Image-to-LaTeX and Image Captioning.(1)

AB Probabilistic finite-state string transducers (FSTs) are extremely popular in natural language processing, due to powerful generic methods for applying, composing, and learning them. Unfortunately, FSTs are not a good fit for much of the current work on probabilistic modeling for machine translation, summarization, paraphrasing, and language modeling. These methods operate directly on trees, rather than strings. We show that tree acceptors and tree transducers subsume most of this work, and we discuss algorithms for realizing the same benefits found in probabilistic string transduction.

TI Artificial Intelligence in Thyroid Field-A Comprehensive Review
SO CANCERS
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) uses mathematical algorithms to perform tasks that require human cognitive abilities. AI-based methodologies, e.g., machine learning and deep learning, as well as the recently developed research field of radiomics have noticeable potential to transform medical diagnostics. AI-based techniques applied to medical imaging allow to detect biological abnormalities, to diagnostic neoplasms or to predict the response to treatment. Nonetheless, the diagnostic accuracy of these methods is still a matter of debate. In this article, we first illustrate the key concepts and workflow characteristics of machine learning, deep learning and radiomics. We outline considerations regarding data input requirements, differences among these methodologies and their limitations. Subsequently, a concise overview is presented regarding the application of AI methods to the evaluation of thyroid images. We developed a critical discussion concerning limits and open challenges that should be addressed before the translation of AI techniques to the broad clinical use. Clarification of the pitfalls of AI-based techniques results crucial in order to ensure the optimal application for each patient.

In this paper, we have proposed a framework for translating Bengali to English. Context sensitive grammar rules are created for parsing. The top-down algorithm is used for parsing the sentences. We have proposed an algorithm for translating idioms in sentences. The proposed system is implemented and tested with about 15000 sentences. The performance analysis of the system gives 85.33% accuracy, which is quite satisfactory.

AB Paraphrase detection has several important applications in natural language processing. Examples of such applications include language translation, text summarization, question answering, plagiarism detection, and online information retrieval. A number of metrics have been proposed in the literature to quantify the textual similarity between two sentences. However, the accuracy of utilizing each similarity metric alone in detecting paraphrases is very low. Though some machine learning (ML) techniques have been deployed for paraphrase detection, there is no known study that intensively benchmarks their performance on this problem under similar conditions. In this paper, we evaluate the utility of integrating five lexical similarity metrics with three standard machine learning paradigms to detect paraphrases. We apply statistical tests to compare and benchmark the relative significance of the adopted ML-based paraphrase detectors on different datasets.

The structural design has minimized the mass of the moving links and, by the combined use of FEM and multibody codes, allowed to take into consideration the high stresses coming from inertial forces and to evaluate a-priori the resulting dynamic properties. A physical prototype has just been built in order to validate the developed models and assess the actual robot performances in real operating conditions.

AB Programmers spend a substantial amount of time manually repairing code that does not compile. We observe that the repairs for any particular error class typically follow a pattern and are highly mechanical. We propose a novel approach that automatically learns these patterns with a deep neural network and suggests program repairs for the most costly classes of build-time compilation failures. We describe how we collect all build errors and the human-authored, in-progress code changes that cause those failing builds to transition to successful builds at Google. We generate an AST diff from the textual code changes and transform it into a domain-specific language called Delta that encodes the change that must be made to make the code compile. We then feed the compiler diagnostic information (as source) and the Delta changes that resolved the diagnostic (as target) into a Neural Machine Translation network for training. For the two most prevalent and costly classes of Java compilation errors, namely missing symbols and mismatched method signatures, our system called DEEPDELTA, generates the correct repair changes for 19,314 out of 38,788 (50%) of unseen compilation errors. The correct changes are in the top three suggested fixes 86% of the time on average.

TI Stage error calibration for coordinates measuring machines based on
   self-calibration algorithm
SO PRECISION ENGINEERING-JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETIES FOR
   PRECISION ENGINEERING AND NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB The stage error of coordinate measuring machines (CMM) can significantly influence the measurement results, and it places ultra-high requirement on the measurement and calibration tools. A calibration technique based on self-calibration algorithm is presented to calibrate the two-dimensional stage error of CMM, and it can be carried out with a grid plate of the accuracy no higher than test stage. With the proposed self-calibration algorithm based on least squares method, the measurements at various position combinations of rotation and translation are carried out to separate the stage error from measurement results. Both the accuracy and feasibility of the proposed calibration method have been demonstrated by computer simulation and experiments, and the measurement accuracy RMS better than 1 mu m is achieved. The proposed calibration method has a good anti-noise ability and provides a feasible way to lower the accuracy requirement on standard parts. It is of great practicality for high-accuracy calibration of the stage error of CMM and manufacturing machines in the order of submicron. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Crawl and crowd to bring machine translation to under-resourced
   languages
SO LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
AB We present a widely applicable methodology to bring machine translation (MT) to under-resourced languages in a cost-effective and rapid manner. Our proposal relies on web crawling to automatically acquire parallel data to train statistical MT systems if any such data can be found for the language pair and domain of interest. If that is not the case, we resort to (1) crowdsourcing to translate small amounts of text (hundreds of sentences), which are then used to tune statistical MT models, and (2) web crawling of vast amounts of monolingual data (millions of sentences), which are then used to build language models for MT. We apply these to two respective use-cases for Croatian, an under-resourced language that has gained relevance since it recently attained official status in the European Union. The first use-case regards tourism, given the importance of this sector to Croatia's economy, while the second has to do with tweets, due to the growing importance of social media. For tourism, we crawl parallel data from 20 web domains using two state-of-the-art crawlers and explore how to combine the crawled data with bigger amounts of general-domain data. Our domain-adapted system is evaluated on a set of three additional tourism web domains and it outperforms the baseline in terms of automatic metrics and/or vocabulary coverage. In the social media use-case, we deal with tweets from the 2014 edition of the soccer World Cup. We build domain-adapted systems by (1) translating small amounts of tweets to be used for tuning by means of crowdsourcing and (2) crawling vast amounts of monolingual tweets. These systems outperform the baseline (Microsoft Bing) by 7.94 BLEU points (5.11 TER) for Croatian-to-English and by 2.17 points (1.94 TER) for English-to-Croatian on a test set translated by means of crowdsourcing. A complementary manual analysis sheds further light on these results.

AB Non-autoregressive translation (NAT) achieves faster inference speed but at the cost of worse accuracy compared with autoregressive translation (AT). Since AT and NAT can share model structure and AT is an easier task than NAT due to the explicit dependency on previous target-side tokens, a natural idea is to gradually shift the model training from the easier AT task to the harder NAT task. To smooth the shift from AT training to NAT training, in this paper, we introduce semi-autoregressive translation (SAT) as intermediate tasks. SAT contains a hyperparameter k, and each k value defines a SAT task with different degrees of parallelism. Specially, SAT covers AT and NAT as its special cases: it reduces to AT when k = 1 and to NAT when k = N (N is the length of target sentence). We design curriculum schedules to gradually shift k from 1 to N, with different pacing functions and number of tasks trained at the same time. We called our method as task-level curriculum learning for NAT (TCL-NAT). Experiments on IWSLT14 De-En, IWSLT16 En-De, WMT14 En-De and De-En datasets show that TCL-NAT achieves significant accuracy improvements over previous NAT baselines and reduces the performance gap between NAT and AT models to 1-2 BLEU points, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method.

TI Comparison of canine stifle kinematic analysis after two types of total
   knee arthroplasty: A cadaveric study
SO VETERINARY WORLD
AB Background and Aim: Osteoarthritis is a common consequence of cranial cruciate ligament rupture (CCLR) in the canine stifle. Total knee replacement is a valuable method for managing end-stage osteoarthritis.
   Materials and Methods: Two new designs of total knee replacement implants were fabricated with information from computed tomography scans. Canine hind limbs of cadavers were tested with a biomechanical testing machine with C-arm fluoroscopy. The four groups tested were as follows: Intact stifles (INTACT), CCLR, total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with a peg on top of the tibial component (TKAP), and TKA with no peg on top of the tibial component (TKAN). Extension, flexion, adduction, abduction, internal rotation, external rotation, cranial translation, caudal translation, and range of motion were measured.
   Results: The cranial translation of the tibia relative to the femur increased significantly after cutting off the cranial cruciate ligament. After arthroplasty, adduction/abduction and cranial/caudal translation within the TKAN group was increased compared with the intact stifle group. In the TKAP group, only adduction was greater than it was in the intact stifle group.
   Conclusion: The design of the prosthesis used for the TKAP group was more appropriate for total knee replacement in dogs than the design of the prosthesis for the TKAN group.

However, to this date, there are no large-scale question-answer corpora available. In this paper we present the 30M Factoid Question-Answer Corpus, an enormous question-answer pair corpus produced by applying a novel neural network architecture on the knowledge base Freebase to transduce facts into natural language questions. The produced question-answer pairs are evaluated both by human evaluators and using automatic evaluation metrics, including well-established machine translation and sentence similarity metrics. Across all evaluation criteria the question-generation model outperforms the competing template-based baseline. Furthermore, when presented to human evaluators, the generated questions appear to be comparable in quality to real human-generated questions.

The major design parameters which affect aerostatic bearing performance are discussed. The supply pressure ratio and hence, the bearing clearance and the type and specific size of inlet flow control device are shown to require special consideration. Specific information on the tolerance of each of the parameters which have a direct effect on the nano-precision location of these bearings is given. In addition the paper addresses the manufacturing tolerances and manufacturing variations which can occur in practice and places limits on the magnitude that these sources of errors can contribute to the permissible manufacturing variations.

AB Deploying accurate machine learning algorithms into a high-throughput networking environment is a challenging task. On the one hand, machine learning has proved itself useful for traffic classification in many contexts (e.g., intrusion detection, application classification, and early heavy hitter identification). On the other hand, most of the work in the area is related to post-processing (i.e., training and testing are performed offline on previously collected samples) or to scenarios where the traffic has to leave the data plane to be classified (i.e., high latency). In this work, we tackle the problem of creating simple and reasonably accurate machine learning models that can be deployed into the data plane in a way that performance degradation is acceptable. To that purpose, we introduce a framework and discuss issues related to the translation of simple models, for handling individual packets or flows, into the P4 language. We validate our framework with an intrusion detection use case and by deploying a single decision tree into a Netronome SmartNIC (Agilio CX 2x10GbE). Our results show that high-accuracy is achievable (above 95%) with minor performance degradation, even for a large number of flows.

AB Word sense disambiguation is one of the key tasks of text processing. It consists in the determination of senses of words or compound terms in accordance with the context where they were used. The word sense disambiguation problem originated in the 1950s as a subtask of machine translation. Since then, the great number of methods of its solution has been developed; however, none of them may be viewed as a perfect one. The paper is a survey of most well-known studies in this field.

SO ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES
AB Code Selection in translation has been effectively abstracted out in terms of tree rewriting or pattern matching based approaches. However, modelling register files in an architecture independent way is a problem which is bypassed in most available algorithms. Architectural parameterization is frequently just code selector generation while architectural registers and operand constraints are handled in a machine-specific way. To partially address this issue, we present an abstraction for register allocation and assignment in non-uniform register file architectures in terms of bipartite graph matching.

TI Linear and angular feedrate interpolation for planar implicit curves
SO COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN
AB In multi-axis CNC machining, a cutting tool combines translation and rotational movements with respect to a workpiece. This entails CNC interpolation to take angular feedrates defining the speed of the rotational movement into account, while current interpolations are overwhelmingly based on linear feedrates defining the speed of the translation movement. This paper considers linear and angular feedrate interpolations of 2D tool paths for multi-axis machining. A 2D tool path is identified by a position curve assumed to be a 2D implicit curve and a tool orientation curve based on the implicit curve. The paper will relate the angular feedrate to the linear feedrate along the tool paths. The result is then used to develop the angular feedrate interpolation from the linear feedrate interpolation. Detailed interpolation schemes for such hybrid feedrates as a constant linear feedrate with constrained angular feedrate (CLCA) and a constant angular feedrate with constrained linear feedrate (CACL) have further been constructed. A corrected interpolation scheme is further present to augment the initial interpolation. Example interpolations including a quadric curve, the nodal cubic and a quartic curve are carried out to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TI IPvest: Clustering the IP Traffic of Network Entities Hidden Behind a
   Single IP Address Using Machine Learning
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK AND SERVICE MANAGEMENT
AB IP Networks serve a variety of connected network entities (NEs) such as personal computers, servers, mobile devices, virtual machines, hosted containers, etc. The growth in the number of NEs and technical considerations has led to a reality where a single IP address is used by multiple NEs. A typical example is a home router using Network Address Translation (NAT). In organizations and cloud environments, a single IP can be used by multiple virtual machines or containers running on a single device. Discovering the number of NEs served by an IP address and clustering their traffic correctly is of value in many use cases for security, lawful interception, asset management, and other purposes. In this paper, we introduce IPvest, a system that incorporates unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms based on various features for counting and clustering network traffic of NEs masqueraded by a single IP. The features are based on the characteristics of operating systems (OSs), NAT behavior, and users' habits. Our model is evaluated on real-world datasets including Windows, Linux-based, Android, and iOS-based devices, containers, virtual machines, and load-balancers. We show that IPvest can count the number of NEs and cluster their traffic with high precision, even for containers running on a single device and servers behind a load-balancer.

SO APPLIED CATEGORICAL STRUCTURES
AB A categorical framework for modeling and analyzing systems in a broad sense is proposed. These systems should be thought of as 'machines' with inputs and outputs, carrying some sort of signal that occurs through some notion of time. Special cases include continuous and discrete dynamical systems (e.g. Moore machines). Additionally, morphisms between the different types of systems allow their translation in a common framework. A central goal is to understand the systems that result from arbitrary interconnection of component subsystems, possibly of different types, as well as establish conditions that ensure totality and determinism compositionally. The fundamental categorical tools used here include lax monoidal functors, which provide a language of compositionality, as well as sheaf theory, which flexibly captures the crucial notion of time.

AB The widespread of the computer technology and the Internet lead to a massive amount of textual information being available in written Arabic. This that more is available, it becomes more difficult to extract the relevant information. To meet this challenge, many researchers are directed to the development of information retrieval systems based on syntactic and semantic parsing. In Arabic, this field is restricted by the lack of labeled datasets. Thus, it is important to build systems for part-of-speech tagging and language modeling and use their results for further syntactic and semantic parsing in fields like chunking, semantic role labeling, information extraction, named entity recognition and statistical machine translation. Deep neural networks have proved efficient in fields like imaging or acoustics and recently in natural language processing. In this study, we used the Taguchi method to find the optimal parameter combination for a deep neural network architecture. Therefore, the neural network obtained the most accurate results. The main use of the Taguchi method in our work is to help us to choose the best context which is the number of words before and after the word on which the training is made.

TI Aging effect on head motion: A Machine Learning study on resting state
   fMRI data
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS
AB Background: Resting-state-fMRI is a technique used to explore the functional brain architecture in term of brain networks and their interactions. However, the robustness of Resting-state-fMRI analysis is negatively affected by physiological noise caused by subject head motion. The aim of our study was to provide new knowledge about the effect of normal aging on the head motion signals.
   New Method: For the first time, we proposed a method for evaluating the most sensitive head motion parameters linked to subjects'aging. We enrolled 14-young(9females; mean-age = 28 +/- 4.07) and 14-elderly(9females; mean-age = 66 +/- 5.19) subjects. Along three axes(X,Y,Z), we extracted six motions parameters which reflected the head's movements to characterize translations(x,y,z) and rotations(angles phi,theta,psi). We performed:1)univariate analysis for comparing the groups and correlation to investigate the relationship between age and movement parameters; 2)Support-Vector-Machine, using bootstrap and calculating the feature importance.
   Results: Statistical analyses showed significant association between the aging and some motion's parameters (rotation psi; translations y and z). These results were also confirmed by multivariate analysis with Support Vector-Machine that presented an AUC of 90 %.
   Comparison to existing methods: The proposed method shows that normal aging produces significant increase in head motion parameters, highlighting the critical effect of motion on resting data analyses in particular considering psi, y and z movements. To our knowledge and at the present, this represents the first study investigating the accurate characterization of motion parameters in aging.
   Conclusions: Our results have a high impact to improve healthy control recruitment and appropriately decreasing the risk of signal distortion, according to the age of enrolled subjects.

AB Recently the opportunity of reading and writing in English has been greatly increasing. We focused on supporting the Japanese to write English sentence by indicating appropriate example sentences. This paper proposed a method to retrieve such target example sentences by using domain categories and keywords or directly inputting the Japanese sentence. The result of the experiment to evaluate the precision of example sentence retrieval indicated that our technique exceeded the conventional technique by more than 20%.

AB As we know deaf people present about 70 million of the person in the word. 17 million of this community is only in Arabic word. Therefore this community of person require more and more attention from researchers and precisely SLMT (Sign Language Machine Translation) researchers to be able to practice their natural right which is communication with other person. In this context the research laboratory LaTICE of the University of Tunis lunched science many years the project WebSign [1] aiming to translate automatically a written text to sign language whatever the language as input (English, French, Arabic, etc.). WebSign is a Web application. It is based on the technology of avatar (animation in virtual world). The input of the system is a text in natural language. The output is a real-time and online interpretation in sign language. This interpretation is constructed thanks to a dictionary of word and signs. The creation of this dictionary can be made in an incremental way by users who propose signs corresponding to words [2]. Our work as a part of this project aims to develop a translation module from Arabic text to Sign Language to be integrated in the WebSign project. This module offers to Arab Deaf and hearing people a tool facilitating their communication. Anyone can use this tool to translate an Arabic written text to Arabic Sign Language (ArSL). In fact in this level, it's very useful to define a transcription system for Arabic Sign Language based on Arabic Gloss. This intermediate annotation system is a textual representation of sign language that covers the different parameters of the sign with a simplified representation to avoid the complexity of understanding [3].

TI A proposed expert system for word sense disambiguation: deductive
   ambiguity resolution based on data mining and forward chaining
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS
AB One of the major issues in the process of machine translation is the problem of choosing the proper translation for a multi-sense word referred to as word sense disambiguation (WSD). Two commonly used approaches to this problem are statistical and example-based methods. In statistical methods, ambiguity resolution is mostly carried out by making use of some statistics extracted from previously translated documents or dual corpora of source and target languages. Example-based methods follow a similar approach as they also make use of bilingual corpora. However, they perform the task of matching at run-time (i.e. online matching). In this paper, by looking at the WSD problem from a different viewpoint, we propose a system, which consists of two main parts. The first part includes a data mining algorithm, which runs offline and extracts some useful knowledge about the co-occurrences of the words. In this algorithm, each sentence is imagined as a transaction in Market Basket Data Analysis problem, and the words included in a sentence play the role of purchased items. The second part of the system is an expert system whose knowledge base consists of the set of association rules generated by the first part. Moreover, in order to deduce the correct senses of the words, we introduce an efficient algorithm based on forward chaining in order to be used in the inference engine of the proposed expert system. The encouraging performance of the system in terms of precision and recall as well as its efficiency will be analysed and discussed through a set of experiments.

TI On Explainable Features for Translatorship Attribution: Unveiling the
   Translator's Style With Causality
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Translatorship attribution deals with accurately attributing a translation to its translator. The task is challenging because several factors can confound the attribution such as the original author's style, genre, and topic of the text. The attribution and the identification of the translator's style could contribute to fields including translation studies and forensic linguistics. In this paper, we pose translatorship attribution as a multiclass classification problem and employ machine learning algorithms. To address the problem of confounding, we use corpora of English translations of the same source material (parallel corpora) to identify the translators' personal style. We propose two novel feature sets in this task: i) a list of cohesive markers with and without their surrounding punctuation and ii) syntactic n-grams to capture real syntactic information. We employ chi(2) feature selection and, using 10-fold cross-validation, assess the accuracy of several classifiers trained with our proposed features and with word, punctuation, POS, and POS-punctuation n-grams. The results show that the proposed features yield comparable and even higher accuracy results than the reported in the literature on the same corpora and prove that POS-punctuation n-grams are an effective feature set for this task. We also recover the most distinctive features and provide examples of stylistic interpretations of them for each translator. Finally, using insights from causal inference, where confounding is well-defined and studied, we provide a novel explanation for the accepted need of using parallel and contemporaneous corpora on this task and for the different results among types of features.

TI An Improved Transformer-Based Neural Machine Translation Strategy:
   Interacting-Head Attention
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB Transformer-based models have gained significant advances in neural machine translation (NMT). The main component of the transformer is the multihead attention layer. In theory, more heads enhance the expressive power of the NMT model. But this is not always the case in practice. On the one hand, the computations of each head attention are conducted in the same subspace, without considering the different subspaces of all the tokens. On the other hand, the low-rank bottleneck may occur, when the number of heads surpasses a threshold. To address the low-rank bottleneck, the two mainstream methods make the head size equal to the sequence length and complicate the distribution of self-attention heads. However, these methods are challenged by the variable sequence length in the corpus and the sheer number of parameters to be learned. Therefore, this paper proposes the interacting-head attention mechanism, which induces deeper and wider interactions across the attention heads by low-dimension computations in different subspaces of all the tokens, and chooses the appropriate number of heads to avoid low-rank bottleneck. The proposed model was tested on machine translation tasks of IWSLT2016 DE-EN, WMT17 EN-DE, and WMT17 EN-CS. Compared to the original multihead attention, our model improved the performance by 2.78 BLEU/0.85 WER/2.90 METEOR/2.65 ROUGE_L/0.29 CIDEr/2.97 YiSi and 2.43 BLEU/1.38 WER/3.05 METEOR/2.70 ROUGE_L/0.30 CIDEr/3.59 YiSi on the evaluation set and the test set, respectively, for IWSLT2016 DE-EN, 2.31 BLEU/5.94 WER/1.46 METEOR/1.35 ROUGE_L/0.07 CIDEr/0.33 YiSi and 1.62 BLEU/6.04 WER/1.39 METEOR/0.11 CIDEr/0.87 YiSi on the evaluation set and newstest2014, respectively, for WMT17 EN-DE, and 3.87 BLEU/3.05 WER/9.22 METEOR/3.81 ROUGE_L/0.36 CIDEr/4.14 YiSi and 4.62 BLEU/2.41 WER/9.82 METEOR/4.82 ROUGE_L/0.44 CIDEr/5.25 YiSi on the evaluation set and newstest2014, respectively, for WMT17 EN-CS.

AB Popular and widely available translators like Google Translator uses statistic based approach to build the multilingual translation system. This approach solely depends on the availability of a large number of samples. Which is why, Google translator performs interestingly well when it translates among the popular languages like English, French or Spanish, however, makes elementary mistakes when it translates the languages that are newly introduced or less known to the system. Most of the research found so far on natural language processing (NLP), have been performed keeping English as the target language. However, a good number of widely spoken potential languages remain nearly unexplored in the research fields which is quite unexpected in the era of global communication. In this study, we have tried to explore a generalized machine translation system, especially for the languages having insufficient availability in literature. This study basically focuses on Bengali Language as an example of such low resource languages. In this work, we have proposed different approaches for semantic based verb identification along with its translation, and hence, developed an algorithm for root word detection of a verb in any sentence which reflects significant improvement over Google Translator. Finally, we have shown a comparison among the different approaches in terms of accuracy, time complexity and space complexity.

AB Simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) starts translating while receiving the streaming source inputs, and hence the source sentence is always incomplete during translating. Different from the full-sentence MT using the conventional seq-to-seq architecture, SiMT often applies prefix-to-prefix architecture, which forces each target word to only align with a partial source prefix to adapt to the incomplete source in streaming inputs. However, the source words in the front positions are always illusoryly considered more important since they appear in more prefixes, resulting in position bias, which makes the model pay more attention on the front source positions in testing. In this paper, we first analyze the phenomenon of position bias in SiMT, and develop a Length-Aware Framework to reduce the position bias by bridging the structural gap between SiMT and full-sentence MT. Specifically, given the streaming inputs, we first predict the full-sentence length and then fill the future source position with positional encoding, thereby turning the streaming inputs into a pseudo full-sentence. The proposed framework can be integrated into most existing SiMT methods to further improve performance. Experiments on two representative SiMT methods, including the state-of-the-art adaptive policy, show that our method successfully reduces the position bias and thereby achieves better SiMT performance.

AB This paper describes ANVITA-1.0 MT system, architected for submission to WAT 2021 MultiIndicMT shared task by mcairt team, where the team participated in 20 translation directions: English -> Indic and Indic -> English; Indic set comprised of 10 Indian languages. ANVITA-1.0 MT system comprised of two multi-lingual NMT models one for the English -> Indic directions and other for the Indic -> English directions with shared encoder-decoder, catering 10 language pairs and twenty translation directions. The base models were built based on Transformer architecture and trained over MultiIndicMT WAT 2021 corpora and further employed back-translation and transliteration for selective data augmentation, and model ensemble for better generalization. Additionally, MultiIndicMT WAT 2021 corpora was distilled using a series of filtering operations before putting up for training. ANVITA-1.0 achieved highest AM-FM score for English -> Bengali, 2nd for English -> Tamil and 3rd for English -> Hindi, Bengali -> English directions on official test set. In general, performance achieved by ANVITA for the Indic -> English directions are relatively better than that of English -> Indic directions for all the 10 language pairs when evaluated using BLEU and RIBES, although the same trend is not observed consistently when AM-FM based evaluation was carried out. As compared to BLEU, RIBES and AM-FM based scoring placed ANVITA relatively better among all the task participants.

TI Puf3p induces translational repression of genes linked to oxidative
   stress
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB In response to stress, the translation of many mRNAs in yeast can change in a fashion discordant with the general repression of translation. Here, we use machine learning to mine the properties of these mRNAs to determine specific translation control signals. We find a strong association between transcripts acutely translationally repressed under oxidative stress and those associated with the RNA-binding protein Puf3p, a known regulator of cellular mRNAs encoding proteins targeted to mitochondria. Under oxidative stress, a PUF3 deleted strain exhibits more robust growth than wild-type cells and the shift in translation from polysomes to monosomes is attenuated, suggesting puf3D cells perceive less stress. In agreement, the ratio of reduced: oxidized glutathione, a major antioxidant and indicator of cellular redox state, is increased in unstressed puf3D cells but remains lower under stress. In untreated conditions, Puf3p migrates with polysomes rather than ribosome-free fractions, but this is lost under stress. Finally, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of Puf3p targets following affinity purification shows Puf3p-mRNA associations are maintained or increased under oxidative stress. Collectively, these results point to Puf3p acting as a translational repressor in a manner exceeding the global translational response, possibly by temporarily limiting synthesis of new mitochondrial proteins as cells adapt to the stress.

SO IMMUNOLOGY
AB At a time when immunology seeks to progress ever more rapidly from characterization of a microbial or tumour antigen to the immune correlates that may define protective T-cell immunity, there is a need for robust tools to enable accurate predictions of peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) and peptide-MHC-T-cell receptor binding. Improvements in the curation of data sets from high throughput pMHC analysis, such as the NIH Immune Epitope Database (IEDB), and the associated developments of predictive tools rooted in machine-learning approaches, are having significant impact. When such approaches are linked to the powerful empirical immunopeptidome data sets from peptide MHC elution and mass spectrometry, there is considerable potential for rapid translation to T-cell therapies and vaccines.

However, for agents to intelligently interact with humans, simply capturing the statistical patterns is insufficient. In this paper we investigate if, and how, grounded compositional language can emerge as a means to achieve goals in multi-agent populations. Towards this end, we propose a multi-agent learning environment and learning methods that bring about emergence of a basic compositional language. This language is represented as streams of abstract discrete symbols uttered by agents over time, but nonetheless has a coherent structure that possesses a defined vocabulary and syntax. We also observe emergence of nonverbal communication such as pointing and guiding when language communication is unavailable.

TI Neural Natural Language Generation: A Survey on Multilinguality,
   Multimodality, Controllability and Learning
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
AB Developing artificial learning systems that can understand and generate natural language has been one of the long-standing goals of artificial intelligence. Recent decades have witnessed an impressive progress on both of these problems, giving rise to a new family of approaches. Especially, the advances in deep learning over the past couple of years have led to neural approaches to natural language generation (NLG). These methods combine generative language learning techniques with neural-networks based frameworks. With a wide range of applications in natural language processing, neural NLG (NNLG) is a new and fast growing field of research. In this state-of-the-art report, we investigate the recent developments and applications of NNLG in its full extent from a multidimensional view, covering critical perspectives such as multimodality, multilinguality, controllability and learning strategies. We summarize the fundamental building blocks of NNLG approaches from these aspects and provide detailed reviews of commonly used preprocessing steps and basic neural architectures. This report also focuses on the seminal applications of these NNLG models such as machine translation, description generation, automatic speech recognition, abstractive summarization, text simplification, question answering and generation, and dialogue generation. Finally, we conclude with a thorough discussion of the described frameworks by pointing out some open research directions.

AB Natural language processing (NLP) allows a computer program to understand human language as it is spoken, and has been increasingly deployed in a growing number of applications, such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, and electronic voice assistant. While information obtained from different sources can enhance the accuracy of NLP models, there are also privacy implications in the collection of such massive data. Thus, in this paper, we design a privacy-preserving system SecureNLP, focusing on the instance of recurrent neural network (RNN)based sequence-to-sequence with attention model for neural machine translation. Specifically, for non-linear functions such as sigmoid and tanh, we design two efficient distributed protocols using secure multi-party computation (MPC), which are used to carry out the respective tasks in the SecureNLP. We also prove the security of these two protocols (i.e., privacy-preserving long short-term memory network PrivLSTM, and privacy-preserving sequence to sequence transformation PrivSEQ2SEQ) in the semi-honest adversary model, in the sense that any honest-but-curious adversary cannot learn anything else from the messages they receive from other parties. The proposed system is implemented in C++ and Python, and the findings from the evaluation demonstrate the utility of the protocols in cross-domain NLP.

AB Models such as Sequence-to-Sequence and Image-to Sequence are widely used in real world applications. While the ability of these neural architectures to produce variable length outputs makes them extremely effective for problems like Machine Translation and Image Captioning, it also leaves them vulnerable to failures of the form where the model produces outputs of undesirable length. This behaviour can have severe consequences such as usage of increased computation and induce faults in downstream modules that expect outputs of a certain length. Motivated by the need to have a better understanding of the failures of these models, this paper proposes and studies the novel output-size modulation problem and makes two key technical contributions. First, to evaluate model robustness, we develop an easy-to-compute differentiable proxy objective that can be used with gradient-based algorithms to find output-lengthening inputs. Second and more importantly, we develop a verification approach that can formally verify whether a network always produces outputs within a certain length. Experimental results on Machine Translation and Image Captioning show that our output-lengthening approach can produce outputs that are 50 times longer than the input, while our verification approach can, given a model and input domain, prove that the output length is below a certain size.

AB Query Intent classifier is used by a search engine to classify an online search query whether having a certain type of intent such as adult intent or commercial intent. Training such classifiers for each language is a supervised machine learning task that requires a large amount of labeled training queries. The manual annotation of training queries for each new emerging language using human judges is expensive, error-prone and time consuming. In this paper, we leverage the existing query classifiers in a source language and the abundant unlabeled queries in the query log of the underserved target language to reduce the cost and automate the training data annotation process. The most clicked search results of a query are used to predict the intent of this query instead of human judges. Document classifier is trained on hidden topics extracted by latent semantic indexing from the translation of source language documents into the target language. The experimental results, using English as the source language and Arabic as the target one, show that the proposed unsupervised method has trained support vector machines as Arabic omen, classifiers to detect both commercial and health intent without need for human-judged Arabic queries. The unsupervised classifiers outperform the classifiers based on direct query translation and the decision fusion of both classifier is superior.

TI Implications of macromolecular crowding and reducing conditions for in
   vitro ribosome construction
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB In vitro construction of Escherichia coli ribosomes could elucidate a deeper understanding of these complex molecular machines and make possible the production of synthetic variants with new functions. Toward this goal, we recently developed an integrated synthesis, assembly and translation (iSAT) system that allows for co-activation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription and ribosome assembly, mRNA transcription and protein translation without intact cells. Here, we discovered that macromolecular crowding and reducing agents increase overall iSAT protein synthesis; the combination of 6% w/v Ficoll 400 and 2 mM DTBA yielded approximately a five-fold increase in overall iSAT protein synthesis activity. By utilizing a fluorescent RNA aptamer, fluorescent reporter proteins and ribosome sedimentation analysis, we showed that crowding agents increase iSAT yields by enhancing translation while reducing agents increase rRNA transcription and ribosome assembly. Finally, we showed that iSAT ribosomes possess similar to 70% of the protein synthesis activity of in vivo-assembled E. coli ribosomes. This work improves iSAT protein synthesis through the addition of crowding and reducing agents, provides a thorough understanding of the effect of these additives within the iSAT system and demonstrates how iSAT allows for manipulation and analysis of ribosome biogenesis in the context of an in vitro transcription-translation system.

AB Robotic arms have increasingly been used in applications such as manufacturing and medical. Often, physically impaired individuals have difficulty completing tasks such as picking an object off a shelf or picking items from the refrigerator. They rely on caregivers and others to help them complete tasks. Therefore to address this issue, research is ongoing into how to improve the lives of such persons using robotic arms and other technologies.
   This work builds on existing research which utilizes object recognition and grasp detection components to identify a bottle and obtain its real world coordinates but did not fully integrate the solution with a robotic arm [1]. We fully integrate the object recognition and grasp detection components with a Dobot Magician robotic arm. Using an eye-to-hand translation approach, we determine the translation matrix using experimental results. We used an Intel RealSense D455 camera to generate images for object detection and grasp point detection. The grasp point coordinates are passed to the robotic arm which performs the translation before moving the arm to grasp the bottle.
   Our tests with the fully integrated robotic arm show that the solution is feasible and using the given translation and depth accuracy the robotic arm can pick a bottle placed randomly in a given area.

AB A high-quality code summary describes the functionality and purpose of a code snippet concisely, which is key to program comprehension. Automatic code summarization aims to generate natural language summaries from code snippets automatically, which can save developers time and improve efficiency in development and maintenance. Recently, researchers mainly use neural machine translation (NMT) based approaches to fill this task. They apply a neural model to translate code snippets into natural language summaries.
   However, the performance of existing NMT-based approaches is limited. Although a summary and a code snippet are semantically related, they may not share common lexical tokens or language structures. Such a semantic gap between codes and summaries hinders the effect of NMT-based models. Only using code tokens to represent a code snippet cannot help NMT-based models overcome this gap.
   To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a code summarization approach that incorporates lexical, syntactic and semantic modalities of codes. We treat code tokens as the lexical modality and the abstract syntax tree (AST) as the syntactic modality. To obtain the semantic modality, inspired by translation memory (TM) in NMT, we use the information retrieval (IR) technique to retrieve a relevant summary for a code snippet to describe its functionality. We propose a novel approach based on contrastive learning to build a retrieval model to retrieve semantically similar summaries. Our approach learns and fuses those different modalities using Transformer.
   We evaluate our approach on a large Java dataset, experiment results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on automatic evaluation metrics BLEU, ROUGE and METEOR by 10%, 8% and 9%.

TI Monolingual and multilingual topic analysis using LDA and BERT
   embeddings
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMETRICS
AB Analyzing research topics offers potential insights into the direction of scientific development. In particular, analyzing multilingual research topics can help researchers grasp the evolution of topics globally, revealing topic similarity among scientific publications written in different languages. Most studies to date on topic analysis have been based on English language publications and have relied heavily on citation-based topic evolution analysis. However, since it can be challenging for English publications to cite non-English sources and since many languages do not offer English translations of abstracts, citation-based methodologies are not suitable for analyzing multilingual research topic relations. Since multilingual sentence embeddings can effectively preserve word semantics in multilingual translation tasks, a topic model based on multilingual sentence embeddings could potentially generate topic-word distributions for publications in multilingual analysis. In this paper, which is situated in the field of library and information science, we use multilingual pretrained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) embeddings and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model to analyze topic evolution in monolingual and multilingual topic similarity settings. For each topic, we multiply its LDA probability value by the averaged tensor similarity of BERT embeddings to explore the evolution of the topic in scientific publications. As our proposed method does not rely on a machine translator or the author's subjective translation, it avoids confusion and misusages caused by either machine error or the author's subjectively chosen English keywords. Our results show that the proposed approach is well-suited to analyzing the scientific evolutions in monolingual and scientific multilingual topic similarity relations. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The increasing need for performance of earth system modeling and other scientific domains pushes the computing technologies in diverse architectural directions. The development of models needs technical expertise and skills of using tools that are able to exploit the hardware capabilities. The heterogeneity of architectures complicates the development and the maintainability of the models.
   To improve the software development process of earth system models, we provide an approach that simplifies the code maintainability by fostering separation of concerns while providing performance portability. We propose the use of high-level language extensions that reflect scientific concepts. The scientists can use the programming language of their own choice to develop models, however, they can use the language extensions optionally wherever they need. The code translation is driven by configurations that are separated from the model source code. These configurations are prepared by scientific programmers to optimally use the machine's features.
   The main contribution of this paper is the demonstration of a user-controlled source-to-source translation technique of earth system models that are written with higher-level semantics. We discuss a flexible code translation technique that is driven by the users through a configuration input that is prepared especially to transform the code, and we use this technique to produce OpenMP or OpenACC enabled codes besides MPI to support multi-node configurations.

TI Convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit-Recurrent Neural Network for
   State-of-Charge Estimation of Lithium-Ion Batteries
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB For most deep learning practitioners, recurrent networks are often used for sequence modeling. However, recent researches indicate that convolutional architectures may be used to optimize recurrent networks on some machine translation tasks. Problems here are which architecture we should use for a new sequence modeling. By integrating and systematically evaluating the general convolution and recurrent architecture used for sequence modeling, a convolution gated recurrent unit (CNN-GRU) network is proposed for the state-of-charge (SOC) estimation of lithium-ion batteries in this paper. Deep-learning models are well suited for SOC estimation because a battery management system is time-varying and non-linear. The CNN-GRU model is trained using data collected from the battery-discharging processes, such as the dynamic stress test and the federal urban driving schedule. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve higher estimation accuracy than two commonly used deep learning models (recurrent neural network and gated recurrent unit) and two traditional machine learning approaches (support vector machine and extreme learning machine) for SOC estimation of lithium-ion batteries.

This is one of the foundations of this study in addition to the high interest of the world population to use and learn the language. Russian language does not use alphabets but uses Cyrillic script, where the font is different from the letters in general so there are some obstacles to learn, understand and pronounce it.

AB Building automation and control systems (BACS) generate large amounts of data. Manual interpretation of the data, e.g. for identifying energy efficiency measures, is in many cases either too costly or too complex. In order to reduce the manual effort of building data analysis, it is necessary that the labeling of data points is human- and machine-readable. As there is currently no widely accepted standard for labeling, these labeling texts differ greatly. We developed an algorithm based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) that automates the translation of BACS metadata. In previous works, we developed a schema based on 40 other schemas for the designation of data points (BUDO Schema) that we use for the translation. The user labels data points suggested by our algorithm Aikido and checks the prediction in a browser-based GUI (key interface). In our case study, we use a dataset that comprises five different projects, each using its own schema for structuring the metadata of data points in BACS. After ten training labels, our algorithm achieved an accuracy of 0.87 across all data sets. This increased to 0.95 with 50 training labels. We show that the chosen approach is able to normalize the metadata of different schemas to transfer to a previously defined schema. Thus, the manual effort is decreased significantly.

TI On the Linguistic Representational Power of Neural Machine Translation
   Models
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Despite the recent success of deep neural networks in natural language processing and other spheres of artificial intelligence, their interpretability remains a challenge. We analyze the representations learned by neural machine translation (NMT) models at various levels of granularity and evaluate their quality through relevant extrinsic properties. In particular, we seek answers to the following questions: (i) How accurately is word structure captured within the learned representations, which is an important aspect in translating morphologically rich languages? (ii) Do the representations capture long-range dependencies, and effectively handle syntactically divergent languages? (iii) Do the representations capture lexical semantics? We conduct a thorough investigation along several parameters: (i) Which layers in the architecture capture each of these linguistic phenomena; (ii) How does the choice of translation unit (word, character, or subword unit) impact the linguistic properties captured by the underlying representations? (iii) Do the encoder and decoder learn differently and independently? (iv) Do the representations learned by multilingual NMT models capture the same amount of linguistic information as their bilingual counterparts? Our data-driven, quantitative evaluation illuminates important aspects in NMT models and their ability to capture various linguistic phenomena. We show that deep NMT models trained in an end-to-end fashion, without being provided any direct supervision during the training process, learn a non-trivial amount of linguistic information. Notable findings include the following observations: (i) Word morphology and part-of-speech information are captured at the lower layers of the model; (ii) In contrast, lexical semantics or non-local syntactic and semantic dependencies are better represented at the higher layers of the model; (iii) Representations learned using characters are more informed about word-morphology compared to those learned using subword units; and (iv) Representations learned by multilingual models are richer compared to bilingual models.

AB We study the problem of question retrieval in community question answering (CQA). The biggest challenge within this task is lexical gaps between questions since similar questions are usually expressed with different but semantically related words. To bridge the gaps, state-of-the-art methods incorporate extra information such as word-to-word translation and categories of questions into the traditional language models. We find that the existing language model based methods can be interpreted using a new framework, that is they represent words and question categories in a vector space and calculate question-question similarities with a linear combination of dot products of the vectors. The problem is that these methods are either heuristic on data representation or difficult to scale up. We propose a principled and efficient approach to learning representations of data in CQA. In our method, we simultaneously learn vectors of words and vectors of question categories by optimizing an objective function naturally derived from the framework. In question retrieval, we incorporate learnt representations into traditional language models in an effective and efficient way. We conduct experiments on large scale data from Yahoo! Answers and Baidu Knows, and compared our method with state-of-the-art methods on two public data sets. Experimental results show that our method can significantly improve on baseline methods for retrieval relevance. On 1 million training data, our method takes less than 50 minutes to learn a model on a single multicore machine, while the translation based language model needs more than 2 days to learn a translation table on the same machine.

AB Approaching named entities transliteration as a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) problem is common practice. While many have applied various NMT techniques to enhance machine transliteration models, few focus on the linguistic features particular to the relevant languages. In this paper, we investigate the effect of incorporating phonetic features for English-to-Chinese transliteration under the multi-task learning (MTL) setting-where we define a phonetic auxiliary task aimed to improve the generalization performance of the main transliteration task. In addition to our system, we also release a new English-to-Chinese dataset and propose a novel evaluation metric which considers multiple possible transliterations given a source name. Our results show that the multi-task model achieves similar performance as the previous state of the art with a model of a much smaller size.(1)

TI Bitext Dependency Parsing With Auto-Generated Bilingual Treebank
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB This paper proposes a method to improve the accuracy of bilingual texts (bitexts) dependency parsing by using an auto-generated bilingual treebank created with the help of statistical machine translation (SMT) systems. Previous bitext parsing methods use human-annotated bilingual treebanks that are costly and troublesome to obtain. In the proposed method, we use an auto-generated bilingual treebank to train the parsing models. First, an SMT system is used to translate a monolingual treebank into the target language; then, a monolingual parser for the target language is used to parse the translated sentences. Since the auto-translated sentences and auto-parsed trees in the auto-generated bilingual treebank are far from perfect, the bilingual constraints are not sufficiently reliable. To overcome this problem, we propose a method to verify the reliability of the constraints using a large amount of target monolingual and bilingual unannotated data. Finally, we design a set of effective bilingual features for parsing models on the basis of the verified constraints. We conduct the experiments using a standard test data. The experimental results show that our bitext parser significantly outperforms monolingual parsers. Moreover, our method is still able to provide improvement when we use a larger monolingual treebank containing over 50 000 sentences. We also test the proposed method with different SMT systems and the results show that our method is very robust to the noise. In particular, the proposed method can be used in a purely monolingual setting with the help of SMT. That is, it does not need the human translation of the test set as previous methods do.

TI Fully unsupervised word translation from cross-lingual word embeddings
   especially for healthcare professionals
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEM ASSURANCE ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT
AB Unsupervised word to word translation without parallel corpora has attracted much research interest in the recent years. Even with the remarkable success of the recent techniques that trained with adversarial learning methods achieved a high accuracy. But they suffer from the typical drawbacks of generative adversarial models that is sensitivity to hyper-parameters, long training time and lack of interpretability. In this paper, we proposed a method of cross-lingual word embedding generation for English and morphological rich Hindi language pairs especially for healthcare professional because it will remove the communication barrier among patients regardless of its language. There is no requirement of aligned document or sentence aligned corpus, nor any bilingual dictionary because fully unsupervised learning method has been used. We are following the assumption of intra-lingual similarity distribution idea that the distribution graph is identical for the most common terms between language pairs and isometric embeddings. The performance is analyzed by using different word retrieval methods and compared for the cross-lingual word embedding of an English Hindi language pair, which is trained for both fully unsupervised and semi-supervised ways by passing the seed dictionary. We have also provided the comparative analysis of results of adversarial training and robust self-learning method for English and Hindi languages.

TI Bilingual terminology extraction using multi-level termhood
SO ELECTRONIC LIBRARY
AB Purpose Terminology is the set of technical words or expressions used in specific contexts, which denotes the core concept in a formal discipline and is usually applied in the fields of machine translation, information retrieval, information extraction and text categorization, etc. Bilingual terminology extraction plays an important role in the application of bilingual dictionary compilation, bilingual ontology construction, machine translation and cross-language information retrieval etc. This paper aims to address the issues of monolingual terminology extraction and bilingual term alignment based on multi-level termhood.
   Design/methodology/approach A method based on multi-level termhood is proposed. The new method computes the termhood of the terminology candidate as well as the sentence that includes the terminology by the comparison of the corpus. Since terminologies and general words usually have different distribution in the corpus, termhood can also be used to constrain and enhance the performance of term alignment when aligning bilingual terms on the parallel corpus. In this paper, bilingual term alignment based on termhood constraints is presented.
   Findings Experimental results show multi-level termhood can get better performance than the existing method for terminology extraction. If termhood is used as a constraining factor, the performance of bilingual term alignment can he improved.
   Originality/value The termhood of the candidate terminology and the sentence that includes the terminology is used for terminology extraction, which is called multi-level termhood. Multi-level termhood is computed by the comparison of the corpus. Bilingual term alignment method based on termhood constraint is put forward and termhood is used in the task of bilingual terminology extraction. Experimental results show that termhood constraints can improve the performance of terminology alignment to some extent.

TI A step towards refining and translating B control annotations to
   Handel-C
SO CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB The design and implementation of critical controllers benefit from development in a formal method such as the B-Method. However, B does not support direct specification of executions, but this is a requirement in controller design. The aim here is to develop a set of annotations so that they can be used by a B design engineer to capture execution requirements while creating the B model. The annotations, once shown to be consistent with the B machine, can be used independently to assess the correctness of the proposed CSP controllers. CSP parallel to B is an alternative formal method integration that can be used to develop critical controllers with both state and event behaviour. The advantage of using annotations is that the execution requirements can be captured and shown to be consistent with the state during operation development, and that a control loop invariant to establish correctness does not have to be independently developed. Handel-C is used on route to hardware synthesis as it supports the implementation of concurrency and the manipulation of state. Annotations are again used to guide the translation of the B and control annotations into Handel-C. This work has three main aims. First, we introduce a set of annotations to describe control directives to permit controller development in B. The annotations capture execution requirements. They give rise to proof obligations that when discharged prove that the annotations are consistent with the machine they are written in, and therefore will not cause the machine to diverge. Second, we prove that CSP controllers that are consistent with the annotations will preserve the non-divergence property established between the machine and the annotations. Third, we show how annotation refinement is possible, and show a range of mappings from annotated B and consistent controllers to Handel-C. The development of mappings demonstrates the feasibility of automatic translation of annotated B to Handel-C. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI A Unified Framework for Multilingual Speech Recognition in Air Traffic
   Control Systems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
AB This work focuses on robust speech recognition in air traffic control (ATC) by designing a novel processing paradigm to integrate multilingual speech recognition into a single framework using three cascaded modules: an acoustic model (AM), a pronunciation model (PM), and a language model (LM). The AM converts ATC speech into phoneme-based text sequences that the PM then translates into a word-based sequence, which is the ultimate goal of this research. The LM corrects both phoneme- and word-based errors in the decoding results. The AM, including the convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN), considers the spatial and temporal dependences of the speech features and is trained by the connectionist temporal classification loss. To cope with radio transmission noise and diversity among speakers, a multiscale CNN architecture is proposed to fit the diverse data distributions and improve the performance. Phoneme-to-word translation is addressed via a proposed machine translation PM with an encoder-decoder architecture. RNN-based LMs are trained to consider the code-switching specificity of the ATC speech by building dependences with common words. We validate the proposed approach using large amounts of real Chinese and English ATC recordings and achieve a 3.95% label error rate on Chinese characters and English words, outperforming other popular approaches. The decoding efficiency is also comparable to that of the end-to-end model, and its generalizability is validated on several open corpora, making it suitable for real-time approaches to further support ATC applications, such as ATC prediction and safety checking.

TI A Hybrid Fault Diagnosis Method Using Translation Invariant Wavelet
   Denoising, Hierarchical Entropy, and Support Vector Machine with PSO
   Algorithm
SO TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL
AB The rolling element bearing is used in various machinery and produces vibration due to imperfections, surface irregularities during manufacture, damaged bearings, and inaccuracies in the allied element. Also, the rolling element bearing vibration generally shows non-linear dynamic characteristics and is masked with heavy background noise. This noble investigation advances a hybrid technique for removing background noise from the vibration signal and detecting bearing defects. Translation invariant wavelet denoising is the initial stage in this hybrid method for noise removal from the signal. The second phase uses Hierarchical Entropy (HE) for defect feature frequency extraction. Hierarchical entropy at scale four and SampEns of eight hierarchical decomposition nodes was utilized to determine the defect feature vector. In particular, low-frequency components are investigated through multi-scale entropy (MSE), but hierarchical entropy (HE) incorporates low-frequency and high-frequency components and can extract more defective information. Implemented a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) for extracting Hierarchical entropy as feature vectors. These feature vectors are trained by utilizing particle swarm optimization (PSO). To accomplish a prediction model, examine the optimal SVM parameters and then various bearing conditions with the variation of type, size, speed, and load severity identified by SVM. The investigation results show that hierarchical entropy can adequately and more precisely express the features of bearing vibration signals. It is beyond MSE, and the proposed Nobel hybrid Translation invariant wavelet denoising and Hierarchical entropy-based method will effectively remove the noisy background signal. Also, it distinguishes different bearings successfully, indicates the bearing conditions correctly, and is more prominent than those found on MSE.

TI Investigating Dysregulated Pathways in Dilated Cardiomyopathy from
   Pathway Interaction Network
SO RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS
AB The aim of this study was to identify dysregulated pathways for the diagnosis and treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) using pathway interaction network analysis. Methods: Transcriptome data of DCM, protein-protein interaction (PPI) data, and pathway data were recruited and preprocessed. Then, the pathway interaction network was constructed based on the gene expression analysis and gene co-expression analysis. Meanwhile, pathway activity analysis was performed, and the pathway with the greatest activity change was defined as the seed pathway. Staring from the seed pathway, the dysregulated pathways that could serve as diagnostic biomarker was extracted from the pathway interaction network using support vector machines. Results: Combining gene expression and co-expression data, we constructed the pathway interaction network, covering 4175 pathway interactions. Via pathway activity analysis, cap-dependent translation initiation with the greatest activity change was defined as the seed pathway. Staring from cap-dependent translation initiation, a total of 21 dysregulated pathways were obtained, which could discriminate DCM samples from controls with the area under the curve value of 0.95. Conclusion: A pathway interaction network was implemented to identify dysrgulated pathways that can best discriminate DCM samples from controls. We identified a total of 21 dysregulated pathways in DCM, which can serve as diagnostic biomarkers for DCM.

TI iTIS-PseKNC: Identification of Translation Initiation Site in human
   genes using pseudo k-tuple nucleotides composition
SO COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB Translation is an essential genetic process for understanding the mechanism of gene expression. Due to the large number of protein sequences generated in the post-genomic era, conventional methods are unable to identify Translation Initiation Site (TIS) in human genes timely and accurately. It is thus highly desirable to develop an automatic and accurate computational model for identification of TIS. Considerable improvements have been achieved in developing computational models; however, development of accurate and reliable automated systems for TIS identification in human genes is still a challenging task. In this connection, we propose iTIS-PseKNC, a novel protocol for identification of TIS. Three protein sequence representation methods including dinucleotide composition, pseudo-dinucleotide composition and Trinucleotide composition have been used in order to extract numerical descriptors. Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor and Probabilistic Neural Network are assessed for their performance using the constructed descriptors. The proposed model MS-PseKNC has achieved 99.40% accuracy using jackknife test. The experimental results validated the superior performance of iTIS-PseKNC over the existing methods reported in the literature. It is highly anticipated that the iTISPseKNC predictor will be useful for basic research studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Dissecting the Nucleoside Antibiotics as Universal Translation
   Inhibitors
SO ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH
AB CONSPECTUS: Without question, natural products have provided the lion share of leads, if not drugs themselves, for the treatment of bacterial infections. The bacterial arms race, fueled by selection and survival pressures has delivered a natural arsenal of small molecules targeting the most essential of life processes. Antibiotics that target these critical intracellular processes face the formidable defense of both penetrating a bacterial cell membrane and avoiding efflux to exert their effect. These challenges are especially effective in Gram-negative (Gram-(-)) bacteria, which have a double membrane structure and efficient efflux systems from the combination of outer-membrane porins and inner membrane proton pumps. In this landscape of offense and defense, our clinically used antibiotics have only successfully targeted three intracellular processes for therapeutic intervention in Gram-(-) bacteria: dihydrofolate biosynthesis, transcription, and translation. Not surprisingly, such critical survival machinery is a popular target for bacterial warfare, and eight of our 14 classes of commonly used antibiotics target translation with the bacterial ribosome remaining one the most vetted targets for antimicrobial therapy. On the plus side, its anionic character attracts cationic inhibitors, which are generally more capable of penetrating the bacterial cell wall, and clinical resistance rates are usually manageable as mutation of such a highly evolved machine is difficult. On the down side, this highly evolved machine renders it difficult to inhibit selectively, and the inhibition of prokaryotic translation versus both eukaryotic cellular and mitochondrial translation is critical for clinical development and minimization of undesired toxicities.
   A class of natural products known as the "nucleoside antibiotics" have historically been recognized as universal inhibitors of the ribosome and can inhibit translation in prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and archaea. While they have served an essential role in dissecting the biochemical underpinnings of the enzymatic functions of the ribosome, they have not proven therapeutically useful as they target the highly conserved rRNA in the P-site and are toxic to mammalian cells. In this Account, we describe our studies on the natural product amicetin, a nucleoside antibiotic that we have demonstrated to break the rule of being a universal translation inhibitor. While the cytosine of amicetin mimics C75 of the 3'-CCA tail of the P-site tRNA akin to other nucleoside antibiotics, we advance a hypothesis that amicetin's unique interaction with the ribosomal protein uL16 exploits an untapped mechanism for selectively targeting the bacterial ribosome. A complex molecule comprised of a nucleoside, carbohydrates and amino acids, amicetin is also chemically unstable. Our initial attempts to stabilize and simplify this scaffold are presented with the ultimate goal of rebuilding the compound with improved penetrance to bacterial cells. If successful, this scaffold would demonstrate a path forward for a new class of antibiotics capable of selectively targeting the ribosomal P-site.

TI A Path-Based Equivalence Checking Method Between System Level and RTL
   Descriptions Using Machine Learning
SO JOURNAL OF CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND COMPUTERS
AB The growing complexity of modern digital design makes designers shift toward starting design exploration using high-level languages, and generating register transfer level (RTL) design from system level modeling (SLM) using high-level synthesis tools or manual transformation. Unfortunately, this translation process is very complex and error prone. The most important verification task is to check whether the RTL implementation is indeed equivalent to the system-level model. Equivalence checking is critical to ensure that the synthesized RTL conforms to its SLM specification.
   In this paper, we propose a novel path-based sequential equivalence checking method to validate the transformed RTL description against its corresponding SLM description. We represent the original SLM and the transformed RTL descriptions using Finite state machines with datapath (FSMD) and compare the path-pairs of the FSMD to obtain the equivalence of the designs. Then we recognize the corresponding path-pairs from all the generated paths of FSMD with Machine learning (ML) technique, and compare the recognized path-pairs by symbolic simulation and a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver. Our method can handle designs without mapping information and improve the efficiency of the state-of-the-art path-based equivalence checking methods. The promising experiments on representative benchmarks indicate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.

AB This study focuses on a new planning method for fixture conditions of workpiece in the continuous multi-axis controlled machining process. Generally, the motion of translational axes on machine tools with a trunnion table is significantly effected by the machine tool structure, tool posture in CL data, and position/posture of the workpiece on the trunnion table. In some cases, rapid changes in the tool posture at cutter locations away from the center of the rotational axis, significantly shifts the translational axes. However, in conventional CAM schemes, tool posture changes in CL data are determined without considering the machine tool structure and fixture conditions. And, a planning method for determining the fixture conditions, which prevent the rapid motion of translational axes and reduce the energy consumption for planned CL data by CAM systems, has not yet been proposed.
   In this paper, we therefore propose a new planning method for determining the workpiece position and posture on the trunnion table of a multi-axis-controlled machine tool. The proposed method consists of two different steps. In the first step, a large number of potential fixture conditions are assumed automatically. Second, the distribution of features about the movement on translation axes is estimated by coordinate transformation and collision detection. To deal with a large number of potential fixture conditions and significantly reduce the computation time for repetition of post processing, an ultra parallel computing technology known as GPGPU is introduced into the planning algorithms. The developed system can estimate the total energy consumption on the translational axes and the total machining time for each potential workpiece fixture. Therefore, the developed system can assist an NC operator to select optimum fixture conditions in a short time. (C) 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Improving the Polarity of Text through word2vec Embedding for Primary
   Classical Arabic Sentiment Analysis
SO NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS
AB Over the past decade, Sentiment analysis has attracted significant researcher attention. Despite a huge number of studies in this field, Sentiment analysis of authors' books (classical Arabic) with extracting the embedding features has not yet been done. The recent feature extraction of Arabic text depends on the frequency of the words within the corpus without extracting the relation between these words. This paper aims to create a new classical Arabic dataset CASAD from many art books by collecting sentences from several stories with human-expert labeling. Additionally, the feature extraction of those datasets is created by word embedding techniques equivalent to Word2vec that are able to extract the deep relation which means features of the formal Arabic language. These features are evaluated by several types of machine learning for classical Arabic, for example, support vector machines (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Classification And Regression Trees (CART). Moreover, statistical methods such as validation and reliability are applied to evaluate this dataset's label. Finally, our experiments evaluated the classification rate of the feature-extraction matrices in two and three classes using six machine-learning algorithms for tenfold cross-validation that showed that the Logistic Regression with Word2Vec approach is the most accurate in predicting topic-polarity occurrence.

TI Design and Experimental Investigation of a New 2R1T Overconstrained
   Parallel Kinematic Machine With Actuation Redundancy
SO JOURNAL OF MECHANISMS AND ROBOTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
AB Two rotations and one translation (2R1T) parallel kinematic machines (PKMs) are suitable for the machining of complex curved surfaces, which requires high speed and precision. To further improve rigidity, precision, and avoid singularity, actuation redundancy, and over-constrained PKMs with fixed actuators and limited-degrees of freedom (DOF) limbs are preferred. However, there are few 2R1T PKMs with these features. This paper introduces a new 2R1T overconstrained PKM with actuation redundancy, which is called Tex4. The Tex4 PKM consists of four limited-DOF limbs; that is, two PUR limbs and two 2PRU limbs (where P denotes an actuated prismatic joint, U denotes a universal joint, and R denotes a revolute joint). The kinematic model of the proposed 2PUR-2PRU machine is presented along with the results of mobility, inverse kinematics, and velocity analysis. By considering the motion/force transmissibility, the dimensional parameters of the Tex4 PKM were optimized to obtain an improved satisfactory transmission workspace without singular configurations. Finally, a prototype based on the optimized parameters was fabricated, and its feasibility and accuracy were validated by motion and position error experiments. The Tex4 PKM has the advantages of high rigidity, simple kinematic model, and zero singularity in the workspace, which suggests that it has potential for use in the high-speed machining of curved surfaces.

TI TRANSLATION FROM CLASSICAL TWO-WAY AUTOMATA TO PEBBLE TWO-WAY AUTOMATA
SO RAIRO-THEORETICAL INFORMATICS AND APPLICATIONS
AB We study the relation between the standard two-way automata and more powerful devices, namely, two-way finite automata equipped with some l additional "pebbles" that are movable along the input tape, but their use is restricted (nested) in a stack-like fashion. Similarly as in the case of the classical two-way machines, it is not known whether there exists a polynomial trade-off, in the number of states, between the nondeterministic and deterministic two-way automata with l nested pebbles. However, we show that these two machine models are not independent: if there exists a polynomial trade-off for the classical two-way automata, then, for each l >= 0, there must also exist a polynomial trade-off for the two-way automata with l nested pebbles. Thus, we have an upward collapse (or a downward separation) from the classical two-way automata to more powerful pebble automata, still staying within the class of regular languages. The same upward collapse holds for complementation of nondeterministic two-way machines. These results are obtained by showing that each pebble machine can be, by using suitable inputs, simulated by a classical two-way automaton (and vice versa), with only a linear number of states, despite the existing exponential blow-up between the classical and pebble two-way machines.

The simulator makes it possible to analyze an accuracy of a 3D tool-path based on a prescribed set of the cutter location (CL) points as well as a set of the cutter contact (CC) points with tool inclination angle. The resulting trajectory of the tool is not unique and depends on the initial set up of the machine which in turn is problem depended. Furthermore, the simulator can be used to simulate the milling process, verify the final cut and estimate the errors of the actual tool-path before the real workpiece is actually being tested with the real machine. Thus, reduce the cost of iterative trial and errors.
   Tool path simulation is verified by a series of cutting experiments performed by means of the proposed software and evaluates the accuracy of milling. It has been shown that the proposed graphical 3D software presents an efficient interactive approach to the interactive modification of a tool path based on an appropriate set of transformations as well as to verification of the tool path optimization algorithms.

AB Unlike prior approaches to machine learning, Transformer models can first be trained on a large corpus of unlabeled data with a generic objective and then on a smaller task-specific dataset. This versatility has led to both larger models and datasets. Consequently, Transformers have led to breakthroughs in the field of natural language processing. Generic program optimization presently operates on low-level programs such as LLVM. Unlike the high-level languages (e.g. C, Python, Java), which have seen initial success in machine-learning analyses, lower-level languages tend to be more verbose and repetitive to precisely specify program behavior, provide more details about microarchitecture, and derive properties necessary for optimization, all of which makes it difficult for machine learning.
   In this work, we apply transfer learning to low-level (LLVM) programs and study how low-level programs can be made more amenable to Transformer models through various techniques, including preprocessing, infix/prefix operators, and information deduplication. We evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques through a series of ablation studies on the task of translating C to both unoptimized (-O0) and optimized (-O1) LLVM IR. On the AnghaBench dataset, our model achieves a 49.57% verbatim match and BLEU score of 87.68 against Clang -O0 and 38.73% verbatim match and BLEU score of 77.03 against Clang -O1.

TI Quality characteristic association analysis of computer numerical
   control machine tool based on meta-action assembly unit
SO ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
AB As everyone knows, assembly quality plays a very important role in final product quality. Since computer numerical control machine tool is a large system with complicated structure and function, and there are complex association relationships among quality characteristics in assembly process, then it is difficult and inaccurate to analyze the whole computer numerical control machine tool quality characteristic association at one time. In this article, meta-action assembly unit is proposed as the basic analysis unit, of which quality characteristic association is studied to guarantee the whole computer numerical control machine tool assembly quality. First, based on Function-Motion-Action decomposition structure, the definitions of meta-action and meta-action assembly unit are introduced. Second, manufacturing process association and meta-action assembly unit quality characteristic association are discussed. Third, after understanding the definitions of information entropy and relative entropy, the concrete meta-action assembly unit quality characteristic association analysis steps based on relative entropy are described in detail. And finally, the lifting piston translation assembly unit of automatic pallet changer is taken as an example, the association degree between internal leakage and the influence factors of part quality characteristics and mate-relationships among them are calculated to figure out the most influential factors, showing the correctness and feasibility of this method.

TI Using Support Vector Machine to identify imaging biomarkers of
   neurological and psychiatric disease: A critical review
SO NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
AB Standard univariate analysis of neuroimaging data has revealed a host of neuroanatomical and functional differences between healthy individuals and patients suffering a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Significant only at group level however these findings have had limited clinical translation, and recent attention has turned toward alternative forms of analysis, including Support-Vector-Machine (SVM). A type of machine learning, SVM allows categorisation of an individual's previously unseen data into a predefined group using a classification algorithm, developed on a training data set. In recent years, SVM has been successfully applied in the context of disease diagnosis, transition prediction and treatment prognosis, using both structural and functional neuroimaging data. Here we provide a brief overview of the method and review those studies that applied it to the investigation of Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder, presymptomatic Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease and autistic spectrum disorder. We conclude by discussing the main theoretical and practical challenges associated with the implementation of this method into the clinic and possible future directions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Splicing sites prediction of human genome using machine learning
   techniques
SO MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB The accurate splice site prediction has several applications in the field of medical sciences and biochemistry. For instance, any mutation affecting the splice site will lead to genetic diseases and cancer such as Lynch syndrome and breast cancer. For this purpose, collecting the Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) samples is an efficient and convenient method to detect the involvement of splicing defects in disease formation. Therefore, the present study aims to develop an accurate and robust Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) method for swift and precise targeting of splice site sequences. A composite features-based model is proposed by integrating three different sample representation methods i.e., Dinucleotide Composition (DNC), Trinucleotide Composition (TNC) and Tetranucleotide Composition (TetraNC) for precise splice site prediction after converting the DNA sequences into numerical descriptors. The precision and accuracy of these features are analyzed by applying different machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Naive Bayes (NB). Results show that the proposed model of composite features vector with SVM classifier achieved an accuracy of 95.20% and 97.50% for donor and acceptor sites datasets, respectively.

TI Application of Mesenchymal Stem Cells During Machine Perfusion: An
   Emerging Novel Strategy for Organ Preservation
SO FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
AB Although solid organ transplantation remains the definitive management for patients with end-stage organ failure, this ultimate treatment has been limited by the number of acceptable donor organs. Therefore, efforts have been made to expand the donor pool by utilizing marginal organs from donation after circulatory death or extended criteria donors. However, marginal organs are susceptible to ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and entail higher requirements for organ preservation. Recently, machine perfusion has emerged as a novel preservation strategy for marginal grafts. This technique continually perfuses the organs to mimic the physiologic condition, allows the evaluation of pretransplant graft function, and more excitingly facilitates organ reconditioning during perfusion with pharmacological, gene, and stem cell therapy. As mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have anti-oxidative, immunomodulatory, and regenerative properties, mounting studies have demonstrated the therapeutic effects of MSCs on organ IRI and solid organ transplantation. Therefore, MSCs are promising candidates for organ reconditioning during machine perfusion. This review provides an overview of the application of MSCs combined with machine perfusion for lung, kidney, liver, and heart preservation and reconditioning. Promising preclinical results highlight the potential clinical translation of this innovative strategy to improve the quality of marginal grafts.

TI Translation of statechart agents into a BDI framework for MAS
   engineering
SO ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB In the agent-oriented computing area, different programming paradigms have been to date proposed to design and implement multi-agent systems (MAS). Among them, the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) and Statecharts-based models have emerged as they effectively support the definition of rational and protocol-oriented agent behaviors, respectively. In this paper, we investigate the translation between such models by using two available agent modeling languages: PROFETA, which is based on the BDI agent model, and the agent-oriented Distilled StateCharts (DSC) formalism, which allows modeling agent behaviors based on Statecharts-like state machines. In particular, we propose a mapping from DSC to PROFETA that can enable visual programming of PROFETA programs to facilitate the development of PROFETA-based autonomous systems. A case-study is also developed to exemplify the proposed engineering approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

With the development of the Internet, researchers begin to mine the parallel corpora from the multilingual websites. They use some prior knowledge like ad hoc heuristics or calculate the similarity of the webpages structure and content to find the bilingual webpages. This paper presents a method that uses the search engine and little prior knowledge about the URL patterns to get the bilingual websites from the Internet. The method is fast for its low time cost and there is no need for large-scale computation on URL pattern matching. We have collected 88 915 candidate parallel Chinese-English webpages, which average accuracy is around 90.8%. During the evaluation, the true bilingual websites that we found have high similar html structure and good quality translations.

TI Structures of the human and Drosophila 80S ribosome
SO NATURE
AB Protein synthesis in all cells is carried out by macromolecular machines called ribosomes. Although the structures of prokaryotic, yeast and protist ribosomes have been determined, the more complex molecular architecture of metazoan 80S ribosomes has so far remained elusive. Here we present structures of Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens 80S ribosomes in complex with the translation factor eEF2, E-site transfer RNA and Stm1-like proteins, based on high-resolution cryo-electron-microscopy density maps. These structures not only illustrate the co-evolution of metazoan-specific ribosomal RNA with ribosomal proteins but also reveal the presence of two additional structural layers in metazoan ribosomes, a well-ordered inner layer covered by a flexible RNA outer layer. The human and Drosophila ribosome structures will provide the basis for more detailed structural, biochemical and genetic experiments.

AB The dramatic increases in computing power and bandwidth over the past decade and more have enabled significant improvements in the global learning environment via distance education. Yet, while distance education has dramatically reduced the harriers between different geographic regions, it has not yet had a similar impact on reducing the barriers between different languages. This paper discusses a system that helps non-native English students to better understand lectures that are delivered in English via the Internet in distance learning environments. The system integrates speech recognition, a language parser, and machine translation to instantly generate transcripts of lectures and display them simultaneously with audio and video streams. We present the method, design, functionality, and implementation issues, which provide a synchronous and interactive distance learning environment in which non-native English students can learn materials in English more easily.

AB Machine translation between many languages at once is highly challenging, since training with ground truth requires supervision between all language pairs, which is difficult to obtain. Our key insight is that, while languages may vary drastically, the underlying visual appearance of the world remains consistent. We introduce a method that uses visual observations to bridge the gap between languages, rather than relying on parallel corpora or topological properties of the representations. We train a model that aligns segments of text from different languages if and only if the images associated with them are similar and each image in turn is well-aligned with its textual description. We train our model from scratch on a new dataset of text in over fifty languages with accompanying images. Experiments show that our method outperforms previous work on unsupervised word and sentence translation using retrieval. Code, models and data are available on globetrotter.cs.columbia.edu

AB Transformer architecture achieves great success in abundant natural language processing tasks. The over-parameterization of the Transformer model has motivated plenty of works to alleviate its overfitting for superior performances. With some explorations, we find simple techniques such as dropout, can greatly boost model performance with a careful design. Therefore, in this paper, we integrate different dropout techniques into the training of Transformer models. Specifically, we propose an approach named UniDrop to unite three different dropout techniques from fine-grain to coarse-grain, i.e., feature dropout, structure dropout, and data dropout. Theoretically, we demonstrate that these three dropouts play different roles from regularization perspectives. Empirically, we conduct experiments on both neural machine translation and text classification benchmark datasets. Extensive results indicate that Transformer with UniDrop can achieve around 1.5 BLEU improvement on IWSLT14 translation tasks, and better accuracy for the classification even using strong pre-trained RoBERTa as backbone.

AB PinOS is an extension of the Pin dynamic instrumentation framework for whole-system instrumentation, i.e., to instrument both kernel and user-level code. It achieves this by interposing between the subject system and hardware using virtualization techniques. Specifically, PinOS is built on top of the Xen virtual machine monitor with Intel VT technology to allow instrumentation of unmodified OSes. PmOS is based on software dynamic translation and hence can perform pervasive fine-grain instrumentation. By inheriting the powerful instrumentation API from Pin, plus introducing some new API for system-level instrumentation, PinOS can be used to write system-wide instrumentation tools for tasks like program analysis and architectural studies. As of today, PmOS can boot Linux on IA-32 in uniprocessor mode, and can instrument complex applications such as database and web servers.

AB In the IBM LMT Machine Translation (MT) system, a built-in strategy provides lexical coverage of a particular subset of words that are not listed in its bilingual lexicons. The recognition and coding of these words and their transfer generation is based on a set of derivational morphological rules. A new utility extends unfound words of this type in an LMT-compatible format in an auxiliary bilingual lexical file to be subsequently merged into the core lexicons. What characterizes this approach is the use of morphological, semantic, and syntactic features for both analysis and transfer. The auxiliary lexical file (ALF) has to be revised before a merge into the core lexicons. This utility integrates a linguistics-based analysis and transfer rules with a corpus-based method of verifying or falsifying linguistic hypotheses against extensive document translation, which in addition yields statistics on frequencies of occurrence as well as local context.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEXT-GENERATION COMPUTING
AB Sign Language is one of the major medium of communication for the deaf people. It uses gestures which makes use of hand, facial expression and other body parts to convey meaning. The use of parallel modification as opposed the sequential nature of spoken language makes it difficult for efficient representation. This calls for development of animation techniques for representing signs which can easily model human gestures. This paper presents a prototype Malayalam language text to Indian Sign Language (ISL) automatic translation system. The proposed system takes Malayalam text as input and generates corresponding Indian Sign Language (ISL) signs as output. Output animation is rendered using a computer generated model. This system will help to disseminate information to the deaf people in public utility places like railways, banks, hospitals etc. This will also act as an educational tool.

AB Quality estimation evaluation commonly takes the form of measurement of the error that exists between predictions and gold standard labels for a particular test set of translations. Issues can arise during comparison of quality estimation prediction score distributions and gold label distributions, however. In this paper, we provide an analysis of methods of comparison and identify areas of concern with respect to widely used measures, such as the ability to gain by prediction of aggregate statistics specific to gold label distributions or by optimally conservative variance in prediction score distributions. As an alternative, we propose the use of the unit-free Pearson correlation, in addition to providing an appropriate method of significance testing improvements over a baseline. Components of WMT-13 and WMT-14 quality estimation shared tasks are replicated to reveal substantially increased conclusivity in system rankings, including identification of outright winners of tasks.

AB In this paper, we study pre-trained sequence-to-sequence models for a group of related languages, with a focus on Indic languages. We present IndicBART, a multilingual, sequence-to-sequence pre-trained model focusing on 11 Indic languages and English. IndicBART utilizes the orthographic similarity between Indic scripts to improve transfer learning between similar Indic languages. We evaluate IndicBART on two NLG tasks: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and extreme summarization. Our experiments on NMT and extreme summarization show that a model specific to related languages like IndicBART is competitive with large pre-trained models like mBART50 despite being significantly smaller. It also performs well on very low-resource translation scenarios where languages are not included in pre-training or fine-tuning. Script sharing, multilingual training, and better utilization of limited model capacity contribute to the good performance of the compact IndicBART model.

AB Due to large fluctuations in cellular environments, transfer of information in biological processes without regulation is error-prone. The mechanistic details of error-reducing mechanisms in biological copying processes have been a subject of active research; however, how error reduction of a process is balanced with its thermodynamic cost and dynamical properties remain largely unexplored. Here, we study the error reducing strategies in light of the recently discovered thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) that sets a physical bound to the cost-precision trade-off for dissipative processes. We found that the two representative copying processes, DNA replication by the exonuclease-deficient T7 DNA polymerase and mRNA translation by the E. coli ribosome, reduce the error rates to biologically acceptable levels while also optimizing the processes close to the physical limit dictated by TUR.

AB Automated translation systems for sign languages are important in a world that is showing a continuously increasing interest in removing barriers faced by physically challenged individuals in communicating and contributing to the society and the workforce. These systems can greatly facilitate the communication between the vocal and the non-vocal communities. For the hearing-impaired, such systems can serve as the equivalent of speech-recognition systems used by speaking people to interact with machines in a more natural way. Few research projects tried to develop a translation system from and to visual sign language. Very few of these attempts were on Arabic sign language. None of them succeeded to develop a reliable industrial product. This review explores these trials and proposes clear recommendations to convert the lab research to a real product useful to the community

AB Nowadays, the multimodal nature of the World Wide Web is an evidence. Web sites which include video files, pictures, music and text have become widespread. Furthermore, multimodal collections in several languages demand to apply multilingual information retrieval strategies. This paper describes a new retrieval technique applied on a multimodal and multilingual system that have been tested on two different multilingual image collections. The system applies several machine translators and implements some novel heuristics. These heuristics explore a variety of ways to combine the translations obtained from the given set of translators, and the configuration of the retrieval model by using different weighting functions, and also studying the effect of pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) on this domain. Our results show interesting effects by these variations, allowing the determination of the parameters for the best retrieval model on this data and reporting the loss in performance on each language.

AB Existing automated MT evaluation methods often require expert human translations. These are produced for every language pair evaluated and, due to this expense, subsequent evaluations tend to rely on the same texts, which do not necessarily reflect real MT use. In contrast, we are designing an automated MT evaluation system, intended for use by post-editors, purchasers and developers, that requires nothing but the raw MT output. Furthermore, our research is based on texts that reflect corporate use of MT. This paper describes our first step in system design: a hierarchical classification scheme of fluency errors in English MT output, to enable us to identify error types and frequencies, and guide the selection of errors for automated detection. We present results from the statistical analysis of 20,000 words of MT output, manually annotated using our classification scheme, and describe correlations between error frequencies and human scores for fluency and adequacy.

AB Could smart contracts written in Solidity, a popular language among blockchain developers for Ethereum, be run on other blockchain platforms such as Hyperleger Fabric. To run Solidity smart contracts on another blockchain platform, one can either incorporate the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in the target blockchain, or perform a source-to-source translation of the Solidity contracts to a smart contract language for the target platform. This paper presents Sol2js, an open source source-to-source translation tool that generates Javascript smart contracts for Hyperledger Fabric from Solidity contracts, and provides a conceptual mapping of Ethereum constructs to that of Hyperleger Fabric, where possible. Presently, the tool is able to successfully translate 65-70% of Solidity constructs including major types, functions, inheritance, and events. The preliminary results show that the average of the lines of code (loc) across translated contracts is 7.5x more than the average of Solidity contracts loc while preserving contract semantics.

AB Most state-of-the-art QE systems built upon neural networks have achieved promising performances on benchmark datasets. However, the performance of these methods can be easily influenced by the inherent features of the model input, such as the length of input sequence or the number of unseen tokens. In this paper, we introduce a causal inference based method to eliminate the negative impact caused by the characters of the input for a QE system. Specifically, we propose an iterative denoising framework for multiple confounding features. The confounder elimination operation at each iteration step is implemented by a Half-Sibling Regression based method. We conduct our experiments on the official datasets and submissions fromWMT 2020 Quality Estimation Shared Task of Sentence-Level Direct Assessment. Experimental results show that the denoised QE results gain better Pearson's correlation scores with human assessments compared to the original submissions.

AB Predicting the quality of machine translation has traditionally been addressed with language-specific models, under the assumption that the quality label distribution or linguistic features exhibit traits that are not shared across languages. An obvious disadvantage of this approach is the need for labelled data for each given language pair. We challenge this assumption by exploring different approaches to multilingual Quality Estimation (QE), including using scores from translation models. We show that these outperform single-language models, particularly in less balanced quality label distributions and low-resource settings. In the extreme case of zero-shot QE, we show that it is possible to accurately predict quality for any given new language from models trained on other languages. Our findings indicate that state-of-the-art neural QE models based on powerful pre-trained representations generalise well across languages, making them more applicable in real-world settings.

AB Protein synthesis occurs on macromolecular machines, called ribosomes. Bacterial ribosomes and the translational machinery represent one of the major targets for antibiotics in the cell. Therefore, structural and biochemical investigations into ribosome-targeting antibiotics provide not only insight into the mechanism of action and resistance of antibiotics, but also insight into the fundamental process of protein synthesis. This review summarizes the recent advances in our understanding of protein synthesis, particularly with respect to X-ray and cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of ribosome complexes, and highlights the different steps of translation that are targeted by the diverse array of known antibiotics. Such findings will be important for the ongoing development of novel and improved antimicrobial agents to combat the rapid emergence of multidrug resistant pathogenic bacteria.

AB In this work we present a translation validation approach to encode a sound execution semantics for the ATL specification. Based on our sound encoding, the goal is to soundly verify an ATL specification against the specified OCL contracts. To demonstrate our approach, we have developed the VeriATL verification system using the Boogie2 intermediate verification language, which in turn provides access to the Z3 theorem prover. Our system automatically encodes the execution semantics of each ATL specification (as it appears in the ATL matched rules) into the intermediate verification language. Then, to ensure the soundness of the encoding, we verify that it soundly represents the runtime behaviour of its corresponding compiled implementation in terms of bytecode instructions for the ATL virtual machine. The experiments demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. They also illustrate how to automatically verify an ATL specification against specified OCL contracts.

AB A novel magnetically levitated motor which has the ability to control five degrees of freedom was proposed. The proposed magnetic levitated motor uses a radial bearing-less motor to control both radial translation motion and rotation, and an axial magnetic bearing to control both axial translation and tilting motion. Moreover, stators were installed on the inner side of the rotor, such that the flux path of the axial magnetic bearing and radial bearing-less motor are partially-shared. Therefore, the proposed magnetic levitated motor is small, while achieving five degrees of freedom active control. The prototype device was designed using FEM. According to this analysis, the device had sufficient magnetic force to control the rotor within a designed airgap of +/- 0.6 mm. Moreover, simulated dynamic characteristics showed good response performance of the proposed maglev system.

AB One of the major reasons for translation errors in phrase-based SMT systems is the incorrect phrases induced from inaccuracy word-aligned parallel data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that uses the minimum Bayes-risk (MBR) principle to improve the accuracy of phrase extraction. Our approach performs as a four-stage pipeline: first, bilingual phrases are extracted from parallel corpus using a standard phrase induction method; then, phrases are separated into groups under specific constraints and scored using an MBR model; next, word alignment links contained in phrases with their MBR scores lower than a certain threshold are pruned in the parallel data; last, a new phrase table is learned from the link-pruned parallel data and used in SMT decoding. We evaluate our approach on the SMT Chinese-English MT tasks, and show significant improvements on parallel data sets of different scales.

   technology
SO DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP IN THE HUMANITIES
AB The extraction of large amounts of multilingual parallel text from web resources is a widely used technique in natural language processing. However, automatically collected parallel corpora usually lack precise metadata, which are crucial to accurate data analysis and interpretation. The combination of automated extraction procedures and manual metadata enrichment may help address this issue. Wikipedia is a promising candidate for the exploration of the potential of said combination of methods because it is a rich source of translations in a large number of language pairs and because its open and collaborative nature makes it possible to identify and contact the users who produce translations. This article tests to what extent translated texts automatically extracted fromWikipedia by means of neural networks can be enriched with pertinent metadata through a self-submission-based user survey. Special emphasis is placed on data usefulness, defined in terms of a catalogue of previously established assessment criteria, most prominently metadata quality. The results suggest that from a quantitative perspective, the proposed methodology is capable of capturing metadata otherwise not available. At the same time, the crowdbased collection of data and metadata may face important technical and social limitations.

SO BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB The ribosome is the primary protein synthesis machine in the cell and is a target for treatment of a variety of diseases including bacterial infection and cancer. The ribosomal peptide exit tunnel, the route of egress for the nascent peptide, is an inviting site for drug design. Toward a rational engagement of the nascent peptide components for the design of small molecule inhibitors of ribosome function, we designed and disclosed herein a set of N-10 indole functionalized azithromycin analogs. The indole moiety of these compounds is designed to mimic the translation stalling interaction of SecM W155 side-chain with the prokaryotic (Escherichia coli) ribosome A751 residue. Many of these N-10 functionalized compounds have enhanced translation inhibition activities against E. coli ribosome relative to azithromycin while a subset inhibited the growth of representative susceptible bacteria strains to about the same extent as azithromycin. Moreover, the inclusion of bovine serum in the bacterial growth media enhanced the anti-bacterial potency of the N-10 functionalized azithromycin analogs by as high as 10-fold.

TI Efficient Code Generation in a Region-Based Dynamic Binary Translator
SO ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES
AB Region-based JIT compilation operates on translation units comprising multiple basic blocks and, possibly cyclic or conditional, control flow between these. It promises to reconcile aggressive code optimisation and low compilation latency in performance-critical dynamic binary translators. Whilst various region selection schemes and isolated code optimisation techniques have been investigated it remains unclear how to best exploit such regions for efficient code generation. Complex interactions with indirect branch tables and translation caches can have adverse effects on performance if not considered carefully. In this paper we present a complete code generation strategy for a region-based dynamic binary translator, which exploits branch type and control flow profiling information to improve code quality for the common case. We demonstrate that using our code generation strategy a competitive region-based dynamic compiler can be built on top of the LLVM JIT compilation framework. For the ARM V5T target ISA and SPEC CPU 2006 benchmarks we achieve execution rates of, on average, 867 MIPS and up to 1323 MIPS on a standard X86 host machine, outperforming state-of-the-art QEMU-ARM by delivering a speedup of 264%.

AB Prior work on multilingual question answering has mostly focused on using large multilingual pre-trained language models (LM) to perform zero-shot language-wise learning: train a QA model on English and test on other languages. In this work, we explore strategies that improve cross-lingual transfer by bringing the multilingual embeddings closer in the semantic space. Our first strategy augments the original English training data with machine translation-generated data. This results in a corpus of multilingual silver-labeled QA pairs that is 14 times larger than the original training set. In addition, we propose two novel strategies, language adversarial training and language arbitration framework, which significantly improve the (zero-resource) cross-lingual transfer performance and result in LM embeddings that are less language-variant. Empirically, we show that the proposed models outperform the previous zero-shot baseline on the recently introduced multilingual MLQA and TYDI QA datasets.

AB In this paper, instead of designing new features based on intuition, linguistic knowledge and domain, we learn some new and effective features using the deep auto-encoder (DAE) paradigm for phrase-based translation model. Using the unsupervised pre-trained deep belief net (DBN) to initialize DAE's parameters and using the input original phrase features as a teacher for semi-supervised fine-tuning, we learn new semi-supervised DAE features, which are more effective and stable than the unsupervised DBN features. Moreover, to learn high dimensional feature representation, we introduce a natural horizontal composition of more DAEs for large hidden layers feature learning. On two Chinese-English tasks, our semi-supervised DAE features obtain statistically significant improvements of 1.34/2.45 (IWSLT) and 0.82/1.52 (NIST) BLEU points over the unsupervised DBN features and the baseline features, respectively.

TI A-Site Residues Move Independently from P-Site Residues in all-Atom
   Molecular Dynamics Simulations of the 70S Bacterial Ribosome
SO PLOS ONE
AB The ribosome is a large macromolecular machine, and correlated motion between residues is necessary for coordinating function across multiple protein and RNA chains. We ran two all-atom, explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations of the bacterial ribosome and calculated correlated motion between residue pairs by using mutual information. Because of the short timescales of our simulation (ns), we expect that dynamics are largely local fluctuations around the crystal structure. We hypothesize that residues that show coupled dynamics are functionally related, even on longer timescales. We validate our model by showing that crystallographic B-factors correlate well with the entropy calculated as part of our mutual information calculations. We reveal that A-site residues move relatively independently from P-site residues, effectively insulating A-site functions from P-site functions during translation.

The article also highlights the principles taken into account during the process of transliteration. It shows advantages and disadvantages of the proposed transliteration methods for different languages. It explains the accuracy of mentioned transliteration techniques through transliterated words. It is noted that proposed transliteration methods for one language may not be significant for others. Moreover, it may not be enough to apply only one method in the field of direct and backward transliteration of languages with different graphemes and phonemes. Therefore, different transliteration techniques have to be combined.

AB We present a systematic study on multilingual and cross-lingual intent detection (ID) from spoken data. The study leverages a new resource put forth in this work, termed MINDS14, a first training and evaluation resource for the ID task with spoken data. It covers 14 intents extracted from a commercial system in the e-banking domain, associated with spoken examples in 14 diverse language varieties. Our key results indicate that combining machine translation models with state-of-the-art multilingual sentence encoders (e.g., LaBSE) yield strong intent detectors in the majority of target languages covered in MINDS-14, and offer comparative analyses across different axes: e.g., translation direction, impact of speech recognition, data augmentation from a related domain. We see this work as an important step towards more inclusive development and evaluation of multilingual ID from spoken data, hopefully in a much wider spectrum of languages compared to prior work.

AB Cross-species differences form barriers to translational research that ultimately hinder the success of clinical trials, yet knowledge of species differences has yet to be systematically incorporated in the interpretation of animal models. Here we present Found In Translation (FIT; http://www.mouse2man.org), a statistical methodology that leverages public gene expression data to extrapolate the results of a new mouse experiment to expression changes in the equivalent human condition. We applied FIT to data from mouse models of 28 different human diseases and identified experimental conditions in which FIT predictions outperformed direct cross-species extrapolation from mouse results, increasing the overlap of differentially expressed genes by 20-50%. FIT predicted novel disease-associated genes, an example of which we validated experimentally. FIT highlights signals that may otherwise be missed and reduces false leads, with no experimental cost.

AB In Natural language processing, one of the fundamental tasks is Named Entity Recognition (NER) that include identifying names of peoples, locations and other entities. Applications of NER include catboats, speech recognition, machine translation, knowledge extraction and intelligent search systems. NER is an active research domain for the last 10 years. In this paper, we propose a knowledge extraction framework to extract Named entities from Sahih AlBukhari Urdu translation which is a world known Hadith book. The proposed framework is based on finite state transducer system to extract entities and process the Hadith content using Part of Speech (POS) tagging. Conditional Random Field, an ensemble based algorithm, processes the extracted nouns for NER and classification. In the future, we aim to implement the proposed framework to rank the hadith content and apply the Vector Space Model.

AB Semantic annotated parallel corpora, though rare, play an increasingly important role in natural language processing. These corpora provide valuable data for computational tasks like sense-based machine translation and word sense disambiguation, but also to contrastive linguistics and translation studies. In this paper we present the ongoing development of a web-based corpus semantic annotation environment that uses the Open Multilingual Wordnet (Bond and Foster, 2013) as a sense inventory. The system includes interfaces to help coordinating the annotation project and a corpus browsing interface designed specifically to meet the needs of a semantically annotated corpus. The tool was designed to build the NTU-Multilingual Corpus (Tan and Bond, 2012). For the past six years, our tools have been tested and developed in parallel with the semantic annotation of a portion of this corpus in Chinese, English, Japanese and Indonesian. The annotation system is released under an open source license (MIT).

TI Regulation of chaperone/effector complex synthesis in a bacterial type
   III secretion system
SO MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY
AB Type III protein secretion systems (T3SSs), which have evolved to deliver bacterial proteins into nucleated cells, are found in many species of Gram-negative bacteria that live in close association with eukaryotic hosts. Proteins destined to travel this secretion pathway are targeted to the secretion machine by customized chaperones, with which they form highly structured complexes. Here, we have identified a mechanism that co-ordinates the expression of the Salmonella Typhimurium T3SS chaperone SicP and its cognate effector SptP. Translation of the effector is coupled to that of its chaperone, and in the absence of translational coupling, an inhibitory RNA structure prevents translation of sptP. The data presented here show how the genomic organization of functionally related proteins can have a significant impact on the co-ordination of their expression.

TI Discriminative Word Alignment by Linear Modeling
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Word alignment plays an important role in many NLP tasks as it indicates the correspondence between words in a parallel text. Although widely used to align large bilingual corpora, generative models are hard to extend to incorporate arbitrary useful linguistic information. This article presents a discriminative framework for word alignment based on a linear model. Within this framework, all knowledge sources are treated as feature functions, which depend on a source language sentence, a target language sentence, and the alignment between them. We describe a number of features that could produce symmetric alignments. Our model is easy to extend and can be optimized with respect to evaluation metrics directly. The model achieves state-of-the-art alignment quality on three word alignment shared tasks for five language pairs with varying divergence and richness of resources. We further show that our approach improves translation performance for various statistical machine translation systems.

AB In Chinese to English statistical machine translation (SMT), Chinese texts always need a pre-processing which segments sentences into words and this standard approach is Chinese word segmentation (CWS). However, CWS is not developed for SMT, its results are not necessarily optimal for SMT. In recent years, many investigations have been performed concerning making CWS suitable for SMT, but we explore it from another direction. In this paper, our basic idea is to use multiple CWS results as additional language knowledge sources and we present a simple and effective approach to use multiple CWS results for SMT. We also give experiment results over range of strategy settings, and obtain substantial improvements in performance for translation from Chinese to English. The best result shows we gain 1.89 BLEU percentage points over a state of the art HPBT baseline system without using multiple CWS results.

TI Decoupling Relative Pose Estimation Method for Non-Overlapping
   Multi-Camera System
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB In autonomous driving applications, the vision-based relative pose estimation is one of the core technologies to realize self-positioning of driverless cars. Aiming at the problems that the monocular vision system has a small field of view and the binocular vision system needs a overlapping field of view, a method for decoupling relative pose estimation of multi-camera systems with non-overlapping field of view is proposed. Use the different characteristics of the near and far points in the scene to decouple the rotation matrix and the translation vector. The relative rotation matrix is solved by the histogram voting method for the feature points of the distant scene, and the relative translation is solved by the sampling height method for the feature points of the near scene under the condition that the relative rotation matrix is known. The feasibility, robustness and accuracy of the proposed method are verified through simulation and actual experiment. Experimental results show that the relative attitude accuracy of the proposed method is better than 0.05 degrees, and the relative translation vector direction accuracy is better than 2.5 degrees, which has higher accuracy and better robustness.

It encodes a program code snippet to hide, and its decoding process is implemented by a sophisticated state machine that produces multiple outputs depending on inputs. The key idea of the proposed technique is to ambiguously decode the program code, resulting in multiple decoded code snippets that are challenging to distinguish from each other. Our approach is stealthier than previous similar approaches as its execution does not exhibit different behaviors between when it decodes correctly or incorrectly. This paper also presents analyses of weaknesses of existing techniques and discusses potential improvements. We implement and evaluate the proof of concept approach, and our preliminary results show that the proposed technique imposes various new unique challenges to the program analysis technique.

AB Despite the numerous developments in image to image translation, further improvement and applications are limited by monotonous datasets, especially the lack of the datasets with aligned image pairs. In this paper, we present the first dedicated paired embroidery dataset, which contains 9k sets of the input sketches and the corresponding output embroidery images. Specialized on this dataset, we propose a new imagebased generative approach as the benchmark for automatically generating a preview of the image produced by an expert on an embroidery machine. The key idea is to segment the input image and use the two stage generation. The first stage trains a sub-generator function within each segmentation region, while the second stage fine-tunes the output of the first stage with a global generator function. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed benchmark handles this task best, in terms of both qualitative and quantitative measures.

AB The recently proposed neural network joint model (NNJM) (Devlin et al., 2014) augments the n-gram target language model with a heuristically chosen source context window, achieving state-of-the-art performance in SMT. In this paper, we give a more systematic treatment by summarizing the relevant source information through a convolutional architecture guided by the target information. With different guiding signals during decoding, our specifically designed convolution+gating architectures can pinpoint the parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, and fuse them with the context of entire source sentence to form a unified representation. This representation, together with target language words, are fed to a deep neural network (DNN) to form a stronger NNJM. Experiments on two NIST Chinese-English translation tasks show that the proposed model can achieve significant improvements over the previous NNJM by up to +1.08 BLEU points on average.

AB Transcript disfluency detection (TDD) is an important component of the real-time speech translation system, which arouses more and more interests in recent years. This paper presents our study on adapting neural machine translation (NMT) models for TDD. We propose a general training framework for adapting NMT models to TDD task rapidly. In this framework, the main structure of the model is implemented similar to the NMT model. Additionally, several extended modules and training techniques which are independent of the NMT model are proposed to improve the performance, such as the constrained decoding, denoising autoencoder initialization and a TDD-specific training object. With the proposed training framework, we achieve significant improvement. However, it is too slow in decoding to be practical. To build a feasible and production-ready solution for TDD, we propose a fast non-autoregressive TDD model following the non-autoregressive NMT model emerged recently. Even we do not assume the specific architecture of the NMT model, we build our TDD model on the basis of Transformer, which is the state-of-the-art NMT model. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available set, Switchboard, and in-house Chinese set. Experimental results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models.

AB Slang is a predominant form of informal language making flexible and extended use of words that is notoriously hard for natural language processing systems to interpret. Existing approaches to slang interpretation tend to rely on context but ignore semantic extensions common in slang word usage. We propose a semantically informed slang interpretation (SSI) framework that considers jointly the contextual and semantic appropriateness of a candidate interpretation for a query slang. We perform rigorous evaluation on two large-scale online slang dictionaries and show that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for slang interpretation in English, but also does so in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios where training data is sparse. Furthermore, we show how the same framework can be applied to enhancing machine translation of slang from English to other languages. Our work creates opportunities for the automated interpretation and translation of informal language.

TI Fourier Descriptors Based on the Structure of the Human Primary Visual
   Cortex with Applications to Object Recognition
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL IMAGING AND VISION
AB In this paper, we propose a supervised object recognition method using new global features and inspired by the model of the human primary visual cortex V1 as the semidiscrete roto-translation group . The proposed technique is based on generalized Fourier descriptors on the latter group, which are invariant to natural geometric transformations (rotations, translations). These descriptors are then used to feed an SVM classifier. We have tested our method against the COIL-100 image database and the ORL face database, and compared it with other techniques based on traditional descriptors, global and local. The obtained results have shown that our approach looks extremely efficient and stable to noise, in presence of which it outperforms the other techniques analyzed in the paper.

TI Accuracy of Machine Learning Assisted Detection of Keratoconus: A
   Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB (1) Background: The objective of this review was to synthesize available data on the use of machine learning to evaluate its accuracy (as determined by pooled sensitivity and specificity) in detecting keratoconus (KC), and measure reporting completeness of machine learning models in KC based on TRIPOD (the transparent reporting of multivariable prediction models for individual prognosis or diagnosis) statement. (2) Methods: Two independent reviewers searched the electronic databases for all potential articles on machine learning and KC published prior to 2021. The TRIPOD 29-item checklist was used to evaluate the adherence to reporting guidelines of the studies, and the adherence rate to each item was computed. We conducted a meta-analysis to determine the pooled sensitivity and specificity of machine learning models for detecting KC. (3) Results: Thirty-five studies were included in this review. Thirty studies evaluated machine learning models for detecting KC eyes from controls and 14 studies evaluated machine learning models for detecting early KC eyes from controls. The pooled sensitivity for detecting KC was 0.970 (95% CI 0.949-0.982), with a pooled specificity of 0.985 (95% CI 0.971-0.993), whereas the pooled sensitivity of detecting early KC was 0.882 (95% CI 0.822-0.923), with a pooled specificity of 0.947 (95% CI 0.914-0.967). Between 3% and 48% of TRIPOD items were adhered to in studies, and the average (median) adherence rate for a single TRIPOD item was 23% across all studies. (4) Conclusions: Application of machine learning model has the potential to make the diagnosis and monitoring of KC more efficient, resulting in reduced vision loss to the patients. This review provides current information on the machine learning models that have been developed for detecting KC and early KC. Presently, the machine learning models performed poorly in identifying early KC from control eyes and many of these research studies did not follow established reporting standards, thus resulting in the failure of these clinical translation of these machine learning models. We present possible approaches for future studies for improvement in studies related to both KC and early KC models to more efficiently and widely utilize machine learning models for diagnostic process.

AB In this paper we study the semantic parsing problem of mapping natural language utterances into machine interpretable meaning representations. We consider a text-to-denotation application scenario in which a user interacts with a non-human assistant by entering a question, which is then translated into a logical structured query and the result of running this query is finally returned as response to the user. We propose encoder-decoder models that are trained end-to-end using the input questions and the corresponding logical structured queries. In order to ensure fast response times, our models do not condition the target string generation on previously generated tokens. We evaluate our models on real data obtained from a conversational banking chat service, and we show that conditionally-independent translation models offer similar accuracy numbers when compared with sophisticate translation models and present one order of magnitude faster response times.

AB This paper presents a cross-language retrieval system for the retrieval of English documents in response to queries in Bengali and Hindi, as part of our participation in CLEF1 2007 Ad-hoc bilingual track. We followed the dictionary-based Machine Translation approach to generate the equivalent English query out of Indian language topics. Our main challenge was to work with a limited coverage dictionary (of coverage similar to 20%) that was available for Hindi-English, and virtually non-existent dictionary for Bengali-English. So we depended mostly on a phonetic transliteration system to overcome this. The CLEF results point to the need for a rich bilingual lexicon, a translation disambiguator, Named Entity Recognizer and a better transliterator for CUR involving Indian languages. The best MAP values for Bengali and Hindi CLIR for our experiment were 7.26% and 4.77%, which are 20% and 13% of our best monolingual retrieval, respectively.

AB In this paper an optimum algorithm to translate control flow graphs to dataflow graphs is proposed for dataflow execution of sequential programs. Some of the existing analysis methods restrict the specification of a program to be processed while others require a very high analysis cost. The algorithm proposed in this paper (CD translation algorithm), (1) with a very low cost, and (2) for any control structure that can be described by a control flow graph, (3) can generate dataflow programs that give an optimum dataflow execution, Furthermore, this proposed analysis algorithm is designed to handle task level control flow graphs as well as instruction level control flow graphs, which are accepted by the existing methods, so that optimum control is-possible for task level dataflow execution.

TI Content-Based Image Retrieval Using DNA Transcription and Translation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NANOBIOSCIENCE
AB DNA carries the genetic information of almost all the living beings on the earth. The flow of genetic information takes place by a series of transcription and translation reactions in which the DNA gets converted into amino-acid sequences which determine the phenotype of an organism. This property of DNA has been used in the proposed CBIR technique in which the images are first stored in DNA sequences and then their corresponding amino-acid sequences are extracted which are used to form the feature-vectors. This not only ensures the reduction of the dimension of the feature-vectors but also the preservation of the necessary information. These feature-vectors are then given as input to various classifiers for training and testing purpose. Ensemble learning is then applied to enhance the retrieval efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm is a novel approach that uses the efficiency of DNA-based computing to increase the efficiency of classifiers for image retrieval. Experimental results show that the proposed method is more efficient than the existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB In many new interactions with machines, such as dialogue or output using voice, there is the need to convert information internal to a system into sentences, using Data2Text systems. Trying to avoid the limitations of template-based and classical NLG methods, systems based on automatic translation have been proposed in recent years. Despite providing sentences with the important variability needed for a better interaction, this doesn't come without a cost. Contrary to template-based, these systems produce sentences with heterogeneous quality. In this paper we proposed to combine a translation based NLG system with a classifier module capable of providing information on the Intelligibility or Quality of the sentences. Sentences marked as unacceptable are replaced by template-based generated ones. This classifier module is the main focus of the paper and combines extraction of linguistic features with a classifier trained in a manually annotated corpus. Results suggest that our approach is valid as best results obtained have false positives below 8% and this metric can be even lower in practical applications, decreasing to around 3%, as the generation module produces low quality sentences at a rate lower than 30%.

TI Financial distress prediction using the hybrid associative memory with

SO APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
AB This paper presents an alternative technique for financial distress prediction systems. The method is based on a type of neural network, which is called hybrid associative memory with translation. While many different neural network architectures have successfully been used to predict credit risk and corporate failure, the power of associative memories for financial decision-making has not been explored in any depth as yet. The performance of the hybrid associative memory with translation is compared to four traditional neural networks, a support vector machine and a logistic regression model in terms of their prediction capabilities. The experimental results over nine real-life data sets show that the associative memory here proposed constitutes an appropriate solution for bankruptcy and credit risk prediction, performing significantly better than the rest of models under class imbalance and data overlapping conditions in terms of the true positive rate and the geometric mean of true positive and true negative rates.

TI Deep successor feature learning for text generation
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
AB In this paper we present an approach to training neural network to generate sequences using successor feature learning from reinforcement learning. The model can be thought as two components, an MLE-based token generator and an estimator that predicts the future value of whole sentence. As we know, reinforcement learning has been applied to dealing with the exposure bias problem of generating sequences. Compared with other RL algorithm, successor feature(SF) can learn robust value function provided observations and reward by decomposing the value function into two components - a reward predictor and a successor map. The encoder-decoder framework with SF enables the decoder to generate outputs that receive more future reward, which means that the model pays attention on not only the current word but also the rest words. We demonstrate that the approach improves performance on two translation tasks. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Geometric errors are seldom considered the generations of CMM dynamic errors. This paper presents the dynamic effects of the geometric errors of CMM in fast probing, and investigates the properties with Finite Elements Method (FEM). The FEM model was composed of CMM moving bridge and its guide way. Presuming CMM guide way as an ideal rigid geometry, then angular errors were generated by the rotations of guide way around a corresponding coordinate axis, while translation errors came from the translations of guide way. Thus the 6 geometric errors on each guide way were completely decoupling and the corresponding dynamic effects were studied respectively. Analyses show that the angular errors around Y and Z-axes, epsilon(Y)(x) and epsilon(Z)(x), can induce remarkable dynamic effects at probe tip, especially in a CMM with low stiffness air bearing.

AB The purpose of a Machine Translation (MT) system is to decode one language into another. Every language has its own different lexical and syntactic structure. A hybrid language does not have its own structure; it is an amalgamation of two or more languages in a sentence. To understand the structure and to decode a hybrid language into a formal language, hybrid parsing techniques are required. Hindi and English have Subject Object Verb (SOV) and Subject Verb Object (SVO) word orders, respectively. The basic requirement of parsers is to transform a SOV word order to a SVO word order and vice versa and Part of Speech (POS) tagging is essential for word grouping. The purpose of this paper is to bring out the concepts of parsers and POS tagging techniques to which hybrid translation can takes place to a formal language.

TI Modelling programmed frameshifting with frameshift machines
SO NATURAL COMPUTING
AB The translation of a messenger RNA into a functional protein is one of the most fundamental molecular processes in a cell. Groups of three ribonucleotides, called codons, uniquely specify amino acids to be used in the construction of a protein. When the translation process skips a number of bases it is possible for the reading frame of the RNA to be shifted. By making use of multiple reading frames, organisms and viruses are able to encode multiple proteins in a single gene. We propose here a formal model of these frameshifting events and investigate its basic mathematical properties and their relevance to biological systems. In addition, multiple time-efficient algorithms are created for use in the study of frameshifting. Some of these algorithms are created to work in general, for any type of frameshifting which could be found in organisms, while others are optimized for known specialized types of frameshifting.

TI A COMMON COMPILER FOR LOTOS AND SDL SPECIFICATIONS
SO IBM SYSTEMS JOURNAL
AB This paper describes a translation of LOTOS and SDL specification languages into executable code, as it was prototyped in the Specification and Programming Environment for Communication Software (SPECS) project under the Research and Development in Advanced Communications in Europe (RACE) program. Both languages are translated into a common intermediate-representation in the form of a network of state machines with both synchronous and asynchronous communications. By a series of transformations that make full use of the equivalence relations defined on LOTOS processes, this translation solves unique problems stemming from the highly abstract nature of LOTOS. The common intermediate representation is mapped into C code that can be executed in a specific run-time environment, implemented on a UNIX(R)-like operating system. SPECS has also developed a pragmatic approach to represent implementable data types in the algebraic framework of LOTOS and SDL, based on a set of predefined type constructors.

TI Discriminative Word Alignment over Multiple Word Segmentations
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS
AB Conventional bilingual word alignment is conducted on sentence pairs with single word segmentation for languages such as Chinese, viz. Single-segmentation-based word alignment (SSWA). However, SSWA may run the risk of losing optimal word segmentation granularities or causing data sparseness in word alignment. This paper proposes Multiple-segmentation-based word alignment (MSWA). In MSWA, diverse and complementary knowledge in multiple word segmentations can be employed to lower the above risks in word alignment. Given k word segmentations of a Chinese sentence, a skeleton segmentation is firstly constructed. The alignment between the skeleton segmentation and the parallel English sentence is log-linearly modeled, where various features defined over multiple word segmentations are incorporated. The Viterbi alignment, the alignment with the highest score, is mapped back to k word alignments based on k segmentations respectively. Experimentally, MSWA outperformed SSWA on all k segmentations in both alignment quality and translation performance.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS & MANUFACTURE
AB A new metrological method is presented that performs simultaneous real-time measurements and compensates for 5-DOF parasitic motion errors in translation stages for precision profiling of optical surfaces. Two plane mirrors are used to obtain motion-dependent interferometric fringes generated by the optical principles of Twyman-Green interferometry. The fringes generated are monitored using high-speed 2D photodiode arrays and analyzed to determine the five separate motion error components in real time. Simultaneously, null control is performed to suppress the measured motion errors independently using piezoelectric actuators through real-time feedback control while the machine axis is moving. The experimental results demonstrate that 5-DOF parasitic motion errors are effectively measured and compensated to within 10 nm for translational motions and 0.15 arcsec for angular motions.

AB For the 2005 Cross-Language Evaluation Forum, Thomson Legal and Regulatory participated in the Hungarian, French, and Portuguese monolingual search tasks as well as French-to-Portuguese bilingual retrieval. Our Hungarian participation focused on comparing the effectiveness of different approaches toward morphological stemming. Our French and Portuguese monolingual efforts focused on different approaches to Pseudo-Relevance Feedback (PRF), in particular the evaluation of a scheme for selectively applying PRF only in the cases most likely to produce positive results. Our French-to-Portuguese bilingual effort applies our previous work in query translation to a new pair of languages and uses corpus-based language modeling to support term-by-term translation. We compare our approach to an off-the-self machine translation system that translates the query as a whole and find the latter approach to be more performant. All experiments were performed using our proprietary search engine. We remain encouraged by the overall success of our efforts, with our main submissions for each of the four tasks performing above the overall CLEF median. However, none of the specific enhancement techniques we attempted in this year's forum showed significant improvements over our initial result.

TI Early rRNA processing is a stress-dependent regulatory event whose
   inhibition maintains nucleolar integrity
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB The production of ribosomes is an energy-intensive process owing to the intricacy of these massive macromolecular machines. Each human ribosome contains 80 ribosomal proteins and four non-coding RNAs. Accurate assembly requires precise regulation of protein and RNA subunits. In response to stress, the integrated stress response (ISR) rapidly inhibits global translation. How rRNA is coordinately regulated with the rapid inhibition of ribosomal protein synthesis is not known. Here, we show that stress specifically inhibits the first step of rRNA processing. Unprocessed rRNA is stored within the nucleolus, and when stress resolves, it re-enters the ribosome biogenesis pathway. Retention of unprocessed rRNA within the nucleolus aids in the maintenance of this organelle. This response is independent of the ISR or inhibition of cellular translation but is independently regulated. Failure to coordinately control ribosomal protein translation and rRNA production results in nucleolar fragmentation. Our study unveils how the rapid translational shut-off in response to stress coordinates with rRNA synthesis production to maintain nucleolar integrity.

AB As the amount of available silicon resources on one chip increases, we have seen the advent of ever increasing parallel resources integrated on-chip. Many architectures use these resources as individually controllable, parallel processing elements. While such architectures excel at parallel applications, they seldom support legacy single-threaded applications. In this work, we propose using parallel resources to facilitate execution of legacy codes with acceptable performance on parallel architectures containing a drastically different instruction set through the use of an all software parallel dynamic binary translation engine. This engine spatially implements different portions of a superscalar processor across distinct parallel elements thus exploiting the pipeline parallelism inherent in a superscalar This virtual microarchitecture facilitates changing the allocation of silicon resources between different superscalar units in software which is not possible when special purpose physical resources are built. We propose building dynamically reconfigurable architectures that inspect the current virtual machine configuration along with the dynamic instruction stream and change the configuration to best suit the program's needs at runtime. An x86 to Raw parallel translation engine was built in which tiles dedicated to translation can be traded for tiles dedicated to the memory system as an example of dynamic reconfiguration.

AB One of the most important and greatest that have been achieved in the past few years is the invention of sign language. But unfortunately, it is not widely known by the common people and only the trained ones will be able to understand it thereby making it harder for the deaf-mute people to communicate with the common world. For solving this many inventions like sign language translating systems were also made. But for the existing systems there are many faults and misconceptions that reduce the accuracy of the system. In this model, camera of a smartphone device has been used to capture the images of the hand gestures as input and based on CNN model used to train the dataset of the proposed system it classifies the hand gesture inputs and give the text translations as the output of the system.

AB Natural language generation (NLG) tasks on pro-drop languages are known to suffer from zero pronoun (ZP) problems, and the problems remain challenging due to the scarcity of ZP annotated NLG corpora. In this case, we propose a highly adaptive two-stage approach to couple context modeling with ZP recovering to mitigate the ZP problem in NLG tasks. Notably, we frame the recovery process in a task-supervised fashion where the ZP representation recovering capability is learned during the NLG task learning process, thus our method does not require NLG corpora annotated with ZPs. For system enhancement, we learn an adversarial bot to adjust our model outputs to alleviate the error propagation caused by mis-recovered ZPs. Experiments on three document-level NLG tasks, i.e., machine translation, question answering, and summarization, show that our approach can improve the performance to a great extent, and the improvement on pronoun translation is very impressive.

TI Constraint and material properties of the subregions of the scapholunate

SO JOURNAL OF HAND SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME
AB The material and constraint properties of the dorsal, proximal, and palmar regions of the scapholunate ligament were studied using isolated bone-ligament-bone preparations from 24 adult intact cadaver wrists. Determinations of constraint to differential rotation and translation as well as failure strength were made using a servohydraulic testing machine incorporating an additional rotatory actuator. The dorsal region of the scapholunate ligament offered the greatest constraint to differential translation, while both the dorsal and palmar regions demonstrated statistically significant combined constraints to differential rotation between the scaphoid and lunate. The greatest yield strength was found in the dorsal region (260.3 N +/- 118.1 N), followed by the palmar region (117.9 N +/- 21.3 N) and the proximal region (62.7 N +/- 32.2 N).

TI Sparse Transcription
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB The transcription bottleneck is often cited as a major obstacle for efforts to document the world's endangered languages and supply them with language technologies. One solution is to extend methods from automatic speech recognition and machine translation, and recruit linguists to provide narrow phonetic transcriptions and sentence-aligned translations. However, I believe that these approaches are not a good fit with the available data and skills, or with long-established practices that are essentially word-based. In seeking a more effective approach, I consider a century of transcription practice and a wide range of computational approaches, before proposing a computational model based on spoken term detection that I call "sparse transcription." This represents a shift away from current assumptions that we transcribe phones, transcribe fully, and transcribe first. Instead, sparse transcription combines the older practice of word-level transcription with interpretive, iterative, and interactive processes that are amenable to wider participation and that open the way to new methods for processing oral languages.

AB We propose LATR-lazy TLB coherence-a software-based TLB shootdown mechanism that can alleviate the overhead of the synchronous TLB shootdown mechanism in existing operating systems. By handling the TLB coherence in a lazy fashion, LATR can avoid expensive IPIs which are required for delivering a shootdown signal to remote cores, and the performance overhead of associated interrupt handlers. Therefore, virtual memory operations, such as free and page migration operations, can benefit significantly from Latr's mechanism. For example, LATR improves the latency of munmap() by 70.8% on a 2-socket machine, a widely used configuration in modern data centers. Real-world, performance-critical applications such as web servers can also benefit from LATR: without any application-level changes, LATR improves Apache by 59.9% compared to Linux, and by 37.9% compared to ABIS, a highly optimized, state-of-the-art TLB coherence technique.

AB This paper considers the prediction of chaotic time series by proposed multi-scale Gaussian processes (MGP) models, an extension of classical Gaussian processes (GP) model. Unlike the GP spending much time to find the optimal hyperparameters, MGP employs a covariance function that is constructed by a scaling function with its different dilations and translations, ensuring that the optimal hyperparameter is easy to determine. Moreover, the scaling function with its different dilations and translations can form a set of complete bases, resulting in that the MGP can acquire better prediction performance than GP. The effectiveness of MGP is evaluated using simulated Mackey-Glass series as well as real-world electric load series. Results show the proposed model outperforms GP on prediction performance, and takes much less time to determine hyperparameter. Results also show that the performance of MGP is competitive with support vector machine (SVM). They give better performance compared to the radial basis function (RBF) networks.

TI Robust estimation of wave-front aberration distribution function using
   invariant wavelet transform profilometry
SO OPTICS AND LASERS IN ENGINEERING
AB The accuracy and stability of the estimation process of phase aberration directly affects the success of machine vision processes. Therefore, accurate modeling and estimation of noise in the process of recovering of aberration distribution function is of prime importance. In this paper, the noise model is considered as an additive Gaussian translation-independent distribution function. To reduce its impacts on estimating the aberration function, non-linear filtering is done in the wavelet space. Thus, the wavelet coefficients are modified in a way that minimizes the effects of the additive Gaussian noise. Then from the modified wavelet coefficients, the phase aberration function is extracted. Experimental results and the empirical validity of this idea are evaluated. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI New wine in old wineskins?-Tagging Old Russian via annotation projection
   from modern translations
SO RUSSIAN LINGUISTICS
AB The task of automatically annotating a digitised historical corpus of Russian with morphosyntactic information poses specific problems: Machine-readable resources are lacking, and word forms occur in orthographic and morphological variants and change over time. However challenging these issues are, an important advantage is that we are still dealing with a language that is predictably close to its modern variant, with its rather rich computational resources. Moreover, high-quality modern Russian translations exist for many relevant texts. The present paper demonstrates an experimental approach to the tagging of Old East Slavonic texts which uses available tools to annotate the modern version and then projects part of the annotation back onto the corresponding original forms in a careful way. The goal is to maximally alleviate the task of manual post-processing, and at the same time, to avoid 'bursting the old wineskins'.

We have performed an experiment in which Portuguese speakers are asked to judge the relevance of English documents; documents hand-translated to Portuguese and documents automatically translated to Portuguese. The goals of the experiment were to answer two questions (i) how well can native Portuguese searchers recognise relevant documents written in English, compared to documents that are hand translated and automatically translated to Portuguese; and (ii) what is the impact of misjudged documents on the performance improvement that can be achieved by relevance feedback. Surprisingly, the results show that machine translation is as effective as hand translation in aiding users to assess relevance in the experiment. In addition, the impact of misjudged documents on the performance of RF is overall just moderate, and varies greatly for different query topics. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

(2) Combining sentence length, word matching and boundary term features, using multi-feature fusion algorithm to obtain parallel sentences from comparable corpus. (3) Tibetan-Chinese entity mapping based on the maximum word continuous intersection model of parallel sentence. Finally, the experimental results show that our approach can effectively find Tibetan-Chinese cross language named entity.

TI A NEW TECHNIQUE FOR 3-DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS OF EXPERIMENTALLY PRODUCED
   FRACTURES OF THE THORACOLUMBAR SPINE
SO UNFALLCHIRURG
AB Biomechanics and motion following fractures of the thoracolumbar spine have not yet been clarified.  The motion acts in 6 degrees of freedom:  thre rotations and three translations parallel to the system of coordinates.  The problem is to measure each rotation and each translation individually.  This requires a method allowing precise three-dimensional evaluation of the motion that takes place in the genesis of a spine fracture.  This technique should not influence the experiment, should give exact data over a wide range of measurement and, finally, should require as little equipment as possible.  To fulfil these conditions we have developed a "double cube" model.  Cadaver spine units from T11 to L3 were used.  T11 was blocked with T12 and L2 with L3.  These blocks were used to fix the spine in a testing machine so that a wedge-compression fracture could be produced in L1.  Dorsal to each of the blocks one cube was mounted, the caudal one fixed while the cranial one could be moved by the machine.  In the caudal cube a right-handed cartesian system of coordinates was defined, in which the vertebrate above would move and break.  This technique can be used to describe either physiological or fracture experiments or, for example, to compare stability tests for different fixation devices.  It is demonstrated that precise three-dimensional description of the biomechanics of vertebral fractures is possible with little and simple equipment.  The cubes in this model are easly to integrate in the experiment.  Measurement of the distances between the edges of the cubes allows analysis of all rotation and translation movements around and parallel to the axes of the system of coordinates.  Each of these movements can be calculated individually.  Assessment of the data and the description of the motion in the fractured functional spine unit (FSU) are supported by a data processing program.  In experimentally produced wedge-compression fracture in L1, we found that the main motion was along the cranio-caudal (y) axis and the main rotation around the left-right (z) axis, but there is also a translation parallel to the x axis (antero-posterior), and only minimal rotation around the other two axes.

TI Cross-lingual sentiment classification: Similarity discovery plus
   training data adjustment
SO KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS
AB The performance of cross-lingual sentiment classification is sharply limited by the language gap, which means that each language has its own ways to express sentiments. Many methods have been designed to transmit sentiment information across languages by making use of machine translation, parallel corpora, auxiliary unlabeled samples and other resources. In this paper, a new approach is proposed based on the selection of training data, where labeled samples highly similar to the target language are put into the training set. The refined training samples are used to build up an effective cross-lingual sentiment classifier focusing on the target language. The proposed approach contains two major strategies: the aligned translation topic model and the semi-supervised training data adjustment. The aligned-translation topic model provides a cross-language representation space in which the semi-supervised training data adjustment procedure attempts to select effective training samples to eliminate the negative influence of the semantic distribution differences between the original and target languages. The experiments show that the proposed approach is feasible for cross-language sentiment classification tasks and provides insight into the semantic relationship between two different languages.

AB The Ripple Down Rule (RDR) is a knowledge acquisition scheme which has been successfully used in large scale commercial applications. Most notable is the use of the scheme in building a knowledge base for interpreting pathology results. Unlike machine learning algorithms which construct theories for raw data, the commercial system using the RDR scheme requires some interaction with an expert to correct erroneous interpretations. However, the frequency of such interactions is very low. Furthermore, the simplicity of the interaction means that a knowledge engineer is not required when updating a knowledge base.
   A number of RDR variants have been devised for different applications. While Scheffer has given operational semantics to one variant of RDR, translations of RDR into classical logics has not yet been presented in the literature. This paper will show how two variants of RDR, single classification RDR (SCRDR) and multiple classification RDR (MCRDR), have a propositional or first-order core tied with case specific defaults. Such a translation will be used to highlight properties of the RDR scheme which make it successful. Similarities and differences in the two variants will be discussed and RDR revision will also be analysed.

TI Correlation between vital capacity and vertebra body translation during

SO JOURNAL OF BACK AND MUSCULOSKELETAL REHABILITATION
AB BACKGROUND: Low back pain is one of the most common musculoskeletal diseases in the modern society, causing a huge economic burden, and has become an important public health problem. Years lived with disability caused by low back pain increased rapidly as a result of population growth and ageing worldwide, with the biggest increase seen in low-income and middle-income countries. In this context, the prevention and treatment of low back pain in the elderly warrant attention and research.
   OBJECTIVE: The aim is to determine the correlation between vital capacity (VC) and vertebral body translation during lumbar flexion and extension in adults aged 60 to 69 years.
   METHODS: A total of 192 adults aged 60 to 69 years were selected by cluster sampling in Lishui City, Zhejiang Province, China. The VC of the study population was tested and the ratio of VC to body mass (BM) was calculated. The lumbar hyperextension and hyperflexion of the study population were radiographed using a Hitachi 500 mAs X-ray machine made in Japan to verify vertebral body translations in each segment.
   RESULTS: The differences of test values of VC (P = 0.004), VC/BM ratio (P = 0.012) and vertebral body translation in the L5-S1 segment during flexion and extension (P < 0.001) of the populations aged 60 to 64 and 65 to 69 years were all statistically significant. The vertebral body translation in the L5-S1 segment during lumbar flexion and extension in the population aged 60 to 69 years was negatively correlated with the VC (rs = 0.207 and P = 0.004) and VC/BM ratio (rs = 0.248 and P = 0.001), showing statistical significance.
   CONCLUSIONS: The vertebral body translation of during lumbar flexion and extension correlates with the VC in the population aged 60 to 69 years. Recognition of this correlation may help to guide further lumbar stabilization exercises.

TI Neural Machine Translation-Based Automated Current Procedural
   Terminology Classification System Using Procedure Text: Development and
   Validation Study
SO JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
AB Background: Administrative costs for billing and insurance-related activities in the United States are substantial. One critical cause of the high overhead of administrative costs is medical billing errors. With advanced deep learning techniques, developing advanced models to predict hospital and professional billing codes has become feasible. These models can be used for administrative cost reduction and billing process improvements.
   Objective: In this study, we aim to develop an automated anesthesiology current procedural terminology (CPT) prediction system that translates manually entered surgical procedure text into standard forms using neural machine translation (NMT) techniques. The standard forms are calculated using similarity scores to predict the most appropriate CPT codes. Although this system aims to enhance medical billing coding accuracy to reduce administrative costs, we compare its performance with that of previously developed machine learning algorithms.
   Methods: We collected and analyzed all operative procedures performed at Michigan Medicine between January 2017 and June 2019 (2.5 years). The first 2 years of data were used to train and validate the existing models and compare the results from the NMT-based model. Data from 2019 (6-month follow-up period) were then used to measure the accuracy of the CPT code prediction. Three experimental settings were designed with different data types to evaluate the models. Experiment 1 used the surgical procedure text entered manually in the electronic health record. Experiment 2 used preprocessing of the procedure text. Experiment 3 used preprocessing of the combined procedure text and preoperative diagnoses. The NMT-based model was compared with the support vector machine (SVM) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models.
   Results: The NMT model yielded the highest top-1 accuracy in experiments 1 and 2 at 81.64% and 81.71% compared with the SVM model (81.19% and 81.27%, respectively) and the LSTM model (80.96% and 81.07%, respectively). The SVM model yielded the highest top-1 accuracy of 84.30% in experiment 3, followed by the LSTM model (83.70%) and the NMT model (82.80%). In experiment 3, the addition of preoperative diagnoses showed 3.7%, 3.2%, and 1.3% increases in the SVM, LSTM, and NMT models in top-1 accuracy over those in experiment 2, respectively. For top-3 accuracy, the SVM, LSTM, and NMT models achieved 95.64%, 95.72%, and 95.60% for experiment 1, 95.75%, 95.67%, and 95.69% for experiment 2, and 95.88%, 95.93%, and 95.06% for experiment 3, respectively.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of creating an automated anesthesiology CPT classification system based on NMT techniques using surgical procedure text and preoperative diagnosis. Our results show that the performance of the NMT-based CPT prediction system is equivalent to that of the SVM and LSTM prediction models. Importantly, we found that including preoperative diagnoses improved the accuracy of using the procedure text alone.

TI Towards a multiple-ISA embedded system
SO JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE
AB In these days, every new added hardware feature must not change the underlying Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), in order to avoid adaptation or recompilation of existing code. Binary translation (BT) allows the execution of already compiled applications on different architectures. Therefore, it opens new possibilities for designers, previously tied to a specific ISA and all its legacy hardware issues. To overcome the BT inherent performance penalty, we propose a new mechanism based on a dynamic two-level binary translation system. While the first level is responsible for the BT de facto to an intermediate machine language, the second level optimizes the already translated instructions to be executed on the target architecture. The system is totally flexible: it supports the porting of radically different ISAs and the employment of different target architectures. This paper presents the first effort towards this direction: it translates code implemented in the x86 ISA to MIPS assembly (the intermediate language), which will be optimized by the target architecture: a dynamically reconfigurable array. We show that it is possible to maintain binary compatibility, with performance improvements and no energy losses, when compared to native execution. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present an approach for producing narratives, or storylines, from sensor data collected from a mobile phone. Given a training set of English-language descriptions of events and a set of corresponding sensor data, we learn a probabilistic translation model. Then, given new sensor data, our model can produce English-language descriptions of the corresponding events. Our approach is evaluated on the data provided as part of the Nokia Mobile Data Challenge (MDC), focusing, in particular, on location labelling. We also present a set of tools for visualizing the MDC data, which were used to generate training data for storyline creation.

TI Six-degree-of-freedom displacement measurement system using a

SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB Six-degree-of-freedom displacement measurement systems are applicable in many fields: precision machine control, precision assembly, vibration analysis, and so on. This article presents a new six-degree-of-freedom displacement measurement system utilizing typical features of a diffraction grating. It is composed of a laser source, three position sensitive detectors, a diffraction grating target, and several optical components. Six-degree-of-freedom displacement is calculated from the coordinates of diffracted rays on the detectors. A forward and an inverse problem were solved to compute the full pose of an object through kinematic analysis. The experimental results show that the measurement system had a maximum error of +/- 10 mu m for translation and +/- 0.012 degrees for rotation. The repeatability is about 10 mu m for translation and 0.01 degrees for rotation. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics. [S0034-6748(00)04708-0].

TI On the Difficulty of Translating Free-Order Case-Marking Languages
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Identifying factors thatmake certain languages harder to model than others is essential to reach language equality in future Natural Language Processing technologies. Free-order case-marking languages, such as Russian, Latin, or Tamil, have provedmore challenging than fixed-order languages for the tasks of syntactic parsing and subject-verb agreement prediction. In this work, we investigate whether this class of languages is also more difficult to translate by state-of-the-art Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models. Using a variety of synthetic languages and a newly introduced translation challenge set, we find that word order flexibility in the source language only leads to a very small loss of NMT quality, even though the core verb arguments become impossible to disambiguate in sentences without semantic cues. The latter issue is indeed solved by the addition of case marking. However, in medium- and low-resource settings, the overall NMT quality of fixed-order languages remains unmatched.

AB This paper describes the so-called ill-formed nature of spontaneous conversational speech as observed from the study of a 1500-hour corpus of recorded dialogue speech. We note that the structure is quite different from that of more formal speech or writing and propose a Statistical Machine Translation approach for mapping between the spoken and written forms of the language as if they were two entirely separate languages. We further posit that the particular nature of the spoken language is especially well suited for the display of affective states, inter-speaker relationships and discourse management information. In summary, both modes of communication appear to be particularly suited to their pragmatic function, neither is ill-formed, and it appears possible to map automatically between the two. This mapping has applications in speech technology for the processing of conversational speech.

JAFARDD dynamically translates Java stack-dependent bytecodes to RISC-style stack-independent instructions to facilitate the use of a general-purpose RISC core. JAFARDD enables the exploitation of instruction level parallelism among the translated instructions by the use of bytecode folding coupled with Tomasulo's algorithm. We detail the JAFARDD architecture and the global architecture design principles observed while designing each pipeline module. We also illustrate the flow of the Java bytecodes through each of the processing phases. Benchmarking of JAFARDD using SPECjvm98 has shown a performance improvement between 1.10 and 2.25.

AB Transformer-based models are the modern work horses for neural machine translation (NMT), reaching state of the art across several benchmarks. Despite their impressive accuracy, we observe a systemic and rudimentary class of errors made by current state-of-the-art NMT models with regards to translating from a language that doesn't mark gender on nouns into others that do. We find that even when the surrounding context provides unambiguous evidence of the appropriate grammatical gender marking, no tested model was able to accurately gender occupation nouns systematically. We release an evaluation scheme and dataset for measuring the ability of NMT models to translate gender morphology correctly in unambiguous contexts across syntactically diverse sentences. Our dataset translates from an English source into 20 languages from several different language families. With the availability of this dataset, our hope is that the NMT community can iterate on solutions for this class of especially egregious errors.

AB Speed-limit sign (SLS) recognition is an important function to realize automatic driving assistance systems (ADAS). This paper presents a novel design of an image-based SLS recognition algorithm, which can efficiently detect and recognize SLS in real-time. To improve the robustness of the proposed SLS algorithm, this paper also proposes a new shape description method to describe the detected SLS using centroid-to-contour (CtC) distances of the sign content. The proposed CtC descriptor is invariant to translation, rotation, and scale variations of the SLS in the image. This advantage increases the recognition rate of a linear support vector machine classifier. The proposed SLS recognition method had been implemented and tested on an ARM-based embedded platform. Experimental results validate the SLS recognition accuracy and real-time performance of the proposed method.

TI Nascent polypeptide sequences that influence ribosome function
SO CURRENT OPINION IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB Ribosomes catalyze protein synthesis using transfer RNAs and auxiliary proteins. Historically, ribosomes have been considered nonspecific translational machines, having no regulatory functions. However, a new class of regulatory mechanisms has been discovered that is based on interactions occurring within the ribosomal peptide exit tunnel that result in ribosome stalling during translation of an appropriate mRNA segment. These discoveries reveal an unexpectedly dynamic role ribosomes play in regulating their own activity. By using nascent leader peptides in combination with bound specific amino acids or antibiotics, ribosome functions can be altered significantly resulting in regulated expression of downstream coding regions. This review summarizes relevant findings in recent articles and outlines our current understanding of nascent peptide-induced ribosome stalling in regulating gene expression.

Two monolingual and eight bilingual runs were submitted with variations in terms of 1 sage of long and short queries, presence of pseudo relevance feedback (PRF), and approaches for word sense disambiguation (WSD). We used an Amharic-English machine readable dictionary (MRD), and an online Amharic-English dictionary for lookup translation of query terms. Out of dictionary Amharic query terms were considered as possible named entities, and further filtering was attained through restricted fuzzy matching based on edit distance which is calculated against automatically extracted English proper names. The obtained results indicate that longer queries tend to perform similar to short ones, PRF improves performance considerably, and that queries tend to fare better with WSD rather than using maximal expansion of terms by taking all the translations given in the MRD.

The system consists of Korean-English paper MT module supported by user interaction environment. Our original Korean-English paper NIT system was quite useful for understanding, but not satisfactory for writing. So, we analyzed our system to trace what caused such dissatisfaction. We classified the analysis results into three main categories, that is, the errors in the source sentence itself, the errors of our NIT system, and the absence of the appropriate domain-specific expression information. For each category we provide an alternative method and show the effectiveness through analyzing the user's data. We can confirm that our system can be used quite usefully for paper writing.

TI Two approaches to compilation of bilingual multi-word terminology lists
   from lexical resources
SO NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING
AB In this paper, we present two approaches and the implemented system for bilingual terminology extraction that rely on an aligned bilingual domain corpus, a terminology extractor for a target language, and a tool for chunk alignment. The two approaches differ in the way terminology for the source language is obtained: the first relies on an existing domain terminology lexicon, while the second one uses a term extraction tool. For both approaches, four experiments were performed with two parameters being varied. In the experiments presented in this paper, the source language was English, and the target language Serbian, and a selected domain was Library and Information Science, for which an aligned corpus exists, as well as a bilingual terminological dictionary. For term extraction, we used theFlexiTermtool for the source language and a shallow parser for the target language, while for word alignment we used GIZA++. The evaluation results show that for the first approach the F(1)score varies from 29.43% to 51.15%, while for the second it varies from 61.03% to 71.03%. On the basis of the evaluation results, we developed a binary classifier that decides whether a candidate pair, composed of aligned source and target terms, is valid. We trained and evaluated different classifiers on a list of manually labeled candidate pairs obtained after the implementation of our extraction system. The best results in a fivefold cross-validation setting were achieved with the Radial Basis Function Support Vector Machine classifier, giving a F(1)score of 82.09% and accuracy of 78.49%.

AB In the paper barriers to human understanding (readability) and machine translation (translatability) of technical texts are discussed. A strong need for effective computer support in teaching professional writing is put into focus. A methodology for developing authoring tools that can be used to teach technical writing while addressing document readability and translatability is suggested. The viability of the methodology is proved by implementing it into a tool that makes the authors and translators aware of the typical areas of concern and provides a computer environment to improve problematic text fragments. The authoring environment is interwoven with hybrid analysis components and a completely automatic generation module. The tool is tuned to Russian texts on engineering and the Russian-English translation direction. However, the methodology for both developing, and using the tool is portable between domains and languages.

AB Current approaches to incorporating terminology constraints in machine translation (MT) typically assume that the constraint terms are provided in their correct morphological forms. This limits their application to real-world scenarios where constraint terms are provided as lemmas. In this paper, we introduce a modular framework for incorporating lemma constraints in neural MT (NMT) in which linguistic knowledge and diverse types of NMT models can be flexibly applied. It is based on a novel cross-lingual inflection module that inflects the target lemma constraints based on the source context. We explore linguistically motivated rule-based and data-driven neural-based inflection modules and design English-German health and English-Lithuanian news test suites to evaluate them in domain adaptation and low-resource MT settings. Results show that our rule-based inflection module helps NMT models incorporate lemma constraints more accurately than a neural module and outperforms the existing end-to-end approach with lower training costs.(1)

This includes an efficient back-propagation, which can easily be integrated in modern neural network frameworks. The APW offers a low-dimensional control to alter the spectrum, which by design generalises over different speakers. We investigate the APW in two tasks required for future dialogue or translation agents, and provide a fairly thorough literature review for both: (1) Zero-shot speaker adaptation to allow keeping the source speaker identity with very small amounts of data. Experiments show increased speaker similarity and prove that the APW increases the generalisability of a multi-speaker model. (2) Emotional speech synthesis to translate or produce affective cues. To the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt on emotional speech synthesis with an APW. While the APW is not able to increase expressiveness or audio quality, our analysis shows that the warping correlates with the level of valence in the emotion. This work should enable future research on emotion translation during machine translation.

AB For interventional procedures, a real-time mapping between treatment guidance images and planning data is challenging yet essential for successful therapy implementation. Because of time and machine constraints, it involves imaging of different modalities, resolutions and dimensions, along with severe out-of-plane deformations to handle. In this paper, we introduce MSV-RegSyn-Net, a novel, scalable, deep learning-based framework for concurrent slice-to-volume registration and high-resolution modality transfer synthesis. It consists of an end-to-end pipeline made up of (i) a cycle generative adversarial network for multimodal image translation combined with (ii) a multi-slice-to-volume deformable registration network. The concurrent nature of our approach creates mutual benefit for both tasks: image translation is naturally eased by explicit handling of out-of-plane deformations while registration benefits from bringing multimodal signals into the same domain. Our model is fully unsupervised and does not require any ground-truth deformation or segmentation mask. It obtains superior qualitative and quantitative performance for multi-slice MR to 3D CT pelvic imaging compared to state-of-the-art traditional and learning-based methods on both tasks.

AB Building an ontology for learning objects can be useful for translating such objects between learning contexts. Such translations are important because they afford learners and educators with the opportunity to a survey a wide selection of learning and teaching material. For instance, university instructors are sometimes required to assess curriculum from courses delivered from other programs or universities, even internationally. Often, the only learning object available to do so is the course outline made available in HTML format on a web page. Generally there is an abundance of metadata available from such learning objects and this information can be used to generate useful components of the ontology. Other useful information can be derived from first establishing the domain of the object, Electricity and Computing for instance, or possibly History. Once extracted, the information representing learning objects can be stored as elements in an XML. template. The purpose of this work was to develop and implement a machine learning strategy for classifying course outlines into pre-defined domains and sub-domains in order to provide this information to an ontology repository designed to aid in the translation of such objects. First some typical domains were identified. Then, 20-30 course outlines were chosen to represent each sub-domain. Next, frequency tables of words common to the course outlines for a given sub-domain were generated in order to compile an ordered list of synonyms used to represent the sub-domains. Finally, a new set of course outlines were randomly selected for classification based on an analysis of the synonym content of each. Establishing the frequency tables and completing the synonym analysis was automated completely thereby constituting the machine learning strategy.

TI Organization of Ribosomes and Nucleoids in Escherichia coli Cells during
   Growth and in Quiescence
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Background: We studied ribosome and nucleoid distribution in Escherichia coli under growth and quiescence. Results: Spatially segregated ribosomes and nucleoids show drastically altered distribution in stationary phase or when treated with drugs affecting translation, transcription, nucleoid-topology, or cytoskeleton. Ribosome inheritance in daughter cells is frequently unequal. Conclusion: Cellular growth processes modulate ribosome and nucleoid distribution. Significance: This provides insight into subcellular organization of molecular machines.
   We have examined the distribution of ribosomes and nucleoids in live Escherichia coli cells under conditions of growth, division, and in quiescence. In exponentially growing cells translating ribosomes are interspersed among and around the nucleoid lobes, appearing as alternative bands under a fluorescence microscope. In contrast, inactive ribosomes either in stationary phase or after treatment with translation inhibitors such as chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and streptomycin gather predominantly at the cell poles and boundaries with concomitant compaction of the nucleoid. However, under all conditions, spatial segregation of the ribosomes and the nucleoids is well maintained. In dividing cells, ribosomes accumulate on both sides of the FtsZ ring at the mid cell. However, the distribution of the ribosomes among the new daughter cells is often unequal. Both the shape of the nucleoid and the pattern of ribosome distribution are also modified when the cells are exposed to rifampicin (transcription inhibitor), nalidixic acid (gyrase inhibitor), or A22 (MreB-cytoskeleton disruptor). Thus we conclude that the intracellular organization of the ribosomes and the nucleoids in bacteria are dynamic and critically dependent on cellular growth processes (replication, transcription, and translation) as well as on the integrity of the MreB cytoskeleton.

TI The Discovery of Ribosome Heterogeneity and Its Implications for Gene
   Regulation and Organismal Life
SO MOLECULAR CELL
AB The ribosome has recently transitioned from being viewed as a passive, indiscriminate machine to a more dynamic macromolecular complex with specialized roles in the cell. Here, we discuss the historical milestones from the discovery of the ribosome itself to how this ancient machinery has gained newfound appreciation as a more regulatory participant in the central dogma of gene expression. The first emerging examples of direct changes in ribosome composition at the RNA and protein level, coupled with an increased awareness of the role individual ribosomal components play in the translation of specific mRNAs, is opening a new field of study centered on ribosome-mediated control of gene regulation. In this Perspective, we discuss our current understanding of the known functions for ribosome heterogeneity, including specialized translation of individual transcripts, and its implications for the regulation and expression of key gene regulatory networks. In addition, we suggest what the crucial next steps are to ascertain the extent of ribosome heterogeneity and specialization and its importance for regulation of the proteome within subcellular space, across different cell types, and during multi-cellular organismal development.

TI PUStackNGly: Positive-Unlabeled and Stacking Learning for N-Linked
   Glycosylation Site Prediction
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB N-linked glycosylation is one of the most common protein post-translation modifications (PTMs) in humans where the Asparagine (N) amino acid of the protein is attached to the glycan. It is involved in most biological processes and associated with various human diseases as diabetes, cancer, coronavirus, influenza, and Alzheimer's. Accordingly, identifying N-linked glycosylation sites will be beneficial to understanding the system and mechanism of glycosylation. Due to the experimental challenges of glycosylation site identification, machine learning becomes very important to predict the glycosylation sites. This paper proposes a novel N-linked glycosylation predictor based on bagging positive-unlabeled (PU) learning and stacking ensemble machine learning (PUStackNGly). In the proposed PUStackNGly, comprehensive sequence and structural-based features are extracted using different feature extraction descriptors. Then, ensemble-based feature selection is employed to select the most significant and stable features. The ensemble bagging PU learning selects the reliable negative samples from the unlabeled samples using four supervised learning methods (support vector machines, random forest, logistic regression, and XGBoost). Then, stacking ensemble learning is applied using four base classifiers: logistic regression, artificial neural networks, random forest, and support vector machine. The experiments results show that PUStackNGly has a promising predicting performance compared to supervised learning methods. Furthermore, the proposed PUStackNgly outperforms the existing N-linked glycosylation prediction tools on an independent dataset with 95.11% accuracy, 100% recall 80.7% precision, 89.32% F1 score, 96.93% AUC, and 0.87 MCC.

AB Machine translation of sign language into spoken languages is an important yet non-trivial task. The sheer variety of dialects that exist in any sign language makes it only harder to come up with a generalized sign language classification system. Though a lot of work has been done in this area previously but most of the approaches rely on intrusive hardware in the form of wired or colored gloves or are specific language/dialect dependent for accurate sign language interpretation. We propose a cost-effective, non-intrusive webcam based solution in which a person from any part of the world can train our system to make it learn the sign language in their own specific dialect, so that our software can then correctly translate the hand signs into a commonly spoken language, such as English. Image based hand gesture recognition carries sheer importance in this task. The heart of hand gesture recognition systems is the detection and extraction of the sign (hand gesture) from the input image stream. Our work uses functions like skin color based thresholding, contour detection and convexity defect for detection of hands and identification of important points on the hand respectively. The distance of these important contour points from the centroid of the hand becomes our feature vector against which we train our neural network. The system works in two phases. In the training phase the correspondence between users hand gestures against each sign language symbol is learnt using a feed forward neural network with back propagation learning algorithm. Once the training is complete, user is free to use our system for translation or communication with other people. Experimental results based on training and testing the system with numerous users show that the proposed method can work well for dialect-free sign language translation (numerals and alphabets) and gives us average recognition accuracies of around 65% and 55% with the maximum recognition accuracies rising upto 77% and 62% respectively.

AB The last few years have seen a rapid adoption of cloud computing for data-intensive tasks. In the cloud environment, it is common for applications to run under virtualization and to share a virtual machine with other applications (e.g., in a virtual private cloud setup). In this setting, our work identifies a new address translation bottleneck caused by memory fragmentation stemming from the interaction of virtualization, colocation, and the Linux memory allocator. The fragmentation results in the effective cache footprint of the host PT being larger than that of the guest PT. The bloated footprint of the host PT leads to frequent cache misses during nested page walks, increasing page walk latency.
   In response to these observations, we propose PTEMagnet, a new software-only approach for reducing address translation latency in a public cloud. PTEMagnet prevents memory fragmentation through a fine-grained reservation-based allocator in the guest OS. Our evaluation shows that PTEMagnet is free of performance overheads and can improve performance by up to 9% (4% on average). PTEMagnet is fully legacy-preserving, requiring no modifications to either user code or mechanisms for address translation and virtualization.

SO POZNAN STUDIES IN CONTEMPORARY LINGUISTICS
AB Cognate status is one of the most complicated issues for those who deal with or are interested in linguistics. In the present study, we have provided a general overview related to this specific matter, and compiled a list of English-Turkish cognates and false cognates. According to the derived list, we determined that 2411 of English words, examined from among approximately 80,000 words, are either cognates or false cognates in Turkish. After determining the number of cognate and false cognate words, we tested and evaluated the correctness of the translations of three software programs and five websites that provide translation services using some of the cognates and false cognates from the derived list. Results suggest that cognate words are translated correctly in most sentences at lexical level, while false cognates and especially partial false cognates are mostly translated wrongly. Nevertheless, at sentential level, it is revealed that almost all sentences translated by computer are unsatisfactory, and need human correction.

TI On Static Binary Translation of ARM/Thumb Mixed ISA Binaries
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS
AB Code discovery has been a main challenge for static binary translation, especially when the source instruction set architecture has variable-length instructions, such as the x86 architectures. Due to embedded data such as PC (program counter)-relative data, jump tables, or paddings in the code section, a binary translator may be misled to translate data as instructions. For variable-length instructions, once a piece of data is mis-translated as instructions, decoding subsequent bytes could also go wrong. We are concerned with static binary translation for the very popular Advanced RISC Machine (ARM) architectures. Although ARM is considered a reduced instruction set computer architecture, it does allow the mix of 32-bit (ARM) instructions and 16-bit (Thumb) instructions in the same executables. In addition to different instruction lengths, the ARM and Thumb instructions are located at 4-byte or 2-byte aligned addresses, respectively. Furthermore, because ARM and Thumb instructions share the same encoding space, a 4-byte word could sometimes be decoded as one ARM instruction or two Thumb instructions. The correct decoding of this 4-byte word is actually determined at runtime by the least-significant bit of the program counter.
   For unstripped binaries, the mapping symbols can be used to identify ARM code regions and Thumb code regions. However, for stripped binaries, such mapping symbols are unavailable. We propose a novel solution to statically translate stripped ARM/Thumb mixed executables. Our solution is implemented in a static binary translator. The binary translator further generates multiple versions of translated code for the code regions whose types cannot be determined with our solution. One of the code versions is selected during runtime. The binary translator also includes a series of analyses that enable the removal of most useless code versions. Based on the experimental results on stripped ARM/Thumb mixed binaries in the SPEC2006 and Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium (EEMBC) benchmark suites, our static binary translator achieves impressive performance when migrating them to run on x86 machines and the space overhead is no more than 10%.

TI Lateral Translation of the Patella in MPFC Reconstruction: A
   Biomechanical Study of Three Approaches
SO JOURNAL OF KNEE SURGERY
AB The purpose of this study was to investigate whether differences exist in preventing lateral patellar translation between three distinct medial patellofemoral complex (MPFC) reconstruction procedures at varying knee flexion angles. Six cadaveric knee specimens were dissected, potted, and placed in a customized jig for testing. Lateral patellar displacement was measured at intervals between 0 and 90 degrees of knee flexion using a tensile testing machine with a 20 N lateral force applied to the patella. Each specimen was tested with the MPFC intact, sectioned, and after each of the three reconstruction techniques: MPFL, hybrid, and medial quadriceps-tendon femoral (MQTFL) reconstructions. There was significantly increased lateral patellar displacement following MPFC sectioning when compared with the intact state in early degrees of flexion (10-30 degrees) ( p < 0.05). All three reconstruction groups restored patella stability and reduced lateral patellar displacement following sectioning from 0 to 30 degrees of flexion ( p < 0.05). When compared with the intact group, all three reconstruction groups demonstrated reduced patella translation at full knee extension, while the MPFL and hybrid reconstruction groups additionally demonstrated significant reduction in patella translation at 10 degrees of flexion ( p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed between the three reconstruction groups. This biomechanical study demonstrates the efficacy of three MPFC reconstruction techniques in patella stabilization following sectioning. Our results suggest that MPFL reconstruction may provide the most robust patella stabilization, whereas MQTFL reconstruction may be the most forgiving construct. This study suggests that MQTFL and hybrid reconstructions provide adequate resistance to lateral translation and may be used as an alternative to MPFL reconstruction.

TI Automatic Methods and Neural Networks in Arabic Texts Diacritization: A
   Comprehensive Survey
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Arabic diacritics are signs used in Arabic orthography to represent essential morphophonological and syntactic information. It is a common practice to leave out those diacritics in written Arabic. Most Arabic electronic texts lack such diacritics. The processing of those texts for various purposes of Natural Language Processing is a complicated task. Diacritized words are necessary for applications such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, and speech synthesis. To address this problem, several studies proposed automatic systems to restore diacritics in Arabic texts. The present paper presents an in-depth survey of 56 most recent Arabic diacritization studies. Based on the diacritization approach, the studies are grouped into four sections in terms of method; rule-based, simple statistical, hybrid, and Neural Networks. While rule-based methods such as morphological analyzers and lexicon retrievals were the earliest approaches, results indicated that they are still valuable tools that can aid in the process of diacritization. Effective statistical methods that produced diacritics with acceptable accuracy include Hidden Markov Model, n-grams, and Support Vector Machines. They are often accompanied by either rule-based or neural networks in hybrid systems. Neural networks, specifically Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory, reached very high diacritization accuracy levels. Studies employing neural networks focused on evaluating and comparing the efficacy of several types of neural networks or a hybrid of them, testing alternatives of input units or suggested schemes for partial daicritization. The study synthesizes the results of the studies, identifies research gaps, and offers recommendations for future research.

TI Robust simultaneous myoelectric control of multiple degrees of freedom
   in wrist-hand prostheses by real-time neuromusculoskeletal modeling
SO JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING
AB Objective. Robotic prosthetic limbs promise to replace mechanical function of lost biological extremities and restore amputees' capacity of moving and interacting with the environment. Despite recent advances in biocompatible electrodes, surgical procedures, and mechatronics, the impact of current solutions is hampered by the lack of intuitive and robust man-machine interfaces. Approach. This work presents a biomimetic interface that synthetizes the musculoskeletal function of an individual's phantom limb as controlled by neural surrogates, i.e. electromyography-derived neural activations. With respect to current approaches based on machine learning, our method employs explicit representations of the musculoskeletal system to reduce the space of feasible solutions in the translation of electromyograms into prosthesis control commands. Electromyograms are mapped onto mechanical forces that belong to a subspace contained within the broader operational space of an individual's musculoskeletal system. Main results. Our results show that this constraint makes the approach applicable to real-world scenarios and robust to movement artefacts. This stems from the fact that any control command must always exist within the musculoskeletal model operational space and be therefore physiologically plausible. The approach was effective both on intact-limbed individuals and a transradial amputee displaying robust online control of multi-functional prostheses across a large repertoire of challenging tasks. Significance. The development and translation of man-machine interfaces that account for an individual's neuromusculoskeletal system creates unprecedented opportunities to understand how disrupted neuro-mechanical processes can be restored or replaced via biomimetic wearable assistive technologies.

In particular, training samples are often labelled by one or a small set of annotators, whose perceptions of translation quality and needs may differ substantially from those of endusers, who will employ predictions in practice. To address this challenge, we propose an online Bayesian meta-learning framework for the continuous training of QE models that is able to adapt them to the needs of different users, while being robust to distributional shifts in training and test data. Experiments on data with varying number of users and language characteristics validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB The ironless permanent magnet planar motors (IPMPMs) are used in the lithography machine to realize long stroke x, y translation with single mover. The lack of rotation motion limits its use in a wide range of applications. This paper proposes a hybrid model for the IPMPM to realize the rotational motion. Based on the decoupling feature, the influence cause by the x, y translation and the rotation can be expressed by the position functions and 1-d lookup table (LUT) respectively. To the coils with centro-symmetry, the hybrid model can be further simplified. Then simulations about the calculation speed and the model accuracy are conducted. Compared with the 3-d LUT, the hybrid model cost less time with relative high accuracy. Finally the validity of the hybrid model is verified by experiment.

AB Communication of a system alliance with surroundings can be modelled as a translation of specific languages. Incoming messages into alliance create an input language LI, outgoing messages from alliance create an output language LA. Elements on the boundaries serve as conversion units between external input languages and internal languages, or they serve as plain acceptors of input sentences, telling only the input sentence is valid/non-valid. Very important case is man machine communication. In this case, the respective languages have to be regular. The example of two alliance interfaces and/or respective correction processes is discussed in detail. The process of the acceptance of a new (unknown) word within the adaptive acceptor is carried-out in the following part. These analyses are of high value for both the control and design of complex uncertain wholes, as well as for increasing their functionality and reliability.

AB Unsupervised translation has reached impressive performance on resource-rich language pairs such as English-French and English-German. However, early studies have shown that in more realistic settings involving low-resource, rare languages, unsupervised translation performs poorly, achieving less than 3.0 BLEU. In this work, we show that multilinguality is critical to making unsupervised systems practical for low-resource settings. In particular, we present a single model for 5 low-resource languages (Gujarati, Kazakh, Nepali, Sinhala, and Turkish) to and from English directions, which leverages monolingual and auxiliary parallel data from other high-resource language pairs via a three-stage training scheme. We outperform all current state-of-the-art unsupervised baselines for these languages, achieving gains of up to 14.4 BLEU. Additionally, we outperform strong supervised baselines for various language pairs as well as match the performance of the current state-of-the-art supervised model for Ne -> En. We conduct a series of ablation studies to establish the robustness of our model under different degrees of data quality, as well as to analyze the factors which led to the superior performance of the proposed approach over traditional unsupervised models.

TI MTCrossBit: A dynamic binary translation system based on multithreaded
   optimization
SO SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Dynamic optimization has been proposed to overcome many limitations caused by static optimization and is widely applied in dynamic binary translation (DBT) to effectively enhance system performance. However, almost all the existing dynamic optimization techniques or methods employed in DBT systems for a single-threaded executive environment considerably increase the complexity of the hardware or the striking runtime overhead. We propose a multithreaded DBT framework with no associated hardware called the MTCrossBit, where a helper thread for building a hot trace is employed to significantly reduce the overhead. In addition, the main thread and helper thread are each assigned to different cores to use the multi-core resources efficiently to attain better performance, two novel methods yet to be implemented in the MTCrossBit are presented: the dual-special-parallel translation caches and the new lock-free threads communication mechanism-assembly language communication (ASLC). We then apply quantitative analysis to prove that MTCrossBit can speed up the original CrossBit. Simultaneously, we present results from the implementation of the MTCrossBit on the uniprocessor machines with multi-cores utilizing the benchmark-SPECint 2000, and illustrate that we achieved some success with the above concurrent architecture.

TI Graft position at the femoral condyle affects knee mobility after
   posterior cruciate ligament replacement
SO KNEE
AB Background: In some cases posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tears require surgical reconstruction. As the femoral footprint of the ligament is quite large, an ideal graft fixation position on the medial notch wall has not yet been identified. The aim of this study was to compare three different graft fixation positions within the anatomical footprint of the PCL and test it for posterior tibial translation at different knee flexion angles.
   Methods: In six human knee specimens a drawer test was simulated on a material testing machine by applying load on the tibia. At three different knee flexion angles (0 degrees, 45 degrees, 90 degrees) knee mobility was examined with respect to tibial posterior translation and stiffness for the following conditions: intact ligaments, detached PCL, three different graft fixation positions on the femoral condyle.
   Results: Replacement of the PCL within its femoral footprint restored knee stability in terms of tibial posterior translation. Low graft position showed comparable drawer displacements to the intact condition for all knee flexion angles (p > 0.344). A higher graft position excessively reduced the posterior translation (p < 0.047) and resulted in a restricted knee mobility and a stiffer joint.
   Conclusions: Graft fixation positions on the femoral condyle play a crucial role in postoperative knee mobility and joint functionality after PCL replacement. Even though all graft fixation positions were placed within the femoral footprint of a native PCL, only the lower position on the medial notch wall showed comparable posterior tibial translation to an intact PCL.

TI Hypothesis: Emergence of Translation as a Result of RNA Helicase
   Evolution
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION
AB The origin of translation and the genetic code is one of the major mysteries of evolution. The advantage of templated protein synthesis could have been achieved only when the translation apparatus had already become very complex. This means that the translation machinery, as we know it today, must have evolved towards some different essential function that subsequently sub-functionalised into templated protein synthesis. The hypothesis presented here proposes that translation originated as the result of evolution of a primordial RNA helicase, which has been essential for preventing dying out of the RNA organism in sterile double-stranded form. This hypothesis emerges because modern ribosome possesses RNA helicase activity that likely dates back to the RNA world. I hypothesise that codon-anticodon interactions of tRNAs with mRNA evolved as a mechanism used by RNA helicase, the predecessor of ribosomes, to melt RNA duplexes. In this scenario, peptide bond formation emerged to drive unidirectional movement of the helicase via a molecular ratchet mechanism powered by Brownian motion. I propose that protein synthesis appeared as a side product of helicase activity. The first templates for protein synthesis were functional RNAs (ribozymes) that were unwound by the helicase, and the first synthesised proteins were of random or non-sense sequence. I further suggest that genetic code emerged to avoid this randomness. The initial genetic code thus emerged as an assignment of amino acids to codons according to the sequences of the pre-existing RNAs to take advantage of the side products of RNA helicase function.

AB Sign language translation (SLT), which generates text in a spoken language from visual content in a sign language, is important to assist the hard-of-hearing community for their communications. Inspired by neural machine translation (NMT), most existing SLT studies adopted a general sequence to sequence learning strategy. However, SLT is significantly different from general NMT tasks since sign languages convey messages through multiple visual-manual aspects. Therefore, in this paper, these unique characteristics of sign languages are formulated as hierarchical spatio-temporal graph representations, including high-level and fine-level graphs of which a vertex characterizes a specified body part and an edge represents their interactions. Particularly, high-level graphs represent the patterns in the regions such as hands and face, and fine-level graphs consider the joints of hands and landmarks of facial regions. To learn these graph patterns, a novel deep learning architecture, namely hierarchical spatio-temporal graph neural network (HST-GNN), is proposed. Graph convolutions and graph self-attentions with neighborhood context are proposed to characterize both the local and the global graph properties. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI Multilingual emotion classification using supervised learning:
   Comparative experiments
SO INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT
AB The importance of emotion mining is acknowledged in a wide range of new applications, thus broadening the potential market already proven for opinion mining. However, the lack of resources for languages other than English is even more critical for emotion mining. In this article, we investigate whether Multilingual Sentiment Analysis delivers reliable and effective results when applied to emotions. For this purpose, we developed experiments involving machine translations over corpora originally written in two languages. Our experimental framework for emotion classification assesses variations on (i) the language of the original text and its translations; (ii) strategies to combine multiple languages to overcome losses due to translation; (iii) options for data pre-processing (tokenization, feature representation and feature selection); and (iv) classification algorithms, including meta classifiers. The results show that emotion classification performance improve significantly with the use of texts in multiple languages, particularly by adopting a stacking of weak monolingual classifiers. Our study also sheds light into the impacts of data preparation strategies and their combination with classification algorithms, and compares differences between polarity and emotion classification according to the same experimental settings.

AB Programmable logic controllers operating in a sequential execution scheme are widely used for various applications in industrial environments with real-time requirements. The graphical programming languages described in the third part of IEC 61131 are often intended to perform open and closed loop control tasks. Continuous Function Charts (CFCs) represent an additional language accepted in practice which can be interpreted as an extension of IEC 61131-3 Function Block Diagrams. Those charts allow more flexible positioning and interconnection of function blocks, but can quickly become difficult to manage. Furthermore, the sequential execution order forces a sequential processing of possible independent and thus possibly parallel program paths. The question arises whether a translation of existing CFCs to synchronous programs considering independent actions can lead to a more manageable software model. While current formalization approaches for CFCs primarily focus on verification, the focus of this approach is on restructuring and possible reuse in engineering. This paper introduces a possible automated translation of CFCs to imperative synchronous Quartz programs and outlines the potential for reducing the states of equivalent extended finite state machines through restructuring.

TI The Effect of Increasing Tibial Tuberosity Advancement and Quadriceps
   Muscle Force on Cranial Translation of the Tibia in the Cranial Cruciate
   Deficient Stifle Joint in Dogs
SO FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
AB BackgroundCranial cruciate ligament (CCL) disease is a well-known pathology that generates both rotational and translational instability of the stifle joint that leads to osteoarthritis in dogs. Tibial tuberosity advancement (TTA) is a common surgical technique used to dynamically neutralize the tibiofemoral shear forces to achieve stifle joint stability. However, significant persistent instability has been documented in clinical cases. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of increasing quadriceps load, increasing tibial tuberosity advancement, and increasing joint flexion angle on the cranial translation of the tibia relative to the femur in the cranial cruciate ligament deficient stifle joint. Methods and ResultsSix cadaveric hind limbs were collected from six healthy mixed breed dogs of medium build and prepared for biomechanical testing. The specimen was placed into a custom-made joint testing machine, and translation of the tibia relative to the femur was measured at stifle angles of 135 degrees, 120 degrees, and 105 degrees. Cranial tibial thrust was generated by applying a vertical load to the metatarsal pad and the quadriceps muscle was simulated with loads of 0, 5, and 10 kg applied to the patella via a system of weights and pulleys. All specimens were tested with the CCL intact and cut, both of which served as controls. The tibial tuberosity was then advanced using both 6 mm and 9 mm cages, and the specimen was tested using the identical technique. Each specimen was loaded to failure by increasing the load applied to the pes until the sudden marked cranial translation of the tibia. Tibial tuberosity advancement with an applied quadriceps load was successful in limiting cranial tibial translation in 54/62 tests. Under similar loading conditions, TTA failed to limit cranial translation in 8 tests. The failures occurred at all angles of flexion examined. In the cases that failed cranial translation could be limited by either increasing the quadriceps load or increasing the amount of tibial tuberosity advancement. ConclusionThis study showed that TTA with an applied quadriceps load is effective at decreasing cranial tibial translation at functional joint angles.

AB The article discusses promising directions for the use of modern automatic methods for analyzing natural language data for solving a wide range of practical problems. The technology of creating electronic corpora (collections) of texts is considered as a tool for the transition from model linguistics to tagged data linguistics. The principles of the creation of marked corpora of texts, the possibilities and limitations of their use are considered. Creation of a marked corpus of texts in which language data that is downloaded from the Internet is processed sequentially before issuing the results to users is described. The conveyor consists of the following steps: uploading data from the Internet; definition of the language in which the text is written; unloading metadata; splitting the texts into paragraphs and sentences; deduplication; tokenization; automatic language markup; uploading cleared and marked data to the network. The prospects for the development of language data analysis systems are presented. Requirements for the creation of corpora for solving problems of public administration and strategic planning are developed. Properties that should have such bodies are considered. Those include: corpus format, corpus volume, the degree of the linguistic analysis depth, corpus-manager structure. A description of the marked corpora of texts developed at the Artificial Intelligence Research Center (AIReC) of Ailamazyan Program Systems Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, with a reference to the tasks of extracting information about persons, events and situations from the texts of news reports is presented. A retrospective review of the development of systems for automatic processing of natural language texts in the areas of machine translation and human-machine interaction is given.

   online writing
SO EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
AB Second language (L2) writing strategies are essential for successful learning outcomes in courses with a substantial writing component and this is especially true during emergency remote teaching (ERT) when online writing tasks help compensate for the missing offline communication. Online writing tasks are multimodal and interactive, and widely delivered through assignment modules, discussion forums, social media, and other online channels, yet little is known pertaining to L2 writing strategies and online writing beliefs. The current study investigates the types of L2 writing strategies students employed during ERT in the midst of Covid-19 and then used structural modeling to understand how strategies relate to online writing task perceptions, L2 writing anxiety, and L2 writing proficiency. The four L2 writing strategy categories are related to planning, monitoring, reviewing, and translating. Following a cross-sectional survey design, a total of 256 South Korean EFL students completed the study's questionnaire administered during their second semester of ERT. Overall, students reported using planning and monitoring strategies the most while using moderate levels of translation and review strategies. Translation strategies produced a significant positive relationship with L2 writing anxiety, indicating effort-avoidance behavior among apprehensive writers. Contrarily, planning and review strategies were positively associated with increased levels of perceived benefits with online writing tasks. When added to the model, the statistically significant correlations among monitoring category and outcome variables vanished, indicating a mediation effect. Along with addressing future directions in L2 writing strategy research in the post-Covid era, some pedagogical implications for the evolving application of translation strategies are discussed.

TI Translation, politics, and development: A corpus-based approach to
   evaluating China?s development aid discourse
SO LINGUISTICA ANTVERPIENSIA NEW SERIES-THEMES IN TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB China's rise to global prominence has been coupled with a development aid approach and narrative that contradicts long-standing Western-oriented models and discourses. Despite the existence of tangible development projects that bear testimony to Chinese aid to developing countries and which clearly espouse the principles upon which the aid is founded, critics continue to allege that the aid is a facade that enables China to advance its political ideology and vision. Using a corpus-based approach, we investigated the extent to which China's political discourse finds its way into the development aid discourse either by senior party officials or through a government-managed collaborative translation mechanism. To do so, we designed a monolingual corpus of the speeches of top-ranking CPC party officials presented at party-organized events and bilingual (Chinese-English) corpora of the discourse used by Chinese government officials during development aid exchanges. We extracted political terms, based mostly on their frequency of use, from the monolingual corpus and verified the extent of their presence in the bilingual corpora of the development aid discourse. Furthermore, we studied the terms and their contexts of use in the bilingual corpora to determine whether translation served as a medium through which China's political discourse was possibly being introduced into its development aid discourse. Our investigation led us to conclude that China's development aid discourse contains an insignificant amount of political terminology mirroring China's own development path. We also concluded that translation did not constitute, in any tangible way, a means by which the presence of China's political discourse in its development aid discourse could be enhanced. However, we uncovered issues related to terminology management, literal translation, and machine translation which suggest that China was struggling to cope with preserving source text and, presumably, target text linguistic and cultural elements, while taking advantage of current advances in translation technology. We propose both structural and translational modifications that could help China curb anti-development aid criticism while enhancing its development aid discourse.

SO ORIGINS OF LIFE AND EVOLUTION OF BIOSPHERES

It was proposed a decade ago that the ribosomal RNA evolved from an earlier RNA-replisome (a ribozyme fulfilling RNA replication) while transfer RNA (tRNA) evolved from a genomic replication origin. Applying these hypotheses, I suggest that protein synthesis arose for the purpose of segregating copy and template RNA during replication through the conventional formation of a complementary strand. Nascent RNA was scanned in 5' to 3' direction following the progress of replication. The base pairing of several tRNA-like molecules with nascent RNA released the replication intermediates trapped in duplex. Synthesis of random peptides evolved to fuel the turnover of tRNAs. Then the combination of replication-coupled peptide formation and the independent development of amino acidspecific tRNA aminoacylation resulted in template-based protein synthesis. Therefore, the positioning of tRNAs adjacent to each other developed for the purpose of replication rather than peptide synthesis. This hypothesis does not include either selection for useful peptides or specific recognition of amino acids at the initial evolution of translation. It does, however, explain a number of features of modern translation apparatus, such as the relative flexibility of genetic code, the number of proteins shared by the transcription and translation machines, the universal participation of an RNA subunit in co-translational protein secretion, 'unscheduled translation', and factor-independent translocation. Assistance of original ribosomes in keeping apart the nascent transcript from its template is still widely explored by modem bacteria and perhaps by other domains of life.

AB With the growing size of real-world datasets running on CPUs, address translation has become a significant performance bottleneck. To translate virtual addresses into physical addresses, modern operating systems perform several levels of page table walks (PTWs) in memory. Translation look-aside buffers (TLBs) are used as caches to keep recently used translation information. However, as datasets increase in size, both the TLB miss rate and the overhead of PTWs worsen, causing severe performance bottlenecks. Using a diverse set of workloads, we show the PTW overhead consumes an average of 20% application execution time.
   In this paper, we propose CoPTA, a technique to speculate the memory address translation upon a TLB miss to hide the PTW latency. Specifically, we show that the operating system has a tendency to map contiguous virtual memory pages to contiguous physical pages. Using a real machine, we show that the Linux kernel can automatically defragment physical memory and create larger chunks for contiguous mapping, particularly when transparent huge page support is enabled. Based on this observation, we devise a speculation mechanism that finds nearby entries present in the TLB upon a miss and predicts the address translation of the missed address assuming contiguous address allocation. This allows CoPTAto speculatively execute instructions without waiting for the PTW to complete. We run the PTW in parallel, compare the speculated and the translated physical addresses, and flush the pipeline upon a wrong speculation with similar techniques used for handling branch mispredictions.
   We comprehensively evaluate our proposal using benchmarks from three suites: SPEC CPU 2006 for server-grade applications, GraphBIG for graph applications, and the NAS benchmark suite for scientific applications. Using a trace-based simulation, we show an average address prediction accuracy of 82% across these workloads resulting in a 16% performance improvement.

TI Some linear models for estimating the motion of rigid bodies with
   applications to geometric quality assurance
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION
AB A geometrical method to assess the quality of a part is to sample points on the surface of the part and to bring an ideal computer representation of the part as close as possible to the sampled locations. The points are sampled with a coordinate measuring machine (CMM) that gives the coordinates, with respect to the machine's own three-dimensional system of axis, of the sampled locations. Computer-assisted design (CAD) gives the ideal representation of the part. The matching involves estimating a rotation and a translation vector characterizing the rigid body transformation needed to go from the computer model to the sampled locations. The sum of the squared residual distances between the sampled locations and the fitted computer part is a measure of the quality of the part. This article investigates the statistical properties of this method when the surface of the part is made of planar regions. Estimating the translation vector and the rotation matrix is shown to be "locally" equivalent to fitting a linear model to the localization data. Three components of the residual sum of squared distances are identified. They measure within planar region variability, the orientation conformity of the planar regions, and the size discrepancies of the regions. Diagnostics for linear models are adapted to yield statistical tests for specific geometric failures of a part. The developments use first-order asymptotic expansions of the estimators and of the sum of squared residuals for the local linear model, as the errors associated with the sampled locations go to 0.

AB Binary translation translates binary programs from one instruction set to another. It is widely used in virtual machines and emulators. We extend mc2llvm, which is an LLVM-based retargetable 32-bit binary translator developed in our lab in the past several years, to support 64-bit ARM instruction set. In this paper, we report the translation of AArch64 floating-point instructions in our mc2llvm. For floating-point instructions, due to the lack of floating-point support in LLVM [13, 14], we add support for the flush-to-zero mode, not-a-number processing, floating-point exceptions, and various rounding modes. On average, mc2llvm-translated binary can achieve 47% and 24.5% of the performance of natively compiled x86-64 binary on statically translated EEMBC benchmark and dynamically translated SPEC CINT2006 benchmarks, respectively. Compared to QEMU-translated binary, mc2llvm-translated binary runs 2.92x, 1.21x and 1.41x faster on statically translated EEMBC benchmark, dynamically translated SPEC CINT2006, and CFP2006 benchmarks, respectively. (Note that the benchmarks contain both floating-point instructions and other instructions, such as load and store instructions.)

TI Research on Modeling Method for Eccentric Axial Force of Axial Flux
   Permanent Magnet Motor with Single-Rotor-Single-Stator Structure
SO JOURNAL OF VIBRATION ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGIES
AB Background Axial flux permanent magnet motors (AFPMMs) with single-rotor-single-stator structure (SRSSS) are the main components of new energy vehicles. The vibration characteristic of AFPMM with SRSSS significantly affect the security of new energy vehicles. Axial force is a main factor causing vibration of AFPMM. Due to manufacturing error, assembling error and so on, there is eccentricity between rotor axis and stator axis. Eccentric axial force will be time-varying as AFPMM works. To research the law of eccentricity on the axial force of AFPMM, a new modelling method is needed. Purpose The eccentricity between rotor axis and stator axis can be divided into three situations: translation error alone, deflection error alone and both. The aim of this study is to obtain the law of translation error and deflection error on the axial force of AFPMM with SRSSS in the three situations. Methods An analytical method is adopted to build a model of axial flux air gap magnetic field model without eccentricity. Both cogging effect and end effect are taken into consideration. Another analytical method is adopted to build the eccentric models of air gap for three situations: translation error alone, deflection error alone and both. The model of axial force is also established in the analytical way. Finite element models are given to validate the method proposed in this study. Conclusion According to the results, for AFPMM with SRSSS, the axial force is reduced as the translation error rises when only the translation error exists. If there is only a deflection error existing, the axial force is increased with the growth of deflection error while the axial force is decreased with the increment of g(0). The amplitude of axial force fluctuation rises as deflection error is increased. When translation error and deflection error both exist, the tendency of a translation error and deflection error on the axial force is the same as that when either translation error or deflection error exists alone. The FE results have validated all the results.

TI Translating the ARM Neon and VFP instructions in a binary translator
SO SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB Binary translation attempts to emulate one instruction set with another on the same or different platforms. The important technique is widely used in modern software. Vector and floating-point instructions are widely used in many applications, including multimedia, graphics, and gaming. Although these instructions are usually simulated with software in a binary translator, it is important to support them such that the host single-instruction, multiple-data (SIMD) and floating-point hardware are efficiently used during emulation. We report our design and implementation of the emulation of ARM Neon and vector floating point (VFP) instructions in the machine-code-to-low-level-virtual-machine (MC2LLVM) binary translator. The Neon and VFP instructions are first translated into carefully chosen sequences of LLVM intermediate representation (IR), and later, the IR sequences are optimized and translated into the host native binary by the existing LLVM backend. Because MC2LLVM makes use of the vector and floating-point types in LLVM IR, the generated host native binary can take full advantage of the vector and floating-point functional units, if present, of the host machine. To be fully compliant with Neon and VFP instruction sets, all the features are supported, including the flush-to-zero mode, default not a number mode, and floating-point exceptions. The experimental results show that code generated by MC2LLVM with the Neon and VFP extensions achieves an average speedup of 1.174x in SPEC 2006 benchmark suites and exhibits a floating-point throughput of 12.05x in LINPACK, compared with code generated by MC2LLVM without the Neon and VFP extensions. Furthermore, MC2LLVM is 3.36x faster than QEMU for processing Neon/VFP instructions. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Maximizing upgrading and downgrading margins for ordinal regression
SO MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH
AB In ordinal regression, a score function and threshold values are sought to classify a set of objects into a set of ranked classes. Classifying an individual in a class with higher (respectively lower) rank than its actual rank is called an upgrading (respectively downgrading) error. Since upgrading and downgrading errors may not have the same importance, they should be considered as two different criteria to be taken into account when measuring the quality of a classifier. In Support Vector Machines, margin maximization is used as an effective and computationally tractable surrogate of the minimization of misclassification errors. As an extension, we consider in this paper the maximization of upgrading and downgrading margins as a surrogate of the minimization of upgrading and downgrading errors, and we address the biobjective problem of finding a classifier maximizing simultaneously the two margins. The whole set of Pareto-optimal solutions of such biobjective problem is described as translations of the optimal solutions of a scalar optimization problem. For the most popular case in which the Euclidean norm is considered, the scalar problem has a unique solution, yielding that all the Pareto-optimal solutions of the biobjective problem are translations of each other. Hence, the Pareto-optimal solutions can easily be provided to the analyst, who, after inspection of the misclassification errors caused, should choose in a later stage the most convenient classifier. The consequence of this analysis is that it provides a theoretical foundation for a popular strategy among practitioners, based on the so-called ROC curve, which is shown here to equal the set of Pareto-optimal solutions of maximizing simultaneously the downgrading and upgrading margins.

AB Virtualization is becoming widely deployed in commercial servers. In our previous study, we proposed Virtual Machine Aware journaling (VMA journaling), a file system journaling approach for virtual server environments. With reliable VMM and hardware subsystems, VMA journaling eliminates journal writes while ensuring file system consistency and data integrity in virtual server environments, allowing it to be an effective alternative to traditional journaling approaches in these environments.
   In recent years, solid-state disks (SSDs) have shown their potential as a replacement of traditional magnetic disks in commercial servers. In this paper, we demonstrate the benefits of VMA journaling on SSDs. We compare the performance of VMA journaling and three traditional journaling approaches (i.e., the three journaling modes of the ext3 journaling file system) in terms of lifetime and garbage collection overhead, which are two key performance metrics for SSDs. Since a Flash Translation Layer (FTL) is used in an SSD to emulate traditional disk interface and the SSD performance highly depends on the FTL being used, three state-of-the-art FTLs (i.e., FAST, SuperBlock FTL and DFTL) are implemented for performance evaluation.
   The performance results show that, traditional full data journaling could reduce the lifetime of the SSD significantly. VMA journaling extends the SSD lifetime under full data journaling by up to 86.5%. Moreover, GC overhead is reduced by up to 80.6% when compared to the full data journaling approach of ext3. Finally, VMA journaling is effective under all the FTLs. These results demonstrate that VMA journaling is effective in SSD-based virtual server environments.

AB Since the past two decades, measurements of angular instantaneous speed have been widely used in different applications in rotating machines by the help of optical or magnetic encoders. For example in geared systems, Transmission Error measurements can be achieved with high accuracy for detecting gear faults and could be extended to torsion vibration measurements. Recently in High Speed Machining, we have shown that tool wear can be monitored by measuring instantaneous rotating speed of the spindle. The particular accuracy of these measurements compared to usual time sampled ones is the straight consequence of the rotating behavior observation through the angular domain, which makes this monitoring resistive to speed fluctuations. Although this past experimental background drove this assertion to become widely admitted in the practical field, angular sampling still lacks from the similar theoretical background. Angular translated motion equations are therefore suspected to depict the dynamic behavior of rotating machines in a more direct manner than the commonly applied.
   We propose in this paper a new way of writing motion equations of rotating parts in the angular domain. This leads to express all the time derivatives as angular variable derivatives through the instantaneous rotating speed. Several simple models of applications in rotating machines will be presented in order to show that simulation of their behavior is easier and exhibits more comprehensive phenomena. Particularly under localized external forces like bearing faults or more generally with mechanical parameters depending on angular position, a comparison between the classical time approach and the proposed angular method will be presented in order to emphasize the opportunity of using such a modeling in rotating machines.

AB This paper presents a simple method and new material which allow transferring results of surgical planning - such as the implant fixture axis - to the surgical site. This method is based on drilling a linear guide in a resin splint corresponding to the fixture axis. A simple mechanical setup links the Computed Tomography (CT) data set with the drilling machine. Since the optimal fixture axis is determined with a software interface, it can be transferred as a linear guide to the resin splint with the drilling machine. Technical validation demonstrates that the accuracy of the method is 0.2 mm in translation and 1 degree in rotation. These results provide a high level of accuracy and clinical validation has begun with several patients. The results for the patients care very satisfactory.

   Memory (LSTM)
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Recently, with the development of Speech to Text, which converts voice to text, and machine translation, technologies for simultaneously translating the captions of video into other languages have been developed. Using this, YouTube, a video-sharing site, provides captions in many languages. Currently, the automatic caption system extracts voice data when uploading a video and provides a subtitle file converted into text. This method creates subtitles suitable for the running time. However, when extracting subtitles from video using Speech to Text, it is impossible to accurately translate the sentence because all sentences are generated without periods. Since the generated subtitles are separated by time units rather than sentence units, and are translated, it is very difficult to understand the translation result as a whole. In this paper, we propose a method to divide text into sentences and generate period marks to improve the accuracy of automatic translation of English subtitles. For this study, we use the 27,826 sentence subtitles provided by Stanford University's courses as data. Since this lecture video provides complete sentence caption data, it can be used as training data by transforming the subtitles into general YouTube-like caption data. We build a model with the training data using the LSTM-RNN (Long-Short Term Memory - Recurrent Neural Networks) and predict the position of the period mark, resulting in prediction accuracy of 70.84%. Our research will provide people with more accurate translations of subtitles. In addition, we expect that language barriers in online education will be more easily broken by achieving more accurate translations of numerous video lectures in English.

AB A variety of agent-oriented programming languages based on concepts such as beliefs and goals has been proposed in the literature. Even though most of these languages now come with interpreters implemented in e.g. Java and can be used to write software agents, there is little work reporting how to implement such languages or to identify a core instruction set that would facilitate such implementation. In this paper we introduce a compiler for the language GOAL into the framework of Jazzyk Behavioural State Machines. The result is a translation of key agent concepts such as beliefs and goals into Jazzyk which lacks these notions, thus providing some evidence that it may provide a sufficient instruction set for implementing agent programs. Moreover, arguably, the implementation strategy used can be applied also to other agent programming languages.

AB We designed a real time, single-laser focus tracking system using low coherence properties of the machining femtosecond laser itself in order to monitor and correct the sample position relative to the focal plane. Using a Michelson Interferometer, the system collects data arising from part of the beam backscattered at the ablation spot. The data is analyzed by a custom software for position correction (employing an XYZ automated translation stage). With the focus tracking enabled we were able to etch channels with a stable cross-section profile on a bovine tooth with relief amplitude tens of times greater than the Rayleigh length of the system, keeping the sample inside the confocal parameter during most of the processing time. Moreover, the system is also capable of monitoring crater depth evolution during the ablation process, allowing for material removal assessment.

AB A booming amount of information is continuously added to the Internet as structured and unstructured data, feeding knowledge bases such as DBpedia and Wikidata with billions of statements describing millions of entities. The aim of Question Answering systems is to allow lay users to access such data using natural language without needing to write formal queries. However, users often submit questions that are complex and require a certain level of abstraction and reasoning to decompose them into basic graph patterns. In this short paper, we explore the use of architectures based on Neural Machine Translation called Neural SPARQL Machines to learn pattern compositions. We show that sequence-to-sequence models are a viable and promising option to transform long utterances into complex SPARQL queries.

TI Basecalling Using Joint Raw and Event Nanopore Data Sequence-to-Sequence
   Processing
SO SENSORS
AB Third-generation DNA sequencers provided by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) produce a series of samples of an electrical current in the nanopore. Such a time series is used to detect the sequence of nucleotides. The task of translation of current values into nucleotide symbols is called basecalling. Various solutions for basecalling have already been proposed. The earlier ones were based on Hidden Markov Models, but the best ones use neural networks or other machine learning models. Unfortunately, achieved accuracy scores are still lower than competitive sequencing techniques, like Illumina's. Basecallers differ in the input data type-currently, most of them work on a raw data straight from the sequencer (time series of current). Still, the approach of using event data is also explored. Event data is obtained by preprocessing of raw data and dividing it into segments described by several features computed from raw data values within each segment. We propose a novel basecaller that uses joint processing of raw and event data. We define basecalling as a sequence-to-sequence translation, and we use a machine learning model based on an encoder-decoder architecture of recurrent neural networks. Our model incorporates twin encoders and an attention mechanism. We tested our solution on simulated and real datasets. We compare the full model accuracy results with its components: processing only raw or event data. We compare our solution with the existing ONT basecaller-Guppy. Results of numerical experiments show that joint raw and event data processing provides better basecalling accuracy than processing each data type separately. We implement an application called Ravvent, freely available under MIT licence.

TI An approach to the Gaussian RBF kernels via Fock spaces
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We use methods from the Fock space and Segal-Bargmann theories to prove several results on the Gaussian RBF kernel in complex analysis. The latter is one of the most used kernels in modern machine learning kernel methods and in support vector machine classification algorithms. Complex analysis techniques allow us to consider several notions linked to the radial basis function (RBF) kernels, such as the feature space and the feature map, using the so-called Segal-Bargmann transform. We also show how the RBF kernels can be related to some of the most used operators in quantum mechanics and time frequency analysis; specifically, we prove the connections of such kernels with creation, annihilation, Fourier, translation, modulation, and Weyl operators. For the Weyl operators, we also study a semigroup property in this case. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

AB Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks has been shown to be capable of learning long time dependencies, and has been successfully applied to many studies, such as machine translation, speech recognition and air pollution concentration prediction. The present research has shown that the presence of missing data could dramatically degrade the results of data mining and categorical predictions with the aid of the machine learning technique including LSTM networks. Therefore, this paper focuses on imputation of missing data in the time series of air pollutants using LSTM networks to improve the PM2.5 concentration prediction accuracy. Experimental result shows that the proposed LSTM-based imputation method presents better PM2.5 concentration prediction accuracy than mean-imputation method and moving average imputation method.

SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Sentiment analysis is a task of natural language processing that has recently attracted increasing attention. However, sentiment analysis research has mainly been carried out for the English language. Although Arabic is ramping up as one of the most used languages on the Internet, only a few studies have focused on Arabic sentiment analysis so far. In this paper, we carry out an in-depth qualitative study of the most important research works in this context by discussing strengths and limitations of existing approaches. In particular, we survey both approaches that leverage machine translation or transfer learning to adapt English resources to Arabic and approaches that stem directly from the Arabic language.

Ideally, these are basic vocabulary units suitable for different tasks, such as speech and text understanding, machine translation, information retrieval, and statistical language modeling. Twelve research groups participated in the challenge and had submitted segmentation results obtained by their algorithms. In this paper, we evaluate the application of these segmentation algorithms to large vocabulary speech recognition using statistical n-gram language models based on the proposed word segments instead of entire words. Experiments were done for two agglutinative and morphologically rich languages: Finnish and Turkish. We also investigate combining various segmentations to improve the performance of the recognizer.

SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PSYCHIATRIE PSYCHOLOGIE UND PSYCHOTHERAPIE
AB Computational psychiatry is a young research field which attempts to bring advances from theoretical and experimental neurosciences to bear on clinical issues in psychiatry. The motivation for the use of computational techniques arises from the complexity of psychiatric phenomena. Computational techniques facilitate the measurement of intrapsychic processes that are not otherwise directly observable (e.g. learning processes) and allow phenomena arising at different levels of description to be related, for instance the impact of ion channel disturbances on short-term memory. Methods from machine learning can be combined with such models and facilitate the analysis of larger, complex datasets. Although there are promising leads, the effort is in its initial stages and it may be appropriate to adopt procedures from the development of pharmaceutical to speed up the validation and translation of computational efforts.

The three degree of freedom parallel translating manipulator consists of two six degree of freedom limbs and a compound limb which constrains the moving platform of the output to translation motion. Closed form solutions of the parallel manipulator are developed for both the inverse and forward kinematics. The Jacobian matrix of the parallel translating manipulator is also derived. The parallel manipulator has the identical performance along the direction of the actuated linear slides for their parallel to one another. It can be explained from the elements' expression of the Jacobian matrix of the parallel translating manipulator. Finally a three degree of freedom parallel machine tool based on the parallel manipulator is also presented for the application of it.

AB This chapter draws upon the author's experimental video artwork Comfortable and Alive, made with the Japanese gynoid robot Geminoid-F by ATR Hiroshi Ishiguro Laboratories, to facilitate a wider, yet fractional, discussion of the cultural provenance and potential integration of specifically female-appearing android robots (gynoids). The "display architecture" of the gynoid can be viewed as an aesthetic emulation by robot designers of the centuries-old characterization of girls and women as naive, pretty, submissive and soothing; this construction also pervades televised and other media. At the present time it is viewed as ideal that the service gynoid should make humans feel comfortable, most often in companionship, entertainment, hostessing, and reception roles. The artwork raises poignant issues pertaining to machine translation, and human-machine affinity, in context of the replication in robots of societal gender norms.

AB Automatic cancer diagnosis based on RNA-Seq profiles is at the intersection of transcriptome analysis and machine learning. Methods developed for this task could be a valuable support in clinical practice and provide insights into the cancer causal mechanisms. To correctly approach this problem, the largest existing resource (The Cancer Genome Atlas) must be complemented with healthy tissue samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. In this work, we empirically prove that previous approaches to joining these databases suffer from translation biases and correct them using batch z-score normalization. Moreover, we propose CanDLE, a multinomial logistic regression model that achieves state of the art performance in multilabel cancer/healthy tissue type classification (94.1% balanced accuracy) and all-vs-one cancer type detection (78.0% average max F-1).

AB This paper presents an approach to retargetable SMT-constrained symbolic execution of machine code. The retargetability is based on an existing open-source processor architecture description language which has been used for processor design and automatic generation of toolchains for dynamic program analysis. The benefit of the presented approach is that with a given architecture description, no manual writing of an instruction set grammar or of a translation of instruction semantics into logics is necessary. The proposed tool architecture relies on language reflection, code generation and dynamic loading to retarget symbolic execution to different machine code syntax. Instruction semantics is translated into SMT bit-vector logic equations by symbolically interpreting the architecture description language. The approach is implemented as plug-in extension to the Eclipse IDE and evaluated by automatically detecting integer overflows in binaries for the ARMv5 and SPARCv8 architectures.

TI Defining brain-machine interface applications by matching interface
   performance with device requirements
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS
AB Interaction with machines is mediated by human-machine interfaces (HMIs). Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) are a particular class of HMIs and have so far been studied as a communication means for people who have little or no voluntary control of muscle activity. In this context, low-performing interfaces can be considered as prosthetic applications. On the other hand, for able-bodied users, a BMI would only be practical if conceived as an augmenting interface. In this paper, a method is introduced for pointing out effective combinations of interfaces and devices for creating real-world applications. First, devices for domotics, rehabilitation and assistive robotics, and their requirements, in terms of throughput and latency, are described. Second, HMIs are classified and their performance described, still in terms of throughput and latency. Then device requirements are matched with performance of available interfaces. Simple rehabilitation and domotics devices can be easily controlled by means of BMI technology. Prosthetic hands and wheelchairs are suitable applications but do not attain optimal interactivity. Regarding humanoid robotics, the head and the trunk can be controlled by means of BMIs, while other parts require too much throughput. Robotic arms, which have been controlled by means of cortical invasive interfaces in animal studies, could be the,next frontier for non-invasive BMIs. Combining smart controllers with BMIs could improve interactivity and boost BMI applications. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The packaging of the eukaryotic genome into chromatin regulates the storage of genetic information, including the access of the cell's DNA metabolism machinery. Indeed, since the processes of DNA replication, translation, and repair require access to the underlying DNA, several mechanisms, both active and passive, have evolved by which chromatin structure can be regulated and modified. One mechanism relies upon the function of chromatin remodeling enzymes which couple the free energy obtained from the binding and hydrolysis of ATP to the mechanical work of repositioning and rearranging nucleosomes. Here, we review recent work on the nucleosome mobilization activity of this essential family of molecular machines.

AB In this paper, iris recognition system using wavelet packet and support vector machines is presented. It specifically uses the multiresolution decomposition of 2-D discrete wavelet packet transform for extracting the unique features from the acquired iris image. This method of feature extraction is well suited to describe the shape of the iris while allowing the algorithm to be translation and rotation invariant. The SVM approach for comparing the similarity between the similar and different irises can be assessed to have the feature's discriminative power. We have showed that the proposed method for human iris recognition gave a way of representing iris patterns in an efficient manner and thus had advantages of saving both time and space. Thanks to the efficiency of the proposed method, it can be easily applied to the real problems.

TI A METHOD OF MEASURING THE STEREOMETRIC PARAMETERS OF WORKING UNITS OF
   MINING MACHINES EQUIPPED WITH CONICAL PICKS
SO ARCHIVES OF MINING SCIENCES
AB The efficiency of mining the rock and other materials with mining machines used in the mining, construction and road industry is largely dependant upon the stereometry of their working units. The stereometry is determined at the design stage using dedicated software, individually for the mining machine's specific working conditions. Inspecting the conformity of pickboxes' arrangement and setting to the working documentation plays an important part in the manufacturing process of working units for mining machines. The inspection generally consists of measuring the stereometric parameters being a set of values determining a position on the side surface and spatial arrangement of each pickbox. The methods currently in use are very time- and work-consuming and feature poor accuracy, especially when measuring angles determining the spatial arrangement of individual pickboxes. The design and operation of the instruments used for this purpose is often complicated.
   The measurement method and mathematical measurement model established allow to determine, relatively easily, the spatial arrangement and setting of pickboxes at the side surface of working units in mining machines equipped with conical picks (tangential rotary) with the required measuring accuracy using typical measuring instruments used commonly in the metrology of geometric values and in the coordination measuring technique. It is an indirect method based on the measurement of translation coordinates of three non-collinear characteristic measuring points for the pickbox in the three-dimensional space of the measuring station.

AB The application fields of bytecode virtual machines and VLIW processors overlap in the area of embedded and mobile systems, where the two technologies offer different benefits, namely high code portability, low power consumption and reduced hardware cost. Dynamic compilation makes it possible to bridge the gap between the two technologies, but special attention must be paid to software instruction scheduling, a must for the VLIW architectures.
   We have implemented JIST, a Virtual Machine and JIT compiler for Java Bytecode targeted to a VLIW processor. We show the impact of various optimizations on the performance of code compiled with JIST through the experimental study on a set of benchmark programs. We report significant speed ups, and increments in the number of instructions issued per cycle up to 50% with respect to the non-scheduling version of the JIT compiler. Further optimizations are discussed.

AB In the present globalized society, people from all over the world are coming and working together. The biggest hurdle in this process is the medium of interaction, as all individuals do not speak a common language. A way to circumvent this problem is to develop a machine based system for recognition of different languages and subsequently employing automatic machine translation mechanism for communication between people from diverse language or dialect groups. A MFCC and GMM based approach for recognition of dialects of Himachal Pradesh has been presented in this paper. Around seven dialects spoken in different regions of Himachal Pradesh have been used in this study. The results obtained shows that dialects spoken in adjacent regions have significant overlap and are difficult to distinguish. Accuracy for offline and online tests was respectively around 80% and 70%.

TI Annual Research Review: Translational machine learning for child and

SO JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY
AB Children and adolescents could benefit from the use of predictive tools that facilitate personalized diagnoses, prognoses, and treatment selection. Such tools have not yet been deployed using traditional statistical methods, potentially due to the limitations of the paradigm and the need to leverage large amounts of digital data. This review will suggest that a machine learning approach could address these challenges and is designed to introduce new readers to the background, methods, and results in the field. A rationale is first introduced followed by an outline of fundamental elements of machine learning approaches. To provide an overview of the use of the techniques in child and adolescent literature, a scoping review of broad trends is then presented. Selected studies are also highlighted in order to draw attention to research areas that are closest to translation and studies that exhibit a high degree of experimental innovation. Limitations to the research, and machine learning approaches generally, are outlined in the penultimate section highlighting issues related to sample sizes, validation, clinical utility, and ethical challenges. Finally, future directions are discussed that could enhance the possibility of clinical implementation and address specific questions relevant to the child and adolescent psychiatry. The review gives a broad overview of the machine learning paradigm in order to highlight the benefits of a shift in perspective towards practically oriented statistical solutions that aim to improve clinical care of children and adolescents.

AB In this paper, we model a PersoArabic to Latin transliteration system as grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) and word lattice methods combined with statistical machine translation (SMT). Persian is an Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European family of languages belonging to Arabic script-based languages. Our transliteration model is induced from a parallel corpus containing the PersoArabic script of a Persian book together with its Romanized transcription in Dabire. We manually aligned the sentences of this book in both scripts and used it as a parallel corpus. Our results indicate that the performance of the system is improved by adding grapheme-to-phoneme and word lattice methods for out-of-vocabulary handling task into the monotonic statistical machine transliteration system. In addition, the final performance on the test corpus shows that our system achieves comparable results with other state-of-the-art systems.

TI Evaluation of fish feeding intensity in aquaculture using a
   convolutional neural network and machine vision
SO AQUACULTURE
AB In aquaculture, information on fish appetite is of great significance for guiding feeding and production practices. However, most fish appetite assessment methods are inefficient and subjective. To solve these problems, in this study, an automatic method for grading fish feeding intensity based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and machine vision is proposed to evaluate fish appetite. The specific implementation process was as follows. First, images were collected during the feeding process, and a dataset was constructed and extended using rotation, scale, and translation (RST) augmentation techniques and noise-invariant data expansion. Then, a CNN was trained on the training dataset, and the fish appetite levels were graded using the trained CNN model. Finally, the performance of the method was evaluated and compared with other quantitative and qualitative feeding intensity assessment methods. The results show that the grading accuracy reached 90%; thus, the model can be used to detect and evaluate fish appetite to guide production practices.

TI Deciphering clinical abbreviations with a privacy protecting machine
   learning system
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Physicians write clinical notes with abbreviations and shorthand that are difficult to decipher. Abbreviations can be clinical jargon (writing "HIT" for "heparin induced thrombocytopenia"), ambiguous terms that require expertise to disambiguate (using "MS" for "multiple sclerosis" or "mental status"), or domain-specific vernacular ("cb" for "complicated by"). Here we train machine learning models on public web data to decode such text by replacing abbreviations with their meanings. We report a single translation model that simultaneously detects and expands thousands of abbreviations in real clinical notes with accuracies ranging from 92.1%-97.1% on multiple external test datasets. The model equals or exceeds the performance of board-certified physicians (97.6% vs 88.7% total accuracy). Our results demonstrate a general method to contextually decipher abbreviations and shorthand that is built without any privacy-compromising data. Patient notes contain shorthand and abbreviations that may be jargon or clinical vernacular. Here the authors train large machine learning models on public web data to decode such text by replacing abbreviations with their meanings.

TI Parameter identification and tuning of the servo system of a 3-HSS
   parallel kinematic machine
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB Aimed at a parallel kinematic machine with three translational degrees of freedom, a method on the parameter identification and tuning of the electromechanical servo system is presented. At first, position, velocity and acceleration inverse solution models of a machine driven by the outer translation pairs that contain parallelogram strut structures are developed, and the inverse dynamics model of the rigid body has been set up by means of the virtual work principle. In the parameter identification process, the triangular-shaped input with variable frequency is adopted to overcome the disadvantages of a pseudo-random number sequence. Moreover, the rotary inertia of the motor can also be identified by the additive mass. Based on the above, making the mean square error of the trajectory of the moving platform as small as possible is the optimum goal, and considering the real-time variational inertial load along with its pose at the same time, the optimum range of PID parameters are given through simulations. Finally, the validity and effectiveness of the method are proved by the experiments.

TI Defining and distinguishing infant behavioral states using acoustic cry
   analysis: is colic painful?
SO PEDIATRIC RESEARCH
AB Background To characterize acoustic features of an infant's cry and use machine learning to provide an objective measurement of behavioral state in a cry-translator. To apply the cry-translation algorithm to colic hypothesizing that these cries sound painful. Methods Assessment of 1000 cries in a mobile app (ChatterBaby(TM)). Training a cry-translation algorithm by evaluating >6000 acoustic features to predict whether infant cry was due to a pain (vaccinations, ear-piercings), fussy, or hunger states. Using the algorithm to predict the behavioral state of infants with reported colic. Results The cry-translation algorithm was 90.7% accurate for identifying pain cries, and achieved 71.5% accuracy in discriminating cries from fussiness, hunger, or pain. The ChatterBaby cry-translation algorithm overwhelmingly predicted that colic cries were most likely from pain, compared to fussy and hungry states. Colic cries had average pain ratings of 73%, significantly greater than the pain measurements found in fussiness and hunger (p < 0.001, 2-sample t test). Colic cries outranked pain cries by measures of acoustic intensity, including energy, length of voiced periods, and fundamental frequency/pitch, while fussy and hungry cries showed reduced intensity measures compared to pain and colic. Conclusions Acoustic features of cries are consistent across a diverse infant population and can be utilized as objective markers of pain, hunger, and fussiness. The ChatterBaby algorithm detected significant acoustic similarities between colic and painful cries, suggesting that they may share a neuronal pathway.

TI Building virtual communities of practice in post-editing training: A
   mixed-method quasi-experimental study
SO JOURNAL OF SPECIALISED TRANSLATION
AB Since post-editing of machine translation has become a widespread practice in the language service industry, post-editing training has been increasingly included in translation courses. The purpose of the study is to investigate the feasibility of implementing a virtual community of practice (VCoP) in training future post-editors that meet the market's needs. A VCoP refers to a social group sharing a common interest in an argument or a problem, interacting with each other by networks (Davis and Goodman 2014). Based on this concept, a VCoP method is postulated to facilitate online post-editing courses. It is a method in which students learn how to post-edit and how to manage a post-editing project by actively engaging in a VCoP. To test the feasibility of this method, a quasi-experimental study was carried out at Hunan University in China. Thirty first-year translation postgraduates participated in the study. Fifteen students were taught virtually using the VCoP method, while fifteen students were taught by the same tutor in a face-to-face classroom. A comparison of students' performance in the two post-editing classes indicated that the VCoP method fostered students' self-reflection and self-assessment, and ultimately helped improve post-editing quality. Students' perceptions of the VCoP method were generally positive, showing its usability.

TI Effect of ACL deficiency on MCL strains and joint kinematics
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
AB The knee joint is partially stabilized by the interaction of multiple ligament structures. This study tested the interdependent functions of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the medial collateral ligament (MCL) by evaluating the effects of ACL deficiency on local MCL strain while simultaneously measuring joint kinematics under specific loading scenarios. A structural testing machine applied anterior translation and valgus rotation (limits 100 N and 10 N m, respectively) to the tibia of ten human cadaveric knees with the ACL intact or severed. A three-dimensional motion analysis system measured joint kinematics and MCL tissue strain in 18 regions of the superficial MCL. ACL deficiency significantly increased MCL strains by 1.8% (p < 0.05) during anterior translation, bringing ligament fibers to strain levels characteristic of microtrauma. In contrast, ACL transection had no effect on MCL strains during valgus rotation (increase of only 0.1%). Therefore, isolated valgus rotation in the ACL-deficient knee was nondetrimental to the MCL. The A CL was also found to promote internal tibial rotation during anterior translation, which in turn decreased strains near the femoral insertion of the MCL. These data advance the basic structure-function understanding of the MCL, and may benefit the treatment of ACL injuries by improving the knowledge of ACL function and clarifying motions that are potentially harmful to secondary stabilizers.

AB Ensemble involves combining the outputs of multiple models to increase performance. This technique has enjoyed great success across many fields in machine learning. This study focuses on a novel approach to increase performance of a model without any increase in number of parameters. The proposed approach involves training a model that can have different variations that perform well and different enough for ensemble. The variations are created by changing the order of the layers of a machine learning model. Moreover, this method can be combined with existing ensemble technique to further improve the performance.
   The task chosen for evaluating the performance is machine translation with Transformer, as Transformer is the current state-of-the-art model for this task as well as many natural language processing tasks. The IWSLT 2014 German to English and French to English datasets see an increase of at least 0.7 BLEU score over single model baseline with the same model size. When combined with multiple model ensemble, minimum increase of 0.3 BLEU is observed with no increase in parameters.

AB Run-time monitoring of JavaScript applications is typically achieved either by instrumenting a browser's virtual machine, usually degrading performance to the level of a simple interpreter, or through complex ad hoc source-to-source transformations. This paper reports on an experiment in layering a portable JS VM on the host VM to expose implementation-level operations that can then be redefined at run-time to monitor an application execution. Our prototype, Photon, exposes object operations and function calls through a meta-object protocol. In order to limit the performance overhead, a dynamic translation of the client program selectively modifies source elements and run-time feedback optimizes monitoring operations. Photon introduces a 4.7x to 191x slowdown when executing benchmarks on popular web browsers. Compared to the Firefox interpreter, it is between 5.5x slower and 7x faster, showing the layering approach is competitive with the instrumentation of a browser VM while being faster and simpler than other source-to-source transformations.

TI A content spectral-based text representation
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
AB In the last few years, text analysis has grown as a keystone in several domains for solving many real-world problems, such as machine translation, spam detection, and question answering, to mention a few. Many of these tasks can be approached by means of machine learning algorithms. Most of these algorithms take as input a transformation of the text in the form of feature vectors containing an abstraction of the content. Most of recent vector representations focus on the semantic component of text, however, we consider that also taking into account the lexical and syntactic components the abstraction of content could be beneficial for learning tasks. In this work, we propose a content spectral-based text representation applicable to machine learning algorithms for text analysis. This representation integrates the spectra from the lexical, syntactic, and semantic components of text producing an abstract image, which can also be treated by both, text and image learning algorithms. These components came from feature vectors of text. For demonstrating the goodness of our proposal, this was tested on text classification and complexity reading score prediction tasks obtaining promising results.

AB In this paper we propose the Color plane Slicing method, a technique to achieve a higher temporal resolution of a phenomena of interest than what is typically achievable by cameras. This is done by using a color camera and strobe lights of different colors at small intervals of time apart. The method, although simple, poses several advantages and applications to machine vision sensors which currently only inspect objects but do not characterize their motion in the context of automation and inspection. Although, the color information is traded for temporal information, we show that the framework is not restrictive for objects with or without colors. Also, the system can continue to be used as a traditional camera for quality inspection with a local translation applied to the formed composite image. Further, potential applications are discussed wherein the system is appended to an industrial grade Smart camera for ease of use. The applicability of the technique is also shown for motion characterization and vibration measurement.

AB The digitalization of the legal domain has been ongoing for a couple of years. In that process, the application of different machine learning (ML) techniques is crucial. Tasks such as the classification of legal documents or contract clauses as well as the translation of those are highly relevant. On the other side, digitized documents are barely accessible in this field, particularly in Germany. Today, deep learning (DL) is one of the hot topics with many publications and various applications. Sometimes it provides results outperforming the human level. Hence this technique may be feasible for the legal domain as well. However, DL requires thousands of samples to provide decent results. A potential solution to this problem is multi-task DL to enable transfer learning. This approach may be able to overcome the data scarcity problem in the legal domain, specifically for the German language. We applied the state of the art multi-task model on three tasks: translation, summarization, and multi-label classification. The experiments were conducted on legal document corpora utilizing several task combinations as well as various model parameters. The goal was to find the optimal configuration for the tasks at hand within the legal domain. The multi-task DL approach outperformed the state of the art results in all three tasks. This opens a new direction to integrate DL technology more efficiently in the legal domain.

TI Lon protease degrades transfer-messenger RNA-tagged proteins
SO JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY
AB Bacterial trans translation is activated when translating ribosomes are unable to elongate or terminate properly. Small protein B (SmpB) and transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) are the two known factors required for and dedicated to trans translation. tmRNA, encoded by the ssrA gene, is a bifunctional molecule that acts both as a tRNA and as an mRNA during trans translation. The functions of tmRNA ensure that stalled ribosomes are rescued, the causative defective mRNAs are degraded, and the incomplete polypeptides are marked for targeted proteolysis. We present in vivo and in vitro evidence that demonstrates a direct role for the Lon ATP-dependent protease in the degradation of tmRNA-tagged proteins. In an endogenous protein tagging assay, ton mutants accumulated excessive levels of tmRNA-tagged proteins. In a reporter protein tagging assay with lambda-CI-N, the protein product of a nonstop mRNA construct designed to activate trans translation, Ion mutant cells efficiently tagged the reporter protein, but the tagged protein exhibited increased stability. Similarly, a green fluorescent protein (GFP) construct containing a hard-coded C-terminal tmRNA tag (GFP-SsrA) exhibited increased stability in Ion mutant cells. Most significantly, highly purified Lon preferentially degraded the tmRNA-tagged forms of proteins compared to the untagged forms. Based on these results, we conclude that Lon protease participates directly in the degradation of tmRNA-tagged proteins.

TI Cross-lingual text alignment for fine-grained plagiarism detection
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE
AB Fast and easy access to a wide range of documents in various languages, in conjunction with the wide availability of translation and editing tools, has led to the need to develop effective tools for detecting cross-lingual plagiarism. Given a suspicious document, cross-lingual plagiarism detection comprises two main subtasks: retrieving documents that are candidate sources for that document and analysing those candidates one by one to determine their similarity to the suspicious document. In this article, we examine the second subtask, also called the detailed analysis subtask, where the goal is to align plagiarised fragments from source and suspicious documents in different languages. Our proposed approach has two main steps: the first step tries to find candidate plagiarised fragments and focuses on high recall, followed by a more precise similarity analysis based on dynamic text alignment that will filter the results by finding alignments between the identified fragments. With these two steps, the proximity of the terms will be considered in different levels of granularity. In both steps, our approach uses a dictionary to obtain translations of individual terms instead of using a machine translation system to convert longer passages from one language to another. We used a weighting scheme to distinct multiple translations of the terms. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the methods used by the systems that achieved the best results in the PAN-2012 and PAN-2014 competitions.

TI Lateral Patellofemoral Ligament Reconstruction: A Biomechanical
   Comparison of 2 Techniques
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
AB Background: The importance of maintaining lateral patellar stabilizing structures has been demonstrated by the presence of iatrogenic medial patellar instability after lateral retinacular release (LRR) procedures. In patients with medial patellar instability, lateral patellofemoral ligament (LPFL) reconstruction has been clinically shown to restore patellar stability while improving patient-reported outcomes. However, the biomechanics associated with different LPFL reconstruction techniques remain largely unknown. Purpose: To (1) investigate whether LPFL reconstruction restores medial patellar translation compared with the intact state after LRR and (2) evaluate for any biomechanical differences between soft tissue and osseous LPFL reconstruction techniques. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: A total of 7 knees were included in the final analysis. The knees were dissected, and the tibia and femur were potted. An eye screw was then placed at the midpoint of the patella perpendicular to the medial surface. A custom jig was constructed to allow for a 1-kg load to be applied to the quadriceps muscle. Medial patellar displacement was investigated at 0 degrees, 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees of knee flexion using a tensile testing machine with a 20-N medial force applied to the patella. Medial patellar displacement was assessed in 4 states: intact, LRR, soft tissue LPFL reconstruction (inserted through incisions in the iliotibial band, quadriceps tendon, and patellar tendon), and osseous LPFL reconstruction. Results: The LRR group had significantly greater medial patellar translation compared with the intact group throughout flexion (P < .01 to P = .029). The soft tissue LPFL reconstruction group demonstrated significantly greater medial patellar translation at 30 degrees (P = .020) and 45 degrees (P = .025) compared with the intact group, with less translation compared with the LRR group at all degrees of knee flexion except for 45 degrees (P = .065). The osseous LPFL reconstruction group demonstrated significantly greater medial patellar translation compared with the intact group at 30 degrees of flexion (P = .036), with significantly less translation compared with the LRR group from 0 degrees to 30 degrees (P < .01 to P = .013). The soft tissue LPFL reconstruction group (15.94 +/- 2.55 mm) demonstrated significantly greater medial patellar translation at 10 degrees of flexion compared with the osseous LPFL reconstruction group (14.16 +/- 2.34 mm) (P = .033). Conclusion: Soft tissue LPFL reconstruction led to significantly greater medial patellar translation at 30 degrees and 45 degrees compared with the intact state, while osseous LPFL reconstruction produced significantly greater translation only at 30 degrees. Both the soft tissue and the osseous reconstruction techniques resulted in comparable medial patellar translation at all degrees of knee flexion except for 10 degrees, in which osseous reconstruction was more similar to the intact state.

AB Text-to-Speech (TTS), an astounding feature to assemble computer with intelligence and to induce sound is seemingly a challenging task as it is related to the propagation of uncertainty with the input. This is because TTS evolutes the input based on the probabilities and not with certainty ratios. TTS is accomplished by generating the sound structure/phoneme and then classifying these phonemes in the phonetic dictionary. The Wards' algorithms, BIRCH, Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used to figure out the appropriate sound representation for the given context. To distinguish correct elocution, the SVM procedures are equipped with the principles of pruning. The output was analyzed using divergent stages of uncertainty. In order to study the effect of the output 10 listeners were considered for determining Signal-to-Noise (SNR) ratio. SNR shows that the errors of both type phase and uncertainty were approximately 6% resulting 94% of accuracy. These results manifested that SVM stratagem can be used to obtain better results for TTS synthesizer.

TI PROGRAM OPTIMIZATION AND PARALLELIZATION USING IDIOMS
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS
AB Programs in languages such as Fortran, Pascal, and C were designed and written for a sequential machine model. During the last decade, several methods to vectorize such programs and recover other forms of parallelism that apply to more advanced machine architectures have been developed (particularly for Fortran, due to its pointer-free semantics). We propose and demonstrate a more powerful translation technique for making such programs run efficiently on parallel machines which support facilities such as parallel prefix operations as well as parallel and vector capabilities. This technique, which is global in nature and involves a modification of the traditional definition of the program dependence graph (PDG), is based on the extraction of parallelizable program structures (''idioms'') from the given (sequential) program. The benefits of our technique extend beyond the above-mentioned architectures and can be viewed as a general program optimization method, applicable in many other situations. We show a few examples in which our method indeed outperforms existing analysis techniques.

TI Druggable protein prediction using a multi-canal deep convolutional
   neural network based on autocovariance method
SO COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB Drug targets must be identified and positioned correctly to research and manufacture new drugs. In this study, rather than using traditional methods for drug expansion, the drug target is determined using machine learning. Machine learning has generated significant interest and desire in recent years and extensive research due to its low cost and speed of operation. As a result, it is critical to develop an intelligent classification system for drug proteins. This study proposes two distinct models for the prediction of druggable protein classes based on the deep learning method. The translation of drug-protein sequences is based on six physicochemical properties of amino acids. Following the application of the autocovariance method, converted sequences are used as fixedlength input vectors in deep stacked sparse auto-encoders (DSSAEs) network. The coded protein sequences are also considered and utilized as a six-channel input vector for the deep convolutional neural network model. The experimental results contributing to the deep convolution model are more efficient than previous studies for classifying druggable proteins. The proposed approach achieved a sensitivity of 96.92%, a specificity of 99.51%, and an accuracy of 98.29%.

TI Evaluating Variations in Tropical Cyclone Precipitation in Eastern
   Mexico Using Machine Learning Techniques
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
AB Tropical Cyclone Precipitation (TCP) is one of the major triggers of flash flooding and landslide in eastern Mexico. We apply different statistical and machine learning techniques to study a 99 years TCP climatology in high resolution. Strong correlations exist between location variables and annual mean TCP, as well as between dynamic variables and event TCP. Topographic variables observe mixed signals with the elevation variances positively correlated with TCP. The Random Forest (RF) model is a powerful tool with excellent fitting and predicting skills for TCP variations. It has a very small out-of-sample cross-validation error and well captures the spatial variations of historical TCP events. Only three location variables are needed to construct the best model for the annual mean TCP while the best model needs 18 variables to explain the complex variations in the event TCP. The distance to the track is the most important variable for the event TCP model and many other factors contribute to the TCP collectively and nonlinearly, which can't be captured fully by the previous correlation analysis. They include translation characteristics of the storms, locations of the precipitation grid, and topography. Event TCP is generally larger in storms with slower translation speed and more variance in their tracks. While the lower coastal area generally has a higher probability of TCP, the higher inland has elevation variances that enhance less frequent but extreme TCP events. The RF algorithm is an efficient machine learning approach showing potentials for future Quantitative Precipitation Forecasting (QPF).
   Plain Language Summary Tropical Cyclone Precipitation (TCP) is one of the major triggers of flash flooding and landslide in eastern Mexico. We apply different statistical and machine learning techniques to study a 99 year TCP climatology in high resolution. We show that the Random Forest (RF) model is a powerful tool to understand and predict the TCP with high accuracy. Our model demonstrates that locations are most important to the spatial distribution of the long term mean TCP. The event TCP is controlled by multiple factors. More event TCP is observed when: 1) the location is near to the track and near to the coast; 2) the storm is slowly moving and its track has more changes; 3) the location has large elevation changes to enhance the TCP. Our model shows great potentials in these types of machine learning techniques for Quantitative Precipitation Forecasting (QPF) in the future.

AB A discrete kinematic geometry (DKG) approach is proposed in this paper to deal with the kinematic behavior of testing a machine tool linear axis when geometry errors are taken into consideration. An apparatus is set up in connection with a newly acquired 6D high-precision measurement instrument to investigate the actual motion of a worktable (three translations and three rotations) using the proposed model and the measurement data. The invariants for the evaluation of the discrete error motions, especially the spherical image curve and the directrix (Wang and Wang in Kinematic differential geometry and saddle synthesis of linkages. Wiley, Singapore, 2015, 1) are analyzed and compared with the ideal curves, which produce some remarkable global invariants of the erroneous motion of the worktable like the spherical envelope circle error surface and the directrix error space. Three test cases are presented to illustrate how the DKG approach is used to evaluate the accuracy of a machine tool linear axis in a comprehensive and systematical way.

TI The Accidental Philosopher and One of the Hardest Problems in the World
SO PHILOSOPHIES
AB Given the difficulties of defining "machine" and "think", Turing proposed to replace the question "Can machines think?" with a proxy: how well can an agent engage in sustained conversation with a human? Though Turing neither described himself as a philosopher nor published much on philosophical matters, his Imitation Game has stood the test of time. Most understood at that time that success would not come easy, but few would have guessed just how difficult engaging in ordinary conversation would turn out to be. Despite the proliferation of language processing tools, we have seen little progress towards doing well at the Imitation Game. Had Turing instead suggested ability at games or even translation as a proxy for intelligence, his paper might have been forgotten. We argue that these and related problems are amenable to mechanical, though sophisticated, formal techniques. Turing appears to have taken care to select sustained, productive conversation and that alone as his proxy. Even simple conversation challenges a machine to engage in the rich practice of human discourse in all its generality and variety.

AB Micro-tunnel ling often encounters restrictions expanding into new areas. In the Netherlands, and more general in soft soils, one of the problems is the controlled boring of curves. To better understand the behaviour of the tunnel boring machine in such conditions, an analytical model has been developed, that takes translation and rotation of the TBM into account. The model takes the subgrade reaction and the stiffness of the soil into account as major parameters describing the soil behaviour. It is shown that the subgrade reaction in the inner and outer curve of the TBM differs substantially and a subgrade reduction factor is introduced in the model to deal with this effect. A first derivation of the subgrade reduction factor was made comparing field measurements with model parameter variations. In this paper a full three-dimensional finite element simulation is presented, using large deformation analysis to model the movement of the TBM through the soil, which has been used to study the behaviour of the micro-tunnel machine in more detail and derive the subgrade reduction factor.

TI Methods for automatically evaluating answers to complex questions
SO INFORMATION RETRIEVAL
AB Evaluation is a major driving force in advancing the state of the art in language technologies. In particular, methods for automatically assessing the quality of machine output is the preferred method for measuring progress, provided that these metrics have been validated against human judgments. Following recent developments in the automatic evaluation of machine translation and document summarization, we present a similar approach, implemented in a measure called POURPRE, an automatic technique for evaluating answers to complex questions based on n-gram co-occurrences between machine output and a human-generated answer key. Until now, the only way to assess the correctness of answers to such questions involves manual determination of whether an information "nugget" appears in a system's response. The lack of automatic methods for scoring system output is an impediment to progress in the field, which we address with this work. Experiments with the TREC 2003, TREC 2004, and TREC 2005 QA tracks indicate that rankings produced by our metric correlate highly with official rankings, and that POURPRE outperforms direct application of existing metrics.

SO PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS
AB In this paper, we propose an efficient multiple classifier system for Arabic handwritten words recognition. First, we use Chebyshev moments (CM) enhanced with some Statistical and Contour-based Features (SCF) for describing word images. Then, we combine several classifiers integrated at the decision level. We consider the multilayer perceptron (MLP), the support vector machine (SVM) and the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifiers. We propose several combination rules between MLP, SVM and ELM classifiers trained with CM and SCF features. Further, we consider a second level of combination that merges three best rules among the proposed ones. The system is evaluated on the IFN/ENIT database and compared to some well-known systems for Arabic handwriting recognition. The numerical results are competitive and show that our system is able to achieve a global recognition rate equal to 96.82% for the considered dataset. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB We describe the algorithms and architecture approach to produce high-performance codes for numerically intensive computations. In this approach, for a given computation, we design algorithms so that they perform optimally when run on a target machine-in this case, the new POWER2(TM) machines from the RS/6000 family of RISC processors. The algorithmic features that we emphasize are functional parallelism, cache/register blocking, algorithmic prefetching, loop unrolling, and algorithmic restructuring. The architectural features of the POWER2 machine that we describe and that lead to high performance are multiple functional units, high bandwidth between registers, cache, and memory, a large number of fixed- and floating-point registers, and a large cache and TLB (translation lookaside buffer). The paper gives two examples that illustrate how the algorithms and architectural features interplay to produce high-performance codes. They are BLAS (basic linear algebra subroutines) and narrow-band matrix routines. These routines are included in ESSL (Engineering and Scientific Subroutine Library); an overview of ESSL is also given in the paper.

TI A Real-Time Automatic Translation of Text to Sign Language
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Communication is a basic need of every human being; by this, they can learn, express their feelings and exchange their ideas, but deaf people cannot listen and speak. For communication, they use various hands gestures, also known as Sign Language (SL), which they learn from special schools. As normal people have not taken SL classes; therefore, they are unable to perform signs of daily routine sentences (e.g., what are the specifications of this mobile phone?). A technological solution can facilitate in overcoming this commu-nication gap by which normal people can communicate with deaf people. This paper presents an architecture for an application named Sign4PSL that translates the sentences to Pakistan Sign Language (PSL) for deaf people with visual representation using virtual signing character. This research aims to develop a generic independent application that is lightweight and reusable on any platform, including web and mobile, with an ability to perform offline text translation. The Sign4PSL relies on a knowledge base that stores both corpus of PSL Words and their coded form in the notation system. Sign4PSL takes English language text as an input, performs the translation to PSL through sign language notation and displays gestures to the user using virtual character. The system is tested on deaf students at a special school. The results have shown that the students were able to understand the story presented to them appropriately.

AB Many automated multi-axis machines operate under,open loop' control. The exact position in space of the end effecter or tool head is not sensed directly. The software controlling the robots or automated manufacturing machines make a calculated estimate of where the tool-head should be. This is often achieved by monitoring sensors on axes that track linear translation and rotations of shafts or gears. For low precision applications this system is appropriate. However, positional errors often occur. This method may not be suitable for high precision robots and automated machine tools. There exists a need for a sensor system that is capable of acquiring the exact spatial coordinates of the tool point or end effector directly. The aim of this research project was to design a low cost sensor system that would precisely locate the tool points' spatial coordinates directly by 'closed loop' control. This aided in the reduction of errors encountered in 'open loop' control. The system was capable of seamless integration with existing techniques for motion control. The sensor system was able to locate the tool head in 2D space. With simple additions and modifications it rendered itself applicable to 3Dspace location of the tool head. It was modular, sufficiently robust and error immune such that it would work in almost any environment.

AB This paper presents the development of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models for the prediction of laser machined internal micro-channels' dimensions and production costs. In this work, a pulsed Nd:YVO4 laser was used for machining micro-channels in polycarbonate material. Six ANN multi-layered, feed-forward, back-propagation models are presented which were developed on three different training data sets. The analysed data was obtained from a 3(3) factorial design of experiments (DoE). The controlled parameters were laser power, P; pulse repetition frequency, PRF; and sample translation speed; U. Measured responses were the micro-channel width and the micro-machining operating cost per metre of produced micro channel. The responses were sufficiently predicted within the set micro-machining parameters limits. Three carefully selected statistical criteria were used for comparing the performance of the ANN predictive models. The comparison showed that model which had the largest amount of training data provided the highest degree of predictability. However, in cases where only a limited amount of ANN training data was available, then training data taken from a Face Centred Cubic (FCC) model design provided the highest level of predictability compared with the other examined training data sets.

TI A NEW TESTING MACHINE TO DETERMINE THE BEHAVIOUR OF ALUMINIUM GRANULATE
   UNDER COMBINED PRESSURE AND SHEAR
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATERIAL FORMING
AB To reduce the environmental impact and increase the yield from conventional recycling processes of aluminium a direct continuous extrusion method of shredded scrap is being developed. The innovative new method is based on a process where a rotating screw generates the extrusion pressure, introducing rotation to the scrap compacting and extruding in one single process. The objective of this paper is to present a testing machine for compactation of aluminium granulate representing this process in a simplified manner. A machine, which is capable of imposing rotational and linear translations, has been built for the purpose of compacting granulate under different pressures, torques and strain rates at different temperatures to study the influence of these parameters. The compactation of granulate under both high pressure and rotation at elevated temperature is a generic way of representing the thermo-mechanical conditions in this recycling process. The paper describes the developed machine, its features and capabilities in detail. Two initial tests, with and without rotation, have been carried out. The material used was an aluminum alloy AA6060 wire cut in appropriate sizes. It is shown how simultaneous rotation and compression reduce the necessary pressure for full achieving compactation of the granulate.

AB Optical Character Recognition is conversion of printed or handwritten text images into machine-encoded text. It is a building block of many processes such as machine translation, text-to-speech conversion and text mining. Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks have shown a superior performance in character recognition with respect to other types of neural networks. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we propose the first hardware architecture of Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network with Connectionist Temporal Classification for Optical Character Recognition. Based on the new architecture, we present an FPGA hardware accelerator that achieves 459 times higher throughput than state-of-the-art. Visual recognition is a typical task on mobile platforms that usually use two scenarios either the task runs locally on embedded processor or offloaded to a cloud to be run on high performance machine. We show that computationally intensive visual recognition task benefits from being migrated to our dedicated hardware accelerator and outperforms high-performance CPU in terms of runtime, while consuming less energy than low power systems with negligible loss of recognition accuracy.

TI Smart system to generate the optimal authorized bounding volume
SO OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL
AB Purpose The overall functioning of this system is based on two approaches: construction and supervision. The first is conducted entirely by the machine, and the second requires the intervention of the designer to collaborate with the machine. The morphological translation of urban rules is sometimes contradictory and may require additional external relevance to urban rules. Designer arbitration assists the artificial intelligence (AI) in accomplishing this task and solving the problem. Design/methodology/approach This paper provides a method of computational design in generating the optimal authorized bounding volume which uses the best target values of morphological urban rules. It examines an intelligent system, adopting the multi-agent approach, which aims to control and increase urban densification by optimizing morphological urban rules. The process of the system is interactive and iterative. It allows collaboration and exchange between the machine and the designer. This paper is adopting and developing a new approach to resolve the distributed constraint optimization problem in generating the authorized bounding volume. The resolution is not limited to an automatic volume generation from urban rules, but also involves the production of multiple optimal-solutions conditioned both by urban constraints and relevance chosen by the designer. The overall functioning of this system is based on two approaches: construction and supervision. The first is conducted entirely by the machine and the second requires the intervention of the designer to collaborate with the machine. The morphological translation of urban rules is sometimes contradictory and may require additional external relevance to urban rules. Designer arbitration assists the AI in accomplishing this task and solving the problem. The human-computer collaboration is achieved at the appropriate time and relies on the degree of constraint satisfaction. This paper shows and analyses interactions with the machine during the building generation process. It presents different cases of application and discusses the relationship between relevance and constraints satisfaction. This topic can inform a chosen urban densification strategy by assisting a typology of the optimal authorized bounding volume. Findings The human-computer collaboration is achieved at the appropriate time and relies on the degree of constraint satisfaction with fitness function. Originality/value The resolution of the distributed constraint optimization problem is not limited to an automatic generation of urban rules, but involves also the production of multiple optimal ABV conditioned both by urban constraints as well as relevance, chosen by the designer.

This machine emulates the translational capabilities of the ribosome. The device has been prototyped to make specific DNA sequences. The state of the device is established by the addition of DNA set strands. There is no transcriptional relationship between the set strands and the product strands. The device has potential applications that include designer polymer synthesis, encryption of information, and use as a variable-input device for DNA-based computation.

We discuss the five IBM alignment models, the Hidden-Maxkov alignment model, smoothing techniques and various modifications. We present different methods to combine alignments. As evaluation criterion we use the quality of the resulting Viterbi alignment compared to a manually produced reference alignment. We show that models with a first-order dependence and a fertility model lead to significantly better results than the simple models IBM-1 or IBM-2, which are not able to go beyond zero-order dependencies.

TI Context-Aware Automatic Sign Language Video Transcription in Psychiatric
   Interviews
SO SENSORS
AB Sign language (SL) translation constitutes an extremely challenging task when undertaken in a general unconstrained setup, especially in the absence of vast training datasets that enable the use of end-to-end solutions employing deep architectures. In such cases, the ability to incorporate prior information can yield a significant improvement in the translation results by greatly restricting the search space of the potential solutions. In this work, we treat the translation problem in the limited confines of psychiatric interviews involving doctor-patient diagnostic sessions for deaf and hard of hearing patients with mental health problems.To overcome the lack of extensive training data and be able to improve the obtained translation performance, we follow a domain-specific approach combining data-driven feature extraction with the incorporation of prior information drawn from the available domain knowledge. This knowledge enables us to model the context of the interviews by using an appropriately defined hierarchical ontology for the contained dialogue, allowing for the classification of the current state of the interview, based on the doctor's question. Utilizing this information, video transcription is treated as a sentence retrieval problem. The goal is predicting the patient's sentence that has been signed in the SL video based on the available pool of possible responses, given the context of the current exchange. Our experimental evaluation using simulated scenarios of psychiatric interviews demonstrate the significant gains of incorporating context awareness in the system's decisions.

TI Neutron: an attention-based neural decompiler
SO CYBERSECURITY
AB Decompilation aims to analyze and transform low-level program language (PL) codes such as binary code or assembly code to obtain an equivalent high-level PL. Decompilation plays a vital role in the cyberspace security fields such as software vulnerability discovery and analysis, malicious code detection and analysis, and software engineering fields such as source code analysis, optimization, and cross-language cross-operating system migration. Unfortunately, the existing decompilers mainly rely on experts to write rules, which leads to bottlenecks such as low scalability, development difficulties, and long cycles. The generated high-level PL codes often violate the code writing specifications. Further, their readability is still relatively low. The problems mentioned above hinder the efficiency of advanced applications (e.g., vulnerability discovery) based on decompiled high-level PL codes.In this paper, we propose a decompilation approach based on the attention-based neural machine translation (NMT) mechanism, which converts low-level PL into high-level PL while acquiring legibility and keeping functionally similar. To compensate for the information asymmetry between the low-level and high-level PL, a translation method based on basic operations of low-level PL is designed. This method improves the generalization of the NMT model and captures the translation rules between PLs more accurately and efficiently. Besides, we implement a neural decompilation framework called Neutron. The evaluation of two practical applications shows that Neutron's average program accuracy is 96.96%, which is better than the traditional NMT model.

   algorithms for financial distress prediction
SO APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
AB We set out in this study to review a vast amount of recent literature on machine learning (ML) approaches to predicting financial distress (FD), including supervised, unsupervised and hybrid supervised-unsupervised learning algorithms. Four supervised ML models including the traditional support vector machine (SVM), recently developed hybrid associative memory with translation (HACT), hybrid GA-fuzzy clustering and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were compared in prediction performance to the unsupervised classifier deep belief network (DBN) and the hybrid DBN-SVM model, whereby a total of sixteen financial variables were selected from the financial statements of the publicly-listed Taiwanese firms as inputs to the six approaches. Our empirical findings, covering the 2010-2016 sample period, demonstrated that among the four supervised algorithms, the XGBoost provided the most accurate FD prediction. Moreover, the hybrid DBN-SVM model was able to generate more accurate forecasts than the use of either the SVM or the classifier DBN in isolation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Experimental results show that, compared with the reference system, this model can significantly improve the effect of word alignment, which is applicable.

AB Light pen coordinate measuring system is a kind of vision-based portable coordinate measuring technique. It implements coordinate measuring by analyzing the image of light pen, which has several control points. With the relative positons of the control points determined and the pixel coordinates of their image points acquired by image processing, the posture of light pen can be obtained by solving perspectiven-point problem. Therefore, the control point positons serve as the measuring basis of the whole system. However, the accuracy of existing calibration methods is not satisfactory. In this paper, a new method of control point positon calibration, which utilizes traditional coordinate measuring machine, is proposed. The light pen is fasten to the measuring arm of a coordinate measuring machine and moves along a three dimensional grid route driven by the machine. A stationary camera is located in front of the machine to capture the image of light pen at each node of the route. For each control point, an individual coordinate system is established. Then the relative positions of control points can be transformed into the differences of a series of translation vectors. Experiments show that, with the proposed method, the accuracy of light pen coordinate measuring system can reach 30 m within 10 meters.

AB Ontologies provide advantages of knowledge reusability, sharing, and greater robustness when used to build large knowledge-based applications. Unfortunately, translating between English statements and a specific ontology requires skill in knowledge engineering and all understanding of formal logic and the ontology itself. A knowledge engineer must be familiar with the concepts in the ontology, the fine distinctions between terms. and the specific way the ontology conceptualizes the world.
   We are developing a tool, CELT (Controlled English to Logic Translation), to enable non-programmers to add knowledge expressed in terms of an ontology. CELT is all automatic translation tool to convert controlled English to KIF formulas using ontologies built with the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO). WordNet provides a base lexicon and a default preference for word senses. We do not expect CELT to obviate the need for knowledge engineers but to instead better leverage their time, as current machine translation tools assist professional human translators.
   CELT uses Discourse Representation Theory to handle the translation of multiple sentences, the use of logical quantifiers, and the resolution of anaphoric referents. Individual sentences are parsed using a Definite Clause Grammar augmentcd with feature grammar extensions.
   CELT is domain-independent but can be customized for particular domains by providing domain -specific ontologies and lexicons. The lexicons call specify both technical terms and domain-specific preferred word senses for common terms. CELT translates sentences to assertions and queries for a first-order logic theorem prover.

TI A Lubricated Nonimmunogenic Neural Probe for Acute Insertion Trauma
   Minimization and Long-Term Signal Recording
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) that link the brain to a machine are promising for the treatment of neurological disorders through the bi-directional translation of neural information over extended periods. However, the longevity of such implanted devices remains limited by the deterioration of their signal sensitivity over time due to acute inflammation from insertion trauma and chronic inflammation caused by the foreign body reaction. To address this challenge, a lubricated surface is fabricated to minimize friction during insertion and avoid immunogenicity during neural signal recording. Reduced friction force leads to 86% less impulse on the brain tissue, and thus immediately increases the number of measured signal electrodes by 102% upon insertion. Furthermore, the signal measurable period increases from 8 to 16 weeks due to the prevention of gliosis. By significantly reducing insertion damage and the foreign body reaction, the lubricated immune-stealthy probe surface (LIPS) can maximize the longevity of implantable BMIs.

AB Multilingual semantic parsing is a cost-effective method that allows a single model to understand different languages. However, researchers face a great imbalance of availability of training data, with English being resource rich, and other languages having much less data. To tackle the data limitation problem, we propose using machine translation to bootstrap multilingual training data from the more abundant English data. To compensate for the data quality of machine translated training data, we utilize transfer learning from pretrained multilingual encoders to further improve the model. To evaluate our multilingual models on humanwritten sentences as opposed to machine translated ones, we introduce a new multilingual semantic parsing dataset in English, Italian and Japanese based on the Facebook Task Oriented Parsing (TOP) dataset. We show that joint multilingual training with pretrained encoders substantially outperforms our baselines on the TOP dataset and outperforms the state-of-the-art model on the public NLMaps dataset. We also establish a new baseline for zero-shot learning on the TOP dataset. We find that a semantic parser trained only on English data achieves a zero-shot performance of 44.9% exact-match accuracy on Italian sentences.

CT 7th International Symposium on Mathematical Morphology
CY APR 18-20, 2005
CL Paris, FRANCE
AB Mathematical Morphology (MM) is a general framework for studying mappings between complete lattices. In particular, mappings between binary images that are translation invariant and locally defined within a window are of special interest in MM. They are called W-operators. A key aspect of MM is the representation of W-operators in terms of dilations, erosions, intersection, union, complementation and composition. When W-operators are expressed in this form, they are called morphological operators. An implementation of this decomposition structure is called morphological machine (MMach). A remarkable property of this decomposition structure is that it can be represented efficiently by graphs called Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs). In this paper, we propose a new architecture for MMachs that is based on BDDs. We also show that reduced and ordered BDDs (ROBDDs) are non-ambiguous schemes for representing W-operators and we present a method to compute them. This procedure can be applied for the automatic proof of equivalence between morphological operators, since the W-operator they represent are equal if and only if they have the same ROBDD.

AB In living systems, polypeptide chains are synthesised on ribosomes, molecular machines composed of over 50 protein and nucleic acid molecules. As nascent chains emerge from the ribosomal exit tunnel and into the cellular environment, the majority must fold into specific structures in order to function. In this article we discuss recent approaches designed to reveal how such folding occurs and review our current knowledge of this complex self-assembly process.

The problem is much further confounded by the fact that MT evaluations properly done require a considerable commitment of time and resources, an anachronism in this day of cross-lingual information processing when new MT systems may developed in weeks instead of years. This paper surveys the needs addressed by several of the classic "types" of MT, and speculates on ways that each of these types might be automated to create relevant, near-instantaneous evaluation of approaches and systems.

TI Natural Language Processing Applications: A New Taxonomy using Textual
   Entailment
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB Textual entailment recognition is one of the recent challenges of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain. Deep learning strategies are used in the work of text entailment instead of traditional Machine learning or raw coding to achieve new enhanced results. Textual entailment is also used in the substantial applications of NLP such as summarization, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and information verification. Text entailment is more precise than traditional Natural Language Processing techniques in extracting emotions from text because the sentiment of any text can be clarified by textual entailment. For this purpose, when combining a textual entailment with deep learning, they can hugely showed an improvement in performance accuracy and aid in new applications such as depression detection. This paper lists and describes applications of natural language processing regarding textual entailment. Various applications and approaches are discussed. Moreover, datasets, algorithms, resources, and performance evaluation for each model is included. Also, it compares textual entailment application models according to the method used, the result for each model, and the pros and cons of each model.

AB As machine learning algorithms continue to improve, collecting training data becomes increasingly valuable. At the same time, increased focus on data collection may introduce compounding privacy concerns. Accessibility projects in particular may put vulnerable populations at risk, as disability status is sensitive, and collecting data from small populations limits anonymity. To help address privacy concerns while maintaining algorithmic performance on machine learning tasks, we propose privacy-enhancing distortions of training datasets. We explore this idea through the lens of sign language video collection, which is crucial for advancing sign language recognition and translation. We present a web study exploring signers' concerns in contributing to video corpora and their attitudes about using filters, and a computer vision experiment exploring sign language recognition performance with filtered data. Our results suggest that privacy concerns may exist in contributing to sign language corpora, that filters (especially expressive avatars and blurred faces) may impact willingness to participate, and that training on more filtered data may boost recognition accuracy in some cases.

TI Findings from machine learning in clinical medical imaging applications
   - Lessons for translation to the forensic setting
SO FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL
AB Machine learning (ML) techniques are increasingly being used in clinical medical imaging to automate distinct processing tasks. In post-mortem forensic radiology, the use of these algorithms presents significant challenges due to variability in organ position, structural changes from decomposition, inconsistent body placement in the scanner, and the presence of foreign bodies. Existing ML approaches in clinical imaging can likely be transferred to the forensic setting with careful consideration to account for the increased variability and temporal factors that affect the data used to train these algorithms. Additional steps are required to deal with these issues, by incorporating the possible variability into the training data through data augmentation, or by using atlases as a pre-processing step to account for death-related factors. A key application of ML would be then to highlight anatomical and gross pathological features of interest, or present information to help optimally determine the cause of death. In this review, we highlight results and limitations of applications in clinical medical imaging that use ML to determine key implications for their application in the forensic setting.

AB Though nearest neighbor Machine Translation (kNN-MT) (Khandelwal et al., 2020) has proved to introduce significant performance boosts over standard neural MT systems, it is prohibitively slow since it uses the entire reference corpus as the datastore for the nearest neighbor search. This means each step for each beam in the beam search has to search over the entire reference corpus. kNN-MT is thus two-orders slower than vanilla MT models, making it hard to be applied to real-world applications, especially online services. In this work, we propose Fast kNN-MT to address this issue. Fast kNN-MT constructs a significantly smaller datastore for the nearest neighbor search: for each word in a source sentence, Fast kNN-MT first selects its nearest tokenlevel neighbors, which is limited to tokens that are the same as the query token. Then at each decoding step, in contrast to using the entire corpus as the datastore, the search space is limited to target tokens corresponding to the previously selected reference source tokens. This strategy avoids search through the whole datastore for nearest neighbors and drastically improves decoding efficiency. Without loss of performance, Fast kNN-MT is two-orders faster than kNN-MT, and is only two times slower than the standard NMT model. Fast kNN-MT enables the practical use of kNN-MT systems in real-world MT applications.

TI Quick light mixing of multiple color sources for image acquisition using
   pattern search
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRECISION ENGINEERING AND MANUFACTURING
AB Illumination is one of the inspection conditions in industrial machine vision and highly related with image quality. Single light source is commonly used and adjusted to acquire fine images during setup. The image acquisition is described by nonlinear and complex equations, and a color mixing source additionally requires multi-dimensional formulation. So, this paper applied a direct, nondifferential, multi-dimensional search method for optimal illumination conditions using pattern search. The pattern search is one of the optimum methods and was modified for this optimal illumination and multiple color sources in machine vision. The pattern search in this paper was discussed about how to organize a probe network for this optimal illumination of image acquisition. The pattern search was composed of probe network of multiple dimensions, probing sharpness, translation, shrinkage, and terminal condition. The proposed method can maximize image sharpness and minimize iterative adjustment in the test results of an RGB mixer, which was more effective than the case of equal step search. The pattern search algorithm for this optimal illumination provides automatic and quick lighting control in image inspection process. The proposed method decreased the iterations under 1% of conventional search, and it is very efficient on time and energy saving.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED ROBOTIC SYSTEMS
AB Currently, about 60% of the finishing works for freeform parts are done manually, in this paper a parallel kinematic polishing machine (PKPM) with five degrees of freedom (DOFs) and with structural configurations of the type T3R2 (three translations and two rotations) is presented. The PKPM is a variation of the existing METROM Pentapod. The PKPM has a large yaw angle space and, with the aid of an NC rotation table, it can access any given point of the freeform part. A kinematic analysis is developed, an inverse dynamic model based on Kane's equation and the affine projection method is set up in detail, and a real-time and highly efficient inverse dynamic algorithm is developed; the simulation results show that the presented PKPM could achieve an acceleration which is twice that of gravity. A mixed H-2 / H-infinity control method is presented and investigated in order to track the error control of the inverse dynamic model; the simulation results from different conditions show that the mixed H-2 / H-infinity control method could achieve an optimal and robust control performance. This work shows that the presented PKPM has a higher dynamic performance than conventional machine tools.

TI On the diversity of multi-head attention
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
AB Multi-head attention is appealing for the ability to jointly attend to information from different represen-tation subspaces at different positions. In this work, we propose two approaches to better exploit such diversity for multi-head attention, which are complementary to each other. First, we introduce a dis-agreement regularization to explicitly encourage the diversity among multiple attention heads. Specifically, we propose three types of disagreement regularization, which respectively encourage the subspace, the attended positions, and the output representation associated with each attention head to be different from other heads. Second, we propose to better capture the diverse information distributed in the extracted partial-representations with the routing-by-agreement algorithm. The routing algorithm iteratively updates the proportion of how much a part (i.e. the distinct information learned from a speci-fic subspace) should be assigned to a whole (i.e. the final output representation), based on the agreement between parts and wholes. Experimental results on the machine translation, sentence encoding and log-ical inference tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of the proposed approaches, which indicate the necessity of better exploiting the diversity for multi-head attention. While the two strategies individually boost performance, combining them together can further improve the model performance. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Invited Commentary: Off-Roading With Social Epidemiology-Exploration,

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Population health improvements are the most relevant yardstick against which to evaluate the success of social epidemiology. In coming years, social epidemiology must increasingly emphasize research that facilitates translation into health improvements, with continued focus on macro-level social determinants of health. Given the evidence that the effects of social interventions often differ across population subgroups, systematic and transparent exploration of the heterogeneity of health determinants across populations will help inform effective interventions. This research should consider both biological and social risk factors and effect modifiers. We also recommend that social epidemiologists take advantage of recent revolutionary improvements in data availability and computing power to examine new hypotheses and expand our repertoire of study designs. Better data and computing power should facilitate underused analytic approaches, such as instrumental variables, simulation studies and models of complex systems, and sensitivity analyses of model biases. Many data-driven machine-learning approaches are also now computationally feasible and likely to improve both prediction models and causal inference in social epidemiology. Finally, we emphasize the importance of specifying exposures corresponding with realistic interventions and policy options. Effect estimates for directly modifiable, clearly defined health determinants are most relevant for building translational social epidemiology to reduce disparities and improve population health.

AB We define a new notation called netcharts for describing sets of message sequence chart scenarios (MSCs). Netcharts correspond to a distributed version of High-level Message Sequence Charts (HMSCs). Netcharts improve on HMSCs in two respects.
   (i) Netcharts admit a natural and direct translation into communicating finite-state machines, unlike HMSCs, for which the realization problem is nontrivial.
   (ii) Netcharts can describe all regular MSC languages (sets of MSCs in which channel capacities have a finite upper bound), unlike HMSCs, which can only describe finitely-generated regular MSC languages.

The input to the tool are basic information about the system to be specified and a statement describing the specification of the system written in the Malay language. The basic information is used as the basic knowledge about the system. By using this basic knowledge, the specification statement will be translated and semantically interpreted in order to produce an equivalent statement in Z.

AB This paper describes a new approach to solve an inverse classification problem. In many applications of supervised learning, it is of interest to generate a number of synthetic high-dimensional model input from a high dimensional as well output. Recent works have shown the benefit of using artificially augmented data in deep machine learning applications. Especially in image processing augmentation algorithms, e.g., generative adversarial networks (GAN), conditional GANs, variational type of autoencoders, restricted Boltzmann machines, geometric transformations (translation, rotation, and scaling fractional linear Mobius transformation), mixing images, feature space augmentation, etc., are used as methods to solve the problem of limited data space. Furthermore, the classical inverse problem, e.g., reconstruction of images from incomplete data, is still of high interest. There are several studies where the use of deep learning methods in solving inverse problems has shown good results. These studies have been focused on image denoising by, e.g., stacked denoising autoencoders (SDA), removing noisy patterns from images, and image super-resolution by using special type of deep convolutional networks. The proposed approach generates/reconstructs handwritten digits by using compressed sensing (CS) in combination with SAE+SM (Stacked Autoencoder Softmax classification machine) and sparse coding (SC) in forward step.

TI Identification and Correction of Grammatical Errors in Ukrainian Texts
   Based on Machine Learning Technology
SO MATHEMATICS
AB A machine learning model for correcting errors in Ukrainian texts has been developed. It was established that the neural network has the ability to correct simple sentences written in Ukrainian; however, the development of a full-fledged system requires the use of spell-checking using dictionaries and the checking of rules, both simple and those based on the result of parsing dependencies or other features. In order to save computing resources, a pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer) type neural network was used. Such neural networks have half as many parameters as other pre-trained models and show satisfactory results in correcting grammatical and stylistic errors. Among the ready-made neural network models, the pre-trained neural network model mT5 (a multilingual variant of T5 or Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) showed the best performance according to the BLEU (bilingual evaluation understudy) and METEOR (metric for evaluation of translation with explicit ordering) metrics.

TI QUALITY OF POST-EDITED INTERLINGUAL SUBTITLING: FAR MODEL, TRANSLATOR'S
   ASSESSMENT AND AUDIENCE RECEPTION
SO CADERNOS DE TRADUCAO
AB This paper analyzes the quality of machine-translated interlingual subtitles, which were post-edited in the language pair EN/ PT-BR. Our analyses applied the FAR model, a Translation Quality Assessment Model, to the PT-BR subtitles of The Red Sea Diving Resort movie trailer, correlating it to empirical data collected with translators (quality assessment) and audience (reception). Reception data was collected with undergraduate students, which were divided into two groups: the control group that watched the subtitled trailer available on Netflix; and the experimental group that watched the trailer with post -edited subtitles. Quality data was collected with translators and they watched the trailer with post-edited subtitles. We used a 5-point Likert- type scale, a questionnaire and a guided think-aloud protocol to collect our data. Data collected with both translators and students were correlated with the FAR model error scores (Functional Equivalence, Acceptability and Readability). Our results indicate that the post-edited subtitles had good quality in terms of meaning and target language norms; however, the technical parameters had lower quality, which affected the trailer appreciation as reported by most of the audience. Due to the small sample size, further empirical studies are required to obtain solid standards for assessing the quality of post-edited subtitles.

AB In recent years, research in the domain of source code summarization has adopted data-driven techniques pioneered in machine translation (MT). Automatic evaluation metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE, are fundamental to the evaluation of MT systems and have been adopted as proxies of human evaluation in the code summarization domain. However, the extent to which automatic metrics agree with the gold standard of human evaluation has not been evaluated on code summarization tasks. Despite this, marginal improvements in metric scores are often used to discriminate between the performance of competing summarization models.
   In this paper, we present a critical exploration of the applicability and interpretation of automatic metrics as evaluation techniques for code summarization tasks. We conduct an empirical study with 226 human annotators to assess the degree to which automatic metrics reflect human evaluation. Results indicate that metric improvements of less than 2 points do not guarantee systematic improvements in summarization quality, and are unreliable as proxies of human evaluation. When the difference between metric scores for two summarization approaches increases but remains within 5 points, some metrics such as METEOR and chrF become highly reliable proxies, whereas others, such as corpus BLEU, remain unreliable. Based on these findings, we make several recommendations for the use of automatic metrics to discriminate model performance in code summarization.

AB The need to conserve the under-resourced languages is becoming more urgent as some of them are becoming extinct; natural language processing can be used to redress this. Currently, most initiatives around language processing technologies are focusing on western languages such as English and French, yet resources for such languages are already available. Sesotho language is one of the under-resourced Bantu languages; it is mostly spoken in Free State province of South Africa and in Lesotho. Like other parts of South Africa, Free State has experienced a high number of non-Sesotho speaking migrants from neighboring provinces and countries. Such people are faced with serious language barrier problems especially in the informal settlements where everyone tends to speak only Sesotho. As a solution to this, we developed a parallel corpus that has English as a source and Sesotho as a target language and packaged it in UmobiTalk - Ubiquitous mobile speech based learning translator. UmobiTalk is a mobile-based tool for learning Sesotho for English speakers. The development of this tool was based on the combination of automatic speech recognition, machine translation and speech synthesis. This application will be used as an analysis tool for testing accuracy and speed of the corpus. We present the development, testing and evaluation of UmobiTalk in this paper.

TI CYCLOPS reveals human transcriptional rhythms in health and disease
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Circadian rhythms modulate many aspects of physiology. Knowledge of the molecular basis of these rhythms has exploded in the last 20 years. However, most of these data are from model organisms, and translation to clinical practice has been limited. Here, we present an approach to identify molecular rhythms in humans from thousands of unordered expression measurements. Our algorithm, cyclic ordering by periodic structure (CYCLOPS), uses evolutionary conservation and machine learning to identify elliptical structure in high-dimensional data. From this structure, CYCLOPS estimates the phase of each sample. We validated CYCLOPS using temporally ordered mouse and human data and demonstrated its consistency on human data from two independent research sites. We used this approach to identify rhythmic transcripts in human liver and lung, including hundreds of drug targets and disease genes. Importantly, for many genes, the circadian variation in expression exceeded variation from genetic and other environmental factors. We also analyzed hepatocellular carcinoma samples and show these solid tumors maintain circadian function but with aberrant output. Finally, to show how this method can catalyze medical translation, we show that dosage time can temporally segregate efficacy from dose-limiting toxicity of streptozocin, a chemotherapeutic drug. In sum, these data show the power of CYCLOPS and temporal reconstruction in bridging basic circadian research and clinical medicine.

The goal is to provide a comprehensive set of paraphrasing strategies, which can be used in several natural language applications, like text simplification or even machine translation.

We present supervised-to-bandit simulation experiments for several NLP tasks (machine translation, sequence labeling, text classification), showing that bandit learning from relative preferences eases feedback strength and yields improved empirical convergence.

Trained on billions of words, and consisting of billions of parameters, language models often are the single largest components of these systems. There have been many proposed techniques to reduce the storage requirements for language models. A technique based upon pointer-free compact storage of ordinal trees shows compression competitive with the best proposed systems, while retaining the full finite state structure, and without using computationally expensive block compression schemes or lossy quantization techniques.

This system is based around four hardware mechanisms for shared memory: status bits on individual memory blocks, hardware translation of memory addresses to home processors, fast detection of remote accesses, and dedicated thread slots for shared-memory handlers. These mechanisms have been implemented on the MAP processor, and allow remote memory references to be completed in as little as 336 cycles at low hardware cost.

AB Data visualization is a powerful tool for understating information through visual cues. However, allowing novices to create visualization artifacts for what they want to see is not easy, just as not everyone can write SQL queries. Arguably, the most natural way to specify what to visualize is through natural language or speech, similar to our daily search on Google or Apple Siri, leaving to the system the task of reasoning about what to visualize and how.
   In this demo, we present Sevi an end-to-end data visualization system that acts as a virtual assistant to allow novices to create visualizations through either natural language or speech. Sevi is powered by two main components: Speech2Text which is based on Google Cloud Speech-to-Text Rest API, and Text2VIS, which uses an end-to-end neural machine translation model called ncNet trained using a cross-domain benchmark called nvBench. Both ncNet and nvBench have been developed by us. We will walk the audience through two general domain datasets, one related to COVID-19 and the other on NBA player statistics, to highlight how Sevi enables novices to easily create data visualizations. Because nvBench contains Text2VIS training samples from 105 domains (e.g., sport, college, hospital, etc.), the audience can play with speech or text input with any of these domains.

AB In this paper we present a framework for extraction of inference rules from Turkish documents, such as "A solved B similar to A found a solution to B". Many natural language processing tasks, such as question answering, information retrieval and machine translation can benefit tremendously from inference rules. Our framework consists of three layers: construction of dependency trees; determining predicates and their complements and finally discovery of inference rules via clustering. We use Silhouette Index (SI) of the clusters as an automatic evaluation metric.

AB Contour classification methods which operate directly on an image are greatly affected by small magnitude transformations to the image. In this paper, a contour classification method is developed which takes advantage of Curvature Scale Space (CS2) and a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The CS2 representation boasts invariance to transformations including: scaling, rotation, translation and noise. In addition, the linear SVM is a robust tool for classification problems involving multiple labels. The combination of these tools produces a classifier well suited for object recognition in photographs where distortion is present.

TI Passive and active gravity compensation of horizontally-mounted 3-RPS
   parallel kinematic machine
SO MECHANISM AND MACHINE THEORY
AB Taking a horizontally-mounted 3-RPS parallel kinematic machine (PKM) as an example, this paper investigates passive and active gravity compensation strategies for improving PKM precision. Herein, R, P and S denote revolute, actuated prismatic and spherical joint, respectively. Based on inverse position kinematic and force analysis, passive gravity compensation is firstly implemented by three extension springs. Geometric parameters of these springs are optimized by minimizing potential energy fluctuation within a prescribed workspace. Then deformation caused by gravity is adopted to evaluate compensation strategies. The deviations of an end reference point demonstrate that passive gravity compensation is capable of substantially balancing gravity. In order to further eliminate the effect of gravity, active gravity compensation is proposed to adjust spring displacements by several one degree-of-freedom (DoF) translational mechanisms. Deformation of the 3-RPS PKM is directly regarded as the objective function for determining the active translations. Overall, both passive and active gravity compensations are able to improve mechanism precision due to the partial and complete gravity balancing capability, respectively, which makes the 3-RPS PKM suitable for the application of rough and fine machining.

TI Performance analysis of least squares support vector regression
   filtering system
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
AB Support vector machine (SVM) is always researched and developed as a machine learning method on the base of statistical learning theory. As viewed from signal and system, the least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) with the translation invariant kernel is a linear time invariant system. Taking the Ricker wavelet kernel as an example, we investigate the effects of different parameters on frequency responses of the least squares support vector regression (LS-SVR) filter. Those parameters affect the rising edge, the band width and central frequency of passband, and also the attenuation of signal energy. In other words, the longer the length of LS-SVR filter, the sharper the rising edge generated; the larger the kernel parameter, the higher the central frequency and the wider the bandwidth of the passband; the smaller the regularization parameter, the narrower the bandwidth of passband and the greater the attenuation of the desired signal. The experimental results of synthetic seismic data show that the LS-SVR filter with the Ricker wavelet kernel works better than the LS-SVR filter with the RBF kernel, the wavelet transform-based method and adaptive Wiener filtering method.

TI Generating efficient tiled code for distributed memory machines
SO PARALLEL COMPUTING
AB Tiling can improve the performance of nested loops on distributed memory machines by exploiting coarse-grain parallelism and reducing communication overhead and frequency. Tiling calls for a compilation approach that performs first computation distribution and then data distribution, both possibly on a skewed iteration space. This paper presents a suite of compiler techniques for generating efficient SPMD programs to execute rectangularly tiled iteration spaces on distributed memory machines. The following issues are addressed: computation and data distribution, message-passing code generation, memory management and optimisations. and global to local address translation. Methods are developed for partitioning arbitrary iteration spaces a:nd skewed data spaces. Techniques for generating efficient message-passing code for both arbitrary and rectangular iteration spaces are presented. A storage scheme for managing both local and nonlocal references is developed, which leads to the SPMD code with high locality of references. Two memory optimisations are given to reduce the amount of memory usage for skewed iteration spaces and expanded arrays, respectively. The proposed compiler techniques are illustrated using a simple running example and finally analysed and evaluated based on experimental results on a Fujitsu AP1000 consisting of 128 processors.

In this article, we present a bilingual data selection method that leverages a continuous vector-space representation of word sequences for selecting the best subset of a bilingual corpus, for the application of training a machine translation system. We compared our proposal with a state-of-the-art data selection technique (cross-entropy) obtaining very promising results, which were coherent across different language pairs.

It also provides pipelined processing, whereby predictions made at a lower level (e.g. for words) can be used as input to build models for predictions at a higher level (e.g. sentences). QuEST++ allows the extraction of a variety of features, and provides machine learning algorithms to build and test quality estimation models. Results on recent datasets show that QuEST++ achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TI Fast and robust infrared small target detection based on a combination
   of hand-designed features and machine-designed features
SO REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
AB Infrared small target detection is widely used in precision guided weapons and early warning systems. It is very difficult to detect small target in infrared image because the target is small in size and weak in texture information. The traditional methods can't make full use of the characteristics of the target which results in a low detection rate and a high false alarm rate, and do not consider the complexity of the algorithm which makes it difficult to apply to systems with high real-time requirements. This letter proposes a method that combines hand-designed features and machine-designed features for fast and accurate infrared small target detection. First of all, the region of interest is extracted by the proposed local weighted intensity difference method and local eight-direction gradient method. Then, the detection decision map is constructed to improve the detection speed and compose the decomposed target. Finally, the non-translation invariant CoordConv is used to detect target in the region of interest, which solves the defect that the translation invariance of traditional convolution loses the hand-designed features in the region of interest. Numerous experimental results demonstrate our method has the best detection performance compared with baseline methods, while keeps the lowest detection time.

AB With the exponential growth of genomic sequences, there is an increasing demand to accurately identify protein coding regions from genomic sequences. Despite many progresses being made in the identification of protein coding regions by computational methods during recent years, the performances and efficiencies of the prediction methods still need to be improved. A novel method to predict the position of coding regions is proposed. First, a support vector machine is used as a classifier to recognize the first nucleotide of a codon in a coding region. Then, according to the difference of the time frequency characteristics of the output values of the classifier analyzed by Short Time Fourier Transform, the position of coding regions can be accurately determinate. The algorithm is not only can predict coding regions, but also can identify the first nucleotide of the codon in coding regions. This is very significant for accurate translation into a protein sequence. The simulation results show the proposed method is more effective for coding regions prediction than the existing coding region discovery tools.

TI PAGODE - A BACK END GENERATOR USING ATTRIBUTE ABSTRACT SYNTAXES AND TERM
   REWRITINGS
SO LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB A major problem in deriving a compiler from a formal definition is the production of correct and efficient object code.  We propose a solution to this problem in the framework of a compiler writing system where the compilation process may be viewed as successive translations from an attributed abstract syntax to another abstract syntax.  The code-generator generator needs two kinds of specifications:
   - an attributed abstract syntax (AAS) of the target machine:  it is the description of the I.R. given as input to the code-generator.
   - a target machine description where the basic concepts are hierarchically described by tree-patterns.  These tree patterns are terms of the target abstract syntax.
   The code generation process is divided into two steps:  the instructions selection process and the register allocation one.  The instruction selection process applies a set of rewriting rules driven by tree templates derived from the target machine specification to the I.R. term.  The register allocation process consists of several evaluation passes of an attributed grammar derived automatically from the target machine specification.  The first one sets the constraints on temporaries according to the whole context, the second one does life-time analysis and packing on temporaries, the last one assigns effective resources to temporaries.

AB This study focuses on the adaptation of subjects in Human-to-Human (H2H) communication in spontaneous dialogues in two different settings. The speech rate of sixteen dialogues from the HCRC Map Task corpus have been analyzed as direct H2H communication, while fifteen dialogues from the ILMT-s2s corpus have been analyzed as a Speech-to-Speech Machine Translation (S2S-MT) mediated H2H communication comparison. The analysis shows that while the mean speech rate of the subjects in the two task oriented corpora differ, in both corpora the role of the subject causes a significant difference in the speech rate with the Information Giver using a slower speech rate than the Information Follower. Also the different settings of the dialogue recordings (with or without eye contact in the HCRC corpus and with or without live video streaming in the ILMT-s2s corpus) only show a negligible difference in the speech rate. However, the gender of the subjects have provided an interesting difference with the female subjects of the ILMT-s2s corpus using a slower speech rate than the male subjects, gender does not show any difference in the HCRC corpus. This indicates that the difference is not from performing the map task, but a result of their adaptation strategy to the S2S-MT system.

AB Temporal information processing plays an important role in many application areas such as information retrieval, question answering, machine translation, and text summarization. This paper proposes a transformation-based error-driven learning approach to extracting temporal expressions from Chinese unstructured texts. The temporal expression annotator used in the approach is developed based on a Chinese time ontology, which includes concepts of temporal expressions and their taxonomical relations. Experiments in three domains show that our algorithm obtained promising results.

AB Induction of synchronous grammars from empirical data has long been an unsolved problem; despite generative synchronous grammars theoretically suit the machine translation task very well. This fact is mainly due to pervasive structural divergences between languages. This paper presents a statistical approach that learns dependency structure mappings from parallel corpora. The new algorithm automatically learns parallel dependency treelet pairs from loosely matched non-isomorphic dependency trees while keeping computational complexity polynomial in the length of the sentences. A set of heuristics is introduced and specifically optimized for parallel treelet learning purposes using Minimum Error Rate training.

TI A robust and interpretable machine learning approach using multimodal
   biological data to predict future pathological tau accumulation
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) involve interactions between multiple pathophysiological processes. Although these processes are well studied, we still lack robust tools to predict individualised trajectories of disease progression. Here, we employ a robust and interpretable machine learning approach to combine multimodal biological data and predict future pathological tau accumulation. In particular, we use machine learning to quantify interactions between key pathological markers (beta-amyloid, medial temporal lobe atrophy, tau and APOE 4) at mildly impaired and asymptomatic stages of AD. Using baseline non-tau markers we derive a prognostic index that: (a) stratifies patients based on future pathological tau accumulation, (b) predicts individualised regional future rate of tau accumulation, and (c) translates predictions from deep phenotyping patient cohorts to cognitively normal individuals. Our results propose a robust approach for fine scale stratification and prognostication with translation impact for clinical trial design targeting the earliest stages of AD.
   The authors present a machine learning approach that combines baseline multimodal data to accurately predict individualised trajectories of future pathological tau accumulation at asymptomatic and mildly impaired stages of Alzheimer's disease.

TI Measurement method and pipe wall misalignment adjustment algorithm of
   the pipe butting machine
SO MEASUREMENT
AB This paper presents a runout measurement method and a novel finite grouping method to predict and optimize the rotational angle and translational displacement of butting pipes to minimize pipe wall misalignment (PWM). This study develops a method to minimize the PWM of the pipes excluding the positions of welding seams. In this method, the measurement data are divided into finite groups and the criteria are created to identify the positions of welding seams and eliminate the effect of the welding seams. Finally, the rotational angle and translational displacement of the butting pipes are optimized to minimize the PWM. A butting machine is designed to implement this method. The machine is bench marked by a standard smooth pipe to minimize system errors. Three butting experiments have been performed with welded pipes of diameter 406 mm. The comparison shows that the computation results agree with the experimental results very well. The maximum PWMs in three experiments are less than 1.87 mm, which satisfies the butting requirements, that is, a PWM of less than 2.0 mm. Then, the uncertainties of the measurement results are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Grouping of Aspect into Relevant Category Based on Wordnet Definitions
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND NETWORK SECURITY
AB Machine Translation, Information Retrieval and Knowledge Acquisition are the three main applications of sentiment analysis based on aspect word. But in some cases, there may be two aspect words having different spellings, yet belonging to the same aspect category, e.g. the words 'costly' and 'expensive' belong to the same category 'price.' Grouping such aspects into the same category is critical for sentiment analysis. Some have done this by using synonym, LDA (Latent Dirichlet Analysis) groups and Constrained-LDA. The WordNet dictionary is mostly used for such analysis. Although it contains a lot of synonyms, yet sometimes there are such aspects which are not synonymous, but still refer to the same broad category. For example, in the following two sentences: "this camera will not easily fit in a coat pocket" and "this camera is of large size;" aspects 'fit' and 'size' both are not synonyms yet belong to the same category. In this study, the proposed framework consists of four steps: DefString, Supporting-Words, SetWords and Intersection for Decision. The fourth stage will decide that the two aspects belong to the same category or not. After experimenting on a dataset comprising 252 pairs of same-meaning aspects and 62 pairs of different-meaning aspects, 91% accuracy and 86% F score were detected.

AB A machine-vision system for real-time classification of moving objects with highly reflective metallic surfaces and complex 3D-structures is presented. As an application example of our Three-Color Selective Stereo Gradient Method (Three-Color SSGM) a classification system for the three main coin denominations of Euro coins is presented. The coins are quickly moving in a coin validation system. The objective is to decide only from comparison of measured 3D-surface properties with characteristic topographical data stored in a database whether a coin belongs to one of the reference classes or not. Under illumination of a three-color LED-ring a single image of the moving coin is captured by a CCD-camera. Exploiting the spectral properties of the illumination sources, which correspond to the special spectral characteristics of the camera, three independent subimages can be extracted from the first. Comparison between these subimages leads to a discrimination between a coin with real 3D-surface and a photographic image of a coin of the same type. After the coin has been located and segmented, grey value based rotation and translation invariant features are extracted from a normalized image. In combination with template matching methods, a coin can be classified. Statistical classification results will be reported.

AB This paper reports on the evaluation of Deep Learning (DL) transformer architecture models for Named-Entity Recognition (NER) on ten low-resourced South African (SA) languages. In addition, these DL transformer models were compared to other Neural Network and Machine Learning (ML) NER models. The findings show that transformer models substantially improve performance when applying discrete finetuning parameters per language. Furthermore, fine-tuned transformer models outperform other neural network and machine learning models on NER with the low-resourced SA languages. For example, the transformer models obtained the highest F-scores for six of the ten SA languages and the highest average F-score surpassing the Conditional Random Fields ML model. Practical implications include developing high-performance NER capability with less effort and resource costs, potentially improving downstream NLP tasks such as Machine Translation (MT). Therefore, the application of DL transformer architecture models for NLP NER sequence tagging tasks on low-resourced SA languages is viable. Additional research could evaluate the more recent transformer architecture models on other Natural Language Processing tasks and applications, such as Phrase chunking, MT, and Part-of-Speech tagging.

AB Persistent memory's (PM) byte-addressability and high capacity will also make it emerging for virtualized environment. Modern virtualmachine monitors virtualize PM using either I/O virtualization ormemory virtualization. However, I/O virtualization will sacrifice PM's byte-addressability, and memory virtualization does not get the chance of PM image management. In this article, we enhance QEMU's memory virtualization mechanism. The enhanced system can achieve both PM's byte-addressability inside virtual machines and PM image management outside the virtual machines. We also design pcow, a virtual machine image format for PM, which is compatible with our enhanced memory virtualization and supports storage virtualization features including thin-provisioning, base image, snapshot, and striping. Address translation is performed with the help of the Extended Page Table, thus much faster than image formats implemented in I/O virtualization. We also optimize pcow considering PM's characteristics. We perform exhaustive performance evaluations on an x86 server equipping with Intel's Optane DC persistent memory. The evaluation demonstrates that our scheme boosts the overall performance by up to 50x compared with qcow2, an image format implemented in I/O virtualization, and brings almost no performance overhead compared with the native memory virtualization. The striping feature can also scale-out the virtual PM's bandwidth performance.

TI TASK TRANSLATION AND INTEGRATION SPECIFICATION IN INTELLIGENT MACHINES
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION
AB Intelligent machines are defined to be hierarchically intelligent control systems composed of three levels: the organization level, the coordination level, and the execution level. This paper presents an analytical model for the coordination level of intelligent machines, which, together with the established mathematical formulation for the organization level and the well developed control theory for the execution level, completes the first step toward a mathematical theory for intelligent machines. The framework of the coordination level is a tree structure consisting of a dispatcher and a number of coordinators. A new type of transducers, Petri net transducers (PNTs), has been introduced to serve as the basic module in our analytical model. PNTs provide a formal description for the individual processes within the dispatcher and coordinators. The concurrence and conflict among these processes can be represented by PNTs conveniently. Coordination structures are introduced as a formalism for the specification of integration in the coordination level. The task precedence relationship in the coordination process is presented by the Petri nets derived from the coordination structures. These Petri nets also provide us a formal approach of using the concepts and analysis methods in the Petri net theory to investigate the properties of the coordination structures. A case study of modeling an intelligent assembly robotic system has been conducted for the purpose of illustration.

TI Pose Determination of the Disc Cutter Holder of Shield Machine Based on
   Monocular Vision
SO SENSORS
AB The visual measurement system plays a vital role in the disc cutter changing robot of the shield machine, and its accuracy directly determines the success rate of the disc cutter grasping. However, the actual industrial environment with strong noise brings a great challenge to the pose measurement methods. The existing methods are difficult to meet the required accuracy of pose measurement based on machine vision under the disc cutter changing conditions. To solve this problem, we propose a monocular visual pose measurement method consisting of the high precision optimal solution to the PnP problem (OPnP) method and the highly robust distance matching (DM) method. First, the OPnP method is used to calculate the rough pose of the shield machine's cutter holder, and then the DM method is used to measure its pose accurately. Simulation results show that the proposed monocular measurement method has better accuracy and robustness than the several mainstream PnP methods. The experimental results also show that the maximum error of the proposed method is 0.28 degrees in the direction of rotation and 0.32 mm in the direction of translation, which can meet the measurement accuracy requirement of the vision system of the disc cutter changing robot in practical engineering application.

TI Accelerating Address Translation for Virtualization by Leveraging
   Hardware Mode
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS
AB The overhead of memory virtualization remains nontrivial. The traditional shadow paging (TSP) resorts to a shadow page table (SPT) to achieve the native page walk speed, but page table updates require hypervisor interventions. Alternatively, nested paging enables low-overhead page table updates, but utilizes the hardware MMU to perform a long-latency two-dimensional page walk. This paper proposes new memory virtualization solutions based on hardware (machine) mode-the highest CPU privilege level in some architectures like Sunway and RISC-V. A programming interface, running in hardware mode, enables software-implementation of hardware support functions. We first propose Software-based Nested Paging (SNP), which extends the software MMU to perform a two-dimensional page walk in hardware mode. Second, we present Swift Shadow Paging (SSP), which accomplishes page table synchronization by intercepting TLB flushing in hardware mode. Finally we propose Accelerated Shadow Paging (ASP) combining SSP and SNP. ASP handles the last-level SPT page faults by walking two-dimensional page tables in hardware mode, which eliminates most hypervisor interventions. This paper systematically compares multiple memory virtualization models by analyzing their designs and evaluating their performance both on a real system and a simulator. The experiments show that the virtualization overhead of ASP is less than 4.5% for all workloads.

TI Organic nanoelectronics inside us: charge transport and localization in
   RNA could orchestrate ribosome operation
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Translation - protein synthesis at the ribonucleic acid (RNA) based molecular machine, the ribosome, - proceeds in a similar manner in all life forms. However, despite several decades of research, the physics underlying this process remains enigmatic. Specifically, during translation, a ribosome undergoes large-scale conformational changes of its distant parts, and these motions are coordinated by an unknown mechanism. In this study, we suggest that such a mechanism could be related to charge (electron hole) transport along and between the RNA molecules, localization of these charges at certain sites and successive relaxation of the molecular geometry. Thus, we suppose that RNA-based molecular machines, e.g., the ribosome, could be electronically controlled, having "wires'', "actuators'', "a battery'', and other "circuitry''. Taking transfer RNA as an example, we justify the reasonability of our suggestion using ab initio and atomistic simulations. Specifically, very large hole transfer integrals between the nucleotides (up to above 100 meV) are observed so that the hole can migrate over nearly the whole tRNA molecule. Hole localization at several guanines located at functionally important sites (G27, G10, G34 and G63) is predicted, which is shown to induce geometry changes in these sites, their neighborhoods and even rather distant moieties. If our hypothesis is right, we anticipate that our findings will qualitatively advance the understanding of the key biological processes and could inspire novel approaches in medicine.

AB For many tasks and data types, there are natural transformations to which the data should be invariant or insensitive. For instance, in visual recognition, natural images should be insensitive to rotation and translation. This requirement and its implications have been important in many machine learning applications, and tolerance for image transformations was primarily achieved by using robust feature vectors. In this paper we propose a novel and computationally efficient way to learn a local Mahalanobis metric per datum, and show how we can learn a local invariant metric to any transformation in order to improve performance.

AB Researchers are discovering intriguing depths of meaning in synonyms in the genetic which code very short wordlike sequences, or codons, that translate into exactly the same amino acids during the construction of a protein. Scientists are finding that synonymous codons influence the temporal pattern by which a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule bearing genetic specifications from a cell's nucleus is translated by machine like ribosomes into protein molecules. These punctuations in the RNA to protein translation process have unexpected consequences. They can change the timing by which nascent proteins fold as they elongate and peel away from ribosomes.

The grammars are written using a flexible and powerful language, oxyL, that has the power of a programming language but focuses on natural language realization. This engine has been used successfully in creating an English linearization program that is currently employed as part of a Chinese-English machine translation system.

SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Fungal pathogens pose a global threat to human health, with Candida albicans among the leading killers. Systematic analysis of essential genes provides a powerful strategy to discover potential antifungal targets. Here, we build a machine learning model to generate genome-wide gene essentiality predictions for C. albicans and expand the largest functional genomics resource in this pathogen (the GRACE collection) by 866 genes. Using this model and chemogenomic analyses, we define the function of three uncharacterized essential genes with roles in kinetochore function, mitochondrial integrity, and translation, and identify the glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase Gln4 as the target of N-pyrimidinyl-beta-thiophenylacrylamide (NP-BTA), an antifungal compound.

TI Design and implementation of two-degree-of-freedom tuned mass damper in
   milling vibration mitigation
SO JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION
AB The tuned mass damper (TMD) has been applied to the machining vibration control widely, and it is categorized into several groups depending on the available degrees of freedom (DOF). Previous works have been mostly focused on the application of single-DOF TMD, but it is revealed that the clamping performance could be further promoted by multiple-DOFs TMD. A two-DOF TMD for the milling vibration mitigation is investigated. The TMD possessing translation and rotation motion is designed with tunable stiffness and damping, and the design parameters are optimized numerically based on the H-infinity criterion. The TMD is implemented on a workpiece fixture with single dominant mode, and the experimentally tuned frequency response function (FRF) has 80.8 percent reduction on the amplitude of the flexible mode. Spindle speeds corresponding to the resonance and chatter vibrations are selected for the machining tests. The measured vibrations and surface quality validate the improvement of the machining stability by the TMD, and the critical depth of cut is increased at least two folds. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI About the orthogonal parameterization of sculptured part surfaces and
   initial tool surfaces
SO JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME
AB In the domain of multi-axis NC machining of sculptured surface parts, the use of orthogonal parameterizations of part and tool surfaces is convenient because it simplifies the transformation of coordinate systems. Using the so-called ''differential-geometric method of sculptured surface NC machining,'' developed by one of the authors, many parameterizations of part and tool surfaces are easily shown not to be orthogonal. To transform nonorthogonal part and tool surface parameterizations into orthogonal ones, the Jacobian of the transformation may be used. In cases when the Jacobian of the transformation is not known, it is possible to use differential equations for isogonal trajectories on the surfaces (choosing an orthogonal case), or a special kinematic method for obtaining sculptured surface equations. Influences of coordinate system transformations (translations and rotations along and about axes through the origin) on example part and tool surface parameterizations for four types' of general helicoidal surfaces are described The results mentioned above simplify the analytical description of the multi-axis NC machining process, and may be useful for writing NC toolpath generation software.

We train three language-specific abstractive summarizers and evaluate on documents originally written in the source languages, as well as on a fourth, unseen language: Arabic. Our systems achieve significantly higher fluency than a standard copy-attention summarizer on automatically translated input documents, as well as comparable content selection.

   tools based on spherical S-shaped trajectories using a double ball bar
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB This paper presents a novel method to identify the squareness errors of computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools based on double ball bar (DBB) measurements. A series of spherical S-shaped paths are proposed to measure the squareness errors, instead of the generally used circular detection paths since the presented method requires only one experimental setup, and three translation axes are linked, which is more convenient and comprehensive. In this article, the coordinate transformation method and the method for dividing experimental paths evenly are used to solve the asynchronization between actual motion and DBB sampling process. The experimental data is then combined with the product of exponential (POE) model to calculate the three CNC machine tool squareness errors and applied to a spherical spiral testing path with the compensation of the diagnosed errors. The effectiveness of the method is verified by comparing the experimental results before and after the compensation.

SO HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND
   NECK
AB Background. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a unique cancer. Refinement of current therapy by discovering potential drugs may be approached by several computational strategies.
   Methods. We collected NPC genes from published microarray data and the literature. The NPC disease network was constructed via a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The Connectivity Map (CMap) was used to predict potential chemicals, and support vector machines (SVMs) were further utilized to classify the effectiveness of tested drugs against NPC using their gene expression from CMap.
   Results. A highly interconnected network was obtained. Several chemically sensitive genes were identified and 87 drugs were predicted with the potential for treating NPC by SVM, in which nearly half of them have anticancer effects according to the literature. The 2 top-ranked drugs, thioridazine and vorinostat, were demonstrated to be effective in inhibiting NPC cells.
   Conclusion. This in silico approach provides a promising strategy for screening potential therapeutic drugs for NPC treatment. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Composite function wavelet neural networks with extreme learning machine
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
AB A new structure of wavelet neural networks (WNN) with extreme learning machine (ELM) is introduced in this paper. In the proposed wavelet neural networks, composite functions are applied at the hidden nodes and the learning is done using ELM. The input information is first processed by wavelet functions and then passed through a type of bounded nonconstant piecewise continuous activation functions g : R -> R. A selection method that takes into account the domain of input space where the wavelets are not zero is used to initialize the translation and dilation parameters. The formed wavelet neural network is then trained with the computationally efficient ELM algorithm. Experimental results on the regression of some nonlinear functions and real-world data, the prediction of a chaotic signal and classifications on serval benchmark real-world data sets show that the proposed neural networks can achieve better performances in most cases than some relevant neural networks and learn much faster than neural networks training with the traditional back-propagation (BP) algorithm.

AB To perform well on unseen and potentially out-of-distribution samples, it is desirable for machine learning models to have a predictable response with respect to transformations affecting the factors of variation of the input. Here, we study the relative importance of several types of inductive biases towards such predictable behavior: the choice of data, their augmentations, and model architectures. Invariance is commonly achieved through hand-engineered data augmentation, but do standard data augmentations address transformations that explain variations in real data? While prior work has focused on synthetic data, we attempt here to characterize the factors of variation in a real dataset, ImageNet, and study the invariance of both standard residual networks and the recently proposed vision transformer with respect to changes in these factors. We show standard augmentation relies on a precise combination of translation and scale, with translation recapturing most of the performance improvement-despite the (approximate) translation invariance built in to convolutional architectures, such as residual networks. In fact, we found that scale and translation invariance was similar across residual networks and vision transformer models despite their markedly different architectural inductive biases. We show the training data itself is the main source of invariance, and that data augmentation only further increases the learned invariances. Notably, the invariances learned during training align with the ImageNet factors of variation we found. Finally, we find that the main factors of variation in ImageNet mostly relate to appearance and are specific to each class.

To address those requirements, a common approach is to train those models on heterogeneous systems with a mixture of hardware devices such as CPUs and GPUs. Normally, the decision of putting parts of neural networks on devices is made by researchers based on heuristics algorithm. In this paper, we introduce an effective method to optimize operations placement for TensorFlow computational graphs on heterogeneous systems by using deep neural networks to predict devices for each operation in a target computational graph. Based on reinforcement learning, our method learns to group operations and assign each group to a corresponding device. To take advantage of the information of operations, we use a fully-connected network to group operations. In addition, we use the actual running time of the predictive placement as rewards to train the predictive network by using policy gradients. By executing the most widely used models in computer vision and machine translation, our method finds an optimized placement which outperforms human experts. When applying our method to the Neural Machine Translation model on the WMT14 German-English dataset, the execution time of per single training step reduces up to 28.41%.

AB Transformers are the current state-of-the-art type of neural network model for dealing with sequences. Evidently, the most prominent application of these models is in text processing tasks, and the most prominent of these is machine translation. Recently, transformer-based models such as the Edit-Based Transformer with Repositioning (EDITOR) and Levenshtein Transformer (LevT) models have become popular in neural machine translation. To the best of our knowledge, there are no experiments for these two models using under-resourced languages. In this paper, we compared the performance and decoding time of the EDITOR model and the LevT model. We conducted the experiments for under-resourced language pairs, namely, Thai-to-English, Thai-to-Myanmar, Englishto-Myanmar, and vice versa. The experimental results showed that the EDITOR model outperforms the LevT model in English-Thai, Thai-English and English-Myanmar language pairs whereas LevT achieves better score than EDITOR in Thai-Myanmar, Myanmar-Thai and Myanmar-English language pairs. Regarding the decoding time, EDITOR model is generally faster than the LevT model in the four language pairs. However, in the case of English-Myanmar and Myanmar-English pairs, the decoding time of EDITOR is slightly slower than the LevT model. At last, we investigated the system level performance of both models by means of compare-mt and word error rate (WER).

TI A Parallel Dynamic Binary Translator for Efficient Multi-Core Simulation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PARALLEL PROGRAMMING
AB In recent years multi-core processors have seen broad adoption in application domains ranging from embedded systems through general-purpose computing to large-scale data centres. Simulation technology for multi-core systems, however, lags behind and does not provide the simulation speed required to effectively support design space exploration and parallel software development. While state-of-the-art instruction set simulators (Iss) for single-core machines reach or exceed the performance levels of speed-optimised silicon implementations of embedded processors, the same does not hold for multi-core simulators where large performance penalties are to be paid. In this paper we develop a fast and scalable simulation methodology for multi-core platforms based on parallel and just-in-time (Jit) dynamic binary translation (Dbt). Our approach can model large-scale multi-core configurations, does not rely on prior profiling, instrumentation, or compilation, and works for all binaries targeting a state-of-the-art embedded multi-core platform implementing the ARCompact instruction set architecture (Isa). We have evaluated our parallel simulation methodology against the industry standard Splash-2 and Eembc MultiBench benchmarks and demonstrate simulation speeds up to 25,307 Mips on a 32-core x86 host machine for as many as 2,048 target processors whilst exhibiting minimal and near constant overhead, including memory considerations.

AB Sign languages, used by people with hearing impairments to communicate, are not universal. Just like any other language, every country has its own, which makes it difficult to establish communication, as usually people only know their native sign language. This paper presents a novel integrated system to minimize this barrier by combining a web application that uses computer vision techniques and Extreme Learning Machines with a mobile application, to translate between sign languages.

AB A new kernel function is proposed for support vector regression(SVR). An one-to-one mapping is adopted for dimensionality reduction and then continuous wavelet transform is utilized to construct the nonlinear mapping phi(x) from the input space S to the feature space. So we call it continuous wavelet kernel function(CWKF). This wavelet kernel is not translation invariant kernel, instead inner product kernel and need not parameter selecting. The quadratic program of support vector regression has feasible solution if we use CWKF. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.

AB Recent work in multilingual machine translation (MMT) has focused on the potential of positive transfer between languages, particularly cases where higher-resourced languages can benefit lower-resourced ones. While training an MMT model, the supervision signals learned from one language pair can be transferred to the other via the tokens shared by multiple source languages. However, the transfer is inhibited when the token overlap among source languages is small, which manifests naturally when languages use different writing systems. In this paper, we tackle inhibited transfer by augmenting the training data with alternative signals that unify different writing systems, such as phonetic, romanized, and transliterated input. We test these signals on Indic and Turkic languages, two language families where the writing systems differ but languages still share common features. Our results indicate that a straightforward multisource self-ensemble - training a model on a mixture of various signals and ensembling the outputs of the same model fed with different signals during inference-outperforms strong ensemble baselines by 1.3 BLEU on both language families. Further, we find that incorporating alternative inputs via self-ensemble can be particularly effective in low-resource settings, leading to +5 BLEU when only 5% of the total training data is accessible. Finally, our analysis demonstrates that including alternative signals yields more consistency and translates named entities more accurately, which is crucial for increased factuality of automated systems.

AB Policy gradient algorithms have found wide adoption in NLP, but have recently become subject to criticism, doubting their suitability for NMT. Choshen et al. (2020) identify multiple weaknesses and suspect that their success is determined by the shape of output distributions rather than the reward. In this paper, we revisit these claims and study them under a wider range of configurations. Our experiments on in-domain and cross-domain adaptation reveal the importance of exploration and reward scaling, and provide empirical counter-evidence to these claims.

AB This paper proposes a novel approach to the formal definition of UML semantics. We distinguish descriptive semantics from functional semantics of modelling languages. The former defines which system is an instance of a model while the later defines the basic concepts underlying the models. In this paper, the descriptive semantics of class diagram, interaction diagram and state machine diagram are defined by first order logic formulas. A translation tool is implemented and integrated with the theorem prover SPASS to enable automated reasoning about models. The formalisation and reasoning of models is then applied to model consistency checking.

AB Stochastic Unification-Based Grammars combine knowledge-rich and data-rich approaches to natural language processing. This provides a rich structure to the learning and parsing (decoding) tasks that can be described with undirected graphical models. While most work to date has treated parsing as a straight-forward multi-class classification problem, we are beginning to see how this structure can be exploited in learning and parsing. Exploiting this structure is likely to become more important as the research focus moves from parsing to more realistic tasks such as machine translation and summarization.

AB The textual descriptions in logging statements (i.e., logging texts) are printed during system executions and exposed to multiple stakeholders including developers, operators, users, and regulatory authorities. Writing proper logging texts is an important but often challenging task for developers. However, despite extensive research on automated logging suggestions, research on suggesting logging texts rarely exists. In this paper, we present LoGenText, an automated approach that generates logging texts by translating the related source code into short textual descriptions. LoGenText takes the preceding source code of a logging text as the input and considers other context information such as the location of the logging statement, to automatically generate the logging text using neural machine translation models. We evaluate LoGenText on 10 open-source projects, and compare the automatically generated logging texts with the developer-inserted logging texts in the source code. We find that LoGenText generates logging texts that achieve BLEU scores of 23.3 to 41.8 and ROUGE-L scores of 42.1 to 53.9, which outperforms the state-of-the-art approach by a large margin. In addition, we perform a human evaluation involving 42 participants, which further demonstrates the quality of the logging texts generated by LoGenText. Our work is an important step towards automated generation of logging statements, which can potentially save developers' efforts and improve the quality of software logging.

TI Exploring allosteric communication in multiple states of the bacterial
   ribosome using residue network analysis
SO TURKISH JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
AB Antibiotic resistance is one of the most important problems of our era and hence the discovery of new effective therapeutics is urgent. At this point, studying the allosteric communication pathways in the bacterial ribosome and revealing allosteric sites/residues is critical for designing new inhibitors or repurposing readily approved drugs for this enormous machine. To shed light onto molecular details of the allosteric mechanisms, here we construct residue networks of the bacterial ribosomal complex at four different states of translation by using an effective description of the intermolecular interactions. Centrality analysis of these networks highlights the functional roles of structural components and critical residues on the ribosomal complex. High betweenness scores reveal pathways of residues connecting numerous sites on the structure. Interestingly, these pathways assemble highly conserved residues, drug binding sites, and known allosterically linked regions on the same structure. This study proposes a new residue-level model to test how distant sites on the molecular machine may be linked through hub residues that are critically located on the contact topology to inherently form communication pathways. Findings also indicate intersubunit bridges B1b, B3, B5, B7, and B8 as critical targets to design novel antibiotic.

AB In this paper, we present the results of our investigation into phrase-based statistical machine translation from English into Turkish - an agglutinative language with very productive inflectional and derivational word-formation processes. We investigate different representational granularities for morphological structure and find that (i) representing both Turkish and English at the morpheme-level but with some selective morpheme- grouping on the Turkish side of the training data, (ii) augmenting the training data with "sentences" comprising only the content words of the original training data to bias root word alignment, and with highly-reliable phrase-pairs from an earlier corpus-alignment (iii) re-ranking the n-best morpheme- sequence outputs of the decoder with a word-based language model, and (iv) "repairing" translated words with incorrect morphological structure and words which are out-of-vocabulary relative to the training and the language model corpus, provide an non-trivial improvement over a word-based baseline despite our very limited training data. We improve from 19.77 BLEU points for our word-based baseline model to 26.87 BLEU points for an improvement of 7.10 points or about 36% relative. We briefly discuss the applicability of BLEU to morphologically complex languages like Turkish and present a simple extension to compare tokens not in a all-or-none fashion but taking lexical-semantic and morpho-semantic similarities into account, implemented in our BLEU+ tool.

TI XTRACT - AN OVERVIEW
SO COMPUTERS AND THE HUMANITIES
AB Lexical collocations have particular statistical distributions. We have developed a set of statistical techniques for retrieving and identifying collocations from large textual corpora. The techniques we developed are able to identify collocations of arbitrary length as well as flexible collocations. These techniques have been implemented in a lexicographic tool, Xtract, which is able to automatically acquire collocations with high retrieval performance. Xtract works in three stages. The first stage is based on a statistical technique for identifying word pairs involved in a syntactic relation. The words can appear in the text in any order and can be separated by an arbitrary number of other words. The second stage is based on a technique to extract n-word collocations (or n-grams) in a much simpler way than related methods. These collocations can involve closed class words such as particles and prepositions. A third stage is then applied to the output of stage one and applies parsing techniques to sentences involving a given word pair in order to identify the proper syntactic relation between the two words. A secondary effect of the third stage is to filter out a number of candidate collocations as irrelevant and thus produce higher quality output. In this paper we present an overview of Xtract and we describe several uses for Xtract and the knowledge it retrieves such as language generation and machine translation.

TI Interoperable Test Cases to Mediate between Supply Chain's Test
   Processes
SO INFORMATION
AB Heterogeneous test processes with respect to test script languages are an integral part of the development process of mechatronic systems that are carried out in supply chains. Up to now, test cases are not exchangeable between test processes because interoperability is not given. The developed approach enables the source-to-source compiling of test cases between test script languages. With this, the interoperability of test cases is achieved, and seamless integration within the supply chain is possible. The developed approach uses transcompilers as a baseline. In doing so, an interoperability model for test cases is presented. Based on the interoperability model, a source-to-source compiling for test cases is shown. The outcome is a prototype that handles test script languages, which are different with respect to type safety and applied programming paradigms. The approach ensures that test cases are still understandable and usable for test reports. The evaluation confirms the translation capabilities as well as the readability of the generated test case for the high-lift scenario from aviation. The interoperability of test cases within the supply chain enables the formalisation of procedural test knowledge to be used in a broad range of future scenarios, such as test automation, digital twins and predictive maintenance.

AB This paper addresses the problem of mapping natural language to its semantics. It presupposes that the input is in random (compressed) form and proceeds to detail a methodology for extracting the semantics from that normal form. The idea is to enumerate contextual cues and learn to associate those cues with meaning. The process is inherently fuzzy and for this reason is also inherently adaptive in nature.
   It is shown that the influence of context on meaning grows exponentially with the length of a word sequence. This suggests that rule-based randomization plays a key role in rendering a field-effect natural language semantic mapping tractable. An example of rule-based randomization for semantic normalization is as follows. Suppose that two commands to a robot are deemed to be equivalent; namely, "Grasp and pick up the glass" and "Hold the cup and raise it"'. Their mutual normalization might then be, "Grab container. Lift container." Clearly, the randomization process can be effected by rules. Also, the normalized syntax makes the result of any semantic mapping process - such as detailed herein - more efficient.
   A natural language front-end is described, which is designed to reduce the impedance mismatch between the human and the machine. Most significantly, the effective translation of natural language semantics is shown to critically depend on an accelerated capability for learning.

TI Audio-Visual Speech Recognition Based on Dual Cross-Modality Attentions
   with the Transformer Model
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Since attention mechanism was introduced in neural machine translation, attention has been combined with the long short-term memory (LSTM) or replaced the LSTM in a transformer model to overcome the sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) problems with the LSTM. In contrast to the neural machine translation, audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) may provide improved performance by learning the correlation between audio and visual modalities. As a result that the audio has richer information than the video related to lips, AVSR is hard to train attentions with balanced modalities. In order to increase the role of visual modality to a level of audio modality by fully exploiting input information in learning attentions, we propose a dual cross-modality (DCM) attention scheme that utilizes both an audio context vector using video query and a video context vector using audio query. Furthermore, we introduce a connectionist-temporal-classification (CTC) loss in combination with our attention-based model to force monotonic alignments required in AVSR. Recognition experiments on LRS2-BBC and LRS3-TED datasets showed that the proposed model with the DCM attention scheme and the hybrid CTC/attention architecture achieved at least a relative improvement of 7.3% on average in the word error rate (WER) compared to competing methods based on the transformer model.

AB In the modern era, Machine learning and Artificial intelligence remain the most remarkable IT application, a technology that has seen unprecedented progress in recent decades. AI and machine learn-ing are all closely linked with using a computer to simulate intelligent behaviour with little human inter-action. It has been noticed that many large organisations are implementing technologies such as ML and AI to improve their performance and productivity in the business. Companies can create better, more cus-tomised and engaging campaigns as AI becomes increasingly adept at collecting massive data faster than ever before. As AI and ML technologies become more widely used, being a technology-powered company will undoubtedly be a must for survival. AI and ML are guiding on everything from production to delivering products and services to customers. Machine translation, chatbots, and self-learning algorithms are examples of AI technology that may help people better comprehend their surroundings and respond appropriately. Organisations have been embracing artificial intelligence technology advancements to create and maximising their strategic and competitive advantages. Hence, businesses rely heavily on AI to enhance their performance and develop new services to boost productivity and generate new offerings. In addition, they are fundamentally reshaping companies' business and operation processes to better meet customers' requirements and expectations, resulting in increased efficiency. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are broad concepts that will be examined further in this article. The report aims to understand the relationship between Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in large and diversified business organisations. The researcher used a study methodology ori-ented toward a more inclusive and comprehensive approach to better account for the intangible aids of ML and AI within organisations.

TI Automatic Correction of Real-Word Errors in Spanish Clinical Texts
SO SENSORS
AB Real-word errors are characterized by being actual terms in the dictionary. By providing context, real-word errors are detected. Traditional methods to detect and correct such errors are mostly based on counting the frequency of short word sequences in a corpus. Then, the probability of a word being a real-word error is computed. On the other hand, state-of-the-art approaches make use of deep learning models to learn context by extracting semantic features from text. In this work, a deep learning model were implemented for correcting real-word errors in clinical text. Specifically, a Seq2seq Neural Machine Translation Model mapped erroneous sentences to correct them. For that, different types of error were generated in correct sentences by using rules. Different Seq2seq models were trained and evaluated on two corpora: the Wikicorpus and a collection of three clinical datasets. The medicine corpus was much smaller than the Wikicorpus due to privacy issues when dealing with patient information. Moreover, GloVe and Word2Vec pretrained word embeddings were used to study their performance. Despite the medicine corpus being much smaller than the Wikicorpus, Seq2seq models trained on the medicine corpus performed better than those models trained on the Wikicorpus. Nevertheless, a larger amount of clinical text is required to improve the results.

TI Sequence-Based Pronunciation Variation Modeling for Spontaneous ASR
   Using a Noisy Channel Approach
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB The performance of English automatic speech recognition systems decreases when recognizing spontaneous speech mainly due to multiple pronunciation variants in the utterances. Previous approaches address this problem by modeling the alteration of the pronunciation on a phoneme to phoneme level. However, the phonetic transformation effects induced by the pronunciation of the whole sentence have not yet been considered. In this article, the sequence-based pronunciation variation is modeled using a noisy channel approach where the spontaneous phoneme sequence is considered as a "noisy" string and the goal is to recover the "clean" string of the word sequence. Hereby, the whole word sequence and its effect on the alternation of the phonemes will be taken into consideration. Moreover, the system not only learns the phoneme transformation but also the mapping from the phoneme to the word directly. In this study, first the phonemes will be recognized with the present recognition system and afterwards the pronunciation variation model based on the noisy channel approach will map from the phoneme to the word level. Two well-known natural language processing approaches are adopted and derived from the noisy channel model theory: Joint-sequence models and statistical machine translation. Both of them are applied and various experiments are conducted using microphone and telephone of spontaneous speech.

AB A not-translated word (NTW) is a token which a machine translation (MT) system is unable to translate, leaving it untranslated in the output. The number of not-translated words in a document is used as one measure in the evaluation of MT systems. Many MT developers agree that in order to reduce the number of NTWs in their systems, designers must increase the size or coverage of the lexicon to include these untranslated tokens. so that the system can handle them in future processing. While we accept this method for enhancing MT capabilities, in assessing the nature of NTWs in real-world documents, we found surprising results. Our study looked at the NTW output from two commercially available MT systems (Systran and Globalink) and found that lexical coverage played a relatively small role in the words marked as not translated. In fact, 45% of the tokens in the list failed to translate for reasons other than that they were valid source language words not included in the MT lexicon. For instance, e-mail addresses, words already in the target language and acronyms were marked as not-translated words. This paper presents our analysis or NTWs and uses these results to argue that in addition to lexicon enhancement, MT systems could benefit from more sophisticated pre- and post-processing of real-world documents in order to weed out such NTWs.

AB Many embedded Java platforms execute two types of Java classes: those installed statically on the client device and those downloaded dynamically from service providers at run time. For achieving higher performance, the static Java classes can be compiled into machine code by ahead-of-time compiler (AOTC) in the server, and the translated machine code can be installed on the client device. Unfortunately, AOTC cannot be applicable to the dynamically downloaded classes. This paper proposes client-AOTC (c-AOTC), which performs AOTC on the client device using the just-in-time compiler (JITC) module installed on the device, obviating the JITC overhead and complementing the server-AOTC. The machine code of a method translated by JITC is cached on a persistent memory of the device, and when the method is invoked again in a later run of the program, the machine code is loaded and executed directly without any translation overhead. A major issue in c-AOTC is relocation because sonic of the address constants embedded in the cached machine code are not correct when the machine code is loaded and used in a different run; those addresses should be corrected before they are used. Constant pool resolution and inlining complicate the relocation problem, and we propose our solutions. The persistent memory overhead for saving the relocation information is also an issue, and we propose a technique to encode the relocation information and compress the machine code efficiently. We developed a c-AOTC on Sun's CDC VM reference implementation, and our evaluation results indicate that c-AOTC can improve the performance significantly, as much as an average of 12% for EEMBC and 4% for SpecJVM98, with a persistent memory overhead of 1% on average.

AB We present a machine learning model for the analysis of randomly generated discrete signals, modeled as the points of an inhomogeneous, compound Poisson point process. Like the wavelet scattering transform introduced by Mallat, our construction is naturally invariant to translations and reflections, but it decouples the roles of scale and frequency, replacing wavelets with Gabor-type measurements. We show that, with suitable nonlinearities, our measurements distinguish Poisson point processes from common self-similar processes, and separate different types of Poisson point processes.

Our systems return the globally best solution under these models. Our two systems achieve 80.9% and 75.6% accuracy on the test set. We ultimately find that, in this setting, exact inference does not seem to help or hinder the performance of morphological inflection generators, which stands in contrast to its affect on Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models.

We propose combining this approach with the benefits of convolutional filters and a hierarchical structure to create a document classification model that is both highly accurate and fast to train - we name our method Hierarchical Convolutional Attention Networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this architecture by surpassing the accuracy of the current state-of-the-art on several classification tasks while being twice as fast to train.

AB Hierarchical transition systems provide a popular mathematical structure to represent state-based software applications in which different layers of abstraction are represented by inter-related state machines. The decomposition of high level states into inner sub-states, and of their transitions into inner sub-transitions is common refinement procedure adopted in a number of specification formalisms.
   This paper introduces a hybrid modal logic for k-layered transition systems, its first-order standard translation, a notion of bisimulation, and a modal invariance result. Layered and hierarchical notions of refinement are also discussed in this setting.

AB Recently, constraint-programming techniques have been used to generate test data and to verify the conformity of a program with its specification. Constraint generated for these tasks may involve integer ranging on all machine-integers, thus, the constraint-based modeling of the program and its specification is a critical issue. In this paper we investigate different models. We show that a straightforward translation of a program and its specification in a system of guarded constraints is ineffective. We outline the key role of Boolean abstractions and explore different search strategies on standard benchmarks.

TI ASSESSING THE MEASUREMENT UNCERTAINTY FOR THE STEREOMETRY OF MINING
   MACHINES WORKING UNITS USED IN THE MINING INDUSTRY
SO ARCHIVES OF MINING SCIENCES
AB The concept of measuring the stereometry of mining machines working units consists in determining the values of the parameters describing the spatial arrangement and setting of the individual pickboxes at their side surface. The measurements carried out with traditional measuring instruments and with direct measurement methods are accompanied by multiple difficulties due to a complex method of arranging and setting the pickboxes at the side surface of working units in mining machines and due to a large number of such measurements. This especially applies to the angles defining the positioning of pickboxes in the space. A convenient method and mathematical model of measuring the stereometry of working units in mining machines using the direct measurement method has been developed for this reason (Cheluszka, 2010). It consists of measuring directly the values of translation coordinates for three non-collinear characteristic measuring points for individual pickboxes which sets a basis for determining, analytically, the values of the stereometric parameters of the working unit in the mining machine sought for using the appropriate mathematical functions.
   This article evaluates whether the method developed is suitable for measuring the stereometric parameters of working units in mining machines. The method is based on a computer analysis of a complex standard measurement uncertainty of the parameters under consideration. Sensitivity has been determined for the impact on the measurement uncertainty of the values sought for of the stereometric parameters values of mining machines working units, the measurement method's metrological properties and instruments applied. The required values of standard uncertainty of measuring the coordinates of measuring points have also been determined in order to produce the value of a complex standard uncertainty for the measurement of stereometric parameters at the level assumed.

TI Improving Data Augmentation for Low-Resource NMT Guided by POS-Tagging
   and Paraphrase Embedding
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB Data augmentation is an approach for several text generation tasks. Generally, in the machine translation paradigm, mainly in low-resource language scenarios, many data augmentationmethods have been proposed. The most used approaches for generating pseudo data mainly lay in word omission, random sampling, or replacing some words in the text. However, previous methods barely guarantee the quality of augmented data. In this work, we try to build the data by using paraphrase embedding and POS-Tagging. Namely, we generate the fake monolingual corpus by replacing the main four POS-Tagging labels, such as noun, adjective, adverb, and verb, based on both the paraphrase table and their similarity. We select the bigger corpus size of the paraphrase table with word level and obtain the word embedding of each word in the table, then calculate the cosine similarity between these words and tagged words in the original sequence. In addition, we exploit the ranking algorithm to choose highly similar words to reduce semantic errors and leverage the POS-Tagging replacement to mitigate syntactic error to some extent. Experimental results show that our augmentation method consistently outperforms all previous SOTA methods on the low-resource language pairs in seven language pairs from four corpora by 1.16 to 2.39 BLEU points.

TI mRNALoc: a novel machine-learning based in-silico tool to predict mRNA
   subcellular localization
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Recent evidences suggest that the localization of mRNAs near the subcellular compartment of the translated proteins is a more robust cellular tool, which optimizes protein expression, post-transcriptionally. Retention of mRNA in the nucleus can regulate the amount of protein translated from each mRNA, thus allowing a tight temporal regulation of translation or buffering of protein levels from bursty transcription. Besides, mRNA localization performs a variety of additional roles like long-distance signaling, facilitating assembly of protein complexes and coordination of developmental processes. Here, we describe a novel machine-learning based tool, mRNALoc, to predict five sub-cellular locations of eukaryotic mRNAs using cDNA/mRNA sequences. During five fold cross-validations, the maximum overall accuracy was 65.19, 75.36, 67.10, 99.70 and 73.59% for the extracellular region, endoplasmic reticulum, cytoplasm, mitochondria, and nucleus, respectively. Assessment on independent datasets revealed the prediction accuracies of 58.10, 69.23, 64.55, 96.88 and 69.35% for extracellular region, endoplasmic reticulum, cytoplasm, mitochondria, and nucleus, respectively. The corresponding values of AUC were 0.76, 0.75, 0.70, 0.98 and 0.74 for the extracellular region, endoplasmic reticulum, cytoplasm, mitochondria, and nucleus, respectively.

TI Deep code comment generation with hybrid lexical and syntactical
   information
SO EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
AB During software maintenance, developers spend a lot of time understanding the source code. Existing studies show that code comments help developers comprehend programs and reduce additional time spent on reading and navigating source code. Unfortunately, these comments are often mismatched, missing or outdated in software projects. Developers have to infer the functionality from the source code. This paper proposes a new approach named Hybrid-DeepCom to automatically generate code comments for the functional units of Java language, namely, Java methods. The generated comments aim to help developers understand the functionality of Java methods. Hybrid-DeepCom applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to learn from a large code corpus and generates comments from learned features. It formulates the comment generation task as the machine translation problem. Hybrid-DeepCom exploits a deep neural network that combines the lexical and structure information of Java methods for better comments generation. We conduct experiments on a large-scale Java corpus built from 9,714 open source projects on GitHub. We evaluate the experimental results on both machine translation metrics and information retrieval metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method Hybrid-DeepCom outperforms the state-of-the-art by a substantial margin. In addition, we evaluate the influence of out-of-vocabulary tokens on comment generation. The results show that reducing the out-of-vocabulary tokens improves the accuracy effectively.

TI Morphological-based Classifications of Radio Galaxies Using Supervised
   Machine-learning Methods Associated with Image Moments
SO ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
AB With the advent of new high-resolution instruments for detecting and studying radio galaxies with different morphologies, the need for the use of automatic classification methods is undeniable. Here, we focused on the morphological-based classification of radio galaxies known as Fanaroff-Riley (FR) type I and type II via supervised machine-learning approaches. Galaxy images with a resolution of 5 '' at 1.4 GHz provided by the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters (FIRST) survey are employed. The radial Zernike polynomials are exploited to extract image moments. Then, the rotation, translation, and scale-invariant moments of images are used to form a training set (65% of the radio galaxy sample) and a test set (the remaining 35%). The classes of the test set are determined by two classifiers: a support vector machine and a twin support vector machine (TWSVM). In addition the genetic algorithm is employed to optimize the length of moment series and to find the optimum values of the parameters of the classifiers. The labels of outputs are compared to identify the best performance classifier. To do this the confidence level of classifications is estimated by four different metrics: precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy. All tests show that implementing TWSVM with the radial basis function as a kernel achieves a confidence level of more than 95% in grouping galaxies.

TI Understanding grain boundaries - The role of crystallography, structural
   descriptors and machine learning
SO COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Grain boundaries (GBs) influence a wide array of physical properties in polycrystalline materials and play an important role in governing microstructural evolution under extreme environments. While the importance of interfaces is well documented, their properties are among the least understood of all the defect types present in engineering material systems. This is due to the vast configurational space of interfaces, resulting in a diverse range of structures and properties. The complexity associated with GB structures is related to the different crystallographic degrees of freedom - the misorientation, the boundary-plane orientation and the relative translations between the adjoining crystals. These unique challenges can be addressed by leveraging highthroughput simulations of GB properties and developing machine learning algorithms grounded in the concepts of bicrystallography of interfaces. To demystify the relationships between crystallography and properties, the symmetry aspects of GBs are reviewed with an emphasis on boundary-plane orientations and disconnection line defects. To quantify structure-property relationships, recent advances in describing GB structures using the polyhedral unit model and the gaussian-based approximation of local atomic environments are discussed. Finally, examples of predicting GB structure-property relationships using machine learning techniques are summarized. As part of a special issue, the goal of this review article is to motivate machine learning strategies that are informed by bicrystallography and novel structural descriptors for developing reliable crystallographystructure-property relationships for grain boundaries.

AB The synthesis of object behaviour from scenarios is a well-known and important issue in the transition from system analysis to system design. We describe a model transformation procedure from UML 2.0 interactions into UML 2.0 state machines that focuses, in contrast to existing approaches, on standard synchronous operation calls where the sender of a message waits until the receiver object has executed the requested operation possibly returning a result. The key aspect of our approach is to distinguish between active and inactive phases of an object participating in an interaction. This allows us to generate well-structured state machines separating "stable" states, where an object is ready to react to an incoming message, and "activity" states which model the computational behaviour of an object upon receipt of an operation call. The translation procedure is formalised, in accordance with the UML 2.0 meta-model, by means of an abstract syntax for scenarios which are first translated into I/O-automata as an appropriate intermediate format. Apparent non-determinism in the automata gives rise to feedback on scenario deficiencies and to suggestions on scenario refinements. Finally, for each object of interest the corresponding I/O-automaton is translated into a UML 2.0 state machine representing stable states by simple states and activity states by submachine states which provide algorithmic descriptions of operations. Thus the resulting state machines can be easily transformed into code by applying well-known implementation techniques.

TI Non-empirical problems in fair machine learning
SO ETHICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB The problem of fair machine learning has drawn much attention over the last few years and the bulk of offered solutions are, in principle, empirical. However, algorithmic fairness also raises important conceptual issues that would fail to be addressed if one relies entirely on empirical considerations. Herein, I will argue that the current debate has developed an empirical framework that has brought important contributions to the development of algorithmic decision-making, such as new techniques to discover and prevent discrimination, additional assessment criteria, and analyses of the interaction between fairness and predictive accuracy. However, the same framework has also suggested higher-order issues regarding the translation of fairness into metrics and quantifiable trade-offs. Although the (empirical) tools which have been developed so far are essential to address discrimination encoded in data and algorithms, their integration into society elicits key (conceptual) questions such as: What kind of assumptions and decisions underlies the empirical framework? How do the results of the empirical approach penetrate public debate? What kind of reflection and deliberation should stakeholders have over available fairness metrics? I will outline the empirical approach to fair machine learning, i.e. how the problem is framed and addressed, and suggest that there are important non-empirical issues that should be tackled. While this work will focus on the problem of algorithmic fairness, the lesson can extend to other conceptual problems in the analysis of algorithmic decision-making such as privacy and explainability.

TI Optimal design of a novel 4-degree-of-freedom parallel mechanism with
   flexible orientation capability
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART B-JOURNAL OF
   ENGINEERING MANUFACTURE
AB This article proposes a novel spatial parallel kinematic mechanism with three kinematic limbs and 4 degrees of freedom. Its mobile platform can realize two translations and two rotation movements. Of note is that this mechanism can realize flexible A-/B-axis rotation (rotations about the x- and y-axes) and the transformation between vertical machining mode and horizontal machining mode. Using Tilt and Torsion angle description method, the kinematics analysis of this parallel kinematic mechanism is carried out. On this basis, the geometrical parameters, including parameters of three limbs and mobile platform, are optimized. In view of the particularity of configuration, the limb in the postposition with two active inputs is analyzed first and then the remaining two identical limbs. In the optimal design, motion/force transmissibility is taken into consideration, and the local transmission index is used as the performance evaluation criterion to investigate the orientation capability of this parallel kinematic mechanism. Using performance atlases method, the optimal kinematic design of the 4-degree-of-freedom parallel kinematic mechanism is carried out and a set of preferable optimized parameters is obtained at last. By virtue of the kinematic advantages, the proposed parallel kinematic mechanism can be used as the modular machining unit in five-axis machine centers. Based on this work, a machine tool with high flexibility has been developed to process the five faces of a workpiece within one setup.

TI Data-Structures for Multisensory Information Processing in an Embodied
   Machine-Mind
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COGNITIVE AND DEVELOPMENTAL SYSTEMS
AB The real-world is a medley of multisensory information and so are our experiences, memories, and responses. As embodied beings, we respond to the information endogenously and in ways derived from self-defining factors. Thus inspired, we attempt formalization of data-structures to facilitate generation of system-bespoke comprehension-granules of the real-world. The conceptualized structures encapsulate multisensory inputs (sourced from the real-world or memories), intrinsic and deliberate emotions, messages (bearing intermittent process-results, queries, multimodal data, etc.) across system modules and memory units, and sensorimotor responses to the inputs. The structural-schematics are anthropomorphic. These variable-length constructs are theoretically platform-independent, support genericity across data-modality and information-inclusion, and provide for representation of novel sensory-data. An epigenome-styled header node for the afferent data-units provides for the activation of intuitive "fight-flight" behavior. The documentation includes a flow-graph, depicting the translation of information across the data-structures and the different ways of thinking while interpreting a real-world scene or a mind-generated event. Applicability of the structures has been analyzed in the context of comprehension in an embodied mind-machine framework and other similar architectures. Studies herein target contribution to the design of generally intelligent man-machine symbiotic systems.

TI A shared page-aware machine learning assisted method for predicting and
   improving multi-level cell NAND flash memory life expectancy
SO MICROELECTRONICS RELIABILITY
AB NAND flash memory is widely used in consumer electronics, personal computers, and enterprise data storage servers. The most prevalent source of flash memory errors is retention errors, which are mainly caused by leakage of charges. It has been observed that inside the chip, some flash memory blocks exhibit greater endurance to the retention errors than others. In an effort to prolong life expectancy, previous studies focus on improving the Raw Bit Error Rate (RBER) metric at page and block levels, without due consideration of the geometry of shared pages. In this paper, the first insight we provide is that groups of shared pages have different RBER values, and should be analyzed separately. We use this insight to construct a machine learning model to predict the blocks which have less endurance, using the characterization data of new unused flash memory chip(s). This is accomplished by extracting location-sensitive and value-sensitive features from the shared pages group, and engineering them into more sophisticated and explainable features. Furthermore, we describe how our proposed prediction model can be used in combination with the existing flash translation layer (FTL) wear-leveling algorithm to increase lifetime. We evaluated the proposed prediction and lifetime improvement method for four different machine learning techniques, among which Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved superior accuracy up to 85% at a lower computational overhead.

AB During the production of tires, discontinuous and continuous processes take place in an interlinked sequence. A discontinuous mixing process is followed by a continuous extrusion and calendering procedure which is in turn followed by the discontinuous sequence of tire building and vulcanization. Product quality is determined by the four factors: man - raw material - process - machine.
   In modern, highly-mechanized and automated production processes, the human factor has been constantly reduced by the application of essentially automated manufacturing procedures with sensitive measuring and control technology. When process and machine are considered as an operation unit, then the quality of the initial product and the machine function determine the quality of the final product.
   In other words, the group of four factors has been reduced to a two-way relationship which is to be the subject of further investigation: \Q(E)\ = \F (Mi)\ x \Q(V)\ Whereby Q(V) are the quality values of the initial product as present in the statistical distribution, and Q(E) is accordingly the quality of the final product. These are coupled with a complex translation function which represents the procedural sequence and the machine properties and functions.
   The aim is to express this relationship in a mathematical formula, but this has only succeeded up to now in the exceptional case of partial operations.
   Parameters affecting the quality of the extrusion process, tire building engineering and the subsequent vulcanization process will be the subject of closer examination.

AB The correct definition and recognition of sentences is the basis of NLP. For the characteristics of Chinese text structure, the theory of NT clause was proposed from the perspective of micro topics. Based on this theory, this paper proposes a novel method for construction NT clause. Firstly, this paper proposes a neural network model based on Attention and LSTM (AttentionLSTM), which can identify the location of the missing Naming, and uses manually annotated corpus to train the Attention-LSTM. Secondly, in the process of constructing NT clause, the trained Attention-LSTM is used to identify the location of the missing Naming. Then the NT clause can be constructed. The accuracy of the experimental result is 81.74% (+4.5%). This paper can provide support for the task of text understanding, such as Machine Translation, Information Extraction, Man-machine Dialogue.

TI A Two-Level Morphological Description of Bashkir Turkish
SO COMPUTER SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB In recent years, the topic of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has attracted increasing interest. Many NLP applications including machine translation, machine learning, speech recognition, sentiment analysis, semantic search and natural language generation have been developed for most of the existing languages. Besides, two-level morphological description of the language to be used is required for these applications. However, there is no comprehensive study of Bashkir Turkish in the literature. In this paper, a two-level description of Bashkir Turkish morphology is described. The description based on a root word lexicon of Bashkir Turkish is implemented using Extensible Markup Language (XML) and appended to Nuve framework. The phonetic rules of Bashkir Turkish are encoded using 41 two-level rules. This two-level morphological description is promising to be used in Bashkir Turkish oriented NLP applications.

AB Cross-lingual textual entailment is a relatively new problem that detects the entailment relationship between two text fragments written in different languages. Previous work adopted machine learning algorithms and similarity measures as features to address this task. In order to overcome the high cost of human annotation and further improve the recognition performance, we present a novel co-training approach to solve this problem. We first use an off-the-shelf machine translation tool to eliminate the language gap between two texts. Then we measure the similarities and differences between two texts and regard them as sufficient and redundant views. We use those two views to conduct the co-training procedure to perform classification. Besides, a new effective Kullback-Leibler (KL) based criterion is proposed to select the results from all possible iterations. Experiments on cross-lingual datasets provided by SemEval 2013 show that our method significantly outperforms the baseline systems and previous work.

AB The integrity of virtual storage has become a very important issue in the virtual computing environment (like Xen-based computing platform). Current integrity detection systems have some disadvantages, for example, they cannot protect themselves well or the dependence between the detection results and the target system is high. We refer to the problem as lack of transparency. This paper presents a novel online integrity checker, BlockTapping, which ensures its security benefiting from the isolation property of virtual machine. Blocktapping monitors the block-level data streams transparently through block-to-file semantic-translation at the virtual block device layer. Based on the self-described information of virtual storages, BlockTapping detects the file-level malicious behaviors independent of the internal state of the compromised virtual machine. Experiments show that the prototype system successfully captures 13 typical user-mode rootkit attacks against virtual storage, and the performance overhead is acceptable.

AB Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) aim to help disabled patients by translating neural signals from the brain into control signals for guiding prosthetic arms, computer cursors, and other assistive devices. Animal models are central to the development of these systems and have helped enable the successful translation of the first generation of BMIs. As we move toward next-generation systems, we face the question of which animal models will aid broader patient populations and achieve even higher performance, robustness, and functionality. We review here four general types of rhesus monkey models employed in BMI research, and describe two additional, complementary models. Given the physiological diversity of neurological injury and disease, we suggest a need to maintain the current diversity of animal models and to explore additional alternatives, as each mimic different aspects of injury or disease.

AB Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of biological molecules in single-particle (i.e., unordered, nonaggregated) form is a new approach to the study of molecular assemblies, which are often too large and flexible to be amenable to X-ray crystallography. New insights into biological function on the molecular level are expected from cryo-EM applied to the study of such complexes "trapped" at different stages of their conformational changes and dynamical interactions. Important molecular machines involved in the fundamental processes of transcription, mRNA splicing, and translation are examples for successful applications of the new technique, combined with structural knowledge gained by conventional techniques of structure determination, such as X-ray crystallography and NMR.

AB The. NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) aims to provide interoperability among code written in several different languages, but porting scripting languages to it, so that scripts can run natively, has been hard. This paper presents our approach for running scripts written in Lua, a scripting language, on the. NET CLR.
   Previous approaches for running scripting languages on the CLR have focused on extending the CLR, statically generating CLR classes from user-defined types in the source languages. They required either language extensions or restrictions on the languages' dynamic features.
   Our approach, on the other hand, focused on keeping the syntax and semantics of the original language intact, while giving the ability to manipulate CLR objects. We implemented a translator of Lua virtual machine bytecodes to CLR bytecodes. Benchmarks show that the code our translator generates performs better than the code generated by compilers that use the previous approaches.

TI Key challenges for delivering clinical impact with artificial
   intelligence
SO BMC MEDICINE
AB Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) research in healthcare is accelerating rapidly, with potential applications being demonstrated across various domains of medicine. However, there are currently limited examples of such techniques being successfully deployed into clinical practice. This article explores the main challenges and limitations of AI in healthcare, and considers the steps required to translate these potentially transformative technologies from research to clinical practice.
   Main body: Key challenges for the translation of AI systems in healthcare include those intrinsic to the science of machine learning, logistical difficulties in implementation, and consideration of the barriers to adoption as well as of the necessary sociocultural or pathway changes. Robust peer-reviewed clinical evaluation as part of randomised controlled trials should be viewed as the gold standard for evidence generation, but conducting these in practice may not always be appropriate or feasible. Performance metrics should aim to capture real clinical applicability and be understandable to intended users. Regulation that balances the pace of innovation with the potential for harm, alongside thoughtful post-market surveillance, is required to ensure that patients are not exposed to dangerous interventions nor deprived of access to beneficial innovations. Mechanisms to enable direct comparisons of AI systems must be developed, including the use of independent, local and representative test sets. Developers of AI algorithms must be vigilant to potential dangers, including dataset shift, accidental fitting of confounders, unintended discriminatory bias, the challenges of generalisation to new populations, and the unintended negative consequences of new algorithms on health outcomes.
   Conclusion: The safe and timely translation of AI research into clinically validated and appropriately regulated systems that can benefit everyone is challenging. Robust clinical evaluation, using metrics that are intuitive to clinicians and ideally go beyond measures of technical accuracy to include quality of care and patient outcomes, is essential. Further work is required (1) to identify themes of algorithmic bias and unfairness while developing mitigations to address these, (2) to reduce brittleness and improve generalisability, and (3) to develop methods for improved interpretability of machine learning predictions. If these goals can be achieved, the benefits for patients are likely to be transformational.

TI From natural semantics to C: A formal derivation of two STG machines
SO JOURNAL OF FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
AB The Spineless Tag-less G-machine (STG machine) was defined as the target abstract machine for compiling the lazy functional language Haskell. It is at the heart of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) which is claimed to be the Haskell compiler that generates the most efficient code. A high-level description of the STG machine can be found in Peyton Jones (In Journal of Functional programming, 2(2), 127-202 1992), Marlow & Peyton Jones (In Sigplan Not., 39(9) 4-5 2004), and Marlow & Peyton Jones (in Journal of Functional Programming, 16(45), 415-449, 2006). Should the reader be interested in a more detailed view, then the only additional information available is the Haskell code of GHC and the C code of its runtime system.
   It is hard to prove that this machine correctly implements the lazy semantics of Haskell. Part of the problem lies in the fact that the STG machine executes a bare-bones functional language, called STGL, much lower level than Haskell. Therefore, part of the correctness should be-and it is-established by showing that the translation from Haskell to STGL preserves Haskell's semantics.
   The other part involves showing that the STG machine correctly implements the lazy semantics of STGL. In this paper we provide a step-by-step formal derivation of the STG machine and of its compilation to C, starting from a natural semantics of STGL. Thus, our starting point is higher level than the descriptions found Peyton Jones (In Journal of Functional programming, 2(2). 127-202, 1992) and Marlow & Peyton Jones (In Sigplan Not., 39(9) 4-5, 2004), and our arrival point is lower level than those works. Additionaly, there has been substantial changes between the so-called push/enter model or the STG machine described in Peyton Jones (In Journal of Functional programming, 2(2), 127-202, 1992), and the eval/apply model of the STG machine described in Marlow & Peyton Jones (In Sigplan Not., 39(9), 4-5, 2004). So, in fact, we derive two machines instead of one, starting from the same initial semantics.
   At each step we provide enough intuitions and explanations in order to understand the refinement, and then the formal definitions and statements proving that the derivation step is sound and complete. The main contribution of the paper is to show that an efficient machine such as the STG can be presented, understood, and formally reasoned about at different levels of abstraction.

SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB The LoReHLT16 evaluation challenged participants to extract Situation Frames (SFs)-structured descriptions of humanitarian need situations-from monolingual Uyghur text. The ARIEL-CMU SF detector combines two classification paradigms, a manually curated keyword-spotting system and a machine learning classifier. These were applied by translating the models on a per-feature basis, rather than translating the input text. The resulting combined model provides the accuracy of human insight with the generality of machine learning, and is relatively tractable to human analysis and error correction. Other factors contributing to success were automatic dictionary creation, the use of phonetic transcription, detailed, hand-written morphological analysis, and naturalistic glossing for error analysis by humans. The ARIEL-CMU SF pipeline produced the top-scoring LoReHLT16 situation frame detection systems for the metrics SFType, SFType+Place+Need, SFType+Place+Relief, and SFType+Place+Urgency, at each of the three checkpoints.

AB Automatic post-editing (APE) systems aim to correct the systematic errors made by machine translators. In this paper, we propose a neural APE system that encodes the source (src) and machine translated (mt) sentences with two separate encoders, but leverages a shared attention mechanism to better understand how the two inputs contribute to the generation of the post-edited (pe) sentences. Our empirical observations have showed that when the mt is incorrect, the attention shifts weight toward tokens in the src sentence to properly edit the incorrect translation. The model has been trained and evaluated on the official data from the WMT16 and WMT17 APE IT domain English-German shared tasks. Additionally, we have used the extra 500K artificial data provided by the shared task. Our system has been able to reproduce the accuracies of systems trained with the same data, while at the same time providing better interpretability.

TI Models of protein linear molecular motors for dynamic nanodevices
SO INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY
AB Protein molecular motors are natural nano-machines that convert the chemical energy from the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate into mechanical work. These efficient machines are central to many biological processes, including cellular motion, muscle contraction and cell division. The remarkable energetic efficiency of the protein molecular motors coupled with their nano-scale has prompted an increasing number of studies focusing on their integration in hybrid micro- and nanodevices, in particular using linear molecular motors. The translation of these tentative devices into technologically and economically feasible ones requires an engineering, design-orientated approach based on a structured formalism, preferably mathematical. This contribution reviews the present state of the art in the modelling of protein linear molecular motors, as relevant to the future design-orientated development of hybrid dynamic nanodevices.

AB The flourishing idea of Semantic Web being realized as extension of the World Wide Web infrastructure has rehabilitated interest in semantic interoperability between various semantic languages. Semantic languages like OWL, WSML and FIPA SL formalize WWW into machine process able and understandable, by their ability to represent machine interpretable content on the Web. These semantic description languages differ in syntax and semantic representation, resulting in mismatches that hamper semantic information exchange and interoperability for cross service utilization among the resulting information systems. In this paper we propose techniques to facilitate translation among heterogeneous contents while preserving the semantics. We then propose the architecture to realize the system in a middleware that will enable dynamic semantic interoperability between FIPA compliant software agents and semantic web languages including OWL and WSML. We will also develop a prototype application through which a software agent will invoke and use a web service published in OWL or WSML and vice versa.

AB The analysis of author's characteristic writing style and vocabulary has been used to uncover the identity of authors of documents by both manual linguistic approaches and automatic algorithmic methods. The revealing of the gender, name, or age can help to expose pedophiles in social networks, false product reviews on the Internet servers, or machine translations submitted as manually translated texts.
   These problems are predominantly solved by a combination of stylometry and machine learning techniques. Since the stylometry focuses on the author's style, word n-grams cannot be used as a style marker. Stop words are not influenced by a topic of documents, therefore they can be used to create style markers.
   In this paper, we present a guidance on how to implement stop-word extraction and to include stop-words based style markers into a multilingual classification system based on the stylometry.

AB In this paper, we present a novel weakly-supervised method for cross-lingual sentiment analysis. In specific, we propose a latent sentiment model (LSM) based on latent Dirichlet allocation where sentiment labels are considered as topics. Prior information extracted from English sentiment lexicons through machine translation are incorporated into LSM model learning, where preferences on expectations of sentiment labels of those lexicon words are expressed using generalized expectation criteria. An efficient parameter estimation procedure using variational Bayes is presented. Experimental results on the Chinese product reviews show that the weakly-supervised LSM model performs comparably to supervised classifiers such as Support vector Machines with an average of 81% accuracy achieved over a total of 5484 review documents. Moreover, starting with a generic sentiment lexicon, the LSM model is able to extract highly domain-specific polarity words from text.

SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS
AB Artificial neural networks have been successfully applied to a variety of machine learning tasks, including image recognition, semantic segmentation, and machine translation. However, few studies fully investigated ensembles of artificial neural networks. In this work, we investigated multiple widely used ensemble methods, including unweighted averaging, majority voting, the Bayes Optimal Classifier, and the (discrete) Super Learner, for image recognition tasks, with deep neural networks as candidate algorithms. We designed several experiments, with the candidate algorithms being the same network structure with different model checkpoints within a single training process, networks with same structure but trained multiple times stochastically, and networks with different structure. In addition, we further studied the overconfidence phenomenon of the neural networks, as well as its impact on the ensemble methods. Across all of our experiments, the Super Learner achieved best performance among all the ensemble methods in this study.

AB The system stiffness of a tripod parallel kinematic mechanism (PKM) with 3-DOF is investigated in this paper. The tripod PKM has rotations of a motion platform about the x and y axes and translation along the z axis. The motion on the other axes is constrained by a passive link. The stiffness model considers the compliances of three main components: the fixed-length links, the passive link, and the linear actuators. The modeling procedure for the kinetostatic stiffness model is introduced. A case study is provided to demonstrate evaluation of the stiffness of our prototype tripod machine. The developed model differs from the others in the sense that the stiffness on the motion axes is determined by both the active links and the passive link; but the stiffness on the constrained motion axes depends merely on the passive link.

AB Nowadays the leading world scientists and engineers center their attention to data mining and machine learning algorithms optimization and acceleration rather than inventing new ones. The natural language processing methods and tools are widely in use in production in the area of machine translation. The researches in the area of search engines and semantic search are mostly concentrated on data storage and further analysis. The majority of search engines use the huge amounts of previously accumulated user requests for predicting the search output without taking in attention this user intention by qualitative processing the request.
   In this paper we explore the idea of usage the semantic cognitive spaces for extracting the exact user intentions by analysis the natural language input requests. The final goal of our research is to develop a valid search query model for further usage in semantic search engines.

AB Brickwork is the oldest construction method still in use. Digital technologies, in turn, enabled new methods of representation and automation for bricklaying. While automation explored different approaches, representation was limited to declarative methods, as parametric filling algorithms. Alternatively, this work proposes a framework for automated brickwork using a machine learning model based on image-to-image translation (Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks). The framework consists of creating a dataset, training a model for each bond, and converting the output images into vectorial data for robotic assembly. Criteria such as: reaching wall boundary accuracy, avoidance of unsupported bricks, and brick's position accuracy were individually evaluated for each bond. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework fulfils boundary filling and respects overall bonding structural rules. Size accuracy demonstrated inferior performance for the scale tested. The association of this method with 'self-calibrating' robots could overcome this problem and be easily implemented for on-site.

AB Safe program execution environment using sandboxing mechanism is one of important differences of Java(1) programming language and traditional languages. This safety characteristic can be preserved when a program is written in pure Java language, but it may be lost when machine-dependent native code is used in the program. We address this problem by incorporating a novel VM structure that improves the reliability and security of sandboxing mechanism of Java VM. It uses a hybrid execution model combining interpreted execution of Java code and emulated execution of native code. Unmodified native JNI methods are executed by using an emulation engine using binary translation with additional sandboxed execution enforcement. Experimental results of prototype implementation show that performance penalty for SPECjvm98 benchmarks is relatively small, ranging from 0% to 30% meaning that the proposed approach is promising.

AB In this paper a novel 5 Degrees of Freedoms(DoFs) parallel kinematic polishing machine is presented, which could perform automatic polishing for the freeform parts. The T3R2(3 Translations and 2 Rotations) 4URHU-1URHR parallel mechanism is first proposed, it is composed of four 6-DoF kinematic chain and one 5-DoF constraint chain, the polishing tool is installed on the platform. The inverse kinematics is developed and the dexterity index is derived, so that an optimal design for the parallel mechanism is carried out, based on the optimal results the workspace with specified dexterity index of the parallel mechanism could meet the requirements of polishing space. The singularity-free polishing path generation is then carried out with the adjustments of orientation of the NC rotary table. Simulation results show that in the whole polishing process no singular positions are included within the workspace. The work provides theoretical analysis for the development of prototype.

AB State machines, represented by statecharts or state machine diagrams, are an important formalism for behavioural modelling. According to the research literature, the most popular statechart formalisms appear to be Classical, UML, and that implemented by Rhapsody. These three formalisms seem to be very similar; however, there are several key syntactic and semantic differences. These differences are enough that a model written in one formalism could be ill-formed in another formalism. Worse, a model from one formalism might actually be well-formed in another, but be interpreted differently due to the semantic differences. This paper summarizes the results of an informal comparative study of these three formalisms with the help of several illustrative examples. We present a classification of the differences according to the nature of potential problems caused by each difference. In addition, for each difference we discuss how translation between formalisms can be achieved, if at all.

TI Acronyms: identification, expansion and disambiguation
SO ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Acronyms-words formed from the initial letters of a phrase-are important for various natural language processing applications, including information retrieval and machine translation. While hand-crafted acronym dictionaries exist, they are limited and require frequent updates. We present a new machine-learning-based approach to automatically build an acronym dictionary from unannotated texts. This is the first such technique that specifically handles non-local acronyms, i.e., that can determine an acronym's expansion even when the expansion does not appear in the same document as the acronym. Our approach automatically enhances the dictionary with contextual information to help address the acronym disambiguation task (selecting the most appropriate expansion for a given acronym in context), outperforming dictionaries built using prior techniques. We apply the approach to Modern Hebrew, a language with a long tradition of using acronyms, in which the productive morphology and unique orthography adds to the complexity of the problem.

AB In recent years, advances in machine learning and related fields have led to significant advances in a range of user-interface technologies, including audio processing, speech recognition, and natural language processing. These advances in turn have enabled speech-based digital assistants and speech-to-speech translation systems to become practical to deploy on a large scale. In essence, machines are becoming capable of hearing what we are saying. But will they understand what we want them to do when we talk to them? What are the prospects for getting useful work done - in essence, by synthesizing programs - through the act of having a conversation with a computer?
   In this lecture, I will speculate on the central role that programming-language design and program synthesis may have in this possible - and I will argue, likely future of computing, one in which every user writes programs, every day, by conversing with a computing system.

TI DECIMER-hand-drawn molecule images dataset
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS
AB The translation of images of chemical structures into machine-readable representations of the depicted molecules is known as optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR). There has been a lot of progress over the last three decades in this field, but the development of systems for the recognition of complex hand-drawn structure depictions is still at the beginning. Currently, there is no data for the systematic evaluation of OCSR methods on hand-drawn structures available. Here we present DECIMER - Hand-drawn molecule images, a standardised, openly available benchmark dataset of 5088 hand-drawn depictions of diversely picked chemical structures. Every structure depiction in the dataset is mapped to a machine-readable representation of the underlying molecule. The dataset is openly available and published under the CC-BY 4.0 licence which applies very few limitations. We hope that it will contribute to the further development of the field.

An increase in Human-in-the-loop (HITL) error rate may be indicative of reduced operator SA while undermining safety. In this paper, natural language processing (NLP) is applied for modelling industrial Human Machine Interface (HMI) state transitions as a means to detect operator HITL error precursors in real-time. A custom seq2seq encode-decoder deep-learning model design is implemented and evaluated using real-plant scenario dataset obtained from a NPP Operator training simulator. Results support NLP HMI state model may be employed to detect HITL error precursor within the desired N time-steps prior to an accident event.

AB Deep Learning has become increasingly popular since Alexnet was proposed. It has been applied to many domains such as pattern recognition, computer vision, machine translation, and natural language processing. While the advantages of deep learning methods are wildly accepted, the limitations of them are not well researched. In this paper, we present our study and analysis of cases where deep learning methods lose their advantages over traditional methods. Our experiments show that, when the neighbouring proximity disappears, the accuracy of deep learning methods is at most as good as, if not worse than, that of advanced traditional shallow methods. As the resources that traditional shallow methods needed are always much less than deep learning methods. We conclude that, in situations where neighbouring elements of input samples do not have proximity, deep learning methods are significantly less powerful than traditional methods. Furthermore, this clearly indicates that deep structure methods cannot fully replace traditional shallow methods.

AB Virtual machines are versatile systems that can support innovative solutions to many problems. These systems usually rely on emulation techniques, such as interpretation and dynamic binary translation, to execute guest application code. Usually, in order to select the best emulation technique for each code segment, the system must predict whether the code is worth compiling (frequently executed) or not, known as hotness prediction.
   In this paper we show that the threshold-based hot code predictor, frequently mispredicts the code hotness and as a result the VM emulation performance become dominated by miscompilations. To do so, we developed a mathematical model to simulate the behavior of such predictor and using it we quantify and characterize the impact of mispredictions in several benchmarks. We also show how the threshold choice can affect the predictor, what are the major overhead components and how using SPEC to analyze a VM performance can lead to misleading results.

AB This paper describes progress towards making a Neural Text-to-Speech (TTS) Frontend that works for many languages and can be easily extended to new languages. We take a Machine Translation (MT) inspired approach to constructing the frontend, and model both text normalization and pronunciation on a sentence level by building and using sequence-to-sequence (S2S) models. We experimented with training normalization and pronunciation as separate S2S models and with training a single S2S model combining both functions.
   For our language-independent approach to pronunciation we do not use a lexicon. Instead all pronunciations, including context-based pronunciations, are captured in the S2S model. We also present a language-independent chunking and splicing technique that allows us to process arbitrary-length sentences. Models for 18 languages were trained and evaluated. Many of the accuracy measurements are above 99%. We also evaluated the models in the context of end-to-end synthesis against our current production system.

AB Annotations and assertions capturing static program properties are ubiquitous, from robust software engineering to safety-critical or secure code. These may be functional or non-functional properties of control and data flow, memory usage, I/O and real time. We propose an approach to encode, translate, and preserve the semantics of both functional and non-functional properties along the optimizing compilation of C to machine code. The approach involves (1) capturing and translating source-level properties through lowering passes and intermediate representations, such that data and control flow optimizations will preserve their consistency with the transformed program, and (2) carrying properties and their translation as debug information down to machine code. Our experiments using LLVM validate the soundness, expressiveness and efficiency of the approach, considering a reference suite of functional properties as well as established security properties and applications hardened against side-channel attacks.

AB It has been long suggested that commit messages can greatly facilitate code comprehension. however, developers may not write good commit messages in practice. Neural machine translation (NMT) has been suggested to automatically generate commit messages. Despite the efforts in improving NMT algorithms, the quality of the generated commit messages is not yet satisfactory. This paper, instead of improving NMT algorithms, suggests that proper preprocessing of code changes into concise inputs is quite critical to train NMT. We approach it with semantic analysis of code changes. We collect a real-world dataset with 50k+ commits of popular Java projects, and verify our idea with comprehensive experiments. The results show that preprocessing inputs with code semantic analysis can improve NMT significantly. This work sheds light to how to apply existing DNNs designed by the machine learning community, e.g., NMT models, to complete software engineering tasks.

AB Since the professional technical literature include amounts of complex noun phrases, identifying those phrases has an important practical value for such tasks as machine translation. Through analysis of those phrases in Chinese-English bilingual sentence pairs from the aircraft technical publications, we present an annotation specification based on the existing specification to label those phrases and a method for the complex noun phrase identification. In addition to the basic features including the word and the part-of-speech, we incorporate the word clustering features trained by Brown clustering model and Word Vector Class (WVC) model on a large unlabeled data into the machine learning model. Experimental results indicate that the combination of different word clustering features and basic features can leverage system performance, and improve the F-score by 1.83 % in contrast with the method only adding the basic features.

AB Virtual machines (VMs) emulating hardware devices are generally implemented in low-level languages for performance reasons. This results in unmaintainable systems that are difficult to understand. In this paper we report on our experience using the PYPY toolchain to improve the portability and reduce the complexity of whole-system VM implementations. As a case study we implement a VM prototype for a Nintendo Game Boy, called PYGIRL, in which the high-level model is separated from low-level VM implementation issues. We shed light on the process of refactoring from a low-level VM implementation in Java to a high-level model in RPython. We show that our whole-system VM written with PYPY is significantly less complex than standard implementations, without substantial loss in performance.

Based on experiments on various color and style LED lights, The single-color LED illumination composed of a ring LED light and some LED lamps are adopted to get a uniform luminance of visual field and clear contours of the object's surface. The vision software is developed based on HexSight, the conference points are added to models of Locator to recognize different objects(chip & substrate). The reasonable control scheme of two CCD cameras is adopted. According to the error of translation and rotation estimated by experiments on many real images, the composite position error of the vision system on scale 1X1mm chip is calculated, which indicates the high precision and satisfaction of this vision system in microelectronic Packaging.

AB The epistolary correspondence between Thomas Mann and Jean Cocteau has for a long time been considered to be lost, and only minor traces of this Franco-German mutual exchange seem to have survived in Mann's Diaries. During my research in Paris, however, I discovered four letters written in French, which survived in the Bibliotheque Historique de la Ville de Paris: three by Thomas Mann and one by Cocteau. These documents are here edited, translated and discussed for the first time. They are evidence of a very close intellectual exchange of ideas, focussing on Cocteau's play La Machine infernale and on French Surrealism. By doing this, these letters shed an intensive light on Thomas Mann's texts written during the 1930s and 1940s, especially on Lotte in Weimar, Die vertauschten Kopfe, Doktor Faustus and on a planned translation of La Machine infernale by Mann, which was never realized.

AB In this paper, we present a combination of existing and new tools that together make it possible to apply formal verification methods to programs in the form of x86_64 machine code. Our approach first uses a decompilation tool (remill) to extract low-level intermediate representation (LLVM) from the machine code. This step consists of instruction translation (i.e. recovery of operation semantics), control flow extraction and address identification.
   The main contribution of this paper is the second step, which builds on data flow analysis and refinement of indirect (i.e. data-dependent) control flow. This step makes the processed bitcode much more amenable to formal analysis.
   To demonstrate the viability of our approach, we have compiled a set of benchmark programs into native executables and analysed them using two LLVM-based tools: DIVINE, a software model checker and KLEE, a symbolic execution engine. We have compared the outcomes to direct analysis of the same programs.

AB Machine learning in hyperbolic spaces has attracted much attention in natural language processing and many other fields. In particular, Hyperbolic Neural Networks (HNNs) have improved a wide variety of tasks, from machine translation to knowledge graph embedding. Although some studies have reported the effectiveness of embedding into the product of multiple hyperbolic spaces, HNNs have mainly been constructed in a single hyperbolic space, and their extension to product spaces has not been sufficiently studied. Therefore, we propose a novel method to extend a given HNN in a single space to a product of hyperbolic spaces. We apply our method to Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Networks (HGCNs), extending several HNNs. Our model improved the graph node classification accuracy especially on datasets with tree-like structures. The results suggest that neural networks in a product of hyperbolic spaces can be more effective than in a single space in representing structural data.

TI Simply typed fixpoint calculus and collapsible pushdown automata
SO MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Simply typed lambda-calculus with fixpoint combinators lambda Y -calculus, offers an interesting method for approximating program semantics. The Bohm tree of a lambda Y -term represents the meaning of the program up to the meaning of built-in constants. It is much easier to reason about properties of such trees than properties of interpreted programs. Moreover, some interesting properties of programs are already expressible on the level of these trees.
   Collapsible pushdown automata (CPDA) give another way of generating the same class of trees as lambda Y -terms. We clarify the relationship between the two models. In particular, we present two relatively simple translations from lambda Y terms to CPDA using Krivine machines as an intermediate step. The latter are general machines for describing computation of the weak head normal form in the lambda-calculus. They provide the notions of closure and environment that facilitate reasoning about computation.

AB We present an operational model for describing random reactive systems. Some models have already been proposed for this purpose, but they generally aim at performing global reasoning on systems, such as stochastic analysis, or formal proofs. Our goal is somehow less ambitious, since we are rather interested in. executing such models, for testing or prototyping. But on the other hand, the proposed model is not restricted by decidability issues. Therefore it can be more expressive: in particular, our model is not restricted to finite-state descriptions.
   The proposed model is rather general: systems are described as implicit state/transition machines, possibly infinite, where probabilities are expressed by means of relative weights. The model itself is more an abstract machine than. a programming language. The idea is then. to propose high-level, user-friendly languages that can, be compiled into the model. We present such a language, based on regular expressions, together with its translation into the model.

TI Machine learning in computational biology to accelerate high-throughput

SO BIOINFORMATICS
AB Motivation: The Human Protein Atlas (HPA) enables the simultaneous characterization of thousands of proteins across various tissues to pinpoint their spatial location in the human body. This has been achieved through transcriptomics and high-throughput immunohistochemistry-based approaches, where over 40 000 unique human protein fragments have been expressed in E. coli. These datasets enable quantitative tracking of entire cellular proteomes and present new avenues for understanding molecular-level properties influencing expression and solubility.
   Results: Combining computational biology and machine learning identifies protein properties that hinder the HPA high-throughput antibody production pipeline. We predict protein expression and solubility with accuracies of 70% and 80%, respectively, based on a subset of key properties (aromaticity, hydropathy and isoelectric point). We guide the selection of protein fragments based on these characteristics to optimize high-throughput experimentation.

AB Recently, various datasets for question answering (QA) research have been released, such as SQuAD, Marco, WikiQA, MCTest, and SearchQA. However, such existing training resources for these task mostly support only English. In contrast, we study semi-automated creation of the Korean Question Answering Dataset (K-QuAD), by using automatically translated SQuAD and a QA system bootstrapped on a small QA pair set. As a naive approach for other language, using only machine-translated SQuAD shows limited performance due to translation errors. We study why such approach fails and motivate needs to build seed resources to enable leveraging such resources. Specifically, we annotate seed QA pairs of small size (4K) for Korean language, and design how such seed can be combined with translated English resources. These approach, by combining two resources, leads to 71.50 F1 on Korean QA (comparable to 77.3 F1 on SQuAD).

Beginning during protein biogenesis, the translation machinery and a number of molecular chaperones promote correct de novo folding of nascent proteins even before synthesis is complete. Another set of molecular chaperones helps to maintain proteins in their functional, native state. Polypeptides that are no longer needed or pose a threat to the cell, such as misfolded proteins and aggregates, are removed in an efficient and timely fashion by ATP-dependent proteases. In this review, we describe how applications of single-molecule manipulation methods, in particular optical tweezers, are shedding new light on the molecular mechanisms of quality control during the life cycles of proteins.

TI Using eigenvalues of covariance matrices for automated visual inspection
   of microdrills
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB This paper proposes a translation, rotation, and template-free automated visual inspection scheme that detects microdrill defects using the eigenvalues of covariance matrices. We first derived the colour images of microdrills and extracted the boundary of the first facets. Then, the smaller eigenvalues of the covariance matrices of given regions of support were calculated for boundary representation, and they were thresholded to separate the boundaries into segments. The least square linear regression method was used to fit the segments into linear equations. Eventually, the defects were detected by three inspection rules that measure five features of microdrills including: gap distance, parallel, and enclosed angles, accordingly. The proposed scheme was implemented in C++ with a graphical user interface environment. Fifteen microdrills, digitized without alignment, were used to verify the proposed inspection process. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme reliably achieves the inspection of microdrills.

AB Computations in Support Vector Machines (SVM) involve a large number of vector multiplications. When implementing such architectures on a stand alone, embedded system, the complexity of the hardware implementation of the multipliers can be a limiting factor.
   This paper proposes a representation of numerical data to be processed by an approximation of the logarithm of the number, thus allowing the substitution of expensive multipliers with simpler adders. Additional circuitry is proposed to translate between standard and the proposed pseudo-logarithmic number representation.
   The operations for the representation translation, addition and multiplication with pseudo-logarithmic numbers have been implemented in software and several experiments have been carried out to assess their performance when used in a SVM-based computational architecture that was used for data classification. The results obtained show that the proposed representation yields an accuracy that is comparable with that obtained by using standard floating point or fixed point number representation.

The solution is threefold: 1) topic detection, 2) sentiment evaluation, 3) toxicity detection and toxic spans localization. The lack of significantly large training data for the Russian language is handled by utilizing multilingual word embeddings, the adversarial domain adaptation model, and data augmentation. We present an overview of various preprocessing pipelines for topic modeling and highlight the LDA-Mallet model which demonstrates the best performance. For sentiment analysis and toxicity detection, we examine the efficacy of a support vector machine and a deep neural network with a multilingual language model and adversarial domain adaptation that allows us to train algorithms with datasets in the English language. All methods are tested with a dataset of user comments to various online-courses and adjusted to provide support for the development of a virtual dialogue assistant for conducting virtual exams.

TI Agreement on Target-Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks for
   Sequence-to-Sequence Learning
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
AB Recurrent neural networks are extremely appealing for sequence-to-sequence learning tasks. Despite their great success, they typically suffer from a shortcoming: they are prone to generate unbalanced targets with good prefixes but bad suffixes, and thus performance suffers when dealing with long sequences. We propose a simple yet effective approach to overcome this shortcoming. Our approach relies on the agreement between a pair of target-directional RNNs, which generates more balanced targets. In addition, we develop two efficient approximate search methods for agreement that are empirically shown to be almost optimal in terms of either sequence level or non-sequence level metrics. Extensive experiments were performed on three standard sequence-to-sequence transduction tasks: machine transliteration, grapheme-to-phoneme transformation and machine translation. The results show that the proposed approach achieves consistent and substantial improvements, compared to many state-of-the-art systems.

AB With the rapid development of computer science, generative adversarial networks (GAN) have become increasingly important in machine learning. GAN is a machine learning model consisting of a generative network and discriminative network and it is a two-player game proposed by Goodfellow. GAN plays a significant role in real-life application, especially in the image to image translation, image synthesis, data augmentation, and image editing. However, GANs have several issues that have not been well addressed: non-convergence problem, collapse problem, and so on. This article provides a comprehensive overview and analysis of GAN. Firstly, the theory, architecture, and training procedure of the original GAN are introduced in detail. Moreover, we present several variants of GAN, including DCGAN, BEGAN, LSGAN, CIAGAN, and WGAN. We discuss the motivation and networks structures of these variants and list and summarize their advantages and difference. Finally, we provide readers with several evaluation metrics for GAN and point out future open research challenges.

AB The overhead crane is one of dangerous machines. It may cause personnel injury, or even property damages if any accidents happen in working area. Thus, to ensure safe operation, the load size, route and working environment should be taken into consideration. This study developed a safety alarm device for overhead crane to prevent impacting persons or objects, and used image processing technology to create a video surveillance system. It can track the target object automatically and maintain the preset distance between the warning limit and the hanging object as the hanging object ascends or descends. It can be applied on an overhead crane for early warning on collision and prevention of the hanging object from impacting the workers or other equipments. The distance between the obstacle and hanging object is estimated by using perspective projection, translation of axes and rotation skills, thus ensuring the safety effect.

TI Part of Speech Tagging in Urdu: Comparison of Machine and Deep Learning
   Approaches
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In Urdu, part of speech (POS) tagging is a challenging task as it is both inflectionally and derivationally rich morphological language. Verbs are generally conceived a highly inflected object in Urdu comparatively to nouns. POS tagging is used as a preliminary linguistic text analysis in diverse natural language processing domains such as speech processing, information extraction, machine translation, and others. It is a task that first identifies appropriate syntactic categories for each word in running text and second assigns the predicted syntactic tag to all concerned words. The current work is the extension of our previous work. Previously, we presented conditional random field (CRF)-based POS tagger with both language dependent and independent feature set. However, in the current study, we offer: 1) the implementation of both machine and deep learning models for Urdu POS tagging task with well-balanced language-independent feature set and 2) to highlight diverse challenges which cause Urdu POS task a challenging one. In this research, we demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning and deep learning models for Urdu POS task. Empirically, we have evaluated the performance of all models on two benchmark datasets. The core models evaluated in this study are CRF, support vector machine (SVM), two variants of the deep recurrent neural network (DRNN), and a variant of n-gram Markov model the bigram hidden Markov model (HMM). The two variants of DRRN models evaluated include forward long short-term memory (LSTM)-RNN and LSTM-RNN with CRF output.

AB In order to design an efficient vision-based gesture recognition system, the images of the hand gestures need to be represented in an accurate way. This paper presents a new method for representing hands' images based on the Hilbert space-filling curve. The method first segments the hand and then applies a Hilbert space-filling curve to extract a feature vector. Afterwards, a classifier, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), are used to classify the gestures. The Hilbert curve representation is chosen in this work since it has proved its efficiency in representing shapes with uniform background, due to its localization-preserving property of pixels. Moreover, it is also known of being invariant to translation, scaling, and stretching. The results reveal the efficiency and suitability of the proposed approach compared to that of other works in real time.

It is proved that the p(th)-derivative Gaussian wavelet is an admissible translation-invariant kernel function of SVM when p is an even number. The Gaussian wavelet SVM is constructed with wavelet kernel function, and improved stochastic focusing search (SFS) algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of SVM and its kernel function. The experiments of STLF are conducted using the proposed SVM, the conventional Gaussian SVM and Morlet wavelet SVM respectively. The comparison shows that the proposed method is efficient and superior, and has some application value in STLF. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper introduces a novel framework for estimating the motion of a robotic car from image information, a scenario widely known as visual odometry. Most current monocular visual odometry algorithms rely on a calibrated camera model and recover relative rotation and translation by tracking image features and applying geometrical constraints. This approach has some drawbacks: translation is recovered up to a scale, it requires camera calibration which can be tricky under certain conditions, and uncertainty estimates are not directly obtained. We propose an alternative approach that involves the use of semi-parametric statistical models as means to recover scale, infer camera parameters and provide uncertainty estimates given a training dataset. As opposed to conventional non-parametric machine learning procedures, where standard models for egomotion would be neglected, we present a novel framework in which the existing parametric models and powerful non-parametric Bayesian learning procedures are combined. We devise a multiple output Gaussian Process (GP) procedure, named Coupled GP, that uses a parametric model as the mean function and a non-stationary covariance function to map image features directly into vehicle motion. Additionally, this procedure is also able to infer joint uncertainty estimates (full covariance matrices) for rotation and translation. Experiments performed using data collected from a single camera under challenging conditions show that this technique outperforms traditional methods in trajectories of several kilometers.

AB This paper reviews some of the challenges posed by the huge growth of experimental data generated by the new generation of large-scale experiments at UK national facilities at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) site at Harwell near Oxford. Such 'Big Scientific Data' comes from the Diamond Light Source and Electron Microscopy Facilities, the ISIS Neutron and Muon Facility and the UK's Central Laser Facility. Increasingly, scientists are now required to use advanced machine learning and other AI technologies both to automate parts of the data pipeline and to help find new scientific discoveries in the analysis of their data. For commercially important applications, such as object recognition, natural language processing and automatic translation, deep learning has made dramatic breakthroughs. Google's DeepMind has now used the deep learning technology to develop their AlphaFold tool to make predictions for protein folding. Remarkably, it has been able to achieve some spectacular results for this specific scientific problem. Can deep learning be similarly transformative for other scientific problems? After a brief review of some initial applications of machine learning at the RAL, we focus on challenges and opportunities for AI in advancing materials science. Finally, we discuss the importance of developing some realistic machine learning benchmarks using Big Scientific Data coming from several different scientific domains. We conclude with some initial examples of our 'scientific machine learning' benchmark suite and of the research challenges these benchmarks will enable. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Numerical algorithms for high-performance computational science'.

TI B1 field map synthesis with generative deep learning used in the design
   of parallel-transmit RF pulses for ultra-high field MRI
SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR MEDIZINISCHE PHYSIK
AB Spoke trajectory parallel transmit (pTX) excitation in ultra-high field MRI enables B+1 inhomogeneities arising from the shortened RF wavelength in biological tissue to be mitigated. To this end, current RF excitation pulse design algorithms either employ the acquisition of field maps with subsequent non-linear optimization or a universal approach applying robust pre-computed pulses. We suggest and evaluate an intermediate method that uses a subset of acquired field maps combined with generative machine learning models to reduce the pulse calibration time while offering more tailored excitation than robust pulses (RP).The possibility of employing image-to-image translation and semantic image synthesis machine learning models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) to deduce the missing field maps is examined. Additionally, an RF pulse design that employs a predictive machine learning model to find solutions for the non-linear (two-spokes) pulse design problem is investigated.As a proof of concept, we present simulation results obtained with the suggested machine learning approaches that were trained on a limited data-set, acquired in vivo. The achieved excitation homogeneity based on a subset of half of the B+1 maps acquired in the calibration scans and half of the B+1 maps synthesized with GANs is comparable with state of the art pulse design methods when using the full set of calibration data while halving the total calibration time. By employing RP dictionaries or machine-learning RF pulse predictions, the total calibration time can be reduced significantly as these methods take only seconds or milliseconds per slice, respectively.

TI A Systematic Comparison of Data Selection Criteria for SMT Domain
   Adaptation
SO SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL
AB Data selection has shown significant improvements in effective use of training data by extracting sentences from large general-domain corpora to adapt statistical machine translation (SMT) systems to in-domain data. This paper performs an in-depth analysis of three different sentence selection techniques. The first one is cosine tf-idf, which comes from the realm of information retrieval (IR). The second is perplexity-based approach, which can be found in the field of language modeling. These two data selection techniques applied to SMT have been already presented in the literature. However, edit distance for this task is proposed in this paper for the first time. After investigating the individual model, a combination of all three techniques is proposed at both corpus level and model level. Comparative experiments are conducted on Hong Kong law Chinese-English corpus and the results indicate the following: (i) the constraint degree of similarity measuring is not monotonically related to domain-specific translation quality; (ii) the individual selection models fail to perform effectively and robustly; but (iii) bilingual resources and combination methods are helpful to balance out-of-vocabulary (OOV) and irrelevant data; (iv) finally, our method achieves the goal to consistently boost the overall translation performance that can ensure optimal quality of a real-life SMT system.

AB As the outward-most representation of life, phenotype is the fundamental basis with which humans understand life and disease. But with the advent of molecular and sequencing technique and research, a growing portion of science research focuses primarily on the molecular level of life. Our understanding in molecular variations and mechanisms can only be fully utilized when they are translated into the phenotypic level. In this study, we constructed similarity network for phenotype ontology, and then applied network analysis methods to discover phenotype/disease clusters. Then, we used machine learning models to predict protein-phenotype associations. Each protein was characterized by the functional profiles of its interaction neighbors on the protein-protein interaction network. Our methods can not only predict protein-phenotype associations, but also reveal the underlying mechanisms from protein to phenotype.

First, the cross-section of the new micro drill flute is modeled by mathematical equations. Second, machine parameters and work-piece geometric parameters are set up. Third, the engagement equation between the grinding wheel and flute surfaces is developed. Fourth, that equation is solved to obtain the locus of contact points. Finally, the translation and rotation transformations of that locus are carried out to obtain the grinding wheel profile for the new micro drill flute.

TI Automatic isotropic fractionation for large-scale quantitative cell
   analysis of nervous tissue
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS
AB Isotropic fractionation is a quantitative technique that allows reliable estimates of absolute numbers of neuronal and non-neuronal brain cells. However, being fast for single small brains, it requires a long time for processing large brains or many small ones, if done manually. To solve this problem, we developed a machine to automate the method, and tested its efficiency, consistency, and reliability as compared with manual processing. The machine consists of a set of electronically controlled rotation and translation motors coupled to tissue grinders, which automatically transform fixed tissue into homogeneous nuclei suspensions. Speed and torque of the motors can be independently regulated by electronic circuits, according to the volume of tissue being processed and its mechanical resistance to fractionation. To test the machine, twelve paraformaldehyde-fixed rat brains and eight human cerebella were separated into two groups, respectively: one processed automatically and the other, manually. Both pairs of groups (rat and human tissue) followed the same, published protocol of the method. We compared the groups according to nuclei morphology, degree of clustering and number of cells. The machine proved superior for yielding faster results due to simultaneous processing in multiple grinders. Quantitative analysis of machine-processed tissue resulted in similar average numbers of total brain cells, neurons, and non-neuronal cells, statistically similar to the manually processed tissue and equivalent to previously published data. We concluded that the machine is more efficient because it utilizes many homogenizers simultaneously, equally consistent in producing high quality material for counting, and quantitatively reliable as compared to manual processing.

TI Automated 3D structure composition for large RNAs
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Understanding the numerous functions that RNAs play in living cells depends critically on knowledge of their three-dimensional structure. Due to the difficulties in experimentally assessing structures of large RNAs, there is currently great demand for new high-resolution structure prediction methods. We present the novel method for the fully automated prediction of RNA 3D structures from a user-defined secondary structure. The concept is founded on the machine translation system. The translation engine operates on the RNA FRABASE database tailored to the dictionary relating the RNA secondary structure and tertiary structure elements. The translation algorithm is very fast. Initial 3D structure is composed in a range of seconds on a single processor. The method assures the prediction of large RNA 3D structures of high quality. Our approach needs neither structural templates nor RNA sequence alignment, required for comparative methods. This enables the building of unresolved yet native and artificial RNA structures. The method is implemented in a publicly available, user-friendly server RNAComposer. It works in an interactive mode and a batch mode. The batch mode is designed for large-scale modelling and accepts atomic distance restraints. Presently, the server is set to build RNA structures of up to 500 residues.

AB Semantic role labeling task is a way of shallow semantic analysis. Its research results are of great significance for promoting Machine Translation [1], Question Answering [2], Human Robot Interaction [3] and other application systems. The goal of semantic role labeling is to recover the predicate-argument structure of a sentence, based on the sentences entered and the predicates specified in the sentence. Then mark the relationship between the predicate and the argument, such as time, place, the agent, the victim, and so on. This paper introduces the main research directions of semantic role labeling and the research status at home and abroad in recent years. And summarized a large number of research results based on statistical machine learning and deep neural networks. The main purpose is to analyze the method of semantic role labeling and its current status. Summarize the development trend of the future semantic role labeling.

TI Multi-engine collaborative bootstrapping for word sense disambiguation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS
AB In this paper we propose a new word sense disambiguation method called Multi- engine Collaborative Bootstrapping ( MCB) that combines different types of corpora and also uses two languages for bootstrapping. MCB uses the bilingual bootstrapping as its core algorithm that leading to incremental knowledge acquisition. The EM model is applied to train parameters in a base learner. The feature translation model is improved by semantic correlation estimation. In addition we use multi- engine selection to produce qualified starting seeds from parallel corpora and monolingual corpora. Those seeds that are generated through unsupervised machine learning approaches can also ensure bootstrapping effectiveness in contrast with manually selected seeds in spite of their different selection mechanisms. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of MCB. Some factors including feature space and starting seed number are concerned involved in our experiments because the EM algorithm is sensitive to starting values. Limitation of resources is also a concern.

TI Pulsed femtosecond-laser Machining and deep reactive ion etching of
   diamond
SO DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS
AB This paper reports the deep reactive ion etching of femtosecond laser-machined high-aspect graphitic channels through diamond. To begin, two chemical vapor deposition-grown diamond plates, one single-crystal and the other polycrystalline, are processed using the bulk microstructural modification technique of femtosecondpulsed laser machining. Multiple laser parameters are varied in processing the polycrystalline sample, including laser pulse frequency, pulse energy, and number of pulses per micron step size between the back and the front of the diamond, whereas a constrained set of parameters is used with the single-crystal sample. Over the range of parameters evaluated for the polycrystalline diamond, Raman analysis exhibits photoluminescence from defects created near the surface through the laser machining process, but little, if any, graphite-like features. However, a Raman signal from graphite-like material is observed on the surface of the graphitic channels for the single-crystal diamond, from which it is determined that greater diamond to graphite-like phase conversion is obtained with a larger number of pulses per translation step and with a higher laser pulse energy. Further, a larger number of pulses per step results in strong luminescence, observed during Raman investigation. Subsequent deep reactive ion etching of the samples reveals that the laser-machined channels etch considerably faster near the surface than the surrounding diamond, and that a high relative etch rate is obtained even when graphite-like features are absent from the Raman spectra. The highest relative etch rate of the single-crystal sample was 1.61 jun/min. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Simultaneous lecture translation requires speech to be translated in real time before the speaker has spoken an entire sentence since a long delay will create difficulties for the listeners trying to follow the lecture. The challenge is to construct a full-fledged system with speech recognition, machine translation, and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) components that could produce high quality speech translations on the fly. Specifically for a TTS, this poses problems as a conventional framework commonly requires the language-dependent contextual linguistics of a full sentence to produce a natural-sounding speech waveform. Several studies have proposed ways for an incremental TTS (TITS), in which it can estimate the target prosody from only partial knowledge of the sentence. However, most investigations are being done only in French, English, and German. French is a syllable-timed language and the others are stress-timed languages. The Japanese language, which is a mora-timed language, has not been investigated so far. In this paper, we evaluate the quality of Japanese synthesized speech based on various linguistic and temporal incremental units. Experimental results reveal that an accent phrase incremental unit (a group of moras) is essential for a Japanese ITTS as a trade-off between quality and synthesis units.

TI Learning the Multilingual Translation Representations for Question
   Retrieval in Community Question Answering via Non-Negative Matrix
   Factorization
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Community question answering (CQA) has become an increasingly popular research topic. In this paper, we focus on the problem of question retrieval. Question retrieval in CQA can automatically find the most relevant and recent questions that have been solved by other users. However, the word ambiguity and word mismatch problems bring about new challenges for question retrieval in CQA. State-of-the-art approaches address these issues by implicitly expanding the queried questions with additional words or phrases using monolingual translation models. While useful, the effectiveness of these models is highly dependent on the availability of quality parallel monolingual corpora (e. g., question-answer pairs) in the absence of which they are troubled by noise issues. In this work, we propose an alternative way to address the word ambiguity and word mismatch problems by taking advantage of potentially rich semantic information drawn from other languages. Our proposed method employs statistical machine translation to improve question retrieval and enriches the question representation with the translated words from other languages via non-negative matrix factorization. Experiments conducted on real CQA data sets show that our proposed approach is promising.

TI Translingual information retrieval: learning from bilingual corpora
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Translingual information retrieval (TLIR) consists of providing a query in one language and searching document collections in one or more different languages. This paper introduces new TLIR methods and reports on comparative TLIR experiments with these new methods and with previously reported ones in a realistic setting. Methods fall into two categories: query translation and statistical-IR approaches establishing translingual associations. The results show that using bilingual corpora for automated extraction of term equivalences in context outperforms dictionary-based methods. Translingual versions of the Generalized Vector Space Model (GVSM) and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) perform well, as does translingual pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) and Example-Based Term-in-context translation (EBT). All showed relatively small performance loss between monolingual and translingual versions, ranging between 87-101% of monolingual IR performance. Query translation based on a general machine-readable bilingual dictionary-heretofore the most popular method - did not match the performance of other, more sophisticated methods. Also, the previous very high LSI results in the literature based on "mate-finding" were superseded by more realistic relevance-based evaluations; LSI performance proved comparable to that of other statistical corpus-based methods.

TI Intersubunit Mobility of the Ribosome
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Ribosomes are ribonucleoprotein nanoparticles synthesizing all proteins in living cells. The function of the ribosome is to translate the genetic information encoded in a nucleotide sequence of mRNA into the amino acid sequence of a protein. Each translation step (occurring after the codon-dependent binding of the aminoacyl-tRNA with the ribosome and mRNA) includes (i) the transpeptidation reaction and (ii) the translocation that unidirectionally drives the mRNA chain and mRNA-bound tRNA molecules through the ribosomal intersubunit space; the latter process is driven by the free energy of the chemical reaction of transpeptidation. Thus, the translating ribosome can be considered a conveying protein-synthesizing molecular machine. In this review we analyze the role of ribosomal intersubunit mobility in the process of translocation.

The proposed scheme provides the optimum truncation numbers as well as the machine precisions given the desired relative error thresholds and the box sizes for the translation operator at all frequencies. In other words, unlike the previous error control schemes which are valid only for high-frequency problems. the proposed scheme can be used to control the error across both low- and high-frequency problems. Optimum truncation numbers and machine precisions are calculated for a wide range of box sizes and desired relative error thresholds with the proposal error control scheme. The results are compared with the previously available methods and numerical surveys.

TI Using Event-B to construct instruction set architectures
SO FORMAL ASPECTS OF COMPUTING
AB The instruction set architecture (ISA) of a computing machine is the definition of the binary instructions, registers, and memory space visible to an executable binary image. ISAs are typically implemented in hardware as microprocessors, but also in software running on a host processor, i.e. virtual machines (VMs). Despite there being many ISAs in existence, all share a set of core properties which have been tailored to their particular applications. An abstract model may capture these generic properties and be subsequently refined to a particular machine, providing a reusable template for development of robust ISAs by the formal construction of all normal and exception conditions for each instruction. This is a task to which the Event-B (Metayer et al. in Rodin deliverable 3.2 Event-B language, http://rodin.cs.ncl.ac.uk, 2005; Schneider in The B-method an introduction, Palgrave, Basingstoke, 2001) formal notation is well suited. This paper describes a project to use the Rodin tool-set (Abrial in Formal methods and software engineering, Springer, Berlin, 2006) to perform such a process, ultimately producing two variants of the MIDAS (Microprocessor Instruction and Data Abstraction System) ISA (Wright in Abstract state machines, B and Z, Springer, Berlin, 2007; Wright in MIDAS machine specification, Bristol University, http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/Publications, 2009) as VMs. The abstract model is incrementally refined to variant models capable of automatic translation to C source code, which this is compiled to create useable VMs. These are capable of running binary executables compiled from high-level languages such as C (Kernighan and Ritchie in The C programming language, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, 1988), and compilers targeted to each variant allow demonstration programs to be executed on them.

TI Robot Translation Based on Computer Vision for Cultural Psychology of
   English Culture Education
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMANOID ROBOTICS
AB Individuals use language in a wide range of contexts. It is a major part of the culture. Teaching students how to speak English in a different manner requires adopting cultural attitudes and behaviors. This learning style has a tremendous sense of belonging, community, and intent. In addition, it motivates learners to create a difference in their neighborhoods and communities around the world. A simple way to incorporate culture into the curriculum is to use the abilities and narratives of the wider community. Multilingual classrooms present an incredible task for English teachers because of the students' wide range of linguistic backgrounds. Because they are afraid of committing mistakes, the students in multilingual classrooms lack self-confidence to communicate in English. Therefore, in this paper, Robot Interaction for Social Cultural Education (RI-SCE) method is proposed to overcome the challenges mentioned above. It uses Deep Machine language and Artificial Intelligence to interact with robots-based computer vision for cultural psychology of English cultural education. As a result, the simulation shows the importance of robot translation in performance, accuracy, efficiency, security, and flexibility compared to the other available models. The model proposed here achieves standard accuracy of 95.2%.

TI Development of an intelligent Arabic text translation model for deaf

SO BIOSCIENCE BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
AB This paper presents an intelligent model to read, understand and translate Arabic text content into Arabic signs. The proposed model includes four main phases, preprocessing, modeling language, translation, and sign generation phases. In the preprocessing phase, the corpora and the stop words will be employed. The language model includes morphological, lexical and syntax, and semantic analysis. This is in addition to stem, root extraction with ontological support, and number indication will be involved. Consequently, we have different features that represent the analyzed Arabic text (words' meanings, words ordering, syntactic features, number features...). Therefore, the generation phase takes place to generate the equivalent Arabic signs using the signer model. Accordingly, the deaf and hearing-impaired people are showing the generated stream of Arabic signs using video or 3D Avatar. The proposed solution uses programming corpus written in Arabic language, so the generated dictionary/lexicon has limited set of Arabic words with their meaning. After getting the content data from the course, the language model analyzes and understands the content and store it into deep structure or internal representation, consequently, the system will generate the Arabic stream signs based on the signer model.

CY MAR 09-11, 2011
CL Newport Beach, CA
AB This paper presents an approach to the safe execution of applications based on software-based fault isolation and policy-based system call authorization. A running application is encapsulated in an additional layer of protection using dynamic binary translation in user-space. This virtualization layer dynamically recompiles the machine code and adds multiple dynamic security guards that verify the running code to protect and contain the application.
   The binary translation system redirects all system calls to a policy-based system call authorization framework. This interposition framework validates every system call based on the given arguments and the location of the system call. Depending on the user-loadable policy and an extensible handler mechanism the framework decides whether a system call is allowed, rejected, or redirect to a specific user-space handler in the virtualization layer.
   This paper offers an in-depth analysis of the different security guarantees and a performance analysis of libdetox, a prototype of the full protection platform. The combination of software-based fault isolation and policy-based system call authorization imposes only low overhead and is therefore an attractive option to encapsulate and sandbox applications to improve host security.

AB Teaching is critical to human society: it is with teaching that prospective students are educated and human civilization can be inherited and advanced. A good teacher not only provides his/her students with qualified teaching materials (e.g., textbooks), but also sets up appropriate learning objectives (e.g., course projects and exams) considering different situations of a student. When it comes to artificial intelligence, treating machine learning models as students, the loss functions that are optimized act as perfect counterparts of the learning objective set by the teacher. In this work, we explore the possibility of imitating human teaching behaviors by dynamically and automatically outputting appropriate loss functions to train machine learning models. Different from typical learning settings in which the loss function of a machine learning model is predefined and fixed, in our framework, the loss function of a machine learning model (we call it student) is defined by another machine learning model (we call it teacher). The ultimate goal of teacher model is cultivating the student to have better performance measured on development dataset. Towards that end, similar to human teaching, the teacher, a parametric model, dynamically outputs different loss functions that will be used and optimized by its student model at different training stages. We develop an efficient learning method for the teacher model that makes gradient based optimization possible, exempt of the ineffective solutions such as policy optimization. We name our method as "learning to teach with dynamic loss functions" (L2T-DLF for short). Extensive experiments on real world tasks including image classification and neural machine translation demonstrate that our method significantly improves the quality of various student models.

TI A study of the surface scallop generating mechanism in the ball-end
   milling process
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS & MANUFACTURE
AB This paper presents the model, simulation and experimental verification of the scallop formation on the machined surface in the ball-end milling process. In the milling process, the cutting edges of the cutter are in a motion of combined translation and rotation. The periodical variation of the cutting edge orientation during spindle rotation results in two kinds of scallops generated on the machined surface: the pick-interval scallop and the feed-interval scallop. Because of the low feed and comparably large pick used in the conventional ball-end milling process, the emphasis of previous works has been placed on studying the geometric generating mechanism of the pick-interval scallop while the feed-interval scallop has been largely ignored. Trend of the high-speed and high efficiency machining, however, has pushed the feed reaching the same level of the pick. For the high-speed machining where the high feed/pick ratio is used, the feed-interval scallop must be taken into account. This paper presents a new model that describes the path-interval and feed-interval scallops generating mechanism in the ball-end milling processes. Parameters such as the tool radius, feed/pick ratio, initial cutting edge entrance angle, and tool-axis inclination angles have been studied and experimental verified. It was found that the feed-interval scallop height was 3-4 times large than the path-interval scallop height at the high-speed machining case. The scallop height was continuously reduced by increasing the tool-axis inclination angle. An inclination angle up to 10 degrees is, however, good enough for most tool diameters from the surface roughness viewpoint. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The influence of and an appropriate numerical model to simulate cut-edge
   effects of electrical steel laminations
SO ELEKTROTECHNIK UND INFORMATIONSTECHNIK
AB The cutting of electrical steel laminations has a significant influence on the operational characteristics of electrical machines. Due to material degradation in the vicinity of the stator and rotor edges, local hot spots can arise and the overall efficiency of the machine is decreased. Finite-element (FE) machine simulations are common tools for the design and evaluation of new electrical drive concepts. In scientific literature, several different models are used for the evaluation of cut-edge effects. However, these models have different drawbacks. In this work the previously established continuous local cut-edge model is presented and used. It enables the evaluation of different cutting and material parameters. Thereby, an optimization of the cutting process can be enabled. Modelling the magnetic material degradation and its implementation in the calculation tool chain is necessary to enable advanced machine simulations. In this context, a thorough understanding of the fundamental physical effects is required for the improvement of distinct material models. In this paper, the influence of different cutting processes and in case of punching, its respective cutting parameters on magnetic properties of electrical steel is studied and their impact on the operational characteristics of an electrical traction drive are analyzed. The interdependencies between mechanical processing as well as magnetic properties and their translation to continuous local material model are discussed in the context of the physical mechanisms. With this work, a contribution to the understanding of the impact of material processing on the characteristics of electrical machines is presented and the necessity for further advancement of degradation function is motivated.

TI A Ribosomal Protein Homolog Governs Gene Expression and Virulence in a
   Bacterial Pathogen
SO JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY
AB The molecular machine necessary for protein synthesis, the ribosome, is generally considered constitutively functioning and lacking any inherent regulatory capacity. Yet ribosomes are commonly heterogeneous in composition and the impact of ribosome heterogeneity on translation is not well understood. Here, we determined that changes in ribosome protein composition govern gene expression in the intracellular bacterial pathogen Francisella tularensis. F. tularensis encodes three distinct homologs for bS21, a ribosomal protein involved in translation initiation, and analysis of purified F. tularensis ribosomes revealed they are heterogeneous with respect to bS21. The loss of one homolog, bS21-2, resulted in significant changes to the cellular proteome unlinked to changes in the transcriptome. Among the reduced proteins were components of the type VI secretion system (T6SS), an essential virulence factor encoded by the Francisella Pathogenicity Island. Furthermore, loss of bS21-2 led to an intramacrophage growth defect. Although multiple bS21 homologs complemented the loss of bS21-2 with respect to T6SS protein abundance, bS21-2 was uniquely necessary for robust intramacrophage growth, suggesting bS21-2 modulates additional virulence gene(s) distinct from the T6SS. Our results indicate that ribosome composition in F. tularensis, either directly or indirectly, posttranscriptionally modulates gene expression and virulence. Our findings are consistent with a model in which bS21 homologs function as posttranscriptional regulators, allowing preferential translation of specific subsets of mRNAs, likely at the stage of translation initiation. This work also raises the possibility that bS21 in other organisms may function similarly and that ribosome heterogeneity may permit many bacteria to posttranscriptionally regulate gene expression.
   IMPORTANCE While bacterial ribosomes are commonly heterogeneous in composition (e.g., incorporating different homologs for a ribosomal protein), how heterogeneity impacts translation is unclear. We found that the intracellular human pathogen Francisella tularensis has heterogeneous ribosomes, incorporating one of three homologs for ribosomal protein bS21. Furthermore, one bS21 homolog posttranscriptionally governs the expression of the F. tularensis type VI secretion system, an essential virulence factor. This bS21 homolog is also uniquely important for robust intracellular growth. Our data support a model in which bS21 heterogeneity leads to modulation of translation, providing another source of posttranscriptional gene regulation. Regulation of translation by bS21, or other sources of ribosomal heterogeneity, may be a conserved mechanism to control gene expression across the bacterial phylogeny.

AB We present the results from the 5th round of the WMT task on MT Automatic Post-Editing. The task consists in automatically correcting the output of a "black-box" machine translation system by learning from human corrections. Keeping the same general evaluation setting of the previous four rounds, this year we focused on two language pairs (English-German and English-Russian) and on domain-specific data (Information Technology). For both the language directions, MT outputs were produced by neural systems unknown to participants. Seven teams participated in the English-German task, with a total of 18 submitted runs. The evaluation, which was performed on the same test set used for the 2018 round, shows further progress in APE technology: 4 teams achieved better results than last year's winning system, with improvements up to -0.78 TER and +1.23 BLEU points over the baseline. Two teams participated in the English-Russian task submitting 2 runs each. On this new language direction, characterized by a higher quality of the original translations, the task proved to be particularly challenging. Indeed, none of the submitted runs improved the very high results of the strong system used to produce the initial translations (16.16 TER, 76.20 BLEU).

TI A model for the role of isomerization in nascent peptide movement
   through the ribosomal tunnel
SO FASEB JOURNAL
AB The ribosome is a molecular machine whose manner of controlling the progression of the nascent chain through the ribosomal exit tunnel is currently unknown. A novel model for the mechanism driving the nascent chain motion is hereby presented, in which the similar to 180 degrees rotatory motion performed by each C-terminal amino acid of the nascent chain during its translocation from the A site to the P site, is suggested to twist the newly formed peptide bond into cis conformation. By catalyzing the cis to trans isomerization, the ribosome is proposed to release the potential energy stored within the cis conformer and to utilize it to push the chain down the tunnel, thus operating as a molecular motor. This hypothetical isomerization mechanism is supported by its ability to provide an explanation for the peculiar conduct observed in translational events of nascent chains with C-terminal prolines: the slow peptide bond formation with puromycin, translation arrest, and tmRNA tagging.-Agmon, I.

TI Machine learning-based prediction of radiographic progression in
   patients with axial spondyloarthritis
SO CLINICAL RHEUMATOLOGY
AB Introduction Machine learning is applied to characterize the risk and predict outcomes in multi-dimensional data. The prediction of radiographic progression in axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) remains limited. Hence, we tested the feasibility of supervised machine learning algorithms to predict radiographic progression in axSpA. Methods This is a retrospective and hospital-based study. Clinical and laboratory data obtained from two independent axSpA groups were used as training and testing datasets. Radiographic progression over 2 years was assessed using the modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spine Score (mSASSS) and mSASSS worsening by >= two units was defined as progression. Seven machine learning models with different algorithms were fitted, and their performance for the testing dataset was assessed using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall (PR) curve. Results The training and testing groups had equivalent characteristics, and radiographic progression was identified in 25.3% and 23.7%, respectively. The generalized linear model (GLM) and support vector machine (SVM) were the top two best-performing models with an average area-under-curve (AUC) of ROC of over 0.78. SVM had the higher AUC of PR compared with GLM (0.56 versus 0.51). Balanced accuracy was over 65% in all models. mSASSS was the most informative variable, followed by the presence of syndesmophyte(s) at the baseline and sacroiliac joint grades. Conclusions Clinical and radiographic data-driven predictive models showed reasonable performance in the prediction of radiographic progression in axSpA. Further modelling with larger and more detailed data could provide an excellent opportunity for the clinical translation of the predictive models to the management of high-risk patients.

TI Code-Aligned Autoencoders for Unsupervised Change Detection in
   Multimodal Remote Sensing Images
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
AB Image translation with convolutional autoencoders has recently been used as an approach to multimodal change detection (CD) in bitemporal satellite images. A main challenge is the alignment of the code spaces by reducing the contribution of change pixels to the learning of the translation function. Many existing approaches train the networks by exploiting supervised information of the change areas, which, however, is not always available. We propose to extract relational pixel information captured by domain-specific affinity matrices at the input and use this to enforce alignment of the code spaces and reduce the impact of change pixels on the learning objective. A change prior is derived in an unsupervised fashion from pixel pair affinities that are comparable across domains. To achieve code space alignment, we enforce pixels with similar affinity relations in the input domains to be correlated also in code space. We demonstrate the utility of this procedure in combination with cycle consistency. The proposed approach is compared with the state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Experiments conducted on four real and representative datasets show the effectiveness of our methodology.

AB Scattered objects in a digital image have shape and different positions. It also allows some differences in translation, rotation, and scaling. Backpropagation neural network is one of machine learning algorithms that can recognize patterns and identify an object image based on the training provided. Implementation of neural network on image that has a variety of translation, scaling and rotation without prior manipulated require considerable number of samples. Even in terms of accuracy allows the occurrence of a failure in the decision to recognize the object. Solution algorithm that allows improvement of the problem is Hu Moment invariant. The result values of Hu moment invariant consists seven values that identify characteristics of a digital image. These values are independent of the translation, rotation and scaling. These values can be used as samples for each information object for input of neural network to recognize an object. Ming-Kuei Hu proposed this methode to identified twenty six characters in seperated manipulation. In this study, the unique value of the object produced by Hu moment invariant can be used for neural network input. This is proved by learning process and testing, learning parameter values and corresponding architecture, neural network can learn and produce fairly good.

AB Amino acids are the precursors for the synthesis of proteins. In humans, approximately half of the 20 different amino acids are essential, ie, must be obtained from the diet. Cells must therefore take account of amino acid availability to achieve sustainable rates of protein synthesis. One of the major mechanisms involved in this is signaling through,a complex of proteins termed mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC) 1, which is activated by amino acids. In turn, mTORC1 regulates the production of ribosomes, the molecular machines that make proteins, and the activity of other cellular components required for protein synthesis. mTORC1 signaling promotes the transcription of the genes for ribosomal RNAs and many other components involved in ribosome production. It also positively regulates the translation of the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for ribosomal proteins. Indeed, recent studies have shown that mammalian target of rapamycin signaling drives the translation of mRNAs for many anabolic enzymes and other proteins involved in diverse cellular functions. The translational machinery is also regulated by the absence of amino acids through the protein kinase GCN2 (general control nonrepressed 2), which phosphorylates and in end-effect inhibits the translation initiation factor elF2 (eukaryotic initiation factor 2). This process shuts down general protein synthesis to conserve amino acids.

AB Our research explores the feasibility of using communication theory, error control (EC) coding theory specifically, for quantitatively modeling the protein translation initiation mechanism. The messenger RNA (mRNA) of Escherichia coli K-12 is modeled as a noisy (errored), encoded signal and the ribosome as a minimum Hamming distance decoder, where the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) serves as a template for generating a set of valid codewords (the codebook). We tested the E. coli based coding models on 5' untranslated leader sequences of prokaryotic organisms of varying taxonomical relation to E. coli including: Salmonella typhimurium LT2, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus Mu50. The model identified regions on the 5' untranslated leader where the minimum Hamming distance values of translated mRNA sub-sequences and non-translated genomic sequences differ the most. These regions correspond to the Shine-Dalgarno domain and the non-random domain. Applying the EC coding-based models to B. subtilis, and S. aureus Mu50 yielded results similar to those for E. coli K-12. Contrary to our expectations, the behavior of S. typhimurium LT2, the more taxonomically related to E. coli, resembled that of the non-translated sequence group. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the power of internet disinformation in influencing global health. The deluge of information travels faster than the epidemic itself and is a threat to the health of millions across the globe. Health apps need to leverage machine learning for delivering the right information while constantly learning misinformation trends and deliver these effectively in vernacular languages in order to combat the infodemic at the grassroot levels in the general public. Our application, WashKaro, is a multi-pronged intervention that uses conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine translation, and natural language processing to combat misinformation (NLP). WashKaro uses AI to provide accurate information matched against WHO recommendations and delivered in an understandable format in local languages. The primary aim of this study was to assess the use of neural models for text summarization and machine learning for delivering WHO matched COVID-19 information to mitigate the misinfodemic. The secondary aim of this study was to develop a symptom assessment tool and segmentation insights for improving the delivery of information. A total of 5026 people downloaded the app during the study window; among those, 1545 were actively engaged users. Our study shows that 3.4 times more females engaged with the App in Hindi as compared to males, the relevance of AI-filtered news content doubled within 45 days of continuous machine learning, and the prudence of integrated AI chatbot "Satya" increased thus proving the usefulness of a mHealth platform to mitigate health misinformation. We conclude that a machine learning application delivering bite-sized vernacular audios and conversational AI is a practical approach to mitigate health misinformation.

TI Facial Expression Retargeting From Human to Avatar Made Easy
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS
AB Facial expression retargeting from humans to virtual characters is a useful technique in computer graphics and animation. Traditional methods use markers or blendshapes to construct a mapping between the human and avatar faces. However, these approaches require a tedious 3D modeling process, and the performance relies on the modelers' experience. In this article, we propose a brand-new solution to this cross-domain expression transfer problem via nonlinear expression embedding and expression domain translation. We first build low-dimensional latent spaces for the human and avatar facial expressions with variational autoencoder. Then we construct correspondences between the two latent spaces guided by geometric and perceptual constraints. Specifically, we design geometric correspondences to reflect geometric matching and utilize a triplet data structure to express users' perceptual preference of avatar expressions. A user-friendly method is proposed to automatically generate triplets for a system allowing users to easily and efficiently annotate the correspondences. Using both geometric and perceptual correspondences, we trained a network for expression domain translation from human to avatar. Extensive experimental results and user studies demonstrate that even nonprofessional users can apply our method to generate high-quality facial expression retargeting results with less time and effort.

TI Class imbalance methods for translation initiation site recognition in
   DNA sequences
SO KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS
AB Translation initiation site (TIS) recognition is one of the first steps in gene structure prediction, and one of the common components in any gene recognition system. Many methods have been described in the literature to identify TIS in transcribed sequences such as mRNA, EST and cDNA sequences. However, the recognition of TIS in DNA sequences is a far more challenging task, and the methods described so far for transcripts achieve poor results in DNA sequences. Most methods approach this problem taking into account its biological characteristics. in this work we try a different view, considering this classification problem from a purely machine learning perspective.
   From the point of view of machine learning, TIS recognition is a class imbalance problem. Thus, in this paper we approach TIS recognition from this angle, and apply the different methods that have been developed to deal with imbalanced datasets. The proposed approach has two advantages. Firstly, it improves the results using standard classification methods. Secondly, it broadens the set of classification algorithms that can be used, as some of the class-imbalance methods, such as undersampling, are also useful as methods for scaling up data mining algorithms as they reduce the size of the dataset. In this way, classifiers that cannot be applied to the whole dataset, due to long training time or large memory requirements, can be used when undersampling method is applied.
   Results show an advantage of class imbalance methods with respect to the same methods applied without considering the class imbalance nature of the problem. The applied methods are also able to improve the results obtained with the best method in the literature, which is based on looking for the next in-frame stop codon from the putative TIS that must be predicted.

TI Do language combinations affect translators' stylistic visibility in
   translated texts?
SO DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP IN THE HUMANITIES
AB The question of translators' stylistic visibility in translated texts has been a recurring theme in translation studies. Recently, the employment of state-of-the-art stylometric methods such as multivariate statistical analysis or machine learning techniques has enabled important progress to be made in exploring the problem. Nevertheless, studies are conflicting in their findings. Some find evidence of translators' stylistic presence, while others fail to do so. The lack of agreement in the literature makes one suspect some contextual factors affecting the degree of translators' visibility. The present study focuses on one such possible factor- language combinations involved in translation. It is hypothesized that the farther the two languages involved are structurally apart, the more likely it is for the translator's style to gain visibility as the increased distance will allow the translator greater freedom to be creative with his or her choices. The present study applies bootstrap consensus tree analysis and consensus network analysis to 175 samples of contemporary literary translation in two language pairs-the intimate pair of French and English and the distant pair of Korean and English. The analysis supports the hypothesis by showing that the authors completely override their translators to claim authorship in the French group, while authorial presence is significantly diminished in the Korean group, resulting in greater visibility for some translators.

CY DEC 09-13, 2007

SP IEEE
AB We describe a cardinal-synchronous Viterbi decoder for statistical phrase-based machine translation which can operate on general ASR lattices (as opposed to confusion networks). The decoder implements constrained source reordering on the input lattice and makes use of an outbound distortion model to score the possible reorderings. The phrase table, representing the decoding search space, is encoded as a weighted finite state acceptor which is determinized and minimized. At a high level, the search proceeds by performing simultaneous transitions in two pairs of automata: (input lattice, phrase table FSM) and (phrase table FSM, target language model). An alternative decoding strategy that we explore is to break the search into two independent subproblems: first, we perform monotone lattice decoding and find the best foreign path through the ASR lattice and then, we decode this path with reordering using standard sentence-based SMT.
   We report experimental results on several testsets of a large scale Arabic-to-English speech translation task in the context of the Global Autonomous Language Exploitation (or GALE) DARPA project. The results indicate that, for monotone search, lattice-based decoding outperforms 1-best decoding whereas for search with reordering, only the second decoding strategy was found to be superior to 1-best decoding. In both cases, the improvements hold only for shallow lattices.

TI Positioning and navigation system based on machine vision intended for
   laser-electrochemical micro-hole processing
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB In order to improve efficiency and quality of micro-hole processing, a laser-electrochemical micro-hole processing is applied to the micro-hole processing of aero engine blade, i.e., laser drilling and electrochemical machining are performed. However, when electrode wire is inserted into micro-hole, due to the positioning error, it can collide with blade, which could result in short circuit or electrode wire damage. Hitherto, the positioning of electrode wire and micro-hole was achieved by artificial observation, but its efficiency is low, especially for micro-holes with small diameter. Namely, a large amount of asymmetric micro-holes is produced due to the low-accuracy positioning by artificial observation; therefore, machining accuracy and consistency of micro-hole cannot be guaranteed. In this study, a positioning and navigation system based on machine vision is applied for the first time to the laser-electrochemical micro-hole processing. The proposed system is based on parallel installation of camera and electrode wire. A novel hand-eye calibration method, wherein rotation angle and translation vector are calibrated step by step, is proposed for the case when electrode wire is beyond the view area of camera. The tree traversal binary image boundary tracking algorithm is adopted to image processing. The data stem definition is proposed to detect micro-hole edge with burrs. Before electrochemical machining, the micro-hole image is captured by camera that is navigated to the micro-hole top, and then, the captured image is processed in order to get the coordinates of micro-hole center, which enables navigation of electrode wire to the micro-hole center; thus, the accurate positioning and navigation of micro-hole are achieved.

TI Efficiently Parallelizing Instruction Set Simulation of Embedded
   Multi-Core Processors Using Region-based Just-in-Time Dynamic Binary
   Translation

AB Embedded systems, as typified by modern mobile phones, are already seeing a drive toward using multi-core processors. The number of cores will likely increase rapidly in the future. Engineers and researchers need to be able to simulate systems, as they are expected to be in a few generations time, running simulations of many-core devices on today's multi-core machines. These requirements place heavy demands on the scalability of simulation engines, the fastest of which have typically evolved from just-in-time (JIT) dynamic binary translators (DBT).
   Existing work aimed at parallelizing DBT simulators has focused exclusively on trace-based DBT, wherein linear execution traces or perhaps trees thereof are the units of translation. Region-based DBT simulators have not received the same attention and require different techniques than their trace-based cousins.
   In this paper we develop an innovative approach to scaling multi-core, embedded simulation through region-based DBT. We initially modify the JIT code generator of such a simulator to emit code that does not depend on a particular thread with its thread-specific context and is, therefore, thread-agnostic. We then demonstrate that this thread-agnostic code generation is comparable to thread-specific code with respect to performance, but also enables the sharing of JIT-compiled regions between different threads. This sharing optimisation, in turn, leads to significant performance improvements for multi-threaded applications. In fact, our results confirm that an average of 76% of all JIT-compiled regions can be shared between 128 threads in representative, parallel workloads. We demonstrate that this translates into an overall performance improvement by 1.44x on average and up to 2.40x across 12 multi-threaded benchmarks taken from the SPLASH-2 benchmark suite, targeting our high-performance multi-core DBT simulator for embedded ARC processors running on a 4-core Intel host machine.

TI Improving Speech Translation by Cross-Modal Multi-Grained Contrastive
   Learning
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB The end-to-end speech translation (E2E-ST) model has gradually become a mainstream paradigm due to its low latency and less error propagation. However, it is non-trivial to train such a model well due to the task complexity and data scarcity. The speech-and-text modality differences result in the E2E-ST model performance usually inferior to the corresponding machine translation (MT) model. Based on the above observation, existing methods often use sharing mechanisms to carry out implicit knowledge transfer by imposing various constraints. However, the final model often performs worse on the MT task than the MT model trained alone, which means that the knowledge transfer ability of this method is also limited. To deal with these problems, we propose the FCCL (Fine- and Coarse- Granularity Contrastive Learning) approach for E2E-ST, which makes explicit knowledge transfer through cross-modal multi-grained contrastive learning. A key ingredient of our approach is applying contrastive learning at both sentence- and frame-level to give the comprehensive guide for extracting speech representations containing rich semantic information. In addition, we adopt a simple whitening method to alleviate the representation degeneration in the MT model, which adversely affects contrast learning. Experiments on the MuST-C benchmark show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art E2E-ST baselines on all eight language pairs. Further analysis indicates that FCCL can free up its capacity from learning grammatical structure information and force more layers to learn semantic information.

TI How to translate artificial intelligence? Myths and justifications in
   public discourse
SO BIG DATA & SOCIETY
AB Automated technologies populating today's online world rely on social expectations about how "smart" they appear to be. Algorithmic processing, as well as bias and missteps in the course of their development, all come to shape a cultural realm that in turn determines what they come to be about. It is our contention that a robust analytical frame could be derived from culturally driven Science and Technology Studies while focusing on Callon's concept of translation. Excitement and apprehensions must find a specific language to move past a state of latency. Translations are thus contextual and highly performative, transforming justifications into legitimate claims, translators into discursive entrepreneurs, and power relations into new forms of governance and governmentality. In this piece, we discuss three cases in which artificial intelligence was deciphered to the public: (i) the Montreal Declaration for a Responsible Development of Artificial Intelligence, held as a prime example of how stakeholders manage to establish the terms of the debate on ethical artificial intelligence while avoiding substantive commitment; (ii) Mark Zuckerberg's 2018 congressional hearing, where he construed machine learning as the solution to the many problems the platform might encounter; and (iii) the normative renegotiations surrounding the gradual introduction of "killer robots" in military engagements. Of interest are not only the rational arguments put forward, but also the rhetorical maneuvers deployed. Through the examination of the ramifications of these translations, we intend to show how they are constructed in face of and in relation to forms of criticisms, thus revealing the highly cybernetic deployment of artificial intelligence technologies.

TI Data Dissemination: Shortening the Long Tail of Traumatic Brain Injury
   Dark Data
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA
AB Translation of traumatic brain injury (TBI) research findings from bench to bedside involves aligning multi-species data across diverse data types including imaging and molecular biomarkers, histopathology, behavior, and functional outcomes. In this review we argue that TBI translation should be acknowledged for what it is: a problem of big data that can be addressed using modern data science approaches. We review the history of the term big data, tracing its origins in Internet technology as data that are "big" according to the "4Vs" of volume, velocity, variety, veracity and discuss how the term has transitioned into the mainstream of biomedical research. We argue that the problem of TBI translation fundamentally centers around data variety and that solutions to this problem can be found in modern machine learning and other cutting-edge analytical approaches. Throughout our discussion we highlight the need to pull data from diverse sources including unpublished data ("dark data") and "long-tail data" (small, specialty TBI datasets undergirding the published literature). We review a few early examples of published articles in both the pre-clinical and clinical TBI research literature to demonstrate how data reuse can drive new discoveries leading into translational therapies. Making TBI data resources more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) through better data stewardship has great potential to accelerate discovery and translation for the silent epidemic of TBI.

AB Computers continue to diversify with respect to system designs, emerging memory technologies, and application memory demands. Unfortunately, continually adapting the conventional virtual memory framework to each possible system configuration is challenging, and often results in performance loss or requires non-trivial workarounds.
   To address these challenges, we propose a new virtual memory framework, the Virtual Block Interface (VBI). We design VBI based on the key idea that delegating memory management duties to hardware can reduce the overheads and software complexity associated with virtual memory. VBI introduces a set of variable-sized virtual blocks (VBs) to applications. Each VB is a contiguous region of the globally-visible VBI address space, and an application can allocate each semantically meaningful unit of information (e.g., a data structure) in a separate VB. VBI decouples access protection from memory allocation and address translation. While the OS controls which programs have access to which VBs, dedicated hardware in the memory controller manages the physical memory allocation and address translation of the VBs. This approach enables several architectural optimizations to (1) efficiently and flexibly cater to different and increasingly diverse system configurations, and (2) eliminate key inefficiencies of conventional virtual memory.
   We demonstrate the benefits of VBI with two important use cases: (1) reducing the overheads of address translation (for both native execution and virtual machine environments), as VBI reduces the number of translation requests and associated memory accesses; and (2) two heterogeneous main memory architectures, where VBI increases the effectiveness of managing fast memory regions. For both cases, VBI significantly improves performance over conventional virtual memory.

AB A motion simulator is a type of equipment which can reproduce the actual movement environment for an object. It can be widely used in various occasions. Current motion simulator mainly utilizes the full degree-of-freedom (DOF) parallel mechanisms (PMs), such as the Stewart platform, as the main body of the machine. In fact, there is no need to use the full-DOF mechanism at the most of the time. Some deficient-DOF mechanisms can also meet the demands of certain motion simulation. Especially for some predefined motion patterns, the dedicated equipment is more capable and convenient to use than the universal one. In this paper, a practical types of motion simulators for testing the performance under the spherical-translation motion is presented. Specifically, the orientation of the tested object remains fixed during the whole process in order to fulfill the certain simulation demand. First of all, the motion and constraint characteristics for the spherical-translation movement are brought forward using a graphical approach. Based on these conditions, a typical parallel mechanism 3-UU with desired motion pattern is taken out in further to verify the constraint conditions above. Besides, the architecture of each limb is analyzed to observe the necessary condition that the structure characteristics should satisfy. Furthermore, its functional limitation in simulating the spherical-translation motion in random direction is also proposed. According to all the architecture features retained by the mechanism, the new types of motion simulator outputting the desired movement is synthesized and designed at the last, which has been categorized for different application fields.

TI Differential Contributions of the Quadriceps and Patellar Attachments of
   the Proximal Medial Patellar Restraints to Resisting Lateral Patellar
   Translation
SO ARTHROSCOPY-THE JOURNAL OF ARTHROSCOPIC AND RELATED SURGERY
AB Purpose: To define the contributions of the of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) and medial quadriceps tendon femoral ligament (MQTFL) to lateral patellar translation as the knee moves through a 90 degrees arc of motion. Methods: Six pairs of bilateral cadaveric knee specimens (12 knees) were dissected and potted in perfect lateral position using fluoroscopy. An eye screw was placed in the midpoint on the lateral aspect of the patella. Each knee underwent testing in 4 conditions after sequential sectioning: intact, lateral retinacular release, randomized MQTFL or MPFL sectioning, and complete proximal medial patellar restraint (PMPR) sectioning. With a custom machined jig, all knees were tested at 0, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, and 90 degrees of flexion on an MTS machine with 20N of lateral patellar force applied and displacement recorded. Results: PMPR extensor mechanism insertion on all specimens was identified 50% on the quadriceps tendon and 50% on the proximal aspect of the medial patella. Isolated MPFL sectioning resulted in significantly increased lateral displacement compared to the lateral release state at all flexion angles tested except 0 degrees. There was significantly increased lateral patellar displacement with complete sectioning compared with isolated proximal sectioning at all degrees of knee flexion except 0 degrees. However, complete sectioning following isolated MPFL sectioning did not demonstrate significance at any angle. Conclusions: Compared with the MQTFL, the MPFL is primarily responsible for resistance to lateral patellar translation throughout a 0 degrees to 90 degrees arc of motion. The MPFL provides a similar resistance to lateral patellar displacement as the fully intact PMPR; however, the MQTFL may contribute to resistance in full extension. Clinical Significance: Proximal medial patellar restraint reconstruction techniques involving both the patellar and quadriceps insertion have been described; however, the unique contributions of the native anatomy to lateral patellar restraint have not been investigated.

AB With this paper we aim to refer to the speculation on innovating university students' teaching styles in ESP (English for Specific Purposes) classes of the School of Fine Arts and the School of Pedagogy, Department of Primary Education of the University of Western Macedonia in Florina and the School of Engineering, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Environmental Engineering and Department of Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering in Kozani. It is generally admitted that the Greek students entering the university are already familiar with at least two foreign European languages, according to the educational system's standards, one being English, so they are mature enough to discover mediation techniques and develop their metalinguistic skills in translation/ interpreting fields.
   Therefore, we decided to introduce translation assignments from English to Greek as a means of improving the students' reading skills in the foreign language and understanding of academic and scientific texts and apprehension of terminology deriving from their fields. All the above were implemented both during the teaching sessions and in the final assessment. Within this framework, on the one hand we tried to help students understand and familiarize them with the meaning and appropriate use of the terminology of their own scientific fields in both the English and Greek language and on the other hand we attempted to stir the students' interest in learning and researching the English bibliography of their discipline. Our aim was to encourage students to increase their interest in Greek terminology and produce scientific texts in proper Greek. A psychometric questionnaire was prepared and distributed through the e- class to all the students that had opted for the translation assignment. We wanted to motivate students to live more of their lives in English without forgetting their Greek identity, communicate their attitude towards translation through the questionnaire, and improve their language skills while being at the same time free from stress of translating texts as an examination task. To this end, even though we had to face various problems such as multi level classes or reluctant participation in the lecture process, we partially put grammar aside, reintroduced translation as a teaching method where necessary, assisted students to develop a critical view towards various sources (translation machines & Greek < > English web dictionaries), and conducted an amount of experimentation described in this paper.
   Apart from the use of the e- class, to the aid of the teacher- students communication and the distribution of English academic and scientific extracts, the completion of the translation task had as a prerequisite the participation in an oral interview. The material was mostly assigned individually and pair work was the only other form of work that was permitted. In the latter case a larger piece of translation material was assigned. The results of the questionnaires in discussion demonstrated a differentiation of attitudes amongst students belonging to different departments and along with the oral interviews comments consisted a profile for each student's translation problems, a profile useful to the teacher in order to deduct conclusions about problematic areas in the students' L2 acquisition.

TI DTransE: Distributed Translating Embedding for Knowledge Graph
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
AB Knowledge graphs play an important role in many applications, such as link prediction and question answering. Translating embedding for knowledge graphs is done with the aim of encoding structured information on entities and their rich relations in a low-dimensional embedding space. TransE is one of the most important methods in translation-based models, and uses translation invariance to implement translating embedding for knowledge graphs. In this line of work, translating embedding models represent the relation as a translation from the head entity to the tail entity and have achieved impressive results. Currently, the TransE model is only developed on single-node machines. Unfortunately, the computing and storage capacities of a single machine can easily reach their limits as knowledge graphs become larger and more complex, which limits the application scope of TransE. In order to solve this problem, we propose a distributed TransE method, known as DTransE, which can utilize distributed computing resources to calculate knowledge graph embeddings. However, building a distributed TransE is complicated and involves challenges of knowledge graph partitioning and computation. To solve these challenges, we provide a high-quality edge partitioning algorithm for the power-law graph by considering the high-degree and low-degree vertices with adaptive weights, which can balance the workload. By using the unactivated Gather-Apply-Scatter model on TransE, the processes periodically exchange messages in a loop. The irregular data distribution among the processes is also optimized to further accelerate communication. As far as we know, this is the first work on a distributed TransE method. We use link prediction to evaluate the DTransE in a distributed environment. Experiments show that, compared to the original TransE method, our proposed DTransE is, on average, 24.5 times faster with a minimum loss of accuracy; compared to the state-of-the-art parallel TransE implementation, DTransE is two times faster on average.

TI UAV based accurate displacement monitoring through automatic filtering
   out its camera's translations and rotations
SO JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING
AB In this paper, three translations and three rotations of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were derived through the suggested Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC) based template matching computer vision method and their effect on the monitored structural displacement is analyzed. The NCC-based template matching is used to obtain the vibration of UAVs by tracing far-field background points at the recorded images. The images captured at any general orientations are rotated back to their original positions which could detect errors in the monitored displacement induced by the rotation angles. A fast NCC-based template matching method was also proposed in this paper, which could accelerate the original NCC-based template matching method significantly and reaches the same level accuracy as that of the original NCC-based template matching method. In order to verify the concept, a series of experiments were performed on a Multipurpose Testing System (MTS) machine with amplitudes of 10 mm, 5 mm, and 2.5 mm and frequencies of 2 Hz, 1 Hz and 0.5 Hz, respectively, at the same time a UAV and a fixed camera were used to record the motions of the MTS piston. The derived displacements through the UAV and the fixed camera are compared with the true motions of the MTS machine. Excellent precision and consistence were obtained for the UAV monitored displacement, the MTS piston motion, and the fixed camera derived displacement. Comparing to the case of the fixed camera, scales and rotation angles of the UAV are critical and largely affect the accuracy of monitored displacements. A field experiment was conducted to test the proposed method in a windy environment. Excellent agreement was found between the monitored displacement obtained by the UAV and that derived from the fixed camera.

SO ACS APPLIED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
AB The challenges involved in realizing next-generation applications, like robotics, artificial electronic skin, noninvasive healthcare monitoring, motion detection, and so forth, enabled with wireless human-machine interfaces, present a growing need for high-performance flexible and wearable multifunctional electromechanical sensors. In this regard, emerging classes of two-dimensional nanomaterials and their hybrids show excellent promise as active sensing materials, given their high flexibility and remarkable sensitivity to external pressure and strain. This report is the first demonstration of SnS/Ti3C2Tx nanohybrid-based electromechanical sensors for use in applications like sign-to-text translation and sitting posture analysis. The as-fabricated piezoresistive sensor exhibits a high gauge factor and sensitivity value, that is, 7.41 and 7.49 kPa(-1), respectively. Furthermore, the nanohybrid-based sensor displayed a negligible change in performance over similar to 3500 and similar to 2500 cycles for both pressure and strain characterizations, indicating high robustness and exceptional stability. The underlying intrinsic piezoresistive mechanism in layered nanomaterials and the Ohmic contact formed at the SnS/Ti3C2Tx heterojunction are explained in detail with the help of energy band diagrams wherein the work function and the E-homo values are extracted experimentally by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy for both SnS and Ti3C2Tx. The successful demonstration of sign-to-text translation and e-cushion applications using SnS/Ti3C2Tx nanohybrid-based piezoresistive sensors will further expand the scope of flexible and wearable electronics research.

SO IEEE ACCESS
AB English is an international language used for communication worldwide but still many cannot read, write, understand, or communicate in English. On the other hand, the World Wide Web has unlimited resources of information in different languages which English native find challenging to understand. To avoid such barriers, Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) systems are proposed, which refers to document retrieval tasks across different languages. This work focuses on the performance evaluation of different Information Retrieval (IR) models in CLIR system using Quran dataset. Furthermore, this work also investigated the length of query and query expansion models for effective retrieval. The results show that different length of queries has an impact on the performance of the retrieval methods in terms of effectiveness. Hence, after comprehensive experiments, an appropriate length of query for Arabic CLIR system is suggested along with the best query expansion and retrieval model.

TI Design of English Translation Mobile Information System Based on
   Recurrent Neural Network
SO MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB To solve the problem of translating lines of difference in length into English, this article presents a model of neural network recovery (RNN) English translator-based models of end-to-end encoder-decoder. This method promotes machine autonomous learning of features and transforms corpus data into word vectors by constructing end-to-end. By mapping the source language and target language directly through the recurrent neural network and selecting semantic error to construct objective function during training, the influence of each part in semantic can be well balanced, and the alignment information is fully considered, which provides powerful guidance for deep recurrent neural network training. The results of the neural network test define the standard BLEU score by 1.51-11.86. Our test scores and BLEU scores at all levels show that data in equivalence play an important role in modeling. Summary. the English translation model based on the neural repetitive fusion is efficient and stable.

AB For second language learners, a reliable and effective Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) system is imperative, since it can be used as an auxiliary assistant for errors correction and helps learners improve their writing ability. Researchers have paid more emphasis on this task with deep learning methods. Better results were achieved on the standard benchmark datasets compared to traditional rule based approaches. We treat GEC as a special translation problem which translates wrong sentences into correct ones like other former works. In this paper, we propose a novel correction system based on sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture with residual connection and semantically conditioned LSTM (SC-LSTM), incorporating edit operations as special semantic information. Our model further improves the performance of neural machine translation model for GEC and achieves state-of-the-art F-0.5-score on standard test data named CoNLL-2014 compared with other methods that without any re-rank approach.

TI A SMS normalization system integrating multiple grammatical resources
SO NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING
AB SMS language presents special phenomena and important deviations from natural language. Every day, an impressive amount of chat messages, SMS messages, and e-mails are sent all over the world. This widespread use makes important the development of systems that normalize SMS language into natural language. However, typical machine translation approaches are difficult to adapt to SMS language because of many irregularities that are shown by this kind of language. This paper presents a new approach for SMS normalization that combines lexical and phonological translation techniques with disambiguation algorithms at two different levels: lexical and semantic. The method proposed does not depend on big annotated corpus, which is difficult to build and is applied in two different domains showing its easiness of adaptation across different languages and domains. The results obtained by the system outperform some of the existing methods of SMS normalization despite the fact that the Spanish language and the corpus created have some features that complicate the normalization task.

TI Molecular graph enhanced transformer for retrosynthesis prediction
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
AB With massive possible synthetic routes in chemistry, retrosynthesis prediction is still a challenge for researchers. Recently, retrosynthesis prediction is formulated as a Machine Translation (MT) task. Namely, since each molecule can be represented as a Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System (SMILES) string, the process of retrosynthesis is analogized to a process of language translation from the product to reactants. However, the MT models that applied on SMILES data usually ignore the information of natural atomic connections and the topology of molecules. To make more chemically plausible constrains on the atom representation learning for better performance, in this paper, we propose a Graph Enhanced Transformer (GET) framework, which adopts both the sequential and graphical information of molecules. Four different GET designs are proposed, which fuse the SMILES representations with atom embeddings learned from our improved Graph Neural Network (GNN). Empirical results show that our model significantly outperforms the vanilla Transformer model in test accuracy. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We analyzed 165 news items of Ranchi Express from EMILEE corpus of plain text. It consist 2382 sentences. Eight file of dialogue based from the same corpus has been analyzed which consist 871 sentences and from plain text 1511 sentences have been taken. In plain text 966 sentences have nominal antecedent, 387 have clausal antecedent and 153 do not have antecedent (abstract anaphora). On the other hand dialogue based files have 428 nominal antecedent, 334 have clausal antecedent and 108 do not have antecedent (abstract anaphora). Rest two features, Adjectival and propositional / Factual are either zero value or too low to be considered.

AB Parallel corpus is a very important tool to construct a good machine translation system or make any natural language processing research for cross language information retrieval. Internet archive is a good source of parallel documents in different languages. In order to construct a good parallel corpus from the Internet archive, Bilingual dictionary that contains word pairs which may not exist in commercial dictionaries is a must. Extracting a bilingual dictionary from the internet parallel documents is important to add words that are absent from the traditional dictionaries. This paper describes two algorithms to automatically extract an English/Arabic bilingual dictionary from parallel texts that exist in the Internet archive. The system should preferably be useful for many different language pairs. Like most of the systems done, the accuracy of our system is directly proportional to the amount of sentence pairs used By controlling the system parameters, we could achieve 100% precision for the output bilingual dictionary, but the size of the dictionary will be smaller.

TI Protein synthesis by ribosomes with tethered subunits
SO NATURE
AB The ribosome is a ribonucleoprotein machine responsible for protein synthesis. In all kingdoms of life it is composed of two subunits, each built on its own ribosomal RNA (rRNA) scaffold. The independent but coordinated functions of the subunits, including their ability to associate at initiation, rotate during elongation, and dissociate after protein release, are an established model of protein synthesis. Furthermore, the bipartite nature of the ribosome is presumed to be essential for biogenesis, since dedicated assembly factors keep immature ribosomal subunits apart and prevent them from translation initiation(1). Free exchange of the subunits limits the development of specialized orthogonal genetic systems that could be evolved for novel functions without interfering with native translation. Here we show that ribosomes with tethered and thus inseparable subunits (termed Ribo-T) are capable of successfully carrying out protein synthesis. By engineering a hybrid rRNA composed of both small and large subunit rRNA sequences, we produced a functional ribosome in which the subunits are covalently linked into a single entity by short RNA linkers. Notably, Ribo-T was not only functional in vitro, but was also able to support the growth of Escherichia coli cells even in the absence of wild-type ribosomes. We used Ribo-T to create the first fully orthogonal ribosome-messenger RNA system, and demonstrate its evolvability by selecting otherwise dominantly lethal rRNA mutations in the peptidyl transferase centre that facilitate the translation of a problematic protein sequence. Ribo-T can be used for exploring poorly understood functions of the ribosome, enabling orthogonal genetic systems, and engineering ribosomes with new functions.

AB Parallelizing of software improves its effectiveness and productivity. To guarantee correctness, the parallel and serial versions of the same code must be formally verified to be equivalent. We present a novel approach, called GRASSP, that automatically synthesizes parallel single-pass array-processing programs by treating the given serial versions as specifications. Given arbitrary segmentation of the input array, GRASSP synthesizes a code to determine a new segmentation of the array that allows computing partial results for each segment and merging them. In contrast to other parallelizers, GRASSP gradually considers several parallelization scenarios and certifies the results using constrained Horn solving. For several classes of programs, we show that such parallelization can be performed efficiently. The C++ translations of the GRASSP solutions sped performance by up to 5X relative to serial code on an 8-thread machine and Hadoop translations by up to 10X on a 10-node Amazon EMR cluster.

The proposed architecture features the following innovations: 1) It employs an efficient hardware assisted dynamic binary translation approach, 2) It implements a native semantically rich instruction set architecture that achieves when translating user level code one-to-one mappings for RISC ISAs such as ARM and a minimal one-to-multiple mappings for CISC ISAs such as Intel X86, and 3) It tackles, without compromising performance or energy efficiency and without requiring recompilation of software or rewriting of compilers, the issue of software portability across different ISA platforms through unhosted hardware assisted ISA virtualization. After introducing a metric to compare the semantic difference between an emulated virtual ISA and the native platform ISA, we present performance results as well as measurements of the effectiveness of our proposed platform when running ARM and X86 binaries.

AB Cross-ISA system-mode emulation has many important applications. For example, Cross-ISA system-mode emulation helps computer architects and OS developers trace and debug kernel execution-flow efficiently by emulating a slower platform (such as ARM) on a more powerful platform (such as an x86 machine). Cross-ISA system-mode emulation also enables workload consolidation in data centers with platforms of different instruction-set architectures (ISAs). However, system-mode emulation is much slower. One major overhead in system-mode emulation is the multi-level memory address translation that maps guest virtual address to host physical address. Shadow page tables (SPT) have been used to reduce such overheads, but primarily for same-ISA virtualization. In this paper we propose a novel approach called embedded shadow page tables (ESPT). EPST embeds a shadow page table into the address space of a cross-ISA dynamic binary translation (DBT) and uses hardware memory management unit in the CPU to translate memory addresses, instead of software translation in a current DBT emulator like QEMU. We also use the larger address space on modern 64-bit CPUs to accommodate our DBT emulator so that it will not interfere with the guest operating system. We incorporate our new scheme into QEMU, a popular, retargetable cross-ISA system emulator. SPEC CINT2006 benchmark results indicate that our technique achieves an average speedup of 1.51 times in system mode when emulating ARM on x86, and a 1.59 times speedup for emulating IA32 on x86_64.

AB Cross-lingual sentiment classification aims to leverage the rich sentiment resources in one language for sentiment classification in a different language. The biggest challenge of this task is how to eliminate the sentimental semantic gap between two languages. The use of machine translation cannot address this challenge very well due to the translation noises and the different expressions in different languages. In this study, we propose a Bilingual Sentiment Embedding model (BSE) to jointly embed the review texts in different languages into a joint sentimental semantic space. After embedding the reviews texts into the sentimental semantic space, the reviews texts in different languages can be easily classified with a classifier. Moreover, our proposed model can find in both languages the words with similar sentiment orientation or opposite sentiment orientation for a given word. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset show that our proposed model can outperform the state-of-the-art SCL method.

AB Regularization methods applying input perturbation have drawn considerable attention and have been frequently explored for NMT tasks in recent years. Despite their simplicity and effectiveness, we argue that these methods are limited by the under-fitting of training data. In this paper, we utilize prediction difference for ground-truth tokens to analyze the fitting of token-level samples and find that under-fitting is almost as common as over-fitting. We introduce prediction difference regularization (PD-R), a simple and effective method that can reduce over-fitting and under-fitting at the same time. For all token-level samples, PD-R minimizes the prediction difference between the original pass and the input-perturbed pass, making the model less sensitive to small input changes, thus more robust to both perturbations and under-fitted training data. Experiments on three widely used WMT translation tasks show that our approach can significantly improve over existing perturbation regularization methods. On WMT16 En-De task, our model achieves 1.80 SacreBLEU improvement over vanilla transformer.

TI SEQ2SEQ-VIS : A Visual Debugging Tool for Sequence-to-Sequence Models
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS
AB Neural sequence-to-sequence models have proven to be accurate and robust for many sequence prediction tasks, and have become the standard approach for automatic translation of text. The models work with a five-stage blackbox pipeline that begins with encoding a source sequence to a vector space and then decoding out to a new target sequence. This process is now standard, but like many deep learning methods remains quite difficult to understand or debug. In this work, we present a visual analysis tool that allows interaction and "what if"-style exploration of trained sequence-to-sequence models through each stage of the translation process. The aim is to identify which patterns have been learned. to detect model errors, and to probe the model with counterfactual scenario. We demonstrate the utility of our tool through several real-world sequence-to-sequence use cases on large-scale models.

AB Object recognition in real scenes is a central problem in computer vision. In this paper we propose a new approach for shape based recognition of objects in real scenes. This approach uses moment invariants for identification of shape features. Moment Invariants are functions of central moments. They are invariant against linear transformations such as rotation, translation and scaling. Therefore, their integration provides recognition of objects in real scenes with different pose and appearances. In this way, the proposed approach does not only provide invariant object recognition, but also capable of dealing with challenges like variation in pose and appearances. We have used linear support vector machine (SVM) for classification of object and non-object data. With qualitative and quantitative experimental evaluation on standard INRIA Pedestrian dataset, we have compared performance of the proposed method with other state of the art shape feature descriptors based object recognition methods and demonstrated better performance over them.

AB In policy-based management, the gap between policy definition and enforcement mechanisms needs an architectural innovation to rill. Policy-based trust management has this gap too. Enforcement of policies for federation activities, especially trust policies among web-service-based systems, requires a dynamic and flexible architecture to accommodate different trust models and different domains. Meanwhile, the choice of high-level policy languages cannot have an exact match to low-level enforcement mechanisms in network services or operating systems. An intermediate-level semantic translation architecture is proposed in this paper to bridge the gap between high-level policy languages used directly by humans and low-level mechanisms offered by machines. The merits of this architecture include: users can choose their high-level policy languages with the most usability the), want; the system administrator can introduce a new core mathematical or logical model when it is more appropriate for system controls; the semantic translation in the intermediate-level is flexible.

AB In this paper, we explore how we can endow robots with the ability to learn correspondences between their own skills, and those of agents with different embodiments and in different domains than their own, in an entirely unsupervised manner. Our insight and premise is that agents with different embodiments use similar strategies (high-level skill sequences) to solve similar tasks. Based on this insight, we frame learning skill correspondences as a problem of matching distributions of sequences of skills across agents. We then present an unsupervised objective that encourages a learnt skill translation model to match these distributions across domains inspired by recent advances in unsupervised machine translation. Our approach is able to learn semantically meaningful correspondences between skills across multiple robot-robot and human-robot domain pairs, despite being completely unsupervised. Further, the learnt correspondences enable the transfer of task strategies across robots and domains.

TI A Bilingual Adversarial Autoencoder for Unsupervised Bilingual Lexicon
   Induction
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Unsupervised bilingual lexicon induction aims to generate bilingual lexicons without any cross-lingual signals. Successfully solving this problem would benefit many downstream tasks, such as unsupervised machine translation and transfer learning. In this work, we propose an unsupervised framework, named bilingual adversarial autoencoder, which automatically generates bilingual lexicon for a pair of languages from their monolingual word embeddings. In contrast to existing frameworks which learn a direct cross-lingual mapping of word emheddings from the source language to the target language, we train two autoencoders jointly to transform the source and the target monolingual word embeddings into a shared embedding space, where a word and its translation are close to each other. In this way, we capture the crosslingual features of word embeddings from different languages and use them to induce bilingual lexicons. By conducting extensive experiments across eight language pairs, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing adversarial methods and even achieves best-published results across most language pairs.

TI Modeling Complex Relationship Paths for Knowledge Graph Completion
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB Determining the validity of knowledge triples and filling in the missing entities or relationships in the knowledge graph are the crucial tasks for large-scale knowledge graph completion. So far, the main solutions use machine learning methods to learn the low-dimensional distributed representations of entities and relationships to complete the knowledge graph. Among them, translationmodels obtain excellent performance. However, the proposed translation models do not adequately consider the indirect relationships among entities, affecting the precision of the representation. Based on the long short-term memory neural network and existing translation models, we propose a multiple-module hybrid neural network model called TransP. By modeling the entity paths and their relationship paths, TransP can effectively excavate the indirect relationships among the entities, and thus, improve the quality of knowledge graph completion tasks. Experimental results show that TransP outperforms state-of-the-art models in the entity prediction task, and achieves the comparable performance with previous models in the relationship prediction task.

AB The presented study demonstrates the enormous potentials of translating mathematical expressions into their relevant physical meanings. In the past, such translations have proven capable of explaining the cause(s) of phenomena, which seemed to defy all principles of common sense. In other cases, they were able to rectify deeply rooted misconceptions, which haunted the engineers for many decades. Among others, they have revealed the need for revising everything what has been done in the last eight decades in relation to the head developed by an impeller. All the above conclusions are here supported by actual case histories from past experience.
   The discussions presented in this study relate directly to the design of centrifugal and other rotodynamic pumps. However, there exist strong indications, that such translations may prove equally useful also in other fields of engineering.

AB Techniques of processing databases like free text searching, or proximity search are one of the key factors that influence efficiency of query answering. Since most users prefer querying systems in natural language, a correct answer formulation based on the electronic document content seems a real challenge. Processing queries in multilingual environment usually impedes the system responsiveness even more. This paper proposes an approach of over-coming these obstacles by implementation of syntactic information extraction. Some evaluation methodologies commonly used by TREC, NTCIR, SIGIR etc are studied in order to suggest that it is not only a system architecture itself, a translation model or the document format, but also other factors that determine the system performance. The shallow technique of the syntactic information extraction used appears to be a robust of the system described. In this light, it is possible to achieve comparable results when processing monolingual and cross-lingual collections.

AB The verification of access controls is essential for providing secure systems. Model checking is an automated technique used for verifying finite state machines. The properties to be verified are usually expressed as formula in temporal logic. In this paper we present an approach to verify access control security properties of a security annotated business process model. To this end we utilise a security enhanced BPMN notation to define access control properties.
   To enhance the usability the complex and technical details are hidden from the process modeller by using an automatic translation of the process model into a process meta language (Promela) based on Coloured Petri net (CPN) semantics.
   The model checker SPIN is used for the process model verification and a trace file is written to provide visual feedback to the modeller on the abstraction level of the verified process model. As a proof of concept the described translation methodology is implemented as a plug-in for the free web-based BPMN modelling tool Oryx.

AB We introduce a new class of code sequences for synchronous CDMA, having in mind application to the downlink of cellular systems. The code that we propose is made by all the cyclical translations of what is called in the literature a CAZAC sequence, for example a Frank-Zadoff sequence. We show that, when the transmission channel is affected by multipath and noise, the proposed code allows multiuser interference to become cyclic intersymbol interference, provided that a cyclic prefix is appended to the multiplexed vector. Noticeably, the memory of the finite state machine that describes the ISI model is equal to memory of the multipath channel. The main advantage of our proposed system is that optimal detection is obtained by the classical Viterbi algorithm, which is much easier to implement than the optimal multiuser detector of classical CDMA schemes. Another advantage of our scheme is that it leads naturally to a signal processing architecture similar to that of OFDM systems, hence based on the efficient FFT/IFFT algorithm.

TI Learning the Studio: Sketches for Mid-Century Electronic Music
SO CONTEMPORARY MUSIC REVIEW
AB Electronic music is a hugely impactful development that altered the entire course of twentieth century music, though it often seems a bit hard to access analytically. This article uses sketches to open a window onto the ways that composers adapted to the exciting but unfamiliar realm of electronic music. In the postwar era, European avant-garde composers such as Berio, Boulez, Kagel, Koenig, Ligeti, Pousseur, and Stockhausen, who had access to institutional studios, expanded their musical thinking in dialogue with electronic music technologies and discourses. Initially, composers made translations to and from acoustic music, but quickly learned to create musical ideas in cooperation with technicians and studio machinery. Composers also took on new scientific insights as they learned how to use electronic studio machines for making effective musical sound. In this way, the studio's technological affordances and constraints, as well as its collaborative working culture, had major impacts on the progression of both electronic and acoustic music.

AB In the current English semantic recognition of mail, there are problems such as serious information distortion and unrecognizable, which affects the promotion of machine automation to recognize text in emails. This study combines the actual situation of the mail image to set the corresponding image processing algorithm, adopts the conversion from RGB data to gray data to perform image gray processing, and combines the weighted average gray algorithm to improve the image gray definition and softness. At the same time, this study uses homomorphic filtering to enhance the image, uses homomorphic filtering to enhance the sharpness of the text, and uses median filtering to enhance the image. Image edge recognition is performed with the Sobel color difference operator, and the text result is output. Combining experiments to study the performance of the algorithm, the research shows that the algorithm has certain practical effects, which can provide reference for subsequent related research.

AB Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) has been recently modeled using the sequenceto-sequence framework. However, unlike sequence transduction problems such as machine translation, GEC suffers from the lack of plentiful parallel data. We describe two approaches for generating large parallel datasets for GEC using publicly available Wikipedia data. The first method extracts sourcetarget pairs from Wikipedia edit histories with minimal filtration heuristics, while the second method introduces noise into Wikipedia sentences via round-trip translation through bridge languages. Both strategies yield similar sized parallel corpora containing around 4B tokens. We employ an iterative decoding strategy that is tailored to the loosely supervised nature of our constructed corpora. We demonstrate that neural GEC models trained using either type of corpora give similar performance. Fine-tuning these models on the Lang-8 corpus and ensembling allows us to surpass the state of the art on both the CoNLL2014 benchmark and the JFLEG task. We provide systematic analysis that compares the two approaches to data generation and highlights the effectiveness of ensembling.

   afterword
SO SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES
AB Japanese culture inspired English-speaking cyberpunk writers, but the transaction was not a one-way street. For cyberpunk fiction also provided the Japanese with a chance to reinvestigate their own cyborgian identity. I clarify the interactions and negotiations, over four decades, between contemporary Anglo-American and Japanese sf, whether print or multimedia. A major focus of my discussion is Aramaki Yoshio's New Wave short story 'Soft Clocks' (1968-72), which foregrounds the contrast between the imperialist gluttony of 'Dali of Mars' and the anorexia of his granddaughter Vivi. In the heyday of the cyberpunk movement, this text was translated by Kazuko Behrens and Lewis Shine for the January-February 1989 issue of Interzone. While Aramaki in his own way digested and cannibalized outer space-oriented American sf of the 1950s, Lewis Shiner in turn digested and softly transfigured 'Soft Clocks' for a later generation and another culture. This kind of 'soft translation' or transaction between cultures is becoming more and more significant for the future of global sf.

AB Classical Information Retrieval (IR) is the sifting out of the documents most relevant to a user's information requirement (expressed as a "query"), from a large electronic store of documents. A search engine performs IR by retrieving relevant web pages from the internet. Rather than regarding foreign-language documents simply as unwanted "noise", Cross Language Information Retrieval allows the user to state their query in one language, and retrieve documents in another. Some CLIR systems use language resources such as bilingual dictionaries to translate the user's original query, while other systems use machine translation to translate the foreign-language documents beforehand, enabling them to be retrieved by the original query. Problems arise due to ambiguity in language, the use of synonyms to express a single idea, and the lack of context available in translating a short query. This paper will discuss previous work in CLIR, current problems in CLIR, and make recommendations for future work.

AB Quantitative research, especially in the field of radio(geno) mics, has helped us understand fundamental mechanisms of neurologic diseases. Such research is integrally based on advanced algorithms to derive extensive radiomic features and integrate them into diagnostic and predictive models. To exploit the benefit of such complex algorithms, their swift translation into clinical practice is required, currently hindered by their complicated nature. brain-CaPTk is a modular platform, with components spanning across image processing, segmentation, feature extraction, and machine learning, that facilitates such translation, enabling quantitative analyses without requiring substantial computational background. Thus, brain-CaPTk can be seamlessly integrated into the typical quantification, analysis and reporting workflow of a radiologist, underscoring its clinical potential. This paper describes currently available components of brain-CaPTk and example results from their application in glioblastoma.

TI The Mammalian Ribo-interactome Reveals Ribosome Functional Diversity and
   Heterogeneity
SO CELL
AB During eukaryotic evolution, ribosomes have considerably increased in size, forming a surface-exposed ribosomal RNA (rRNA) shell of unknown function, which may create an interface for yet uncharacterized interacting proteins. To investigate such protein interactions, we establish a ribosome affinity purification method that unexpectedly identifies hundreds of ribosome-associated proteins (RAPs) from categories including metabolism and cell cycle, as well as RNA-and protein-modifying enzymes that functionally diversify mammalian ribosomes. By further characterizing RAPs, we discover the presence of ufmylation, a metazoan-specific post-translational modification (PTM), on ribosomes and define its direct substrates. Moreover, we show that the metabolic enzyme, pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM), interacts with sub-pools of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated ribosomes, exerting a non-canonical function as an RNA-binding protein in the translation of ER-destined mRNAs. Therefore, RAPs interconnect one of life's most ancient molecular machines with diverse cellular processes, providing an additional layer of regulatory potential to protein expression.

   5 ' leaders of coding RNAs
SO DEVELOPMENT
AB Large-scale genomics and computational approaches have identified thousands of putative long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). It has been controversial, however, as to what fraction of these RNAs is truly non-coding. Here, we combine ribosome profiling with a machine-learning approach to validate lncRNAs during zebrafish development in a high throughput manner. We find that dozens of proposed lncRNAs are protein-coding contaminants and that many lncRNAs have ribosome profiles that resemble the 5' leaders of coding RNAs. Analysis of ribosome profiling data from embryonic stem cells reveals similar properties for mammalian lncRNAs. These results clarify the annotation of developmental lncRNAs and suggest a potential role for translation in lncRNA regulation. In addition, our computational pipeline and ribosome profiling data provide a powerful resource for the identification of translated open reading frames during zebrafish development.

TI Recent Development of Bioinformatics Tools for microRNA Target
   Prediction
SO CURRENT MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are central players that regulate the post-transcriptional processes of gene expression. Binding of miRNAs to target mRNAs can repress their translation by inducing the degradation or by inhibiting the translation of the target mRNAs. High throughput experimental approaches for miRNA target identification are costly and timeconsuming, depending on various factors. It is vitally important to develop bioinformatics methods for accurately predicting miRNA targets. With the increase of RNA sequences in the post-genomic era, bioinformatics methods are being developed for miRNA studies especially for miRNA target prediction. This review summarizes the current development of state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools for miRNA target prediction, points out the progress and limitations of the available miRNA databases, and their working principles. Finally, we discuss the caveat and perspectives of the next-generation algorithms for the prediction of miRNA targets.

AB Downstream processing of machine translation (MT) output promises to be a solution to improve translation quality, especially when the MT system's internal decoding process is not accessible. Both rule-based and statistical automatic post-editing (APE) methods have been proposed over the years, but with contrasting results. A missing aspect in previous evaluations is the assessment of different methods: i) under comparable conditions, and ii) on different language pairs featuring variable levels of MT quality. Focusing on statistical APE methods (more portable across languages), we propose the first systematic analysis of two approaches. To understand their potential, we compare them in the same conditions over six language pairs having English as source. Our results evidence consistent improvements on all language pairs, a relation between the extent of the gain and MT output quality, slight but statistically significant performance differences between the two methods, and their possible complementarity.

TI Structural basis for the inhibition of the eukaryotic ribosome
SO NATURE
AB The ribosome is a molecular machine responsible for protein synthesis and a major target for small-molecule inhibitors. Compared to the wealth of structural information available on ribosome-targeting antibiotics in bacteria, our understanding of the binding mode of ribosome inhibitors in eukaryotes is currently limited. Here we used X-ray crystallography to determine 16 high-resolution structures of 80S ribosomes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in complexes with 12 eukaryote-specific and 4 broad-spectrum inhibitors. All inhibitors were found associated with messenger RNA and transfer RNA binding sites. In combination with kinetic experiments, the structures suggest a model for the action of cycloheximide and lactimidomycin, which explains why lactimidomycin, the larger compound, specifically targets the first elongation cycle. The study defines common principles of targeting and resistance, provides insights into translation inhibitor mode of action and reveals the structural determinants responsible for species selectivity which could guide future drug development.

AB We introduce a Content-based Document Alignment approach (CDA), an efficient method to align multilingual web documents based on content in creating parallel training data for machine translation (MT) systems operating at the industrial level. CDA works in two steps: (i) projecting documents of a web domain to a shared multilingual space; then (ii) aligning them based on the similarity of their representations in such space. We leverage lexical translation models to build vector representations using TF x IDF. CDA achieves performance comparable with state-of-the-art systems in the WMT-16 Bilingual Document Alignment Shared Task benchmark while operating in multilingual space. Besides, we created two web-scale datasets to examine the robustness of CDA in an industrial setting involving up to 28 languages and millions of documents. The experiments show that CDA is robust, cost-effective, and is significantly superior in (i) processing large and noisy web data and (ii) scaling to new and low-resourced languages.

TI Reproducible Extraction of Cross-lingual Topics (rectr)
SO COMMUNICATION METHODS AND MEASURES
AB With global media content databases and online content being available, analyzing topical structures in different languages simultaneously has become an urgent computational task. Some previous studies have analyzed topics in a multilingual corpus by translating all items into a single language using a machine translation service, such as Google Translate. We argue that this method is not reproducible in the long run and proposes a new method - Reproducible Extraction of Cross-lingual Topics Using R (rectr). Our method utilizes open-source-aligned word embeddings to understand the cross-lingual meanings of words and has a mechanism to normalize residual influence from language differences. We present a benchmark that compares the topics extracted from a corpus of English, German, and French news using our method with methods used in the literature. We show that our method is not only reproducible but can also generate high-quality cross-lingual topics. We demonstrate how our method can be applied in tracking news topics across time and languages.

AB GALL (Google Assisted Language Learning) refers to Google as a collaborative and communicative tool that supports online and blended language learning. This research paper presents an overview of previous studies on using Google Apps in the process of learning and teaching of English language. A systematic search on ERIC digital library and Google Scholar reviewed the previous studies published during the last ten years. There were one hundred seventy-eight articles, and thirty-four studies were sorted and analyzed using NVivo software. This systematic review showed that using some Google Applications, resulted in developing English language learning and teaching. The writing was the most language skill investigated. Translation practices have changed due to using machine translation with the help of Google Translate web site. Besides, more studies with concern for reading skills, speaking skills, oral reading, and the Google speech recognition system emerged as a promising field for further research.

TI How Does the Ribosome Fold the Proteome?
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF BIOCHEMISTRY, VOL 89
SE Annual Review of Biochemistry
AB Folding of polypeptides begins during their synthesis on ribosomes. This process has evolved as a means for the cell to maintain proteostasis, by mitigating the risk of protein misfolding and aggregation. The capacity to now depict this cellular feat at increasingly higher resolution is providing insight into the mechanistic determinants that promote successful folding. Emerging from these studies is the intimate interplay between protein translation and folding, and within this the ribosome particle is the key player. Its unique structural properties provide a specialized scaffold against which nascent polypeptides can begin to form structure in a highly coordinated, co-translational manner. Here, we examine how, as a macromolecular machine, the ribosome modulates the intrinsic dynamic properties of emerging nascent polypeptide chains and guides them toward their biologically active structures.

AB This paper introduces a novel camera mouse driven by 3D model based visual face tracking technique. While camera becomes standard configuration for personal computer(PC) and computer speed becomes faster and faster achieving human machine interaction through visual face tracking becomes a feasible solution to hand-free control. The human facial movement can be decomposed into rigid movement, e.g. rotation and translation, and non-rigid movement, such as the open/close of mouth, eyes, and facial expressions, etc. We introduce our visual face tracking system that can robustly and accurately retrieve these motion parameters from video at real-time. After calibration, the retrieved head orientation and translation can be employed to navigate the mouse cursor and the detection of mouth movement can be utilized to trigger mouse events. 3 mouse control modes are investigated and compared. Experiments in Windows XP environment verifies the convenience of navigation and operations using our face mouse. This technique can be an alternative input device for people with hand and speech disability and for futuristic vision-based game and interface.

TI An Automated Model Test System for Systematic Development and
   Improvement of Gene Expression Models
SO ACS SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY
AB Gene expression models greatly accelerate the engineering of synthetic metabolic pathways and genetic circuits by predicting sequence-function relationships and reducing trial-and-error experimentation. However, developing models with more accurate predictions remains a significant challenge. Here we present a model test system that combines advanced statistics, machine learning, and a database of 9862 characterized genetic systems to automatically quantify model accuracies, accept or reject mechanistic hypotheses, and identify areas for model improvement. We also introduce model capacity, a new information theoretic metric for correct cross-data-set comparisons. We demonstrate the model test system by comparing six models of translation initiation rate, evaluating 100 mechanistic hypotheses, and uncovering new sequence determinants that control protein expression levels. We then applied these results to develop a biophysical model of translation initiation rate with significant improvements in accuracy. Automated model test systems will dramatically accelerate the development of gene expression models, and thereby transition synthetic biology into a mature engineering discipline.

TI Small binding-site clearance delays are not negligible in gene
   expression modeling
SO MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES
AB During the templated biopolymerization processes of transcription and translation, a macromolecular machine, either an RNA polymerase or a ribosome, binds to a specific site on the template. Due to the sizes of these enzymes, there is a waiting time before one clears the binding site and another can bind. These clearance delays are relatively short, and one might think that they could be neglected. However, in the case of transcription, these clearance delays are associated with conservation laws, resulting in surprisingly large effects on the bifurcation diagrams in models of gene expression networks. We study an example of this phenomenon in a model of a gene regulated by a non-coding RNA displaying bistability. Neglecting the binding-site clearance delays in this model can only be compensated for by making ad hoc, unphysical adjustments to the model's kinetic constants.

AB Maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) is widely used in sequence to sequence tasks for model training. It uniformly treats the generation/prediction of each target token as multiclass classification, and yields non-smooth prediction probabilities: in a target sequence, some tokens are predicted with small probabilities while other tokens are with large probabilities. According to our empirical study, we find that the non-smoothness of the probabilities results in low quality of generated sequences. In this paper, we propose a sentence-wise regularization method which aims to output smooth prediction probabilities for all the tokens in the target sequence. Our proposed method can automatically adjust the weights and gradients of each token in one sentence to ensure the predictions in a sequence uniformly well. Experiments on three neural machine translation tasks and one text summarization task show that our method outperforms conventional MLE loss on all these tasks and achieves promising BLEU scores on WMT14 English-German and WMT17 Chinese-English translation task.

TI Leaf classification from binary image via artificial intelligence
SO BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
AB The invariant recognition of 2D binary images is the main subject of the paper. Two methods for invariant pattern recognition based on 2D Fourier power spectrum with guaranteed translation invariance are proposed. First method introduce the features invariant to translation, scaling, rotation and mirroring (TSO invariance). The second method introduces the features invariant to general affine transform (A invariance). The methods are used to obtain TSO/A invariant spectra except of the rotation effect which are analysed on circular paths with fixed radii. Harmonic analysis of power fluctuations around paths generates Fourier coefficients and their square absolute values are used as TSO/A invariant descriptors. The proposed methods were tested on two large sets of 2D digital images of tree leaves. After TSO/A invariant processing of thresholded digital images, kernel Support Vector Machine or self-organizing neural network were used for leaf categorisation. (C) 2015 IAgrE.

AB Sign language is becoming increasingly popular day by day to make a bridge between the hearing impaired and normal people. It is a very challenging task in respect of developing country like Bangladesh where around 2.4 million people use Bangla sign language. In this respect we propose a simple, low cost Bangla sign language translation (BSLT) system that can translate sign into Bangla text. We report on the development of universal interpreter software (UIS) that can be used by both the American and the Bangladeshi users. For this, an efficient method is proposed for skin detection & feature extraction. Our system can recognize 16 Bengali words & 11 Bengali numbers. We train our system using a database of (27x10x20) images, i.e. 10 persons containing 20 images per sign & for testing we use another 2700 (27x10x10) images. The system results in about 96.463% accuracy as compared to K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm.

AB Conjunct Verbs (CVs) are one of the special forms of Complex Predicates that behave as a single verbal unit but maintain a multiword structure. CVs play an important role in Natural Language Processing applications like Speech to Speech Translation, Machine Translation and lexical resource creation. But due to their distinct construction, detection and extraction of CVs is a challenging task. This paper presents a hybrid approach for mining CVs from parallel corpus combining rule-based and statistical approach. Though the proposed approach has been applied on Bangla-English parallel corpus to extract Bangla CVs, the methodology is equally applicable to other Indian languages of Indo-Aryan family, in presence of parts of speech tagger and sufficient amount of parallel corpus. Evaluation on Bangla-English parallel corpus of 50,000 sentences, the proposed approach yields an accuracy of 76% that can be improved by increasing the number of sentence pairs in the parallel corpus.

TI Red-green-blue to normalized difference vegetation index translation: a
   robust and inexpensive approach for vegetation monitoring using machine
   vision and generative adversarial networks
SO PRECISION AGRICULTURE
AB High-resolution multispectral imaging of agricultural fields is expensive but helpful in detecting subtle variations in plant health and stress symptoms before the appearance of visible indications. To aid precision agriculture (PA) practices, an innovative and inexpensive protocol for robust and timely monitoring of vegetation symptoms has been evaluated. This innovative but inexpensive protocol uses machine vision (MV) and generative adversarial networks (GAN) to translate red-green-blue (RGB) imagery captured with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) into a valuable normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) map. This study used direct translation of RGB imagery in NDVI index, in contrast with similar studies that used GANs in near-infrared (NIR) translation. The protocol was tested by flying a fixed-winged UAV developed by senseFly Inc. (Cheseaux-sur-Lausanne, Switzerland) model Ebee-X, equipped with a RedEdge-MX sensor, to capture images from five different potatoes fields located in Prince Edward Island - Canada, during the growing season of 2021. The images were captured throughout the growing season under vegetation (15-30 DAP; days after plantation), tuber formation (30-45 DAP), tuber bulking (75-110 DAP), and tuber maturation stages (> 110 DAP). The NDVI was calculated from captured UAV aerial surveys using NIR and red bands to develop pairwise datasets for the training of GANs. Five hundred pairwise images were used (80% training, 10% validation, and 10% testing) for training and evaluation of GANs. Two famous GANs, namely Pix2Pix and Pix2PixHD, were tested compared to various training and evaluation indicators. The Pix2PixHD outperformed Pix2Pix GAN by recording lower root mean square error (RMSE) (5.40 to 13.73) and higher structural similarity index matrix (SSIM) score (0.69 to 0.90) during the evaluation of the protocol. The results of this study are breakthroughs to be used for economic vegetation and orchard health monitoring after the training of models. The trained GANs can translate simple RGB domains into useful vegetation indices maps for variable rate PA practices. This innovative protocol can also translate remote sensing imagery of large-scale agricultural fields and commercial orchards into NDVI to extract useful information about plant health indicators.

TI Nonequilibrium Many-Body Quantum Engine Driven by Time-Translation
   Symmetry Breaking
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum many-body systems out of equilibrium can host intriguing phenomena such as transitions to exotic dynamical states. Although this emergent behaviour can be observed in experiments, its potential for technological applications is largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the impact of collective effects on quantum engines that extract mechanical work from a many-body system. Using an optomechanical cavity setup with an interacting atomic gas as a working fluid, we demonstrate theoretically that such engines produce work under periodic driving. The stationary cycle of the working fluid features nonequilibrium phase transitions, resulting in abrupt changes of the work output. Remarkably, we find that our many-body quantum engine operates even without periodic driving. This phenomenon occurs when its working fluid enters a phase that breaks continuous time-translation symmetry: The emergent time-crystalline phase can sustain the motion of a load generating mechanical work. Our findings pave the way for designing novel nonequilibrium quantum machines.

TI Analysis and basic design of the magnetically levitated motor with five
   actively controlled degrees of freedom
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROMAGNETICS AND MECHANICS
AB A magnetically levitated motor can realize non-contact support and rotation of the rotor using magnetic force. Therefore, it has many advantages over conventional mechanical bearings. This paper proposed new magnetically levitated motor (Maglev motor). The proposed maglev motor uses a radial bearingless motor to control both of radial translation (x and y) motion and rotation (theta z), and axial magnetic bearings to control both of axial translation (z) and tilt motion (theta x and theta y). Moreover, stators were installed on the inner side of the rotor, such that the flux path of the axial magnetic bearing and radial bearingless motor are partially-shared. Therefore, the proposed magnetic levitated motor is small, while achieving five degrees of freedom active control. The prototype machine was designed using FEM magnetic analysis. According to this analysis, the device had sufficient magnetic force to control the rotor within a designed airgap. In addition, axial directional dynamic characteristics were measured.

AB Recently, substantial progress has been made in language modeling by using deep neural networks. However, in practice, large scale neural language models have been shown to be prone to overfitting. In this paper, we present a simple yet highly effective adversarial training mechanism for regularizing neural language models. The idea is to introduce adversarial noise to the output embedding layer while training the models. We show that the optimal adversarial noise yields a simple closed form solution, thus allowing us to develop a simple and time efficient algorithm. Theoretically, we show that our adversarial mechanism effectively encourages the diversity of the embedding vectors, helping to increase the robustness of models. Empirically, we show that our method improves on the single model state-of-the-art results for language modeling on Penn Treebank (PTB) and Wikitext-2, achieving test perplexity scores of 46.01 and 38.65, respectively. When applied to machine translation, our method improves over various transformer-based translation baselines in BLEU scores on the WMT14 English-German and IWSLT14 German-English tasks.

TI Reinforced Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Neural Headline Generation
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Cross-lingual neural headline generation (CNHG), which aims at training a single, large neural network that directly generates a target language headline given a source language news document, has received considerable attention in recent years. Unlike conventional neural headline generation, CNHG faces the problem that there are no large-scale parallel corpora of source language articles and target language headlines. Consequently, CNHG is a zero-shot scenario. To solve this problem, we propose zero resource CNHG with reinforcement learning. We develop a reinforcement learning framework that is composed of two modules: a neural machine translation (NMT) module and a CNHG module. The translation module translates an input document into a source language document, and the headline generation module takes the previous output as input to generate a target language headline. Then, both modules receive a reward for joint training. The experimental results reveal that our method significantly outperforms baseline models.

AB Despite the progress made in sentence-level NMT, current systems still fall short at achieving fluent, good quality translation for a full document. Recent works in context-aware NMT consider only a few previous sentences as context and may not scale to entire documents. To this end, we propose a novel and scalable top-down approach to hierarchical attention for context-aware NMT which uses sparse attention to selectively focus on relevant sentences in the document context and then attends to key words in those sentences. We also propose single-level attention approaches based on sentence or word-level information in the context. The document-level context representation, produced from these attention modules, is integrated into the encoder or decoder of the Transformer model depending on whether we use monolingual or bilingual context. Our experiments and evaluation on English-German datasets in different document MT settings show that our selective attention approach not only significantly outperforms context-agnostic baselines but also surpasses context-aware baselines in most cases.

AB In this paper we present phase shifting Talbot interferometric technique to draw the profile of the gas turbine blade. In Talbot interferometry phase shifting is implemented by giving in-plane translation to first grating by using precision translation stage. To obtain the phase connected with the object, the additional phase change stepwise, with a step of pi/2 at least three times is introduced and the intensity patterns corresponding to these steps are recorded as Talbot interferometric fringes pattern. Experimentally recorded interferograms have noise due to grating lines and speckles. These noises are filtered by using Fourier filtering technique. The phase map made by using Fourier filtered data. Height variations/profile of the gas turbine blades made by using phase shifting Talbot Interferometry are compared with the results obtained from Co-ordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) having co-ordinate measurement facility with the resolution of I pm. The results are in good agreement.

TI Closing the translation gap: AI applications in digital pathology
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-REVIEWS ON CANCER
AB Recent advances in artificial intelligence show tremendous promise to improve the accuracy, reproducibility, and availability of medical diagnostics across a number of medical subspecialities. This is especially true in the field of digital pathology, which has recently witnessed a surge in publications describing state-of-the-art performance for machine learning models across a wide range of diagnostic applications. Nonetheless, despite this promise, there remain significant gaps in translating applications for any of these technologies into actual clinical practice. In this review, we will first give a brief overview of the recent progress in applying AI to digitized pathology images, focusing on how these tools might be applied in clinical workflows in the near term to improve the accuracy and efficiency of pathologists. Then we define and describe in detail the various factors that need to be addressed in order to successfully close the "translation gap" for AI applications in digital pathology.

AB In the article a technology is considered which aims at creating architecture-independent parallel programmes based on the datadriven functional paradigm. A proposed toolkit provides the translation, execution, debugging, optimisation and verification of programmes. A programme in a data-driven functional parallel language is translated into the data-flow graph (which describes the data dependencies of an implemented algorithm) of the programme. On the basis of this representation, the control-flow graph (which defines the organisation of computations) is generated. Both graphs allow to carry out various optimising transformations. The resulting data-flow graph is also used for the formal verification of the programme. A computation process is considered as a cooperation of the control-flow graph and the data-flow graph. The execution of data-driven functional parallel programmes is carried out by a special interpreter (event machine), which consist of a number of event processors controlled by a special manager.

AB We present a framework for discovering acoustic units and generating an associated pronunciation lexicon from an initial grapheme-based recognition system. Our approach consists of two distinct contributions. First, context-dependent grapheme models are clustered using a spectral clustering approach to create a set of phone-like acoustic units. Next, we transform the pronunciation lexicon using a statistical machine translation-based approach. Pronunciation hypotheses generated from a decoding of the training set are used to create a phrase-based translation table. We propose a novel method for scoring the phrase-based rules that significantly improves the output of the transformation process. Results on an English language dataset demonstrate the combined methods provide a 13% relative reduction in word error rate compared to a baseline grapheme-based system. Our approach could potentially be applied to low-resource languages without existing lexicons, such as in the Babel project.

AB Parallel kinematic manipulator are for sure the best choice to fulfill the need of high accuracy and high stiffness. By the way due to the always increasing required performances, poor decisions during the early design stages might lead to the arising of vibration phenomena during the operating phase of the machine. Due to the intrinsic nonlinearities that characterize this kind of machines the modes of vibration of the structure strongly depend on the pose of the robot. In addition in many applications as the one presented in this paper the tasks the machine is required to perform are not known in advance. Usually the technical specification for a PKM in terms of workspace dimensions and maximum excitation frequencies are related to the end-effector. By the way the kinematics that links the motion of the mobile platform to the joints motion is highly nonlinear, and thus might produce the insurgence of higher frequencies excitations. This paper presents an approach to test the modes of vibration of a 6-DoF parallel kinematic simulator that relies on a statistical method to investigate different possible motions of the end-effector that involve a combination of translations and rotations on the basis of their probability density functions (PDF).

TI Benefits of co-translational complex assembly for cellular fitness
SO BIOESSAYS
AB Complexes of two or more proteins form many, if not most, of the intracellular "machines" that execute physical and chemical work, and transmit information. Complexes can form from stochastic post-translational interactions of fully formed proteins, but recent attention has shifted to co-translational interactions in which the most common mechanism involves binding of a mature constituent to an incomplete polypeptide emerging from a translating ribosome. Studies in yeast have revealed co-translational interactions during formation of multiple major complexes, and together with recent mammalian cell studies, suggest widespread utilization of the mechanism. These translation-dependent interactions can involve a single or multiple mRNA templates, can be uni- or bi-directional, and can use multi-protein sub-complexes as a binding component. Here, we discuss benefits of co-translational complex assembly including accuracy and efficiency, overcoming hidden interfaces, localized and hierarchical assembly, and reduction of orphan protein degradation, toxicity, and dominant-negative pathogenesis, all serving to improve cell fitness.

AB With the growth of computing power neural machine translation (NMT) models also grow accordingly and become better. However, they also become harder to deploy on edge devices due to memory constraints. To cope with this problem, a common practice is to distill knowledge from a large and accurately-trained teacher network (T) into a compact student network (S). Although knowledge distillation (KD) is useful in most cases, our study shows that existing KD techniques might not be suitable enough for deep NMT engines, so we propose a novel alternative. In our model, besides matching T and S predictions we have a combinatorial mechanism to inject layer-level supervision from T to S. In this paper, we target low-resource settings and evaluate our translation engines for Portuguese -> English, Turkish -> English, and English -> German directions. Students trained using our technique have 50% fewer parameters and can still deliver comparable results to those of 12-layer teachers.

AB We contribute a faster decoding algorithm for phrase-based machine translation. Translation hypotheses keep track of state, such as context for the language model and coverage of words in the source sentence. Most features depend upon only part of the state, but traditional algorithms, including cube pruning, handle state atomically. For example, cube pruning will repeatedly query the language model with hypotheses that differ only in source coverage, despite the fact that source coverage is irrelevant to the language model. Our key contribution avoids this behavior by placing hypotheses into equivalence classes, masking the parts of state that matter least to the score. Moreover, we exploit shared words in hypotheses to iteratively refine language model scores rather than handling language model state atomically. Since our algorithm and cube pruning are both approximate, improvement can be used to increase speed or accuracy. When tuned to attain the same accuracy, our algorithm is 4.0-7.7 times as fast as the Moses decoder with cube pruning.

Specifically our approach is to build statistical models which translate from a visual representations (images) to semantic ones , (associated text). As providing optimal text for training is difficult at best, we propose working with whatever associated text is available in large quantities. Examples include large image collections with keywords, museum image collections with descriptive text, news photos, and images on the web.
   In this paper we discuss how the translation approach can give a handle on difficult questions such as: What counts as an object? Which objects are easy to recognize and which are hard? Which objects are indistinguishable using our features? How to integrate low level vision processes such as feature based segmentation, with high level processes such as grouping. We also summarize some of the models proposed for translating from visual information to text, and some of the methods used to evaluate their performance.

TI BosFinder: a novell pre-microRNA gene prediction algorithm in Bos taurus
SO ANIMAL GENETICS
AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that modulate gene expression transcriptionally (transcriptional activation or inactivation) and/or post-transcriptionally (translation inhibition or degradation of their target mRNAs). This phenomenon has significant roles in growth and developmental processes in plants and animals. Bos taurus is one of the most important livestock animals, having great importance in food and economical sciences and industries. However, limited information is available on Bos taurus constituent miRNAs because its whole genome assembly has been only recently published. Therefore, computational methods have been essential tools in miRNA gene prediction and discovery. Among these, machine-learning-based approaches are used to characterize genome scale pre-miRNAs from expressed sequence tags (ESTs). In this study, a support vector machine model was used to classify 33 structural and thermodynamic features of pre-miRNA genes. Public bovine EST data were obtained from different tissues in various developmental stages. A new algorithm, called BosFinder, was developed to identify and annotate the whole genome's derived pre-miRNAs. We found 18 776 highly potential pre-miRNA sequences. This is the first genome survey report of Bos taurus based on a machine-learning method for pre-miRNA gene finding. The BOSFINDER program is freely available at http://lbb.ut.ac.ir/Download/LBBsoft/BosFinder/.

TI Objective Phenotyping of Root System Architecture Using Image
   Augmentation and Machine Learning in Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)
SO PLANT PHENOMICS
AB Active breeding programs specifically for root system architecture (RSA) phenotypes remain rare; however, breeding for branch and taproot types in the perennial crop alfalfa is ongoing. Phenotyping in this and other crops for active RSA breeding has mostly used visual scoring of specific traits or subjective classification into different root types. While image-based methods have been developed, translation to applied breeding is limited. This research is aimed at developing and comparing image-based RSA phenotyping methods using machine and deep learning algorithms for objective classification of 617 root images from mature alfalfa plants collected from the field to support the ongoing breeding efforts. Our results show that unsupervised machine learning tends to incorrectly classify roots into a normal distribution with most lines predicted as the intermediate root type. Encouragingly, random forest and TensorFlow-based neural networks can classify the root types into branch-type, taproot-type, and an intermediate taproot-branch type with 86% accuracy. With image augmentation, the prediction accuracy was improved to 97%. Coupling the predicted root type with its prediction probability will give breeders a confidence level for better decisions to advance the best and exclude the worst lines from their breeding program. This machine and deep learning approach enables accurate classification of the RSA phenotypes for genomic breeding of climate-resilient alfalfa.

TI Simplified fuzzy ARTMAP as pattern recognizer
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
AB Pattern recognition has turned out to be an important aspect of a dominant technology such as machine intelligence. Domain specific fuzzy-neuro models particularly for the "black box" implementation of PR applications have been recently investigated. In this paper, Kasuba's simplified fuzzy adaptive resonance theory map (ARTMAP) has been discussed as a pattern recognizer/classifier For image processing problems. The model inherently recognizes only noise free patterns and in the case of patterns with noise or perturbations (rotation/scaling/translation) misclassifies the images. To tackle this problem, a conventional moment based rotation/scaling/translation invariant feature extractor has been employed. However, since the conventional feature extractor is not strictly invariant to most perturbations, certain mathematical modifications have been proposed that have resulted in an excellent performance by the pattern recognizer. The potential of the model has been demonstrated on two problems, namely, prediction of load from the yield patterns of elastoplastic analysis of clamped and simply supported plates and prediction of modes from mode shapes.

AB The purpose of functional verification is to ensure that a design conforms to its specification. However, large written specifications can contain hundreds of statements describing correct operation which an engineer must use to create sets of correctness properties. This laborious manual process increases both verification time and cost. In this work we present GLAsT, a new learning algorithm which accepts a small set of sentences describing correctness properties and corresponding SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs). GLAsT creates a custom formal grammar which captures the writing style and sentence structure of a specification and facilitates the automatic translation of English specification sentences into formal SystemVerilog Assertions. We evaluate GLAsT on English sentences from two ARM AMBA bus protocols. Results show that a translation system using the formal grammar generated by GLAsT automatically generates correctly formed SVAs from the targeted AMBA specification as well as from a second, different AMBA bus specification.

Our APE model is trained entirely on monolingual data that has been round-trip translated through English, to mimic errors that are similar to the ones introduced by NMT. We apply our model to the output of existing NMT systems, and demonstrate that, while the human-judged quality improves in all cases, BLEU scores drop with forward-translated test sets. We verify these results for the WMT18 English -> German, WMT15 English -> French, and WMT16 English -> Romanian tasks. Furthermore, we selectively apply our APE model on the output of the top submissions of the most recent WMT evaluation campaigns. We see quality improvements on all tasks of up to 2.5 BLEU points.

AB The need for cross-lingual information access is more than ever with the easy accessibility to the Internet, especially in vastly multilingual societies like India. Cross-lingual summarization can help minimize human effort needed for achieving publishable articles in multiple languages, while making the most important information available in target language in the form of summaries. We describe a flexible, web-based tool for human editing of cross-lingual summaries to rapidly generate publishable summaries in a number of Indian Languages for news articles originally published in English, and simultaneously collect detailed logs about the process, at both article and sentence level. Similar to translation post-editing logs, such logs can be used to evaluate the automated cross-lingual summaries, in terms of effort needed to make them publishable. The generated summaries along with the logs can be used to train and improve the automatic system over time.

AB The dominant graph-to-sequence transduction models employ graph neural networks for graph representation learning, where the structural information is reflected by the receptive field of neurons. Unlike graph neural networks that restrict the information exchange between immediate neighborhood, we propose a new model, known as Graph Transformer, that uses explicit relation encoding and allows direct communication between two distant nodes. It provides a more efficient way for global graph structure modeling. Experiments on the applications of text generation from Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) and syntax-based neural machine translation show the superiority of our proposed model. Specifically. our model achieves 27.4 BLEU on LDC2015E86 and 29.7 BLEU on LDC2017T10 for AMR-to-text generation, outper-forming the state-of-the-art results by up to 2.2 points. On the syntax-based translation tasks, our model establishes new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU scores, 21.3 for English-to-German and 14.1 for English-to-Czech, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 1 BLEU.

AB As an emerging pedagogy, micro learning aims to make use of people's fragmented spare time and provide personalized online learning service, for example, by pushing fragmented knowledge to specific learners. In the context of big data, the recommender system is the key factor for realizing the online personalization service, which significantly determines what information will be finally accessed by the target learners. In the education discipline, due to the pedagogical requirements and the domain characteristics, ranking recommended learning materials is essential for maintaining the outcome of the massive learning scenario. However, many widely used recommendation strategies in other domains showed defectiveness in the ability to rank the recommended results. In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation strategy based on the combination of the language model and the translation model. The proposed recommendation strategy aims to filter out unsuitable learning materials and ranks the recommended learning materials more effectively.

SO BIOMOLECULES
AB RNA-RNA interaction slowly emerges as a critical component for the smooth functioning of gene expression processes, in particular in translation where the central actor is an RNA powered molecular machine. Overall, ribosome dynamic results from sequential interactions between three main RNA species: ribosomal, transfer and messenger RNA (rRNA, tRNA and mRNA). In recent decades, special attention has been paid to the physical principles governing codon-anticodon pairing, whereas individual RNA positioning mostly relies on ribosomal RNA framework. Here, we provide a brief overview on the actual knowledge of RNA infrastructure throughout the process of translation in mammalian cells: where and how do these physical contacts occur? What are their potential roles and functions? Are they involved in disease development? What will be the main challenges ahead?

SO AEU-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATIONS
AB This article develops a fast online sequential random vector functional network. In this network, input nodes are connected to both hidden nodes and output nodes. This architecture results in high-speed learning and testing. The network estimates the direction of arrival from signals received by the sparse array in real-time. Neither noisy signal nor effect of mutual coupling among array elements affect the estimation appreciably using the network. The network shows competitive performance in terms of learning speed, accuracy, short event regression time, simplicity, and robustness in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods such as support vector regression, extreme learning machine, and online sequential extreme learning machine. Finally, validation of the network translation into a hardware platform using a fast digital high-speed reconfigurable Xilinx Virtex-5 field-programmable gate array embedded processor for single-source detection completes the work. Comparison with reported measurement shows results with good accuracy and low root mean square error both by the network and its hardware-implemented platform. The direction of arrival estimation is thus possible using the network either through a computer or dedicated hardware as per necessity.

AB This paper addresses the problem of detecting and countering potential terrorist threats. It describes a synergistic conjunction of intelligent technologies with a view towards that goal.
   In particular, this paper shows that knowledge acquisition is to be properly viewed as a symbiotic activity of human and machine. The role of the human is to provide the novel or random information and the role of the machine is to reuse it and all of its symmetric derivations. As more and more knowledge is acquired, the number of symmetries that can be related to an arbitrary piece of knowledge necessarily increases. This means that system intelligence, that is, utility, is necessarily a phenomenon of scale given the proposed architecture.
   A natural language front-end interface is described-which is designed to reduce the impedance mismatch between the human and the machine. Most significantly, the effective translation of natural language semantics is shown to critically depend on an accelerated capability for learning. Next, conversational natural language is mapped onto a set of procedures which effect directed mining and linking operations on a relational database. Finally, projected and restricted database views are analyzed by a distinct high-level knowledge base to generate natural language reports. Most importantly, these reports provide the analyst with immediate feedback that serves to catalyze the generation of subsequent queries.

TI LncRNA-ID: Long non-coding RNA IDentification using balanced random
   forests
SO BIOINFORMATICS
AB Motivation: Long non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs), which are non-coding RNAs of length above 200 nucleotides, play important biological functions such as gene expression regulation. To fully reveal the functions of IncRNAs, a fundamental step is to annotate them in various species. However, as IncRNAs tend to encode one or multiple open reading frames, it is not trivial to distinguish these long non-coding transcripts from protein-coding genes in transcriptomic data.
   Results: In this work, we design a new tool that calculates the coding potential of a transcript using a machine learning model (random forest) based on multiple features including sequence characteristics of putative open reading frames, translation scores based on ribosomal coverage, and conservation against characterized protein families. The experimental results show that our tool competes favorably with existing coding potential computation tools in IncRNA identification.

TI A Machine Learning Approach for PLGA Nanoparticles in Antiviral Drug
   Delivery
SO PHARMACEUTICS
AB In recent years, nanoparticles have been highly investigated in the laboratory. However, only a few laboratory discoveries have been translated into clinical practice. These findings in the laboratory are limited by trial-and-error methods to determine the optimum formulation for successful drug delivery. A new paradigm is required to ease the translation of lab discoveries to clinical practice. Due to their previous success in antiviral activity, it is vital to accelerate the discovery of novel drugs to treat and manage viruses. Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence and consists of computer algorithms which are improved through experience. It can generate predictions from data inputs via an algorithm which includes a method built from inputs and outputs. Combining nanotherapeutics and well-established machine-learning algorithms can simplify antiviral-drug development systems by automating the analysis. Other relationships in bio-pharmaceutical networks would eventually aid in reaching a complex goal very easily. From previous laboratory experiments, data can be extracted and input into machine learning algorithms to generate predictions. In this study, poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles were investigated in antiviral drug delivery. Data was extracted from research articles on nanoparticle size, polydispersity index, drug loading capacity and encapsulation efficiency. The Gaussian Process, a form of machine learning algorithm, could be applied to this data to generate graphs with predictions of the datasets. The Gaussian Process is a probabilistic machine learning model which defines a prior over function. The mean and variance of the data can be calculated via matrix multiplications, leading to the formation of prediction graphs-the graphs generated in this study which could be used for the discovery of novel antiviral drugs. The drug load and encapsulation efficiency of a nanoparticle with a specific size can be predicted using these graphs. This could eliminate the trial-and-error discovery method and save laboratory time and ease efficiency.

TI EEG asymmetry detection in patients with severe acquired brain injuries
   via machine learning methods
SO BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL
AB Lateral brain symmetry indexes, detected by electroencephalography (EEG), are markers of rehabilitative recovery widely used in patients with severe acquired brain injury (sABI). In this study, Machine Learning algorithms were cross-validated to detect consistent asymmetries, starting from a completely automated features extraction pipeline in the EEG recordings of 54 patients with sABI, classified by two expert neurophysiologists. Raw data were filtered and segmented in two-seconds non-overlapping epochs. Low data quality in frontal electrodes caused up to 40% of epochs rejection, whilst central and posterior electrodes contributed with the greatest number of artefacts-free epochs. Out of more than 3000 extracted features, similar to 300 significantly differentiated symmetric and asymmetric EEG recordings, most of them extracted from pairs and lines of electrodes. The best performing solution (nested-cross-validated and optimized Support Vector Machine classifier) detected asymmetry with a test accuracy of 85% (sensitivity 92%, specificity 80%). The application of the proposed approach to our sample size supports the generalizability of our model and its translation to clinical practice. The algorithm, heading to automatic EEG analysis, has the potential to speed up analysis of long recordings and, to improve quality of care in settings lacking skilled staff.

AB Video feedback and machine speech recognition are fast-becoming a popular choice for companies to gain insight into their products. In conjunction with this, text analytics can be used to extract insight from these video translations. Currently, there is little work in the area to analyse and compare techniques for natural language processing, information retrieval and information extraction. A commonly practiced technique in text analytics is the extraction of stop words; words whose presence do not contribute context or information to a document. In this paper, we explore statistical techniques for the automated extraction of stop words, comparing 4 datasets from written and translated reviews. Using statistical variations of the successful technique 'term ranking', we evaluate their performance using a common list of stop words. Results suggest that variation, TFnormlDFnorm, was the most successful with a best performing precision rate of 46.7% and a recall rate of 86.6%. The best results were seen in the largest dataset using written reviews, however comparison of the remaining 3 datasets revealed that spoken text performed 0.4% better in precision than the next best dataset and 2.6% better in recall. Initial results show marginally better performance in machine speech recognition transcribed texts from videos in comparison to comparably size datasets of written reviews.

AB JavaFlow, is an extreme multi-core, multi-network DataFlow Machine implementing a Java Virtual Machine aimed at addressing technology roadmap issues with the ability to effectively utilize and manage large numbers of processing cores. Specific design challenges addressed include: design complexity through a common set of repeatable structures; low power and reliability by featuring unused circuits and ability to power off or bypass sections of the chip; and clock propagation and wire limits by using locality to bring data to processing elements.
   A static Data Flow Architecture is used with multiple heterogeneous networks to connect processing elements capable of executing a single Java ByteCode instruction. Whole methods are cached in this DataFlow fabric, and the networks plus distributed intelligence are used for their management and execution. Analysis of SPEC JVM benchmarks demonstrates the potential for this design concept.
   A baseline configuration is defined with a compressed dataflow structure and then compared to multiple configurations of instruction assignments and clock relationships. Using a series of methods from the SPEC benchmark running independently, IPC (Instructions per Cycle) performance of the sparsely populated heterogeneous structure is 40% of the baseline. The average ratio of instructions to required nodes is 3.1. Innovative solutions to the loading and management of Java methods along with the translation from control flow to DataFlow structure are demonstrated.

TI Translation of an esophagus histopathological FT-IR imaging model to a

SO JOURNAL OF BIOPHOTONICS
AB The technical progress in fast quantum cascade laser (QCL) microscopy offers a platform where chemical imaging becomes feasible for clinical diagnostics. QCL systems allow the integration of previously developed FT-IR-based pathology recognition models in a faster workflow. The translation of such models requires a systematic approach, focusing only on the spectral frequencies that carry crucial information for discrimination of pathologic features. In this study, we optimize an FT-IR-based histopathological method for esophageal cancer detection to work with a QCL system. We explore whether the classifier's performance is affected by paraffin presence from tissue blocks compared to removing it chemically. Working with paraffin-embedded samples reduces preprocessing time in the lab and allows samples to be archived after analysis. Moreover, we test, whether the creation of a QCL model requires a preestablished FTIR model or can be optimized using solely QCL measurements.

AB While the majority of exploratory approaches search for correlations among features of different modalities, indirect/nonlinear relations between structure and function have not yet been fully investigated. In this work, we employ a neural machine translation model [ 1] to relate two modalities: structural MRI (sMRI) spatial componnts and functional MRI (fMRI) brain states estimated using a dynamic connectivity model. We consider each of the modalities as different "languages" of the same brain and fit a translation model to estimate a model for how structure influences function. Results identify multiple aligned aspects of brain structure and functional brain states showing significantly more or less alignment in the patient group as well as interesting links to other variables such as cognitive scores and symptom assessments. Our novel approach provides a new perspective on combining brain structure and function by incorporating indirect/nonlinear effects and enabling the algorithm to learn the interplay between structural and the functional networks.

AB In this work, we propose to model the interaction between visual and textual features for multi-modal neural machine translation (MMT) through a latent variable model. This latent variable can be seen as a multi-modal stochastic embedding of an image and its description in a foreign language. It is used in a target-language decoder and also to predict image features. Importantly, our model formulation utilises visual and textual inputs during training but does not require that images be available at test time. We show that our latent variable MMT formulation improves considerably over strong baselines, including a multi-task learning approach (Elliott and Kgdar, 2017) and a conditional variational auto encoder approach (Toyama et al., 2016). Finally, we show improvements due to (i) predicting image features in addition to only conditioning on them, (ii) imposing a constraint on the KL term to promote models with non-negligible mutual information between inputs and latent variable, and (iii) by training on additional target-language image descriptions (i.e. synthetic data).

AB Cross-lingual word vector space alignment is the task of mapping the vocabularies of two languages into a shared semantic space, which can be used for dictionary induction, unsupervised machine translation, and transfer learning. In the unsupervised regime, an initial seed dictionary is learned in the absence of any known correspondences between words, through distribution matching, and the seed dictionary is then used to supervise the induction of the final alignment in what is typically referred to as a (possibly iterative) refinement step. We focus on the first step and compare distribution matching techniques in the context of language pairs for which mixed training stability and evaluation scores have been reported. We show that, surprisingly, when looking at this initial step in isolation, vanilla GANs are superior to more recent methods, both in terms of precision and robustness. The improvements reported by more recent methods thus stem from the refinement techniques, and we show that we can obtain state-of-the-art performance combining vanilla GANs with such refinement techniques.

AB Paraphrases resemble monolingual translations from a source sentence into other sentences that must preserve the original meaning. To build automatic paraphrasing, a collection of paraphrased expressions is required. However, manually collecting paraphrases is expensive and time-consuming. Most existing paraphrases corpora cover only one-to-one parallel sentences and neglect the fact that possible variants of paraphrases can be generated from a single source sentence. The manipulation applied to the original sentences is also difficult to track. Furthermore, a single corpus is mostly dedicated to a single application that is not reusable in other applications. In this research, we construct a paraphrase corpus based on various elementary operations (reordering, substitution, deletion, insertion) in a crowdsourcing platform to generate multi-paraphrase sentences from a source sentence. These elementary paraphrase operations can be utilized for various applications (i.e., deletion for summarization and reordering for machine translation). Our evaluations show the richness and effectiveness of our created corpus.

TI Design, analysis, and experiment of a new parallel manipulator with two
   rotational and one translational motion
SO MECHANISM AND MACHINE THEORY
AB Five-axis hybrid machine tools are important equipment for highly efficient precision machining of complex workpieces, in which a key part is parallel manipulators (PMs) with two rotations and one translation (2R1T). In view of many single-degree-of-freedom (DOF) joints and virtual output rotational axes in most existing 2R1T PMs, a new 2R1T 2PRU-PSR PM with two certain rotational axes is proposed, which is composed of 13 single-DOF joints and only one S joint and is fully actuated with stationary actuators. Using geometric algebra as a mathematical tool, the mobility and kinematic performance evaluation considering the motion/force transmissibility are pre-sented. With the motion/force transmissibility taken as the optimal index, the dimensional pa-rameters of the 2PRU-PSR PM are optimized to obtain an improved transmission workspace without singular configurations. Based on the optimized parameters, stiffness and dynamic an-alyses of the 2PRU-PSR PM are presented in the framework of geometric algebra. The results reveal that the 2PRU-PSR PM exhibits excellent performance in the levels of kinematics, stiffness, and dynamics. Finally, a five-axis hybrid prototype is built based on the optimized 2PRU-PSR PM and two serial guides. Machining experiments show that the 2PRU-PSR PM is suitable as a parallel module for five-axis hybrid machines.

TI Automatic selection of atomic fingerprints and reference configurations
   for machine-learning potentials
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Machine learning of atomic-scale properties is revolutionizing molecular modeling, making it possible to evaluate inter-atomic potentials with first-principles accuracy, at a fraction of the costs. The accuracy, speed, and reliability of machine learning potentials, however, depend strongly on the way atomic configurations are represented, i.e., the choice of descriptors used as input for the machine learning method. The raw Cartesian coordinates are typically transformed in "fingerprints," or "symmetry functions," that are designed to encode, in addition to the structure, important properties of the potential energy surface like its invariances with respect to rotation, translation, and permutation of like atoms. Here we discuss automatic protocols to select a number of fingerprints out of a large pool of candidates, based on the correlations that are intrinsic to the training data. This procedure can greatly simplify the construction of neural network potentials that strike the best balance between accuracy and computational efficiency and has the potential to accelerate by orders of magnitude the evaluation of Gaussian approximation potentials based on the smooth overlap of atomic positions kernel. We present applications to the construction of neural network potentials for water and for an Al-Mg-Si alloy and to the prediction of the formation energies of small organic molecules using Gaussian process regression.

AB Document alignment aims to identify pairs of documents in two distinct languages that are of comparable content or translations of each other. Such aligned data can be used for a variety of NLP tasks from training cross-lingual representations to mining parallel data for machine translation. In this paper we develop an unsupervised scoring function that leverages cross-lingual sentence embeddings to compute the semantic distance between documents in different languages. These semantic distances are then used to guide a document alignment algorithm to properly pair cross-lingual web documents across a variety of low, mid, and high-resource language pairs. Recognizing that our proposed scoring function and other state of the art methods are computationally intractable for long web documents, we utilize a more tractable greedy algorithm that performs comparably. We experimentally demonstrate that our distance metric performs better alignment than current baselines outperforming them by 7% on high-resource language pairs, 15% on mid-resource language pairs, and 22% on low-resource language pairs.

TI A New Family of Symmetrical 2T2R Parallel Mechanisms Without Parasitic
   Motion
SO JOURNAL OF MECHANISMS AND ROBOTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
AB This paper focuses on parallel mechanisms (PMs) that can perform two translations and two rotations (2T2R). Two sufficient conditions for eliminating parasitic motion in 2T2R PMs are presented. A motion expression satisfying those two conditions is identified and several kinematic bonds containing that motion are found. To achieve symmetrical structures, a configurable platform that generates an instantaneous translation motion is presented, to which four limbs having identical structures are connected, leading to the construction of novel 2T2R PMs. Several designs that may have good practical values are identified and form a mechanism family. A typical mechanism is selected with its position model, workspace, singularity thoroughly investigated. Redundant limbs are added to eliminate the singularities, which then ensure the rotational capability. The proposed mechanisms have the advantages of identical limbs, no parasitic motion, and relatively high rotational capability, which can be used in several applications such as in five-axis machine.

TI MCP: A multi-component learning machine to predict protein secondary
   structure
SO COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB The Gene or DNA sequence in every cell does not control genetic properties on its own; Rather, this is done through the translation of DNA into protein and subsequent formation of a certain 3D structure. The biological function of a protein is tightly connected to its specific 3D structure. Prediction of the protein secondary structure is a crucial intermediate step towards elucidating its 3D structure and function. Traditional experimental methods for prediction of protein structure are expensive and time-consuming. Nevertheless, the average accuracy of the suggested solutions has hardly reached beyond 80%. The possible underlying reasons are the ambiguous sequence-structure relation, noise in input protein data, class imbalance, and the high dimensionality of the encoding schemes. Furthermore, we utilize a compound string dissimilarity measure to directly interpret protein sequence content and avoid information loss. In order to improve accuracy, we employ two different classifiers including support vector machine and fuzzy nearest neighbor and collectively aggregate the classification outcomes to infer the final protein structures. We conduct comprehensive experiments to compare our model with the current state-of-the-art approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that given a set of input sequences, our multi-component framework can accurately predict the protein structure. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of our unified model can be further enhanced through framework configuration.

TI Fourier series of atomic radial distribution functions: A molecular
   fingerprint for machine learning models of quantum chemical properties
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY
AB We introduce a fingerprint representation of molecules based on a Fourier series of atomic radial distribution functions. This fingerprint is unique (except for chirality), continuous, and differentiable with respect to atomic coordinates and nuclear charges. It is invariant with respect to translation, rotation, and nuclear permutation, and requires no preconceived knowledge about chemical bonding, topology, or electronic orbitals. As such, it meets many important criteria for a good molecular representation, suggesting its usefulness for machine learning models of molecular properties trained across chemical compound space. To assess the performance of this new descriptor, we have trained machine learning models of molecular enthalpies of atomization for training sets with up to 10 k organic molecules, drawn at random from a published set of 134 k organic molecules with an average atomization enthalpy of over 1770 kcal/mol. We validate the descriptor on all remaining molecules of the 134 k set. For a training set of 10 k molecules, the fingerprint descriptor achieves a mean absolute error of 8.0 kcal/mol. This is slightly worse than the performance attained using the Coulomb matrix, another popular alternative, reaching 6.2 kcal/mol for the same training and test sets. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Classifiers in natural language processing (NLP) often have a large number of output classes. For example, neural language models (LMs) and machine translation (MT) models both predict tokens from a vocabulary of thousands. The Softmax output layer of these models typically receives as input a dense feature representation, which has much lower dimensionality than the output. In theory, the result is some words may be impossible to be predicted via argmax, irrespective of input features, and empirically, there is evidence this happens in small language models (Demeter et al., 2020). In this paper we ask whether it can happen in practical large language models and translation models. To do so, we develop algorithms to detect such unargmaxable tokens in public models. We find that 13 out of 150 models do indeed have such tokens; however, they are very infrequent and unlikely to impact model quality. We release our algorithms and code so that others can test their models.(1)

The purpose of this research, which is based on a questionnaire survey with high school students, is to examine the frequency of usage and the perceptions of online translators by high school students and to analyze their declared practices so as to identify the educational issues raised by these tools for language teachers. The link between the use of online translators and the estimated level of the students will be analyzed. The study shows that these resources are often used for writing tasks for word revision purposes, which could reveal a lack of understanding of the way the tool works. According to the survey, high school students perceive a gap between their practices and their teachers' recommendations. Reflections on the integration of translators into the language course are proposed in conclusion.

In order to obtain the information of translations in both directions, we use right-to-left and left-to-right two models, concatenate two feature vectors as whole quality feature vectors. For the estimator, we use a multi-layer bi-directional GRU to predict HTER scores or OK/BAD labels for different tasks. We pre-train the predictor according to machine translation (MT) method with bilingual data from WMT2019 EN-ZH task, and then jointly train predictor and estimator with the QE task data. We also construct 50K pseudo data in different methods in respond to the data scarcity. The final system integrates multiple single models to generate results.

AB Understanding voluminous historical records provides clues on the past in various aspects, such as social and political issues and even natural science facts. However, it is generally difficult to fully utilize the historical records, since most of the documents are not written in a modern language and part of the contents are damaged over time. As a result, restoring the damaged or unrecognizable parts as well as translating the records into modern languages are crucial tasks. In response, we present a multi-task learning approach to restore and translate historical documents based on a self-attention mechanism, specifically utilizing two Korean historical records, ones of the most voluminous historical records in the world. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves the accuracy of the translation task than baselines without multi-task learning. In addition, we present an in-depth exploratory analysis on our translated results via topic modeling, uncovering several significant historical events.

AB Grammatical error correction (GEC) is a promising natural language processing (NLP) application, whose goal is to change the sentences with grammatical errors into the correct ones. Neural machine translation (NMT) approaches have been widely applied to this translation-like task. However, such methods need a fairly large parallel corpus of error-annotated sentence pairs. which is not easy to get especially in the field of Chinese grammatical error correction. In this paper. we propose a simple yet effective method to improve the NMT-based GEC models by dynamic masking. By adding random masks to the original source sentences dynamically in the training procedure. more diverse instances of error-corrected sentence pairs are generated to enhance the generalization ability of the grammatical error correction model without additional data. The experiments on NLPCC 2018 Task 2 show that our MaskGEC model improves the performance of the neural GEC models. Besides, our single model for Chinese GEC outperforms the current state-of-the-art ensemble system in NLPCC 2018 Task 2 without any extra knowledge.

TI Contact forces in the subacromial space: Effects of scapular orientation
SO JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY
AB The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of scapular orientation on clearance in the subacromial space. Eight glenohumeral joints from fresh-frozen human cadavers were secured to an Instron mechanical testing machine via a custom-made translation table. Forces were applied to simulate rotator cuff and deltoid contraction. Superior translation of the glenohumeral joint was simulated, and the distance before the development of significant subacromial contact force was measured. Specimens were tested at varying orientations of scapular posterior tilting, upward rotation, and external rotation. Results demonstrated no significant effect of posterior tilting and external rotation. Subacromial clearance was found to decrease with an increase in upward rotation, which is contrary to what was expected. These results suggest that changes in upward rotation observed in patients with impingement syndrome may serve to open the subacromial space. Future work needs to focus on confirming these results and determining contact location.

AB Inspired by recent work in machine translation and object detection, we introduce an attention based model that automatically learns to describe the content of images. We describe how we can train this model in a deterministic manner using standard backpropagation techniques and stochastically by maximizing a variational lower bound. We also show through visualization how the model is able to automatically learn to fix its gaze on salient objects while generating the corresponding words in the output sequence. We validate the use of attention with state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets: Flickr9k, Flickr3Ok and MS COCO.

AB In this paper, we focus on various methods for detecting verbal collocations, i.e. verb-particle constructions and light verb constructions in Wikipedia articles. Our results suggest that for verb-particle constructions, POS-tagging and restriction on the particle seem to yield the best result whereas the combination of POS-tagging, syntactic information and restrictions on the nominal and verbal component have the most beneficial effect on identifying light verb constructions. The identification of multiword semantic units can be successfully exploited in several applications in the fields of machine translation or information extraction.

TI How to Best Protect Kidneys for Transplantation-Mechanistic Target
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB The increasing number of patients on the kidney transplant waiting list underlines the need to expand the donor pool and improve kidney graft utilization. By protecting kidney grafts adequately from the initial ischemic and subsequent reperfusion injury occurring during transplantation, both the number and quality of kidney grafts could be improved. The last few years have seen the emergence of many new technologies to abrogate ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, including dynamic organ preservation through machine perfusion and organ reconditioning therapies. Although machine perfusion is gradually making the transition to clinical practice, reconditioning therapies have not yet progressed from the experimental setting, pointing towards a translational gap. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge on the biological processes implicated in I/R injury and explore the strategies and interventions that are being proposed to either prevent I/R injury, treat its deleterious consequences, or support the reparative response of the kidney. Prospects to improve the clinical translation of these therapies are discussed with a particular focus on the need to address multiple aspects of I/R injury to achieve robust and long-lasting protective effects on the kidney graft.

TI Psychiatric Neural Networks and Precision Therapeutics by Machine
   Learning
SO BIOMEDICINES
AB Learning and environmental adaptation increase the likelihood of survival and improve the quality of life. However, it is often difficult to judge optimal behaviors in real life due to highly complex social dynamics and environment. Consequentially, many different brain regions and neuronal circuits are involved in decision-making. Many neurobiological studies on decision-making show that behaviors are chosen through coordination among multiple neural network systems, each implementing a distinct set of computational algorithms. Although these processes are commonly abnormal in neurological and psychiatric disorders, the underlying causes remain incompletely elucidated. Machine learning approaches with multidimensional data sets have the potential to not only pathologically redefine mental illnesses but also better improve therapeutic outcomes than DSM/ICD diagnoses. Furthermore, measurable endophenotypes could allow for early disease detection, prognosis, and optimal treatment regime for individuals. In this review, decision-making in real life and psychiatric disorders and the applications of machine learning in brain imaging studies on psychiatric disorders are summarized, and considerations for the future clinical translation are outlined. This review also aims to introduce clinicians, scientists, and engineers to the opportunities and challenges in bringing artificial intelligence into psychiatric practice.

AB Majority of methods currently used for quality assessment of tissue engineered medical products (TEMPs) are offline and destructive in nature, which is one of the factors impeding the scale up and translation of these technologies. In this study, we investigate quality assessment of TEMP via dielectric impedance spectroscopy (DIS) and supervised machine learning (ML) as a non-destructive alternative that requires minimal human intervention. 3D printed, NaOH-treated polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds seeded with human adipose-derived stem cells (hASC), NIH 3T3, MG63, and human chondrocyte cells were assessed via DIS over 4 days of in vitro culture. The results showed that the cell type and duration in culture had a significant effect on the delta permittivity (Delta epsilon), an important DIS metric. Five supervised ML algorithms - K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifiers, Support Vector Machines, and artificial neural network- were then used to analyze the comprehensive structured permittivity datasets to determine their ability to discern between different cell types and culture durations. The KNN algorithm demonstrated the best accuracy (99%). The outcomes of this study demonstrate the approach of using DIS and supervised ML in conjunction for assessment of TEMPs in an automated manufacturing system. (C) 2021 The Authors.

TI A Fire Detection Algorithm Based on Tchebichef Moment Invariants and
   PSO-SVM
SO ALGORITHMS
AB Automatic fire detection, which can detect and raise the alarm for fire early, is expected to help reduce the loss of life and property as much as possible. Due to its advantages over traditional methods, image processing technology has been applied gradually in fire detection. In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed to achieve fire image detection, combined with Tchebichef (sometimes referred to as Chebyshev) moment invariants (TMIs) and particle swarm optimization-support vector machine (PSO-SVM). According to the correlation between geometric moments and Tchebichef moments, the translation, rotation, and scaling (TRS) invariants of Tchebichef moments are obtained first. Then, the TMIs of candidate images are calculated to construct feature vectors. To gain the best detection performance, a PSO-SVM model is proposed, where the kernel parameter and penalty factor of support vector machine (SVM) are optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO). Then, the PSO-SVM model is utilized to identify the fire images. Compared with algorithms based on Hu moment invariants (HMIs) and Zernike moment invariants (ZMIs), the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the detection accuracy, achieving the highest detection rate of 98.18%. Moreover, it still exhibits the best performance even if the size of the training sample set is small and the images are transformed by TRS.

TI Modeling friction effects in lubricated roller guideways using a
   modified LuGre model
SO JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND CONTROL
AB Guideways accommodate tool or workpiece translations, and their dynamic behavior and associated sliding effects have great impact on the precision, stability, and performance of the machine tool. During machining, guideway rollers experience oscillatory excitations because of cutting forces, which necessitate considering their pre-sliding behavior along with the sliding characteristics to compensate for the associated tracking errors using the position control system. This study considers friction effects in pre-sliding and sliding regimes of lubricated linear roller guideway systems to provide an accurate dynamic model of the machine tool element. To model the dynamic characteristics of frictional contact in the lubricated linear roller guideway, the LuGre model, commonly used in the machine tool positioning control system to estimate the compensating drive force, is modified considering the roller-raceway contact physics and the lubricant film dynamics. The proposed model also includes coupling effects between normal and tangential forces in the contact interface. Experimental studies were performed on a lubricated linear roller guideway to verify the performance of the presented modified LuGre model. In the experimental observations, the dynamic behavior of friction in the lubricated linear guideway is well illustrated. A comparison of the experimentally measured data and proposed modified LuGre model predictions shows the model can accurately predict dynamic behaviors of the frictional contact interface.

TI Reliable Fault Diagnosis of Multiple Induction Motor Defects Using a 2-D
   Representation of Shannon Wavelets
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS
AB This paper proposes an approach for a 2-D representation of Shannon wavelets for highly reliable fault diagnosis of multiple induction motor defects. Since the wavelet transform is efficient for analyzing non-stationary and non-deterministic vibration signals, this paper utilizes wavelet coefficients deduced from the Shannon mother wavelet function with varying dilation and translation parameters to create 2-D gray-level images. Using the resulting images and their associated texture characteristics, this paper extracts features by generating global neighborhood structure maps, which are used to extract global image features. The texture features are then used as inputs in one-against-all multi-class support vector machines to identify faults in the induction machine. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, it is compared with five conventional state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of classification accuracy. In addition, this paper explores the robustness of the proposed approach in noisy environments by adding white Gaussian noise to the acquired vibration signals. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional algorithms in terms of the classification accuracy. Moreover, the proposed approach achieves higher classification accuracy, even in noisy environments.

AB On 11 March 2011 Japan suffered a major earthquake. The resulting tsunami caused great loss of life and devastated many buildings, industries, and information services. Similarly, recent flooding in Thailand resulted in the destruction of property and a disruption of services. Thus, it is prudent for information technology infrastructure and services providers to formulate and implement procedures for rapid disaster recovery of key services that become even more critical during catastrophic events. To aid in our understanding of how academic resource centers can positively respond to such events, we have prototyped, developed and deployed GEO (Global Earth Observation) Grid applications on a distributed infrastructure made up of physical clusters contributed by our international colleagues. On top of these clusters, each site was able to host virtual machines, using their choice of virtualization infrastructure. We were able to realize a secure and transparent Inter-Cloud infrastructure through automated translation of virtual machines (e.g., between different hypervisors) and network virtualization. Cloud interoperation enables sharing of virtual machine images by private and public Clouds, i.e. a virtual machine image could be shared by different VM hosting environments including OpenNebula, Rocks, and Amazon EC2. Insights gained through the preliminary experiments indicated the key issue for Inter-Cloud is how we could use technologies for network virtualization. We used OpenFlow for network virtualization to build a secure (isolated) network for Inter-Cloud.

This method comprises the following stages: (1) extracting strings of characters as units of collocations, and (2) extracting recurrent combinations of strings as collocations. Through this method, various types of domain-specific collocations can be retrieved simultaneously This method is practical because it uses plain text with no specific-language-dependent information, such as lexical knowledge and parts of speech.

AB Diabetic retinopathy may potentially lead to blindness without early detection and treatment. In this research, an approach to automate the identification of the presence of diabetic retinopathy from color fundus images of the retina has been proposed. Classification of an input fundus image into one of the three classes, healthy/normal, Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR) and Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR) has been achieved. Blood vessel segmentation from the input image is achieved by Gaussian filtering. An adaptive, input-driven approach is considered for the mask generation and thresholding is accomplished using local entropy. The processed image obtained is characterized by second order textural feature, contrast, in four different orientations-0 degrees, 45 degrees, 90 degrees and 135 degrees and structural features namely, fractal dimension and lacunarity. The research incorporates a three layered artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM) to classify the retinal images.
   The efficiency of the proposed approach has been evaluated on a set of 106 images from the DRIVE and DIARETB1 databases. The experimental results indicate that this method can produce a 97.2% and 98.1% classification accuracy using ANN and SVM respectively invariant of rotation, translation and scaling in input retinal images as opposed to a fixed mask based on the matched filter method.

The first algorithm, p-exact search, locally prunes the next-token distribution and performs an exact search over the remaining space. The second algorithm, dynamic beam search, shrinks and expands the beam size according to the entropy of the candidate's probability distribution. Despite the probabilistic intuition behind nucleus search, experiments on machine translation and summarization benchmarks show that both algorithms reach the same performance levels as standard beam search.

These experiments show that using an intermediate phonemic representation and training, our system outperforms an alternative normalization system based on phrase-based statistical machine translation techniques.

AB In recent years, research in natural language processing has increasingly focused on normalizing SMS messages. Different well-defined approaches have been proposed, but the problem remains far from being solved: best systems achieve a 11% Word Error Rate. This paper presents a method that shares similarities with both spell checking and machine translation approaches. The normalization part of the system is entirely based on models trained from a corpus. Evaluated in French by 10-fold-cross validation, the system achieves a 9.3% Word Error Rate and a 0.83 BLEU score.

TI When Machines Think: Radiology's Next Frontier
SO RADIOLOGY
AB Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and deep learning are terms now seen frequently, all of which refer to computer algorithms that change as they are exposed to more data. Many of these algorithms are surprisingly good at recognizing objects in images. The combination of large amounts of machine-consumable digital data, increased and cheaper computing power, and increasingly sophisticated statistical models combine to enable machines to find patterns in data in ways that are not only cost-effective but also potentially beyond humans' abilities. Building an AI algorithm can be surprisingly easy. Understanding the associated data structures and statistics, on the other hand, is often difficult and obscure. Converting the algorithm into a sophisticated product that works consistently in broad, general clinical use is complex and incompletely understood. To show how these AI products reduce costs and improve outcomes will require clinical translation and industrial-grade integration into routine workflow. Radiology has the chance to leverage AI to become a center of intelligently aggregated, quantitative, diagnostic information. Centaur radiologists, formed as a synergy of human plus computer, will provide interpretations using data extracted from images by humans and image-analysis computer algorithms, as well as the electronic health record, genomics, and other disparate sources. These interpretations will form the foundation of precision health care, or care customized to an individual patient. (C) RSNA, 2017

AB The use of relational databases is increasingly present in the industry. Applications in medical, IoT and industry 4.0 are examples of this. Despite the large capacity and efficiency in storing and retrieving data, this type of database requires technical knowledge in specific query languages to access this information, which distances these types of application from the lay public. In this work, we propose an application of recent models in natural language processing that use neural networks, as well as attention mechanisms for the translation of natural language in English to SQL applied in an SQL database of a system to store data from sensors, focused on the concept of Industry 4.0. Paired examples of natural language phrases were generated with their corresponding SQL query to be used for training and validation. By training the neural network, we obtained a language model with an accuracy of approximately 99% in the validation set.

AB In this paper, we propose a multi-hop attention for the Transformer. It refines the attention for an output symbol by integrating that of each head, and consists of two hops. The first hop attention is the scaled dot-product attention which is the same attention mechanism used in the original Transformer. The second hop attention is a combination of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) attention and head gate, which efficiently increases the complexity of the model by adding dependencies between heads. We demonstrate that the translation accuracy of the proposed multi-hop attention outperforms the baseline Transformer significantly, +0.85 BLEU point for the IWSLT-2017 German-to-English task and +2.58 BLEU point for the WMT-2017 German-to-English task. We also find that the number of parameters required for a multi-hop attention is smaller than that for stacking another self-attention layer and the proposed model converges significantly faster than the original Transformer.

AB We present a study on reinforcement learning (RL) from human bandit feedback for sequence-to-sequence learning, exemplified by the task of bandit neural machine translation (NMT). We investigate the reliability of human bandit feedback, and analyze the influence of reliability on the learnability of a reward estimator, and the effect of the quality of reward estimates on the overall RL task. Our analysis of cardinal (5-point ratings) and ordinal (pairwise preferences) feedback shows that their intra- and inter-annotator alpha-agreement is comparable. Best reliability is obtained for standardized cardinal feedback, and cardinal feedback is also easiest to learn and generalize from. Finally, improvements of over 1 BLEU can be obtained by integrating a regression-based reward estimator trained on cardinal feedback for 800 translations into RL for NMT. This shows that RL is possible even from small amounts of fairly reliable human feedback, pointing to a great potential for applications at larger scale.

AB Natural language processing systems are often downstream of unreliable inputs: machine translation, optical character recognition, or speech recognition. For instance, virtual assistants can only answer your questions after understanding your speech. We investigate and mitigate the effects of noise from Automatic Speech Recognition systems on two factoid Question Answering (QA) tasks. Integrating confidences into the model and forced decoding of unknown words are empirically shown to improve the accuracy of downstream neural QA systems. We create and train models on a synthetic corpus of over 500,000 noisy sentences and evaluate on two human corpora from Quizbowl and Jeopardy! competitions.

One method first performed search on a Dutch Wikipedia archive, then followed links to corresponding pages in the English Wikipedia. The other method first translated the extracted query using machine translation and then searched the English Wikipedia collection directly. We found that using the original Dutch transcription query for searching the Dutch Wikipedia yielded better results.

TI Nomadic Pict: Programming Languages, Communication Infrastructure
   Overlays, and Semantics for Mobile Computation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS
AB Mobile computation, in which executing computations can move from one physical computing device to another, is a recurring theme: from OS process migration, to language-level mobility, to virtual machine migration. This article reports on the design, implementation, and verification of overlay networks to support reliable communication between migrating computations, in the Nomadic Pict project. We define two levels of abstraction as calculi with precise semantics: a low-level Nomadic pi calculus with migration and location-dependent communication, and a high-level calculus that adds location-independent communication. Implementations of location-independent communication, as overlay networks that track migrations and forward messages, can be expressed as translations of the high-level calculus into the low. We discuss the design space of such overlay network algorithms and define three precisely, as such translations. Based on the calculi, we design and implement the Nomadic Pict distributed programming language, to let such algorithms (and simple applications above them) to be quickly prototyped. We go on to develop the semantic theory of the Nomadic pi calculi, proving correctness of one example overlay network. This requires novel equivalences and congruence results that take migration into account, and reasoning principles for agents that are temporarily immobile (e. g., waiting on a lock elsewhere in the system). The whole stands as a demonstration of the use of principled semantics to address challenging system design problems.

The specification of these steps is done through two domain specific languages. From these specifications, two refinements are generated. Eventually, a distributed code architecture is also generated. The correctness of the process relies on the correctness of the refinements and the translation. We target the distributed BIP framework.

A one-to-one mapping is adopted for dimensionality reduction and then continuous wavelet transform is utilized to construct the nonlinear mapping phi(x) from the input space S to the feature space. So we call it continuous wavelet kernel function (CWKF). This wavelet kernel is not translation invariant kernel, instead inner product kernel and need not parameter selecting. The quadratic program of support vector regression has feasible solution if we use CWKF. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.

TI DZDC12: a new multipurpose parallel Algerian Arabizi-French
   code-switched corpus
SO LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
AB Algeria's socio-linguistic situation is known as a complex phenomenon involving several historical, cultural and technological factors. However, there are three languages that are mainly spoken in Algeria (Arabic, Tamazight and French) and they can be mixed in the same sentence (code-switching). Moreover, there are several varieties of dialects that differ from one region to another and sometimes within the same region. This paper aims to provide a new multi-purpose parallel corpus (i.e., DZDC12 corpus), which will serve as a testbed for various natural language processing and information retrieval applications. In particular, it can be a useful tool to study Arabic-French code-switching phenomenon, Algerian Romanized Arabic (Arabizi), different Algerian sub-dialects, sentiment analysis, gender writing style, machine translation, abuse detection, etc. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed corpus is the first of its kind, where the texts are written in Latin script and crawled from Facebook. More specifically, this corpus is organised by gender, region and city, and is transliterated into Arabic script and translated into Modern Standard Arabic. In addition, it is annotated for emotion detection and abuse detection, and annotated at the word level. This article focuses in particular on Algeria's socio-linguistic situation and the effect of social media networks. Furthermore, the general guidelines for the design of DZDC12 corpus are described as well as the dialects clustering over the map.

In several applications, a restricted class of 2D affine poses with five degrees of freedom consisting of an anisotropic scaling, a rotation, and a translation must be determined from corresponding 2D points. A closed-form least-squares solution for this problem is described. The algorithm can be extended easily to robustly deal with outliers. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we present an ensemble based translator which combines a simple rule and the connectionist translator RECONTRA. One of the problems of RECONTRA is the growing size of the networks as the tasks to be translated increase in size and complexity. A possibility to reduce this problem and increase the results is the use of ensembles. A simple rule (the presence of the symbol '(sic)' in the input sentence) which allows separating the task in two parts that can be approached separately and, during the test phase allows integrating the results is employed.

TI Unsupervised morphing by conjugate image processing
SO ELECTRONICS LETTERS
AB Unsupervised image morphing is a very challenging task in machine learning, whereas it is relatively easy and common for the human brain. Even a simple deformation of an object such as a translation or scaling operation follows a complex curved trace in a high-dimensional image space. The learning of such a complex curved manifold needs human assistance or sufficiently dense intermediate data points. Presented is a novel transformation framework with which a curved manifold describing the deformation of images turns into a simple linear structure in the transformed space. Therefore, image morphing can be achieved by simple linear superposition using the conjugate image representation.

AB RNA silencing pathways convert the sequence information in long RNA, typically double-stranded RNA, into similar to21-nt RNA signaling molecules such as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). siRNAs and miRNAs provide specificity to protein effector complexes that repress mRNA transcription or translation, or catalyze mRNA destruction. Here, we review our current understanding of how small RNAs are produced, how they are loaded into protein complexes, and how they repress gene expression.

TI Ultra-precision 3 DOF tilting stage for workpiece setup of scalable
   micro-pattern machining
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRECISION ENGINEERING AND MANUFACTURING
AB Micro-machining has been widely used for manufacturing of micro molds for flat panel displays. Because the mold has a large area and heavy weight, the workpiece setup system with a high stiffness and ultraprecise positioning control is required to obtain a longterm manufacturing stability and precision. In this study, a novel ultra-precision tilting stage with 3-DOF motions (z-translation, pitch, and roll) has been developed to setup a heavy duty and large area workpiece. The structure is designed to realize a long motion range via an amplified guide mechanism of high stiffness flexure guide and the piezo-electric actuators are integrated to achieve the motion resolution of less than 100 nm. The guide mechanism has a large stiffness with long-term stability through the unique combination of a closed-lying bridge and a half-standing bridge, which can amplify the motion rage double and minimize the overall volume of tilting system. The static, dynamic, and thermal characteristic of the system was optimized by structural analysis using finite element modeling. Finally, the tilting stage provides 50 nm positioning repeatability for a workpiece of 150 kg within a vertical stroke of 160 mu m and a machining area of 400x400 mm(2).

AB Parallel corpora are among the most important linguistic resources used in multilingual language processing such as statistical machine translation, cross-language information retrieval, and so on. Manually constructing such corpora takes a very high cost while there are many available parallel e-books containing a large number of parallel texts. This paper focuses on the task of aligning paragraphs of English-Vietnamese parallel e-books. A new method for this alignment is proposed. By doing an experiment we have collected an English-Vietnamese parallel corpus which contains nearly 40,000 sentence pairs aligned at the paragraph level.

AB We propose a framework to assist Wikipedia editors to transfer information among different languages. Firstly, with the help of some machine translation tools, we analyse the texts in two different language editions of an article and identify information that is only available in one edition. Next, we propose an algorithm to look for the most probable position in the other edition where the new information can be inserted. We show that our method can accurately suggest positions for new information. Our proposal is beneficial to both readers and editors of Wikipedia, and can be easily generalised and applied to other multi-lingual corpora.

AB We present an analysis of the internal mechanism of the recurrent neural model of sentence production presented by Calvillo et al. (2016). The results show clear patterns of computation related to each layer in the network allowing to infer an algorithmic account, where the semantics activates the semantically related words, then each word generated at each time step activates syntactic and semantic constraints on possible continuations, while the recurrence preserves information through time. We propose that such insights could generalize to other models with similar architecture, including some used in computational linguistics for language modeling, machine translation and image caption generation.

AB Although large language models are used in speech recognition and machine translation applications, OCR systems are "far behind" in their use of language models. The reason for this is not the laggardness of the OCR community, but the fact that, at high accuracies, a frequency-based language model can do more damage than good, unless carefully applied. This paper presents an analysis of this discrepancy with the help of the Google Books n-gram Corpus, and concludes that noisy-channel models that closely model the underlying classifier and segmentation errors are required.

TI Synthetic data with neural machine translation for automatic correction
   in arabic grammar
SO EGYPTIAN INFORMATICS JOURNAL
AB The automatic correction of grammar and spelling errors is important for students, second language learners, and some Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as part of speech and text summarization. Recently, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has been an out-performing and well-established model in the task of Grammar Error Correction (GEC). Arabic GEC is still growing because of some challenges, such as scarcity of training sets and the complexity of Arabic language. To overcome these issues, we introduced an unsupervised method to generate large-scale synthetic training data based on confusion function to increase the amount of training set. Furthermore, we introduced a supervised NMT model for AGEC called SCUT AGEC. SCUT AGEC is a convolutional sequence-to-sequence model consisting of nine encoder-decoder layers with attention mechanism. We applied fine-tuning to improve the performance and get more efficient results. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) gives our model ability to joint feature extraction and classification in one task and we proved that it is an efficient way to capture features of the local context. Moreover, it is easy to obtain long-term dependencies because of convolutional layers staking. Our proposed model becomes the first supervised AGEC system based on the convolutional sequence-to-sequence learning to outperforms the current state-of-the-art neural AGEC models.

TI Investigating the Relationship between Classification Quality and SMT
   Performance in Discriminative Reordering Models
SO ENTROPY
AB Reordering is one of the most important factors affecting the quality of the output in statistical machine translation (SMT). A considerable number of approaches that proposed addressing the reordering problem are discriminative reordering models (DRM). The core component of the DRMs is a classifier which tries to predict the correct word order of the sentence. Unfortunately, the relationship between classification quality and ultimate SMT performance has not been investigated to date. Understanding this relationship will allow researchers to select the classifier that results in the best possible MT quality. It might be assumed that there is a monotonic relationship between classification quality and SMT performance, i.e., any improvement in classification performance will be monotonically reflected in overall SMT quality. In this paper, we experimentally show that this assumption does not always hold, i.e., an improvement in classification performance might actually degrade the quality of an SMT system, from the point of view of MT automatic evaluation metrics. However, we show that if the improvement in the classification performance is high enough, we can expect the SMT quality to improve as well. In addition to this, we show that there is a negative relationship between classification accuracy and SMT performance in imbalanced parallel corpora. For these types of corpora, we provide evidence that, for the evaluation of the classifier, macro-averaged metrics such as macro-averaged F-measure are better suited than accuracy, the metric commonly used to date.

AB We propose a novel approach to semantic dependency parsing (SDP) by casting the task as an instance of multi-lingual machine translation, where each semantic representation is a different foreign dialect. To that end, we first generalize syntactic linearization techniques to account for the richer semantic dependency graph structure. Following, we design a neural sequence-to-sequence framework which can effectively recover our graph linearizations, performing almost on-par with previous SDP state-of-the-art while requiring less parallel training annotations. Beyond SDP, our linearization technique opens the door to integration of graph-based semantic representations as features in neural models for downstream applications.

AB In many domains such as speech recognition and machine translation it is extremely useful to be able able to distinguish coherent from non-coherent sentences. We introduce a set of word-based statistical features which measure semantic coherence and can be used to enhance any language application where coherent sentences need to be generated or recognized. We train a decision tree using the constructed feature set to automatically classify sentences as coherent or not. We find that our combination of boosted decision trees and coherence features achieves an accuracy of 80% when distinguishing trigram-generated sentences (non-coherent) from those in the Broadcast News dataset (coherent).

TI OPTICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF A 2ND-ORDER NEURAL NETWORK
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB An optical implementation of a single-layer, second-order neural network is presented. The quadratic products are obtained by passing the optical beam twice through the input ferroelectric liquid-crystal (FLC) spatial light modulator (SLM), with the interconnection weights being implemented by a further two-dimensional 128 x 128 FLC SLM. The machine successfully associates eight randomly chosen pattern-target pairs (dimensions 16 and 4, respectively) and can learn the parity association. Translation invariance is also demonstrated. Results from a computer model indicate that input SLM contrast ratios of 4:1 and electronic noise of 10% of the maximum output can be tolerated.

TI A Portable Sign Language Collection and Translation Platform with Smart
   Watches Using a BLSTM-Based Multi-Feature Framework
SO MICROMACHINES
AB Continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) using different types of sensors to precisely recognize sign language in real time is a very challenging but important research direction in sensor technology. Many previous methods are vision-based, with computationally intensive algorithms to process a large number of image/video frames possibly contaminated with noises, which can result in a large translation delay. On the other hand, gesture-based CSLR relying on hand movement data captured on wearable devices may require less computation resources and translation time. Thus, it is more efficient to provide instant translation during real-world communication. However, the insufficient amount of information provided by the wearable sensors often affect the overall performance of this system. To tackle this issue, we propose a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM)-based multi-feature framework for conducting gesture-based CSLR precisely with two smart watches. In this framework, multiple sets of input features are extracted from the collected gesture data to provide a diverse spectrum of valuable information to the underlying BLSTM model for CSLR. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we test it on an extremely challenging and radically new dataset of Hong Kong sign language (HKSL), in which hand movement data are collected from 6 individual signers for 50 different sentences. The experimental results reveal that the proposed framework attains a much lower word error rate compared with other existing machine learning or deep learning approaches for gesture-based CSLR. Based on this framework, we further propose a portable sign language collection and translation platform, which can simplify the procedure of collecting gesture-based sign language dataset and recognize sign language through smart watch data in real time, in order to break the communication barrier for the sign language users.

TI Automated Recognition of Chemical Molecule Images Based on an Improved
   TNT Model
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The automated recognition of optical chemical structures, with the help of machine learning, could speed up research and development efforts. However, historical sources often have some level of image corruption, which reduces the performance to near zero. To solve this downside, we need a dependable algorithmic program to help chemists to further expand their research. This paper reports the results of research conducted for the Bristol-Myers Squibb-Molecular Translation competition, which was held on Kaggle and which invited participants to convert old chemical images to their underlying chemical structures, annotated as InChI text; we define this work as molecular translation. We proposed a model based on a transformer, which can be utilized in molecular translation. To better capture the details of the chemical structure, the image features we want to extract need to be accurate at the pixel level. TNT is one of the existing transformer models that can meet this requirement. This model was originally used for image classification, and is essentially a transformer-encoder, which cannot be utilized for generation tasks. On the other hand, we believe that TNT cannot integrate the local information of images well, so we improve the core module of TNT-TNT block-and propose a novel module-Deep TNT block-by stacking the module to form an encoder structure, and then use the vanilla transformer-decoder as a decoder, forming a chemical formula generation model based on the encoder-decoder structure. Since molecular translation is an image-captioning task, we named it the Image Captioning Model based on Deep TNT (ICMDT). A comparison with different models shows that our model has benefits in each convergence speed and final description accuracy. We have designed a complete process in the model inference and fusion phase to further enhance the final results.

TI Two-dimensional toothing for bearingless reluctant rotary-linear motors
SO ELEKTROTECHNIK UND INFORMATIONSTECHNIK
AB The bearingless rotary-linear reluctance motor is a novel drive and allows independent magnetic levitation as well as translation and rotation of a ferromagnetic rotor with a single compact actuator. With the simple and robust design, this motor allows a wide range of new applications. For translation with long travel lengths and high utilization of the machine a special two-dimensional toothing of rotor and stator is needed. Different toothing types with the same tooth pitch in stator and rotor were investigated. These can be divided into the two basic types of chessboard toothing and cross toothing. For this, an analysis and a comparison of the attainable force densities for one magnetic pole of the machine were carried out. The chessboard toothing attains significantly higher tangential forces at only slightly less radial force. In contrast to the cross toothing, however, both tangential forces are coupled. A minimization of a target function, which reflects the heat losses in the worst case, was carried out to determine the optimal toothing offsets and to prove controllability. Based on the respective minimum target function values, it was shown that both a chessboard toothed motor and a cross toothed motor with each six pole pairs are controllable. The attainable tangential forces of the chess field toothed motor are significantly higher than those of the cross toothed motor. The radial forces are only slightly lower.

TI Cytoskeletal and Actin-Based Polymerization Motors and Their Role in
   Minimal Cell Design
SO ADVANCED BIOSYSTEMS
AB Life implies motion. In cells, protein-based active molecular machines drive cell locomotion and intracellular transport, control cell shape, segregate genetic material, and split a cell in two parts. Key players among molecular machines driving these various cell functions are the cytoskeleton and motor proteins that convert chemical bound energy into mechanical work. Findings over the last decades in the field of in vitro reconstitutions of cytoskeletal and motor proteins have elucidated mechanistic details of these active protein systems. For example, a complex spatial and temporal interplay between the cytoskeleton and motor proteins is responsible for the translation of chemically bound energy into (directed) movement and force generation, which eventually governs the emergence of complex cellular functions. Understanding these mechanisms and the design principles of the cytoskeleton and motor proteins builds the basis for mimicking fundamental life processes. Here, a brief overview of actin, prokaryotic actin analogs, and motor proteins and their potential role in the design of a minimal cell from the bottom-up is provided.

TI Cross-Predicting Essential Genes between Two Model Eukaryotic Species
   Using Machine Learning
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Experimental studies of Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster have contributed substantially to our understanding of molecular and cellular processes in metazoans at large. Since the publication of their genomes, functional genomic investigations have identified genes that are essential or non-essential for survival in each species. Recently, a range of features linked to gene essentiality have been inferred using a machine learning (ML)-based approach, allowing essentiality predictions within a species. Nevertheless, predictions between species are still elusive. Here, we undertake a comprehensive study using ML to discover and validate features of essential genes common to both C. elegans and D. melanogaster. We demonstrate that the cross-species prediction of gene essentiality is possible using a subset of features linked to nucleotide/protein sequences, protein orthology and subcellular localisation, single-cell RNA-seq, and histone methylation markers. Complementary analyses showed that essential genes are enriched for transcription and translation functions and are preferentially located away from heterochromatin regions of C. elegans and D. melanogaster chromosomes. The present work should enable the cross-prediction of essential genes between model and non-model metazoans.

TI Image classification based on complex wavelet structural similarity
SO SIGNAL PROCESSING-IMAGE COMMUNICATION
AB Complex wavelet structural similarity (CW-SSIM) index has been recognized as a novel image similarity measure of broad potential applications due to its robustness to small geometric distortions such as translation, scaling and rotation of images. Nevertheless, how to make the best use of it in image classification problems has not been deeply investigated. In this paper, we introduce a series of novel image classification algorithms based on CW-SSIM and use handwritten digit recognition, and face recognition as examples for demonstration. Among the proposed approaches, the best compromise between accuracy and complexity is obtained by the CW-SSIM support vector machine based algorithms, which combines an unsupervised clustering method to divide the training images into clusters with representative images and a supervised learning method based on support vector machines to maximize the classification accuracy. Our experiments show that such a conceptually simple image classification method, which does not involve any registration, intensity normalization or sophisticated feature extraction processes, and does not rely on any modeling of the image patterns or distortion processes, achieves competitive performance with reduced computational cost.

TI Prediction of Premature Termination Codon Suppressing Compounds for
   Treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Using Machine Learning
SO MOLECULES
AB A significant percentage of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) cases are caused by premature termination codon (PTC) mutations in the dystrophin gene, leading to the production of a truncated, non-functional dystrophin polypeptide. PTC-suppressing compounds (PTCSC) have been developed in order to restore protein translation by allowing the incorporation of an amino acid in place of a stop codon. However, limitations exist in terms of efficacy and toxicity. To identify new compounds that have PTC-suppressing ability, we selected and clustered existing PTCSC, allowing for the construction of a common pharmacophore model. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models were developed for prediction of new PTCSC based on known compounds. We conducted a search of the NCI compounds database using the pharmacophore-based model and a search of the DrugBank database using pharmacophore-based, ML and DL models. Sixteen drug compounds were selected as a consensus of pharmacophore-based, ML, and DL searches. Our results suggest notable correspondence of the pharmacophore-based, ML, and DL models in prediction of new PTC-suppressing compounds.

AB Dialog act identification plays an important role in understanding conversations. It has been widely applied in many fields such as dialogue systems, automatic machine translation, automatic speech recognition, and especially useful in systems with human-computer natural language dialogue interfaces such as virtual assistants and chatbots. The first step of identifying dialog act is identifying the boundary of the dialog act in utterances. In this paper, we focus on segmenting the utterance according to the dialog act boundaries, i.e. functional segments identification, for Vietnamese utterances. We investigate carefully functional segment identification in two approaches: (1) machine learning approach using maximum entropy (ME) and conditional random fields (CRFs); (2) deep learning approach using bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with a CRF layer (Bi-LSTM-CRF) on two different conversational datasets: (1) Facebook messages (Message data); (2) transcription from phone conversations (Phone data). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies deep learning based approach to dialog act segmentation. As the results show, deep learning approach performs appreciably better as to compare with traditional machine learning approaches. Moreover, it is also the first study that tackles dialog act and functional segment identification for Vietnamese.

TI Accurately Predicting Glutarylation Sites Using Sequential
   Bi-Peptide-Based Evolutionary Features
SO GENES
AB Post Translational Modification (PTM) is defined as the alteration of protein sequence upon interaction with different macromolecules after the translation process. Glutarylation is considered one of the most important PTMs, which is associated with a wide range of cellular functioning, including metabolism, translation, and specified separate subcellular localizations. During the past few years, a wide range of computational approaches has been proposed to predict Glutarylation sites. However, despite all the efforts that have been made so far, the prediction performance of the Glutarylation sites has remained limited. One of the main challenges to tackle this problem is to extract features with significant discriminatory information. To address this issue, we propose a new machine learning method called BiPepGlut using the concept of a bi-peptide-based evolutionary method for feature extraction. To build this model, we also use the Extra-Trees (ET) classifier for the classification purpose, which, to the best of our knowledge, has never been used for this task. Our results demonstrate BiPepGlut is able to significantly outperform previously proposed models to tackle this problem. BiPepGlut achieves 92.0%, 84.8%, 95.6%, 0.82, and 0.88 in accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Matthew's Correlation Coefficient, and F1-score, respectively. BiPepGlut is implemented as a publicly available online predictor.

TI Embedding Projection for Targeted Cross-Lingual Sentiment: Model
   Comparisons and a Real-World Study
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
AB Sentiment analysis benefits from large, hand-annotated resources in order to train and test machine learning models, which are often data hungry. While some languages, e. g., English, have a vast array of these resources, most under-resourced languages do not, especially for fine-grained sentiment tasks, such as aspect-level or targeted sentiment analysis. To improve this situation, we propose a cross-lingual approach to sentiment analysis that is applicable to under-resourced languages and takes into account target-level information. This model incorporates sentiment information into bilingual distributional representations, by jointly optimizing them for semantics and sentiment, showing state-of-the-art performance at sentence-level when combined with machine translation. The adaptation to targeted sentiment analysis on multiple domains shows that our model outperforms other projection-based bilingual embedding methods on binary targeted sentiment tasks. Our analysis on ten languages demonstrates that the amount of unlabeled monolingual data has surprisingly little effect on the sentiment results. As expected, the choice of a annotated source language for projection to a target leads to better results for source-target language pairs which are similar. Therefore, our results suggest that more efforts should be spent on the creation of resources for less similar languages to those which are resource-rich already. Finally, a domain mismatch leads to a decreased performance. This suggests resources in any language should ideally cover varieties of domains.

TI Data processing of high-order aspheric surface measurements using CMM in
   optical fabrication
SO CHINESE OPTICS
AB Surface measurement using a Coordinate Measuring Machine(CMM) is the main method of processing large-aperture high order aspheric mirror fabrication. Because three main types of measurement error exist in original data, the achieved surface residual cannot be directly used in mirror fabrication. Therefore, a series of algorithms for cleaning the errors of CMM point clouds is proposed. Firstly, Probe Radius Compensation (PRC) based on aspherical surface reconstruction is used to compensate for probe radius error in acquired data. Then, the compensation data is processed to remove the rotation and translation errors in the coordinate system. Finally, Surface Residual Denoising(SRD) based on KNN is used to denoise the extracted surface residual data. In the PRC algorithm, a high-precision surface fitting model for probe center points is proposed, which takes rotation and translation errors into consideration. With this model, a correcting vector for each point can be calculated to compensate for the probe radius error. The Simulation experiments show that with PRC algorithm, the precision can reach RMS <4 nm. By densifying the sampling points with spatial interpolation and optimizing the noise characterization, the proposed SRD algorithm can identify the noise points with a high degree of sensitivity, making the denoising intelligent. Software was constructed according to the error cleaning algorithm and its application shows that it can effectively improve the accuracy and efficiency of CMM point cloud processing during aspheric mirror fabrication.

AB We describe a span-level supervised attention loss that improves compositional generalization in semantic parsers. Our approach builds on existing losses that encourage attention maps in neural sequence-to-sequence models to imitate the output of classical word alignment algorithms. Where past work has used word-level alignments, we focus on spans; borrowing ideas from phrase-based machine translation, we align subtrees in semantic parses to spans of input sentences, and encourage neural attention mechanisms to mimic these alignments. This method improves the performance of transformers, RNNs, and structured decoders on three benchmarks of compositional generalization.

AB In this paper, we proposed a method to incorporate syntax-based language models in phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) systems. The language model that we used is based on link grammar, which is a high lexical formalism. In order to apply language models based on link grammar in phrase-based models, we brought out the concept of linked phrases, which is an extension of the concept of traditional phrases in phrase-based models. Experiments were carried out and the results showed that the use of syntax-based language models could improve the performance of the phrase-based models greatly.

AB A large-scale sentence pattern dictionary (SP-dictionary) for Japanese compound and complex sentences has been developed. The dictionary has been compiled based on the non-compositional language model. Sentences with 2 or 3 predicates are extracted from a Japanese-to-English parallel corpus of 1 million sentences, and the compositional constituents contained within them are generalized to produce a SP-dictionary containing a total of 215,000 pattern pairs. In evaluation tests, the SP-dictionary achieved a syntactic coverage of 92% and a semantic coverage of 70%.

TI Computational framework for fusing eye movements and spoken narratives
   for image annotation
SO JOURNAL OF VISION
AB Despite many recent advances in the field of computer vision, there remains a disconnect between how computers process images and how humans understand them. To begin to bridge this gap, we propose a framework that integrates human-elicited gaze and spoken language to label perceptually important regions in an image. Our work relies on the notion that gaze and spoken narratives can jointly model how humans inspect and analyze images. Using an unsupervised bitext alignment algorithm originally developed for machine translation, we create meaningful mappings between participants' eye movements over an image and their spoken descriptions of that image. The resulting multimodal alignments are then used to annotate image regions with linguistic labels. The accuracy of these labels exceeds that of baseline alignments obtained using purely temporal correspondence between fixations and words. We also find differences in system performances when identifying image regions using clustering methods that rely on gaze information rather than image features. The alignments produced by our framework can be used to create a database of low-level image features and high-level semantic annotations corresponding to perceptually important image regions. The framework can potentially be applied to any multimodal data stream and to any visual domain. To this end, we provide the research community with access to the computational framework.

AB Linear weighted extended top-down tree transducers with regular look-ahead and with weights from a semiring are formal models that are used in syntax-based statistical machine translation. The composition hierarchies of some restricted versions of such weighted tree transducers (also without regular look-ahead) are considered. In particular, combinations of the restrictions of epsilon-freeness (all rules consume input), nondeletion, and strictness (all rules produce output) are considered. The composition hierarchy is shown to be finite for all but one epsilon-free variant of these weighted transducers over any commutative semiring.

AB Natural language processing (NLP) is the study of mathematical and computational modeling of various aspects of language and the development of a wide range of systems. These include spoken language systems that integrate speech and natural language; cooperative interfaces to databases and knowledge bases that model aspects of human-human interaction; multilingual interfaces; machine translation; and message-understanding systems, among others. Research in NLP is highly interdisciplinary, involving concepts in computer science, linguistics, logic, and psychology. NLP has a special role in computer science because many aspects of the field deal with linguistic features of computation and NLP seeks to model language computationally.

Recently, the astroparticle physics community successfully adapted supervised learning algorithms for a wide range of tasks including background rejection, object reconstruction, track segmentation and the denoising of signals. Additionally, the first approaches towards fast simulations and simulation refinement indicate the huge potential of unsupervised learning for astroparticle physics. We summarize the latest results, discuss the algorithms and challenges and further illustrate the opportunities for the astrophysics community offered by deep learning based algorithms.

AB Entity Recognition concept came from NER system. In NER name specifics entities are detected from documents like name of city, state, Country, organization, person, location, sport, river, quantity etc. Whereas Entity Recognition detects all the entities presents in a documents to help the improvement of the performance of some high level NLP tasks like Question Answering, Auto Summarization, Machine Translation, Information Retrieval. In this paper our main objective is to perform Entity Recognition in Natural languages CRF. We will use POS tagging and Named entity Recognition with our own tag set to perform this task.

AB Truecasing is the process of restoring case information to badly-cased or noncased text. This paper explores truecasing issues and proposes a statistical, language modeling based truecaser which achieves an daccuracy of similar to 98% on news articles. Task based evaluation shows a 26% F-measure improvement in named entity recognition when using truecasing. In the context of automatic content extraction, mention detection performance on automatic speech recognition text is also improved by a factor of 8. Truecasing also enhances machine translation output legibility and yields a BLEU score improvement of 80.2%. This paper argues for the use of truecasing as a valuable component in text processing applications.

TI Representing Context in FrameNet: A Multidimensional, Multimodal
   Approach
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB Frame Semantics includes context as a central aspect of the theory. Frames themselves can be regarded as a representation of the immediate context against which meaning is to be construed. Moreover, the notion of frame invocation includes context as one possible source of information comprehenders use to construe meaning. As the original implementation of Frame Semantics, Berkeley FrameNet is capable of providing computational representations of some aspects of context, but not all of them. In this article, we present FrameNet Brasil: a framenet enriched with qualia relations and capable of taking other semiotic modes as input data, namely pictures and videos. We claim that such an enriched model is capable of addressing other types of contextual information in a framenet, namely sentence-level cotext and commonsense knowledge. We demonstrate how the FrameNet Brasil software infrastructure addresses contextual information in both database construction and corpora annotation. We present the guidelines for the construction of two multimodal datasets whose annotations represent contextual information and also report on two experiments: (i) the identification of frame-evoking lexical units in sentences and (ii) a methodology for domain adaptation in Neural Machine Translation that leverages frames and qualia for representing sentence-level context. Experimental results emphasize the importance of computationally representing contextual information in a principled structured fashion as opposed to trying to derive it from the manipulation of linguistic form alone.

AB Current question answering (QA) systems usually contain named entity recognizer (NER) as a core component. NER is an important and difficult task in computational linguistics. It plays an important role in natural language processing application such as Question Answering, Machine Translation, and Information Retrieval etc. NER includes the identification and classification of certain proper nouns (like location, organization, person, data, money and others) in a text. The purpose of our study is to recognize and extract the exact Japanese sightseeing domain named entities. It is a basic step for the following processing: question analysis and keyword extraction information retrieval. As well as, through doing the named entity recognition, we consider that it can mine exact information from text document to respond to user. This paper describes how to do the Japanese sightseeing named entity recognition due to we are constructing a Japanese sightseeing question answering system. We adopt the hybrid method which combined with machine learning and.rule-base method. In the experiment of Japanese sightseeing domain named entity recognition we have got excellent precision and recalling rates. It shows that our method is effective and can be used in a practical question answering system.

In this paper we explore the representational power of these models using synthetic grammars designed to exhibit phenomena similar to those found in real transduction problems such as machine translation. These experiments lead us to propose new memory-based recurrent networks that implement continuously differentiable analogues of traditional data structures such as Stacks, Queues, and DeQues. We show that these architectures exhibit superior generalisation performance to Deep RNNs and are often able to learn the underlying generating algorithms in our transduction experiments.

A knuckle image with scale, rotation and translation invariance is isolated from the hand recorded image with digital image processing techniques. The wrinkle of the knuckle images are extracted to a black and white image which is used as biometric feature. A hidden Markov model and a Support Vector Machine are proposed as verifiers. A similar equal error rate of 0.094 is reached by both classifiers with our preliminary database consisting of 8 samples of 20 people hand.

The study investigates the elements of the word-formational system of Esperanto and pays special attention to the combinatorial rules that allow the derivation of the meaning of complex word forms. An elaborate word grammar is presented and those aspects are pointed out which have a cross-linguistic bearing. The limitations of compositionality are discussed, which leads to some insights about the opposition of rule-based versus probabilistic techniques in computational linguistics.

TI "Look at my classifier's result": Disentangling unresponsive from
   (minimally) conscious patients
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Given the fact that clinical bedside examinations can have a high rate of misdiagnosis, machine learning techniques based on neuroimaging and electrophysiological measurements are increasingly being considered for comatose patients and patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, a minimally conscious state or locked-in syndrome. Machine learning techniques have the potential to move from group-level statistical results to personalized predictions in a clinical setting. They have been applied for the purpose of (1) detecting changes in brain activation during functional tasks, equivalent to a behavioral command-following test and (2) estimating signs of consciousness by analyzing measurement data obtained from multiple subjects in resting state. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the literature on both approaches and discuss the translation of present findings to clinical practice. We found that most studies struggle with the difficulty of establishing a reliable behavioral assessment and fluctuations in the patient's levels of arousal. Both these factors affect the training and validation of machine learning methods to a considerable degree. In studies involving more than 50 patients, small to moderate evidence was found for the presence of signs of consciousness or good outcome, where one study even showed strong evidence for good outcome.

AB Named Entity Recognition (NER) is used to classify each word of a document into predefined named entity classes and is important for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as information retrieval, question answering system, machine translation etc. Mising is a Tibeto-Burman language spoken by over 500,000 Mising people who inhabit in Assam. Mising is a resource-constrained language. The corpus for the language was developed by the authors with 50K words as there is hardly any document in the web written in the language. The authors had used 12 tag sets and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for NER in Mising language. As the Mising language uses the Roman script and the named entities are always starts with capital letter in Mising language unlike other Indian languages makes it easier to extract and classify the NER. The authors used 5-fold cross validation test for the SVM based NER system with average Precision, recall and F-Score of 85.14%, 90.58% and 87.77% respectively. As this was the first NER system for the language, the authors did not find other systems to compare with.

AB In this paper we explore the structure and applicability of the Distributed Measurement Calculus (DMC), an assembly language for distributed measurement-based quantum computations. We describe the formal language's syntax and semantics, both operational and denotational, and state several properties that are crucial to the practical usability of our language, such as equivalence of our semantics, as well as compositionality and context-freeness of DMC programs. We show how to put these properties to use by constructing a composite program that implements distributed controlled operations, in the knowledge that the semantics of this program does not change under the various composition operations. Our formal model is the basis of a quantum virtual machine construction for distributed quantum computations, which we elaborate upon in the latter part of this work. This virtual machine embodies the formal semantics of DMC such that programming execution no longer needs to be analysed by hand. Far from a literal translation, it requires a substantial concretisation of the formal model at the level of data structures, naming conventions and abstraction mechanisms. At the same time we provide automatisation techniques for program specification where possible to obtain an expressive and user-friendly programming environment.

TI Mathematical-based microbiome analytics for clinical translation
SO COMPUTATIONAL AND STRUCTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Traditionally, human microbiology has been strongly built on the laboratory focused culture of microbes isolated from human specimens in patients with acute or chronic infection. These approaches primarily view human disease through the lens of a single species and its relevant clinical setting however such approaches fail to account for the surrounding environment and wide microbial diversity that exists in vivo. Given the emergence of next generation sequencing technologies and advancing bioinformatic pipelines, researchers now have unprecedented capabilities to characterise the human microbiome in terms of its taxonomy, function, antibiotic resistance and even bacteriophages. Despite this, an analysis of microbial communities has largely been restricted to ordination, ecological measures, and discriminant taxa analysis. This is predominantly due to a lack of suitable computational tools to facilitate microbiome analytics. In this review, we first evaluate the key concerns related to the inherent structure of microbiome datasets which include its compositionality and batch effects. We describe the available and emerging analytical techniques including integrative analysis, machine learning, microbial association networks, topological data analysis (TDA) and mathematical modelling. We also present how these methods may translate to clinical settings including tools for implementation. Mathematical based analytics for microbiome analysis represents a promising avenue for clinical translation across a range of acute and chronic disease states. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

Such structures can be obtained as results of repeated experiments, e.g., in biology, psychology, medicine, etc. A translation between probabilistic and crisp description logics is introduced and then utilized to reduce the construction of a base of general concept inclusions of a probabilistic interpretation to the crisp case for which a method for the axiomatization of a base of GCIs is well-known.

This paper discusses the derivation of the syntax rules for sentences in Malayalam language. It also discusses the list of hierarchical syntax rules in context free grammar form. A set of part of speech tags and chunk tags were derived for representing the rules in context free grammar notation. The rule set covers the syntax of most of the commonly occurring sentences in Malayalam language.

AB Partial cognates are pairs of words in two languages that have the same meaning in some, but not all contexts. Detecting the actual meaning of a partial cognate in context can be useful for Machine Translation tools and for Computer-Assisted Language Learning tools. In this paper we propose a supervised and a semi-supervised method to disambiguate partial cognates between two languages: French and English. The methods use only automatically-labeled data; therefore they can be applied for other pairs of languages as well. We also show that our methods perform well when using corpora from different domains.

AB Automatic transliteration of foreign names is basically regarded as a diminutive clone of the machine translation (MT) problem. It thus follows IBM's conventional MT models under the source-channel framework. Nonetheless, some parameters of this model dealing with zero-fertility words in the target sequences, can negatively impact transliteration effectiveness because of the inevitable inverted conditional probability estimation. Instead of source-channel, this paper presents a direct probabilistic transliteration model using contextual features of phonemes with a tailored alignment scheme for phoneme chunks. Experiments demonstrate superior performance over the source-channel for the task of English-Chinese transliteration.

These methods employ learning techniques to automatically extract linguistic knowledge from natural language corpora rather than require the system developer to manually encode the requisite knowledge. The current special issue reviews recent research in empirical methods in speech recognition, syntactic parsing, semantic processing, information extraction, and machine translation. This article presents an introduction to the series of specialized articles on these topics and attempts to describe and explain the growing interest in using learning methods to aid the development of natural language processing systems.

TI Using a knowledge translation framework to identify barriers and
   supports to effective nursing handover: A focus group study
SO HELIYON
AB The aims of this study were to systematically assess the barriers and facilitators to evidence-based nursing handover in a clinical environment, and to identify potential adopters and attributes of evidence-based nursing handover for translation into practice. The study was conducted in the medical wards of a major tertiary referral hospital in Brisbane, Australia. Participants comprised registered and enrolled nurses permanently employed in the participating wards for at least three months prior to the commencement of study. Using a qualitative focus group design, a context specific assessment of the barriers and enablers to knowledge translation was performed through five semi-structured focus groups. Focus groups discussions were recorded by a registered court reporter using a stenotype machine for voice to text transcription, transcribed verbatim and de-identified for analysis. Focus group data were analysed using thematic analysis.
   Three themes emerged from the focus group discussions: 1) Content (information transferred); 2) Process (steps used to transfer accountability and responsibility for care); and 3) Environment (factors impacting on safe handover). Participants identified barriers to effective nursing handover including variability of handover content and process, uncertainty around sharing sensitive information, inconsistency around clarifying gaps through questioning during the handover, superficial patient involvement, time constraints and environmental challenges. Key facilitators discussed during the focus groups were the use of integrated electronic medical records, support and clear expectations from the nursing leadership and targeted handover education.
   During the focus group discussions, participants identified several barriers and facilitators to effective handover. These findings will guide the development of research translation strategies to support the implementation of best practice, standardised clinical handover.

TI Assessment of the Craniocaudal Stability of Four Extracapsular
   Stabilization Techniques During Two Cyclic Loading Protocols: A Cadaver
   Study
SO VETERINARY SURGERY
AB ObjectiveTo (1) compare the effect of cyclic loading on craniocaudal tibial translation in cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL)-deficient stifles after extracapsular stabilization, and (2) evaluate the effect of peak force during cyclic loading on the rate of development of craniocaudal laxity.
   Study DesignBiomechanical cadaveric study.
   Sample PopulationCadaveric pelvic limbs (n=24 pairs) from skeletally mature dogs.
   MethodsTwenty-four pairs of stifles were randomly assigned to 4 stabilization groups: nylon leader lateral circumfabellar-tibial suture (NLS); FiberTape lateral circumfabellar-tibial suture (FTLS); TightRope (TR); or bone anchor (BA). Contralateral limbs were cyclically loaded to produce cranial tibial translation at peak forces of either 80 or 160N. Craniocaudal displacement of the tibia was measured with a mechanical testing machine during cyclic loading with the CrCL intact, after CrCL transection, and after extracapsular stabilization. The number of cycles each construct underwent before reaching 200% and 300% of the mean craniocaudal displacement present during cyclic loading of the CrCL-intact stifles was calculated. Number of cycles among treatment groups was compared with a Kruskal-Wallis test. P<.05 was considered significant.
   ResultsMeanSD translation before and after CrCL transection were 3.9 +/- 0.6 and 14.6 +/- 1.7mm, respectively. TR constructs resisted significantly more cycles than NLS constructs before reaching 7.8mm (200%) and 11.7mm (300%) of translation when loaded to 80N. No other differences between constructs were significant at a peak load of 80N. All constructs reached 7.8 and 11.7mm of translation in fewer cycles when loaded to 160N than at 80N.
   ConclusionsTR constructs were most resistant to elongation during cyclic loading. Doubling the peak force during cyclic loading significantly decreased the number of cycles constructs withstood, supporting recommendations for restricting postoperative activity after extracapsular stabilization of the CrCL-deficient stifle.

Captions and subtitles greatly vary in form and content depending on the programs genres and subtitling styles, resulting for instance in significantly different compression rates and lexical content. Borrowing ideas from the multi-domain machine translation literature, we implement and contrast several adaptation methods on a diverse set of programs broadcast on the French public TV. Our results show that such multi-domain adaption techniques are effective and help to improve our automatic subtitling system.

TI Errors in a nonlinear graphic-semantic mapping task resulting from
   lesions in Boltzmann machine: Is it relevant to dyslexia?
SO JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL SOCIETY
AB One of the most fascinating aspects of brain research is the subject of language. As in many other cases, the malfunctions that occur in different persons for various reasons give us insight on the mechanisms that support our ability to talk, read and listen. Following the work of Plaut and associates, we deal with the dyslexia disorder, which is the overall name for a large number of reading disorders. A Boltzmann machine neural network scheme was trained to implement the nonlinear mapping task of graphic representation into semantic representation, which may model the brain sections responsible for the translation of a written word into meanings and syllables, After training, various types of lesions were applied and the performance of the network was tested in order to measure the effect of each lesion on the error rate and type distribution that were detected. The system's errors were classified into several categories and the distribution of errors between the categories was studied. Using the simulations, it is demonstrated that a finite scheduling process in the Boltzmann machine causes the distribution of the network's errors to be unique and different from its expected error distribution. The phenomenon is given a mathematical explanation rooted in the statistical mechanics basics of the Boltzmann machine. Test results suggest the localization of certain reading functions within the network. Comparison is made to relevant types of dyslexia and shows resemblance in major symptoms as well as in certain known side effects.

TI Task-Oriented Evaluation of the Feasible Kinematic Directional
   Capabilities for Robot Machining
SO SENSORS
AB Performing the machining of complex surfaces can be a challenging task for a robot, especially in terms of collaborative robotics, where the available motion capabilities are greatly reduced in comparison with conventional industrial robot arms. It is necessary to evaluate these capabilities prior to task execution, for which we need efficient algorithms, especially in the case of flexible robot applications. To provide accurate and physically consistent information about the maximum kinematic capabilities while considering the requirements of the task, an approach called the Decomposed Twist Feasibility (DTF) method is proposed in this study. The evaluation of the maximum feasible end-effector velocity is based on the idea of decomposition into the linear and angular motion capabilities, considering a typical robot machining task with synchronous linear and angular motion. The proposed DTF method is presented by the well-known manipulability polytope concept. Unlike the existing methods that estimate the kinematic performance capabilities in arbitrarily weighted twist space, or separately in the translation and the rotation subspace, our approach offers an accurate and simple solution for the determination of the total kinematic performance capabilities, which is often highly required, especially in the case of robot machining tasks. The numerical results obtained in this study show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Moreover, the proposed DTF method could represent suitable kinematic performance criteria for the optimal placement of predefined tasks within the robot workspace.

Word2vec tool of Dl4j library is very popular to represent the words in continuous vector space and these vectors capture the syntactic and semantic meaning of corresponding words. If we have a database of sample words with their POS category, it is possible to assign POS tag to the words but it fails when the word is not present in database. Cosine similarity concept plays an important role to find the POS Tags of the words and phrases which are not previously trained or POS Tagged. With the help of Cosine similarity, system assign the appropriate POS tags to the words by finding their nearest similar words using the vectors which we have trained from Word2vec database. Deep neural network like RNN outperforms as compare to traditional state of the art as it deals with the issue of word sense disambiguation. Semi-supervised learning is used to train the network. This approach can be applicable for Indian languages as well as for foreign languages. In this paper, RNN is implemented to build a machine learning system for POS-tagging of the words in English language sentences.

TI A universal predictor-based machine learning model for optimal process
   maps in laser powder bed fusion process
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING
AB The primary bottlenecks faced by the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process is the identification of optimal process parameters to obtain high density (> 99.8%) and a good surface finish (< 10 mu m) in the fabricated components. Prediction of optimal process maps with the help of machine learning (ML) models is still challenging due to extensive training data, which proves to be expensive in additive manufacturing. In view of this, the present study employs six different supervised ML algorithms on a comparatively small data set of 33 experiments to predict relative density and surface roughness. It has been observed that input data (predictor) curation can increase the accuracy of the ML models even with a small data set. In the ML prediction model, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was reduced by 30% (relative density) and 21.94% (surface roughness) with volumetric energy density as an input parameter instead of laser power, scanning speed, hatch space, and layer thickness. The choice of non-dimensional energy input as a universal predictor allows for an increase in training size and the translation capability of trained ML models from one machine/material combination to another. The ML model based on increased training data size (198 for relative density and 173 for surface roughness) procured from the material processed/fabricated on different LPBF machines showcased reasonable R-2 values of 79.11% and 80.3% for relative density and surface roughness, respectively.

AB A Conversational Agent (CA), or dialogue system, is a computer system that has the ability to respond to humans automatically using natural language. CAs offer instant responses and can concurrently assist a potentially unlimited number of users. The modeling of CAs in Arabic has so far received less attention when compared with other languages due to the complexity of the Arabic language, the existence of several dialects, and a lack of data resources. The literature contends that modeling a CA in Arabic mostly done using pattern-matching and information retrieval, employing classification approaches with a closed-domain data source. There is extremely limited research so far on modeling an open-domain CA in the Arabic dialect. This research has utilized a deep-learning architecture, known as the Seq2Seq neural network, to build a CA in the Arabic Gulf dialect. We formulated the CA problem as a machine translation problem and, therefore, built our corpus from tweets, in the post-reply format, to train and evaluate the model. We investigated the effects of pretrained embeddings on the performance of the CA. For our evaluation, a Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score and human evaluators were used. The performance of the model was found to be comparable with existing deep learning models that have been trained on much larger corpora and in other languages. Our results present a promising first step towards building an open-domain CA in the Gulf Arabic dialect.

Specifically, we investigate the attention and feature extraction mechanisms of state-of-the-art recurrent neural networks and self-attentive architectures for sentiment analysis, entailment and machine translation under adversarial attacks. We also propose a novel attack algorithm for generating more natural adversarial examples that could mislead neural models but not humans. Experimental results show that, compared to recurrent neural models, self-attentive models are more robust against adversarial perturbation. In addition, we provide theoretical explanations for their superior robustness to support our claims.

The first step has been a successful translator that works with a subset language (MicroJava) and enables the usage of formal transformations in FermaT to restructure the code from a machine level to human readable high level structures, both automatically and manually. It mostly relies on the existing transformations, but some new ones were introduced in this work, and some old ones were modified.

AB Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNNs) have been widely used for speech recognition, machine translation, scene analysis, etc. Unfortunately, general-purpose processors like CPUs and GPGPUs can not implement LSTM-RNNs efficiently due to the recurrent nature of LSTM-RNNs. FPGA-based accelerators have attracted attention of researchers because of good performance, high energy-efficiency and great flexibility. In this work, we present an FPGA-based accelerator for LSTM-RNNs that optimizes both computation performance and communication requirements. The peak performance of our accelerator achieves 7.26 GFLOP/S, which significantly outperforms previous approaches.

TI The Sequence Memoizer
SO COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM
AB Probabilistic models of sequences play a central role in most machine translation, automated speech recognition, lossless compression, spell-checking, and gene identification applications to name but a few. Unfortunately, real-world sequence data often exhibit long range dependencies which can only be captured by computationally challenging, complex models. Sequence data arising from natural processes also often exhibits power-law properties, yet common sequence models do not capture such properties. The sequence memoizer is a new hierarchical Bayesian model for discrete sequence data that captures long range dependencies and power-law characteristics, while remaining computationally attractive. Its utility as a language model and general purpose lossless compressor is demonstrated.

TI Measurement for the identification of static and quasi-static rotational
   stiffness
SO PRECISION ENGINEERING-JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETIES FOR
   PRECISION ENGINEERING AND NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Machine tool calibration can be employed to optimise tool path trajectories through on- and off-line compensation of anticipated deflections, which result from a process plan, and to assess the machine tools capability to comply with the geometric dimensions and tolerances of a process plan. This work presents a measurement for the identification of static and quasi-static rotational stiffness of a rotational joint of 5-axis machining centres. This work shall serve as a basis towards the calibration of translational as well as rotational stiffness of 5-axis machining centres. The novelty of this work lies partly in the measurement procedure for the quasi-static rotational stiffness, which relies on multiple circular trajectories, as well as in the comparison of the static and quasi-static rotational stiffness of machine tools, which is usually identified using finite element approaches. The measurement procedure for the static rotational stiffness consists of inducing a static load directly, from an overhead factory crane, to a single rotational joint and measuring its deflection with both three LVDTsLinear Variable Differential Transformers (LVDTs) as well as three Non-Contact Capacitive Probes (NCCPs). While the measurement for the quasi-static rotational stiffness induces quasi-static loads indirectly from the Loaded Double Ball Bar, with different magnitudes and radii from the axis of rotation, between the tool centre point and the machine tool table. The quasi-static measurement procedure measures the deflection with both three LVDTs as well as three NCCPs while the spindle tracks circular trajectories inscribed by the movement of the rotary axis. The measurement procedures are implemented in two case studies on 5-axis machining centres with significantly different kinematic configurations to be able to highlight and discuss the limitations of the applicability of the method. The presented method works well for machining centres with symmetric and acceptably with asymmetric structures due to the corresponding symmetry of the deflection field. Finally, the manuscript concludes with a contextualisation of the introduced measurement procedure towards fully calibrated machine tool models, i.e. translation and rotation as well as static and dynamic, which together with customised post-processors and process models, might form the future basis of a stiffness volumetric compensation system.

TI Recreation of the periodic table with an unsupervised machine learning
   algorithm
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In 1869, the first draft of the periodic table was published by Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev. In terms of data science, his achievement can be viewed as a successful example of feature embedding based on human cognition: chemical properties of all known elements at that time were compressed onto the two-dimensional grid system for a tabular display. In this study, we seek to answer the question of whether machine learning can reproduce or recreate the periodic table by using observed physicochemical properties of the elements. To achieve this goal, we developed a periodic table generator (PTG). The PTG is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm based on the generative topographic mapping, which can automate the translation of high-dimensional data into a tabular form with varying layouts on-demand. The PTG autonomously produced various arrangements of chemical symbols, which organized a two-dimensional array such as Mendeleev's periodic table or three-dimensional spiral table according to the underlying periodicity in the given data. We further showed what the PTG learned from the element data and how the element features, such as melting point and electronegativity, are compressed to the lower-dimensional latent spaces.

TI Dual-light control of nanomachines that integrate motor and modulator
   subunits
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB A current challenge in the field of artificial molecular machines is the synthesis and implementation of systems that can produce useful work when fuelled with a constant source of external energy(1-5). The first experimental achievements of this kind consisted of machines with continuous unidirectional rotations(6-14) and translations(15-17) that make use of 'Brownian ratchets'(18-25) to bias random motions. An intrinsic limitation of such designs is that an inversion of directionality requires heavy chemical modifications in the structure of the actuating motor part(26,27). Here we show that by connecting subunits made of both unidirectional light-driven rotary motors and modulators, which respectively braid and unbraid polymer chains in crosslinked networks, it becomes possible to reverse their integrated motion at all scales. The photostationary state of the system can be tuned by modulation of frequencies using two irradiation wavelengths. Under this out-of-equilibrium condition, the global work output (measured as the contraction or expansion of the material) is controlled by the net flux of clockwise and anticlockwise rotations between the motors and the modulators.

TI Joint Spatial-Spectral Feature Space Clustering for Speech Activity
   Detection from ECoG Signals
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Brain-machine interfaces for speech restoration have been extensively studied for more than two decades. The success of such a system will depend in part on selecting the best brain recording sites and signal features corresponding to speech production. The purpose of this study was to detect speech activity automatically from electrocorticographic signals based on joint spatial-frequency clustering of the ECoG feature space. For this study, the ECoG signals were recorded while a subject performed two different syllable repetition tasks. We found that the optimal frequency resolution to detect speech activity from ECoG signals was 8 Hz, achieving 98.8% accuracy by employing support vector machines as a classifier. We also defined the cortical areas that held the most information about the discrimination of speech and nonspeech time intervals. Additionally, the results shed light on the distinct cortical areas associated with the two syllables repetition tasks and may contribute to the development of portable ECoG-based communication.

AB We describe indexes for searching large data sets for variable-length-gapped (VLG) patterns. VLG patterns are composed of two or more subpatterns, between each adjacent pair of which is a gap-constraint specifying upper and lower bounds on the distance allowed between subpatterns. VLG patterns have numerous applications in computational biology (motif search), information retrieval (e.g., for language models, snippet generation, machine translation) and capture a useful subclass of the regular expressions commonly used in practice for searching source code. Our best approach provides search speeds several times faster than prior art across a broad range of patterns and texts.

AB This paper proposes a novel Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) language model that takes advantage of character information. We focus on character n-grams based on research in the field of word embedding construction (Wieting et al. 2016). Our proposed method constructs word embeddings from character n-gram embeddings and combines them with ordinary word embeddings. We demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best perplexities on the language modeling datasets: Penn Treebank, WikiText-2, and WikiText-103. Moreover, we conduct experiments on application tasks: machine translation and headline generation. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method also positively affects these tasks.

Result documents are presented to the user in a contextualised manner. Challenges and affordances of both adaptive and multilingual IR, with a particular focus on digital libraries, are detailed. The framework components are motivated by a series of results from experiments on query logs and documents from The European Library. We conclude that factoring adaptivity and multilinguality aspects into the search process can enhance the user's experience with online digital libraries.

AB In this paper we present a novel log-polar transform based digital image stabilization algorithm to estimate large global transformations among consecutive frames. In our proposed algorithm, multi-resolution log-polar transform techniques in spatial domain are introduced as an initial motion estimation module to estimate arbitrary rotations, arbitrary translations and moderate scale changes. Then, a gradient-based nonlinear least squares optimization module is used to achieve sub-pixel accuracy. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can stabilize 15 frames per second in 320 x 240 image sequences with large interframe motions on a 3.0-GHZ Pentium 4 machine.

TI Automatic plagiarism detection in obfuscated text
SO PATTERN ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Plagiarism is a serious problem in education, research, publishing and other fields. Automatic plagiarism detection systems are crucial for ensuring the integrity and genuineness of intellectual work. There are different types of plagiarism, such as copy-paste, obfuscation and translation. In particular, obfuscated text is one of the hardest types of plagiarism to detect. In this paper, we propose an automatic plagiarism detection system for obfuscated text based on a support vector machine classifier that exploits a set of lexical, syntactic and semantic features. We evaluated the performance of the proposed system on benchmark English and Arabic corpora made available by the PAN Workshop series: PAN 2012, PAN 2013, PAN 2014 and PAN@FIRE2015. We also compared the performance of our system to the performances of other systems that participated in the PAN competitions. The obtained results show that our system had the best performance in terms of the F-measure on the PAN 2012 and on the PAN@FIRE2015 obfuscated sub-corpora, was among the top four on the PAN 2013 corpus and was among the top two on the PAN 2014 corpus.

TI Classifying intracranial stenosis disease severity from functional MRI
   data using machine learning
SO JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM
AB Translation of many non-invasive hemodynamic MRI methods to cerebrovascular disease patients has been hampered by well-known artifacts associated with delayed blood arrival times and reduced microvascular compliance. Using machine learning and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms, we investigated whether arrival time-related artifacts in these methods could be exploited as novel contrast sources to discriminate angiographically confirmed stenotic flow territories. Intracranial steno-occlusive moyamoya patients (n = 53; age = 45 +/- 14.2 years; sex = 43 F) underwent (i) catheter angiography, (ii) anatomical MRI, (iii) cerebral blood flow (CBF)-weighted arterial spin labeling, and (iv) cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR)-weighted hypercapnic blood-oxygenation-level-dependent MRI. Mean, standard deviation (std), and 99th percentile of CBF, CVR, CVRDelay, and CVRMax were calculated in major anterior and posterior flow territories perfused by vessels with vs. without stenosis (>= 70%) confirmed by catheter angiography. These and demographic variables were input into SVMs to evaluate discriminatory capacity for stenotic flow territories using k-fold cross-validation and receiver-operating-characteristic-area-under-the-curve to quantify variable combination relevance. Anterior circulation CBF-std, attributable to heterogeneous endovascular signal and prolonged arterial transit times, was the best performing single variable and CVRDelay-mean and CBF-std, both reflective of delayed vascular compliance, were a high-performing two-variable combination (specificity = 0.67; sensitivity = 0.75). Findings highlight the relevance of hemodynamic imaging and machine learning for identifying cerebrovascular impairment.

TI Cyanobacterial RNA Helicase CrhR Localizes to the Thylakoid Membrane
   Region and Cosediments with Degradosome and Polysome Complexes in
   Synechocystis sp Strain PCC 6803
SO JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY
AB The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 encodes a single DEAD box RNA helicase, CrhR, whose expression is tightly autoregulated in response to cold stress. Subcellular localization and proteomic analysis results indicate that CrhR localizes to both the cytoplasmic and thylakoid membrane regions and cosediments with polysome and RNA degradosome components. Evidence is presented that either functional RNA helicase activity or a C-terminal localization signal was required for polysome but not thylakoid membrane localization. Polysome fractionation and runoff translation analysis results indicate that CrhR associates with actively translating polysomes. The data implicate a role for CrhR in translation or RNA degradation in the thylakoid region related to thylakoid biogenesis or stability, a role that is enhanced at low temperature. Furthermore, CrhR co-sedimentation with polysome and RNA degradosome complexes links alteration of RNA secondary structure with a potential translation-RNA degradation complex in Synechocystis.
   IMPORTANCE
   The interaction between mRNA translation and degradation is a major determinant controlling gene expression. Regulation of RNA function by alteration of secondary structure by RNA helicases performs crucial roles, not only in both of these processes but also in all aspects of RNA metabolism. Here, we provide evidence that the cyanobacterial RNA helicase CrhR localizes to both the cytoplasmic and thylakoid membrane regions and cosediments with actively translating polysomes and RNA degradosome components. These findings link RNA helicase alteration of RNA secondary structure with translation and RNA degradation in prokaryotic systems and contribute to the data supporting the idea of the existence of a macromolecular machine catalyzing these reactions in prokaryotic systems, an association hitherto recognized only in archaea and eukarya.

TI Classification of rotifers with machine vision by shape moment
   invariants
SO AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING
AB An automated system for the identification of rotifers under a microscope with machine vision by shape analysis has been developed, which tends to be substituted for human appraisal. A suitable image recognition algorithm was proposed and the results were discussed in detail. In this study, rotifers were classified into the exact types despite the debris, which appeared from sludge in the degraded water or from rotifer carcasses. Two stages of a discrimination model based on shape analysis were built: one: was to separate debris from rotifers,and the other was to classify rotifers into three groups. A set of shape descriptors, including geometry and moment features, was extracted from the images. The set of shape descriptors had to satisfy the RST (rotation, scaling, and translation) invariance. Shape analysis was proved to be an effective approach since the classification accuracy was approx. 92%. The results from different classification approaches were also compared. The machine vision system with shape analysis and the 2-stage discrimination model had a greater effect on the reduction of manpower requirement for the classification of rotifers.

TI Collocation Extraction Using Web Feedback Data

AB As an important linguistic resource, collocation represents a significant relation between words. Automatic collocation extraction is very important for many natural language processing applications such as machine translation, information extraction, and information retrieval. While traditional collocation extraction approaches are based on linguistic corpus, we propose to acquire collocations from the Web. Three classical lexical association measures (co-occurrence frequency, mutual information and t-test) are used to automatically extract collocation. Based on the experimental results, the benchmarks indicate that superior performance of this new Web-based approach in both high precision and recall.

Inspired by recent research in parameter-efficient transfer learning from pre-trained models, this paper proposes a fusion-based generalisation method that learns to combine domain-specific parameters. We propose a leave-one-domain-out training strategy to avoid information leaking to address the challenge of not knowing the test domain during training time. Empirical results on three language pairs show that our proposed fusion method outperforms other baselines up to +0.8 BLEU score on average.

It has proven effective in a number of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as machine translation. One challenge with this approach is the solving of so-called analogical equations. In this paper, we investigate how structured learning can be used for learning to solve formal analogical equations. We evaluate our learning procedure on several test sets and show that we can improve upon fair baselines.

TI Empowering Data Sharing and Analytics through the Open Data Commons for

SO NEUROTRAUMA REPORTS
AB Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health problem. Despite considerable research deciphering injury pathophysiology, precision therapies remain elusive. Here, we present large-scale data sharing and machine intelligence approaches to leverage TBI complexity. The Open Data Commons for TBI (ODC-TBI) is a community-centered repository emphasizing Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable data sharing and publication with persistent identifiers. Importantly, the ODC-TBI implements data sharing of individual subject data, enabling pooling for high-sample-size, feature-rich data sets for machine learning analytics. We demonstrate pooled ODC-TBI data analyses, starting with descriptive analytics of subject-level data from 11 previously published articles (N = 1250 subjects) representing six distinct pre-clinical TBI models. Second, we perform unsupervised machine learning on multi-cohort data to identify persistent inflammatory patterns across different studies, improving experimental sensitivity for pro- versus anti-inflammation effects. As funders and journals increasingly mandate open data practices, ODC-TBI will create new scientific opportunities for researchers and facilitate multi-data-set, multi-dimensional analytics toward effective translation.

TI Classification of Arabic Tweets: A Review
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Text classification is a prominent research area, gaining more interest in academia, industry and social media. Arabic is one of the world's most famous languages and it had a significant role in science, mathematics and philosophy in Europe in the middle ages. During the Arab Spring, social media, that is, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, played an essential role in establishing, running, and spreading these movements. Arabic Sentiment Analysis (ASA) and Arabic Text Classification (ATC) for these social media tools are hot topics, aiming to obtain valuable Arabic text insights. Although some surveys are available on this topic, the studies and research on Arabic Tweets need to be classified on the basis of machine learning algorithms. Machine learning algorithms and lexicon-based classifications are considered essential tools for text processing. In this paper, a comparison of previous surveys is presented, elaborating the need for a comprehensive study on Arabic Tweets. Research studies are classified according to machine learning algorithms, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, hybrid, and lexicon-based classifications, and their advantages/disadvantages are discussed comprehensively. We pose different challenges and future research directions.

TI Domain adaptation using neural network joint model
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB We explore neural joint models for the task of domain adaptation in machine translation in two ways: (i) we apply state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques, such as mixture modelling and data selection using the recently proposed Neural Network Joint Model (NNJM) (Devlin et al., 2014); (ii) we propose two novel approaches to perform adaptation through instance weighting and weight readjustment in the NNJM framework. In our first approach, we propose a pair of models called Neural Domain Adaptation Models (NDAM) that minimizes the cross entropy by regularizing the loss function with respect to in-domain (and optionally to out-domain) model. In the second approach, we present a set of Neural Fusion Models (NFM) that combines the in- and the out-domain models by readjusting their parameters based on the in-domain data.
   We evaluated our models on the standard task of translating English-to-German and Arabic-to-English TED talks. The NDAM models achieved better perplexities and modest BLEU improvements compared to the baseline NNJM, trained either on in domain or on a concatenation of in- and out-domain data. On the other hand, the NFM models obtained significant improvements of up to +0.9 and +0.7 BLEU points, respectively. We also demonstrate improvements over existing adaptation methods such as instance weighting, phrasetable fill-up, linear and log-linear interpolations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved

TI Dynamic Modeling and Analysis of a 2PRU-UPR Parallel Robot Based on
   Screw Theory
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper proposes the systemic dynamic modeling and analysis of a 2PRU-UPR parallel robot with two rotations and one translation based on screw theory, where P, R and U denote prismatic, revolute and universal joints, respectively. Compared with existing parallel robots having two rotations and one translation, the two actuated prismatic joints of the 2PRU-UPR parallel robot are mounted on a fixed base to reduce the movable mass and improve the dynamic response. First, the inverse kinematics are presented. Next, adopting the screw-based method, the velocity and acceleration of joints and limbs of the 2PRU-UPR parallel robot are analyzed in detail. The actuated forces of the three actuators are then obtained according to the principle of virtual work. Additionally, a numerical simulation is conducted using ADAMS software to investigate the dynamic model of the 2PRU-UPR manipulator and to verify the correctness of the theoretical results. Finally, distributions of the dynamic manipulability ellipsoid index are used to evaluate the dynamic translational and rotational performances of the 2PRU-UPR parallel robot. A prototype based on the dynamic analysis has been fabricated. The dynamic modeling and evaluation provide a basis for the efficient and precise control of the 2PRU-UPR parallel robot in actual machining manipulations. The 2PRU-UPR parallel robot has great potential in machining workpieces with curved surfaces.

AB At the beginning of the new millennium, we proposed the concept of intercultural collaboration where participants with different cultures and languages work together towards shared goals. Because intercultural collaboration is a new area with scarce data, it was necessary to execute parallel experiments in both in real fields as well as in research laboratories. In 2002, we conducted a one-year experiment with Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Malaysian colleagues and students to develop open-source software oriented towards machine translation. From this experiment, we understood the necessity of a language infrastructure on the Internet that could create customized multilingual environments for various situations. In 2006, we launched the Language Grid project to realize a federated operation of servers for language services. Using the Language Grid, we worked with a nongovernmental organization since 2011 to support knowledge communications between agricultural experts in Japan and farmers in Vietnam via their children. We observed that a large community emerged to utilize these nonmature machine translation technologies. During these experiences, by facing different types of difficulties, we gradually came to understand the nature of intercultural collaboration. Problems are wicked and not easily defined because of their nested and open networked origin. Fortunately, multiagent technologies can be applied to model and simulate intercultural collaboration so as to predict the difficulties and to prepare a better support systems. In this paper, we provide a brief history of the research and practice as regards intercultural collaboration and support systems.

TI Image captioning with transformer and knowledge graph
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS
AB The Transformer model has achieved very good results in machine translation tasks. In this paper, we adopt the Transformer model for the image captioning task. To promote the performance of image captioning, we improve the Transformer model from two aspects. First, we augment the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with an extra Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term to distinguish the difference between incorrect predictions. Second, we introduce a method to help the Transformer model generate captions by leveraging the knowledge graph. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

AB The present paper investigates the impact of the anaphoric one words in English on the Neural Machine Translation (NMT) process using English-Hindi as source and target language pair. As expected, the experimental results show that the state-of-the-art Google English-Hindi NMT system achieves significantly poorly on sentences containing anaphoric ones as compared to the sentences containing regular, non-anaphoric ones. But, more importantly, we note that amongst the anaphoric words, the noun class is clearly much harder for NMT than the determinatives. This reaffirms the linguistic disparity of the two phenomenon in recent theoretical syntactic literature, despite the obvious surface similarities.

To overcome the language barriers, we represent words in titles in different languages by using bilingual word embeddings that allow word similarities to be measured across languages. The proposed method can be used to link or integrate databases in different languages. We evaluate our proposed method's effectiveness on the Japanese and English ukiyo-e print databases. We also compare the performance of our method with a method that relies on machine translation.

AB Aligning the representation spaces of two languages to induce a bilingual lexicon achieves attractive results on European language pairs. Unfortunately, current solutions perform terribly on distant language pairs. To address this problem, we analyze existing models for the lexicon induction task of distant language pairs, such as English-Chinese. We propose an framework for the task with improved preprocessing, mapping and inference accordingly. Experimental results show that our proposed approach enhances the accuracy of bilingual lexicons substantially on English-Chinese, as well as some other distant language pairs.

In this study, it is proposed to employ information gain measure in determining the value-ranges of the paraphrase classification features on the renown paraphrase corpus of Microsoft Research (MSRP). The classification performances of value-ranges that are determined by information gain measure and an alternative heuristic method are compared by the use of Bayes classifier. The results show that the proposed method performs better than the heuristic method.

Assigning tags is a very important way to analyze this experiment. However, assigning tags has a cost that is too large for analysts. In this study, we suggest and introduce a method for participants to voluntarily self-tag, focusing on gamification and crowdsourcing. As a result, we verified that it is possible for analysts to reduce the tagging cost when analyzing and to analyze results more accurately.

AB The paper presents an approach to semantic disambiguation in a transfer MT system based on a bilingual dictionary, i.e. the dictionary built from source-target pairs. The approach assumes building a concept ontology for nouns. The ontological concepts are applied as semantic values in lexical rules for verbs, adjectives and prepositions. A set of "semantic accommodation" rules is developed. The set is consulted during the process of semantic disambiguation that follows syntactical parsing. The approach has been applied in a commercial bi-directional Polish-English MT system called Translatica.

AB The radial mass transform (RMT) is defined to produce a rotation and translation invariant vector representation of the neighborhood structure of points. The RMT transforms 3D (or 2D) data sets into a ID signal, where m(p, r) gives the total mass (or intensity) of sensed data at distance r from the point p. A support vector machine can be trained on example signals to detect salient points in an entire image or volume. Results show the method to be effective in multiple applications. The method is computation intensive but highly parallelizable and feasible for high value data sets.

Based on the computational model of communicating extended finite state machines (EFSM) the control flow is separated from dataflow of the SDL process. Hence for the first time it is possible to generate a mired hardware/software implementation of an SDL process. This technique also reduces the complexity for high-level and register-transfer synthesis tools for the hardware parts of the system. The advantage of this methodology ir shown by a design example of a wireless communication chip.

TI A new testing machine to determine the behaviour of aluminium granulate
   under combined pressure and shear
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATERIAL FORMING
AB To reduce the environmental impact and increase the yield from conventional aluminium recycling processes, a direct continuous extrusion method of shredded scrap is being developed. The innovative method is a process where a rotating screw generates the extrusion pressure, introducing rotation to the scrap compacting and extruding in one single operation. The objective of this paper is to present a testing machine, representing the basic mechanisms of the above process in a simplified manner. A rotary anvil-type machine, which is capable of imposing rotational and linear translations, has been built for the purpose of compacting granulate under different pressures, torques and strain rates at different temperatures. This paper describes the developed machine, its features and capabilities in detail. The machine has shown that it is capable of delivering a compressive force of 500 kN while simultaneously delivering a torque of 1.580 Nm on disks made from aluminium granulate. Several tests, with and without rotation, have been carried out where aluminium granulate has been consolidated. The material used was an aluminium alloy AA6060 wire cut in appropriate sizes. The results show how simultaneous rotation and compression reduce the necessary pressure needed for achieving full compactation of the granulate. It is also shown how an increased number of rotations influence the mixing of the granulate to a greater depth. The severe plastic deformation of the granulate is thought to influence the mechanical properties of the resulting compound beneficially.

TI Numerical Simulation of Ambiguity Resolution in Multiple Information
   Streams Based on Network Machine Translation
SO COMPLEXITY
AB In natural language, the phenomenon of polysemy is widespread, which makes it very difficult for machines to process natural language. Word sense disambiguation is a key issue in the field of natural language processing. This paper introduces the more common statistical learning methods used in the field of word sense disambiguation. Using the naive Bayesian machine learning method and the feature vector set extracted and constructed by the Dice coefficient method, a semantic word disambiguation model based on semantics is realized. The results of comparative experiments show that the proposed method is better compared with known systems. This paper proposes a method for disambiguation of word segmentation in professional fields based on unsupervised learning. This method does not rely on professional domain knowledge and training corpus and only uses the frequency, mutual information, and boundary entropy information of the string in the test corpus to solve the problem of word segmentation ambiguity. The experimental results show that these three evaluation standards can solve the problem of word segmentation ambiguity in professional fields and improve the effect of word segmentation. Among them, the segmentation result using mutual information is the best, and the performance is stable.

AB Dataflow computation is a powerful paradigm for parallel computing that is especially attractive on modern machines with multiple avenues for parallelism. However, adopting this model has been challenging as neither hardware-nor language-based approaches have been successful, except, in specialized contexts. We argue that general-purpose array languages, such as matlab, are good candidates for automatic translation to macro dataflow-style execution, where each array operation naturally maps to a macro dataflow operation and the model can be efficiently executed on contemporary multicore architecture. We support our argument with a fully automatic compilation technique to translate matlab programs to dynamic dataflow graphs that are capable of handling unbounded structured control flow. These graphs can be executed on multicore machines in an event driven fashion with the help of a runtime system built on top of Intel's Threading Building Blocks (TBB). By letting each task itself be data parallel, we are able to leverage existing data-parallel libraries and utilize parallelism at multiple levels. Our experiments on a set of benchmarks show speedups of up to 18x using our approach, over the original data-parallel code on a machine with two 16-core processors.

TI Real-Time Sentiment Analysis for Polish Dialog Systems Using MT as Pivot
SO ELECTRONICS
AB We live in a time when dialogue systems are becoming a very popular tool. It is estimated that in 2021 more than 80% of communication with customers on the first line of service will be based on chatbots. They enter not only the retail market but also various other industries, e.g., they are used for medical interviews, information gathering or preliminary assessment and classification of problems. Unfortunately, when these work incorrectly it leads to dissatisfaction. Such systems have the possibility of contacting a human consultant with a special command, but this is not the point. The dialog system should provide a good, uninterrupted and fluid experience and not show that it is an artificial creation. Analysing the sentiment of the entire dialogue in real time can provide a solution to this problem. In our study, we focus on studying the methods of analysing the sentiment of dialogues based on machine learning for the English language and the morphologically complex Polish language, which also represents a language with a small amount of training resources. We analyse the methods directly and use the machine translator as an intermediary, thus checking the quality changes between models based on limited resources and those based on much larger English but machine translated texts. We manage to obtain over 89% accuracy using BERT-based models. We make recommendations in this regard, also taking into account the cost aspect of implementing and maintaining such a system.

AB Assessment of trust and reputation typically relies on prior experiences of a trustee agent, which may not exist, e.g. especially in highly dynamic environments. In these cases stereotypes can be used, where traits of trustees can be used as an indicator of their behaviour during interactions. Communicating observations of traits to witnesses who are unable to observe them is difficult, however, when the traits are interpreted subjectively. In this paper we propose a mechanism for learning translations between such subjective observations, evaluating it in a simulated marketplace.

TI Improved Analysis for Determining Diffusion Coefficients from Short,
   Single-Molecule Trajectories with Photoblinking
SO LANGMUIR
AB Two maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) methods were developed for optimizing the analysis of single-molecule trajectories that include phenomena such as experimental noise, photoblinking, photobleaching, and translation or rotation out of the collection plane. In particular, short, single-molecule trajectories with photoblinking were studied, and our method was compared to existing analytical techniques applied to simulated data. The optimal method for various experimental cases was established, and the optimized MLE method was applied to a real experimental system: single-molecule diffusion of fluorescent molecular machines known as nanocars.

AB The main focus of this paper is to introduce an approach to sentiment classification for documents in different languages. The method is based on language-specific resources available for English. First, documents are translated to English using standard translation software. For polarity detection, sentiment-bearing terms are identified by means of SentiWordNet. Polarity scores calculated for words of three word classes are exploited by a machine learning classifier for determining the document polarity. The introduced method is tested and evaluated on movie reviews in six different languages. The results show that polarity can be correctly determined even if language specific resources are unavailable.

TI Wearable Assistive Robotics: A Perspective on Current Challenges and
   Future Trends
SO SENSORS
AB Wearable assistive robotics is an emerging technology with the potential to assist humans with sensorimotor impairments to perform daily activities. This assistance enables individuals to be physically and socially active, perform activities independently, and recover quality of life. These benefits to society have motivated the study of several robotic approaches, developing systems ranging from rigid to soft robots with single and multimodal sensing, heuristics and machine learning methods, and from manual to autonomous control for assistance of the upper and lower limbs. This type of wearable robotic technology, being in direct contact and interaction with the body, needs to comply with a variety of requirements to make the system and assistance efficient, safe and usable on a daily basis by the individual. This paper presents a brief review of the progress achieved in recent years, the current challenges and trends for the design and deployment of wearable assistive robotics including the clinical and user need, material and sensing technology, machine learning methods for perception and control, adaptability and acceptability, datasets and standards, and translation from lab to the real world.

AB This article is devoted to the rediscovery of a document by Israel Abraham Staffel (1814-1885), a prolific Polish inventor. It is a handwritten book in Russian and Polish that provides detailed information about one of the most famous of Staffel's inventions, a 13-digit arithmometer, honored at the Great London Exhibition in 1851. The brief biography of Staffel, born into a Jewish family of meagre means who became famous in his time as an inventor, and a description of his developments are presented. Particular attention is paid to his mechanical calculating machines. In the Appendix, an English translation of the handwritten book by Staffel appears for the first time. Typical mechanical calculating machines by the end of the nineteenth century were based on Leibniz's stepped drums. Staffel's arithmometer was based on pinwheels. The content of the discovered book allows us to raise the question of the influence of Staffel's invention on the arithmometer's design. The paper, which also clarifies and complements certain facts about his life, activity and inventions, demonstrates the need for further archival research to confirm the currently accepted history of innovation.

TI Machine learning based de-noising of electron back scatter patterns of
   various crystallographic metallic materials fabricated using laser
   directed energy deposition
SO ULTRAMICROSCOPY
AB A novel machine learning (ML) method of refining noisy Electron Back Scatter Patterns (EBSP) is proposed. For this, conditional generative adversarial networks (c-GAN) have been employed. The problem of de-noising the EBSPs was formulated as an image translation task conditioned on the input images to get refined/denoised output of EBSPs which can be indexed using conventional Hough transform based indexing algorithms. The ML model was trained using 10,000 EBSPs acquired under different settings for additively manufactured FCC, BCC and HCP alloy samples ensuring enough diversity and complexity in training data set. Pairs of noisy and cor-responding optimal EBSPs were acquired by suitable tweaking of the EBSP acquisition parameters such as beam defocus, pattern binning and EBSD camera exposure duration. The trained model has brought out significant improvement in EBSD indexing success rate on test data, accompanied by betterment of indexing accuracy, quantified through 'pattern fit'. Complete automation of the EBSP refinement was demonstrated where in entire EBSD scan data can be fed to the model to get the refined EBSPs from which high quality EBSD data can be obtained.

TI Semantic role identification for Malayalam using machine learning
   approaches
SO INNOVATIONS IN SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
AB Determining the semantic role is a key task in deciding the sentence meanings of constituents of a sentence lying behind a facade of variant syntactic expression. Semantics, a field under natural language processing, is concerned with the extraction of meaning from a sentence. Semantic role labeling takes the preliminary steps in extracting meaning from a sentence by giving generic roles or labels to the tokens of the text. The significant issue of semantic role identification is investigated in this study. For the Malayalam language, this paper provides a machine learning methodology for finding semantic roles. Case markers are used to identify semantic roles, which is beneficial for both syntactic and semantic analysis. To identify these relations between nouns and verbs in a sentence, case markers play an important role. This paper discusses the necessity for identifying the semantic roles in a sentence in any machine translation system. This paper proposes a statistical approach for identifying the semantic role of Malayalam sentences using the conditional random field learning algorithm and compares its efficiency with other learning algorithms. The results obtained are very much promising and further enhancements to this can be made in the future.

AB Agile is one of the most widely used software development methodologies that include user stories, the smallest units semi-structured specifications to capture the requirements from a user's point of view. Despite being popular, only a little research has been done to automate the quality checking/analysis of a user story before assigning it to a sprint. In this study, we have chosen two metrics, i.e., Testable and Valuable criteria from INVEST checklist, and have applied supervised machine learning classifiers to automatically classify them. Since the industrial data collected for the research was unbalanced, we also applied data balancing techniques such as SMOTE, RUS, ROS, and Back translation (BT) to verify if they improved any classification metrics. Although we did not see any significant improvements in accuracy and precision for the classifiers after applying data balancing techniques, we noticed a significant improvement in recall values across all the classifiers. Our research provides some promising insights into how this research could be used in the software industry to automate the analysis of user stories and improve the quality of software produced.

TI Ethics in Academic Writing Help for International Students in Higher
   Education: Perceptions of Faculty and Students
SO JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC ETHICS
AB International students often turn to various sources for help, including writing center tutors, friends, faculty mentors, online sources such as Google translate, and proofreading and editorial services, among others. While receiving help from these sources is both understandable and somewhat expected, what type and level of help is appropriate or ethical is not always clearly defined. The current research study investigates perceptions of faculty and international students at one U.S. university as to what is ethical in academic writing help for international students in 17 different scenarios. Findings suggest that students, far more than faculty, lacked certainty and agreement on whether certain help they may receive is ethical. The two groups' views also varied on machine translation and the use of for-pay editors. Faculty, in general, had the least agreement on the use of machine translation and the use of a for-pay editing service for sentence-and discourse-level help and expressed that specific contexts and instructor's expectations should be taken into consideration. Also, perceptions of students from East Asia showed notable differences. We argue that establishing and communicating clear guidelines concerning writing help should be part of any policy of academic integrity and present an "ethicality index" to help begin conversations as each institution, program, or faculty establishes the boundaries of ethical writing help in a specific context.

TI Self-aware cycle curriculum learning for multiple-choice reading
   comprehension
SO PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Multiple-choice reading comprehension task has recently attracted significant interest. The task provides several options for each question and requires the machine to select one of them as the correct answer. Current approaches normally leverage a pre-training and then fine-tuning procedure that treats data equally, ignoring the difficulty of training examples. To solve this issue, curriculum learning (CL) has shown its effectiveness in improving the performance of models. However, previous methods have two problems with curriculum learning. First, most methods are rule-based, not flexible enough, and usually suitable for specific tasks, such as machine translation. Second, these methods arrange data from easy to hard or from hard to easy and overlook the fact that human beings usually learn from easy to difficult, and from difficult to easy when they make comprehension reading tasks. In this article, we propose a novel Self-Aware Cycle Curriculum Learning (SACCL) approach which can evaluate data difficulty from the model's perspective and train the model with cycle training strategy. The experiments show that the proposed approach achieves better performance on the C3 dataset than the baseline, which verifies the effectiveness of SACCL.

TI Clouds, nuptials, nubifications: At the origins of operatic poetics
SO ROMANCE QUARTERLY
AB This essay compares the manifold manifestations of clouds in Francesco Buti's libretto, Le nozze di Peleo e di Teti (1654), the libretto's anonymous French translation, Les nopces de Pelee et de Thetis, and Giacomo Torelli's cloud machines for the Parisian stage. The Latin word for "cloud"-nubes, a cognate of nubere, "to veil," "to marry"-discloses the gendered aspect of clouds and gestures to weddings as privileged occasions for the poetic and artistic presence of clouds. This essay envisions the oscillation between the French and Italian poetics of the libretto and the stage machines as a cross-media process of "operatic nubifications" in which clouds emerge as a powerful, if heretofore less studied, mediating instance not only between these two registers, but also between the male and the female gender. The dual goal of this essay is to investigate the complex tension between the page and the stage as it emerged out of the collaborative work between the librettist and the stage engineer and to disclose, through the cloud, new avenues to rethink the artistic, cultural, and, last but not least, cosmological transformations which took place in the course of the seventeenth-century.

TI Direct Prediction of Phonon Density of States With Euclidean Neural
   Networks
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Machine learning has demonstrated great power in materials design, discovery, and property prediction. However, despite the success of machine learning in predicting discrete properties, challenges remain for continuous property prediction. The challenge is aggravated in crystalline solids due to crystallographic symmetry considerations and data scarcity. Here, the direct prediction of phonon density-of-states (DOS) is demonstrated using only atomic species and positions as input. Euclidean neural networks are applied, which by construction are equivariant to 3D rotations, translations, and inversion and thereby capture full crystal symmetry, and achieve high-quality prediction using a small training set of approximate to 103 examples with over 64 atom types. The predictive model reproduces key features of experimental data and even generalizes to materials with unseen elements, and is naturally suited to efficiently predict alloy systems without additional computational cost. The potential of the network is demonstrated by predicting a broad number of high phononic specific heat capacity materials. The work indicates an efficient approach to explore materials' phonon structure, and can further enable rapid screening for high-performance thermal storage materials and phonon-mediated superconductors.

SO BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
AB A prototype automatic young coconut fruit trimming machine was designed, constructed, tested and evaluated. The mechanism used features a sharp inclined knife which operates in translation motion in a vertical plane to trim the fruit, which is clamped tightly and rotates about a vertical axis. Machine components include a main frame, a body-trimming station, a shoulder-trimming station, a base-cutting station, a rotary base, three fruit holders, an electrical connection slip ring, a power drive and programmable electronic control. In experiments, the untrimmed fruit was continuously fed into three separate fruit holders. These in turn conveyed the coconut through the body-trimming, shoulder-trimming and base-cutting stations. The fruit holders continuously travelled in a circle encompassing every station in sequence. Optimal settings included (a) feeding rate of 86 fruit h(-1), (b) 300 rpm rotation of the trimmed fruit, and (c) a shoulder knife height of 180 mm. Average loss rates were 0.35%, for the fibrous area, 2.5% for fruit damage and 14.5% for the untrimmed green area. The optimally trimmed fruit was accepted by growers and traders. (C) 2008 IAgrE.

AB Kernel updates are a part of daily life in contemporary computer systems. They usually require an OS reboot that involves the restart of not only the kernel but also all of the running applications, causing downtime that can disrupt software services. This downtime issue has been tackled by numerous approaches. Although dynamic translation of the running kernel image, which is the representative approach, can conduct kernel updates at runtime, its applicable updates are inherently limited. This paper describes Dwarf, which shortens downtime during kernel updates and covers more types of updates. Dwarf is designed to reboot the kernel for its updates but make the downtime as short as possible, requiring no preparation of additional machines and shared disks. Dwarf launches the newer kernel in the background on the same physical machine and forces the kernel to inherit the running states of the older kernel. We implemented a prototype of Dwarf on Xen 4.5.0, Linux 4.1.6, and Linux 2.6.39. Also, we conducted experiments using real-world applications, such as MySQL and memcached, and the results demonstrate that Dwarf's downtime is up to 8x shorter than that of the normal OS reboot.

The E2LP (Embedded Engineering Learning Platform) was an FP7 finalized project which focused on Embedded Systems Education at University level. This work covers the integration between the hardware measurement technologies and high-level programming for access and administration of the FMM Remote Lab. The innovative approach incorporates the use of LabVIEW services as a bridge between the physical signals from FMM and an accessible user interface. The use of Moodle open-source learning platform opens the way for translation of the low-level web services into the easily administrated and accessible form. It is possible due to the development of custom software blocks and modules that may be easily adapted to communicate with existing web services. The result of the FMM Remote Lab is an e-learning portal which provides remote real-time control of the measurement processes. Moreover, this project demonstrates the possibility of modernisation of obsolete systems and adaptation to up-to-date standards without the need of interfering in their base structure.

Using KVM, we quantify this impact on applications written in multiple paradigms: message passing, shared memory and partitioned global address spaces. Our analysis shows that on NUMA systems, current memory translation schemes cannot preserve the locality of access and introduce up to 82 percent slowdown. We discuss the interaction between contemporary OS and VM architectures and argue that partitioning is the best solution to enforce memory locality. Current I/O solutions using one assistant task cannot provide the level of I/O parallelism required by scientific applications and we observe an average 7.2x application slowdown on a cluster with 16 cores per node. More specialized solutions that implement shared memory by-pass within the communication stack also do not scale well with cores and we observe an average 2.4x application slowdown. Overall, our results indicate that using partitioning and direct inter-VM shared memory support is enough to provide close to native performance in multicore clusters.

TI Proximal Methods for Plant Stress Detection Using Optical Sensors and
   Machine Learning
SO BIOSENSORS-BASEL
AB Plant stresses have been monitored using the imaging or spectrometry of plant leaves in the visible (red-green-blue or RGB), near-infrared (NIR), infrared (IR), and ultraviolet (UV) wavebands, often augmented by fluorescence imaging or fluorescence spectrometry. Imaging at multiple specific wavelengths (multi-spectral imaging) or across a wide range of wavelengths (hyperspectral imaging) can provide exceptional information on plant stress and subsequent diseases. Digital cameras, thermal cameras, and optical filters have become available at a low cost in recent years, while hyperspectral cameras have become increasingly more compact and portable. Furthermore, smartphone cameras have dramatically improved in quality, making them a viable option for rapid, on-site stress detection. Due to these developments in imaging technology, plant stresses can be monitored more easily using handheld and field-deployable methods. Recent advances in machine learning algorithms have allowed for images and spectra to be analyzed and classified in a fully automated and reproducible manner, without the need for complicated image or spectrum analysis methods. This review will highlight recent advances in portable (including smartphone-based) detection methods for biotic and abiotic stresses, discuss data processing and machine learning techniques that can produce results for stress identification and classification, and suggest future directions towards the successful translation of these methods into practical use.

AB In the last decade, Machine Learning has experienced a dramatic increase in performance on a wide variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, text parsing, and language translation, just to name a few. This has corresponded to an understandable hype especially for the remarkable results achieved in some cases. Therefore, practitioners of Scientific Disciplines have become interested in utilizing new Machine Learning techniques, and have sometimes started doing so with mixed success.
   The purpose of this paper is to describe some of the common Traps, Pitfalls and Misconceptions of Machine Learning as relevant to the Scientific Discipline, and how to avoid them. In fact, Machine Learning and Deep Learning are fast evolving fields, and some of the astonishing results achieved recently sit on small but important details which have become the state of the art. Some of these details are not broadly known by the scientific community. No new scientific result is presented in this paper, which is a survey and a summary of the best of the field, for the benefit of researchers with limited experience.
   It is not the intention of the authors to provide any criticism to the work of experienced practitioners, particularly not to the ones working on the cutting edge of what is currently possible: in these cases expert researchers may well be doing exactly what we recommend here to avoid, and for a good reason. However we believe that the advice provided here will be useful, and perhaps even a reference, for the newcomers of the field.

Grapheme to phoneme conversion based on Moses is compared to two other methods: G2P, and a dictionary look-up method supplemented by a rule-based tool for phonetic transcriptions of words unavailable in the dictionary. Moses gives better results than G2P, and have performance comparable to the dictionary look-up strategy.

AB Recent advances in artificial intelligence and deep learning models are contributing to the development of advanced computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. In the context of medical imaging, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a valuable technique that is able to provide cross-sectional visualisations of the ocular tissue. However, OCT is constrained by a limitation between the quality of the visualisations that it can produce and the overall amount of tissue that can be analysed at once. This limitation leads to a scarcity of high quality data, a problem that is very prevalent when developing machine learning-based CAD systems intended for medical imaging. To mitigate this problem, we present a novel methodology for the unpaired conversion of OCT images acquired with a low quality extensive scanning preset into the visual style of those taken with a high quality intensive scan and vice versa. This is achieved by employing contrastive unpaired translation generative adversarial networks to convert between the visual styles of the different acquisition presets. The results we obtained in the validation experiments show that these synthetic generated images can mirror the visual features of the original ones while preserving the natural tissue texture, effectively increasing the total number of available samples that can be used to train robust machine learning-based CAD systems.

TI Machine Learning for Designing Next-Generation mRNA Therapeutics
SO ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH
AB Over just the last 2 years, mRNA therapeutics and vaccines have undergone a rapid transition from an intriguing concept to real-world impact. However, whereas some aspects of mRNA therapeutics, such as the use of chemical modifications to increase stability and reduce immunogenicity, have been extensively optimized for over two decades, other aspects, particularly the selection and design of the noncoding leader and trailer sequences which control translation efficiency and stability, have received comparably less attention. In practice, such 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) are often borrowed from highly expressed human genes with few or no modifications, as in the case for the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine. Focusing on the S'UTR, we here argue that model-driven design is a promising alternative that provides unprecedented control over S'UTR function. We review recent work that combines synthetic biology with machine learning to build quantitative models that relate ribosome loading, and thus translation efficiency, to the 5'UTR sequence. We first introduce an experimental approach that uses polysome profiling and high-throughput sequencing to quantify ribosome loading for hundreds of thousands of S'UTRs in parallel. We apply this approach to measure ribosome loading in synthetic RNA libraries with a random sequence inserted into the 5'UTR. We then review Optimus 5-Prime, a convolutional neural network model trained on the experimental data. We highlight that very accurate models of biological regulation can be learned from synthetic data sets with degenerate 5'UTRs. We validate model predictions not only on held-out data sets from our random library but also on a large library of over 30 000 human S'UTR fragments and using translation reporter data collected independently by other groups. Both the experiment and model are compatible with commonly used chemically modified nucleosides, in particular, pseudouridine (psi) and 1-methyll-pseudouridine (m(1)psi). We find that, in general, 5 1 UTRs have very similar impacts when combined with different proteincoding sequences and even in the context of different chemical modifications. We demonstrate that Optimus 5-Prime can be combined with design algorithms to generate de novo sequences with precisely defined translation efficiencies. We emphasize recent developments in design algorithms that rely on activation maximization and generative modeling to improve both the fitness and diversity of designed sequences. Compared with prior approaches such as genetic algorithms, we show that these approaches are not only faster but also less likely to get stuck in local sequence optima. Finally, we discuss how the approach reviewed here can be generalized to other gene regions and applications.

TI Affine Transform to Reform Pixel Coordinates of EOG Signals for
   Controlling Robot Manipulators Using Gaze Motions
SO SENSORS
AB Biosignals will play an important role in building communication between machines and humans. One of the types of biosignals that is widely used in neuroscience are electrooculography (EOG) signals. An EOG has a linear relationship with eye movement displacement. Experiments were performed to construct a gaze motion tracking method indicated by robot manipulator movements. Three operators looked at 24 target points displayed on a monitor that was 40 cm in front of them. Two channels (Ch1 and Ch2) produced EOG signals for every single eye movement. These signals were converted to pixel units by using the linear relationship between EOG signals and gaze motion distances. The conversion outcomes were actual pixel locations. An affine transform method is proposed to determine the shift of actual pixels to target pixels. This method consisted of sequences of five geometry processes, which are translation-1, rotation, translation-2, shear and dilatation. The accuracy was approximately 0.86 degrees +/- 0.67 degrees in the horizontal direction and 0.54 degrees +/- 0.34 degrees in the vertical. This system successfully tracked the gaze motions not only in direction, but also in distance. Using this system, three operators could operate a robot manipulator to point at some targets. This result shows that the method is reliable in building communication between humans and machines using EOGs.

AB Machine translation (MT) deals with a large amount of data which represents sentence meanings constructed on the basis of the grammatical rules and the lexical knowledge of the source and target languages. As it is hardly possible to make an automated semantic analysis of the source language data, predominant methods in use have been transfer models such as those of phrase-based statistical MT and pattern-based MT, the main task of which is to replace the source language text with the target language text without understanding them. As it is reported that nearly half the text data consist of unanalyzable multiword like collocations, idioms, and phrasal verbs, it would be inevitable to resort to such a method. At the same time, however, it has been observed that MT output quality suffers to a significant extent when the sentences are not divided into proper segments. This paper proposes a model of the lexicon of verbs whose rich relational information contributes to parsing and understanding sentences. While other existing models of lexicons have no or little consideration for their roles of interaction with processes of syntactic parsing and semantic representation, the proposed model is designed for playing a role as an interface between the two processes in handling sentences with regular usages of verbs as well as idiomatic and metaphoric usages.

TI Development of an End-to-End Deep Learning Framework for Sign Language
   Recognition, Translation, and Video Generation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The recent developments in deep learning techniques evolved to new heights in various domains and applications. The recognition, translation, and video generation of Sign Language (SL) still face huge challenges from the development perspective. Although numerous advancements have been made in earlier approaches, the model performance still lacks recognition accuracy and visual quality. In this paper, we introduce novel approaches for developing the complete framework for handling SL recognition, translation, and production tasks in real-time cases. To achieve higher recognition accuracy, we use the MediaPipe library and a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network + Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (CNN + Bi-LSTM) model for pose details extraction and text generation. On the other hand, the production of sign gesture videos for given spoken sentences is implemented using a hybrid Neural Machine Translation (NMT) + MediaPipe + Dynamic Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model. The proposed model addresses the various complexities present in the existing approaches and achieves above 95% classification accuracy. In addition to that, the model performance is tested in various phases of development, and the evaluation metrics show noticeable improvements in our model. The model has been experimented with using different multilingual benchmark sign corpus and produces greater results in terms of recognition accuracy and visual quality. The proposed model has secured a 38.06 average Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score, remarkable human evaluation scores, 3.46 average Frechet Inception Distance to videos (FID2vid) score, 0.921 average Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) values, 8.4 average Inception Score, 29.73 average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) score, 14.06 average Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score, and an average 0.715 Temporal Consistency Metric (TCM) Score which is evidence of the proposed work.

SO SOFTWARE TESTING VERIFICATION & RELIABILITY
AB The Stream X-Machine (SXM) testing method provides strong and repeatable guarantees of functional correctness, up to a specification. These qualities make the method attractive for software certification, especially in the domain of brokered cloud services, where arbitrage seeks to substitute functionally equivalent services from alternative providers. However, practical obstacles include the difficulty in providing a correct specification, the translation of abstract paths into feasible concrete tests and the large size of generated test suites. We describe a novel SXM verification and testing method, which automatically checks specifications for completeness and determinism, prior to generating complete test suites with full grounding information. Three optimization steps achieve up to a 10-fold reduction in the size of the test suite, removing infeasible and redundant tests. The method is backed by a set of tools to validate and verify the SXM specification, generate technology-agnostic test suites and ground these in SOAP, REST or rich-client service implementations. The method was initially validated using seven specifications, three cloud platforms and five grounding strategies.

AB In this paper, we present a novel method for extracting handwritten and printed text zones from noisy document images with mixed content. We use Triple-Adjacent-Segment (TAS) based features which encode local shape characteristics of text in a consistent manner. We first construct two codebooks of the shape features extracted from a set of handwritten and printed text documents respectively. We then compute the normalized histogram of codewords for each segmented zone and use it to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The codebook based approach is robust to the background noise present in the image and TAS features are invariant to translation, scale and rotation of text. In experiments, we show that a pixel-weighted zone classification accuracy of 98% can be achieved for noisy Arabic documents. Further, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for document page classification and show that a high precision can be achieved for the detection of machine printed documents. The proposed method is robust to the size of zones, which may contain text content at line or paragraph level.

SP IEEE
AB The Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a simplified neural network. It non-linearly embeds input data in a higher dimensional space using randomly generated sigmoidal basis functions. The training target vector is then approximated by a linear weighted sum of these basis functions. In this paper the ELM algorithm has been applied to classify static hand gestures that represent different letters of the Auslan(Australian Sign Language) dictionary. ELM offers very fast learning with very consistent performance. It has only one tuning parameter. It can be adapted to multiclass classification and multi output regression without any increase in training time. Its low computational intensity and short training time makes it superior to traditional algorithms such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Single and Recurrent Feed Forward Neural Networks for real time translations.
   Preliminary experimental results have shown that ELM can produce good generalization performance as a classifier. Increasing the dimensionality of the data results in better separation. Consequently the gestures become more distinguishable improving the probability of correct classification. An investigation into its classification performance for the entire alphabet is currently under way.

TI Systematic Machine Translation of Social Network Data Privacy Policies
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB With the growing popularity of online social networks, one common desire of people is to use of social networking services for establishing social relations with others. The boom of social networking has transformed common users into content (data) contributors. People highly rely on social sites to share their ideas and interests and express opinions. Social network sites store all such activities in a data form and exploit the data for various purposes, e.g., marketing, advertisements, product delivery, product research, and even sentiment analysis, etc. Privacy policies primarily defined in Natural Language (NL) specify storage, usage, and sharing of the user's data and describe authorization, obligation, or denial of specific actions under specific contextual conditions. Although these policies expressed in Natural Language (NL) allow users to read and understand the allowed (or obliged or denied) operations on their data, the described policies cannot undergo automatic control of the actual use of the data by the entities that operate on them. This paper proposes an approach to systematically translate privacy statements related to data from NL into a controlled natural one, i.e., CNL4DSA to improve the machine processing. The methodology discussed in this work is based on a combination of standard Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, logic programming, and ontologies. The proposed technique is demonstrated with a prototype implementation and tested with policy examples. The system is tested with a number of data privacy policies from five different social network service providers. Predominantly, this work primarily takes into account two key aspects: (i) The translation of social networks' data privacy policy and (ii) the effectiveness and efficiency of the developed system. It is concluded that the proposed system can successfully and efficiently translate any common data policy based on an empirical analysis performed of the obtained results.

SO CONCURRENCY-PRACTICE AND EXPERIENCE
CT ACM 1999 Java Grande Conference
CY JUN 12-14, 1999
CL SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA
SP ACM
AB The Java bytecode language lacks expressiveness for traditional compiler optimizations, making this portable, secure software distribution format inefficient as a program representation for high performance. This inefficiency results from the underlying stack model, as well as the fact that many bytecode operations intrinsically include sub-operations (e.g. iaload includes the address computation, array bounds checks and the actual load of the array element), The stack model, with no operand registers and limiting access to the top of the stack, prevents the re-use of values and bytecode re-ordering, In addition, the language has no mechanism to indicate which sub-operations in the Java bytecode stream are redundant or subsumed by previous ones. As a consequence, the Java bytecode language inhibits the expression of important compiler optimizations, including register allocation and instruction scheduling.
   The Java bytecode stream generated by a Java bytecode compiler is a significantly under-optimized program representation, The most common solution to overcome this inefficiency is the use of a just-in-time (JIT) compiler to not only generate native code, but perform optimization as well. However, the latter is a time-consuming operation in an already time-constrained translation process, In this paper we present an alternative to an optimizing JIT compiler that makes use of code annotations generated by a Java bytecode compiler. These annotations carry information concerning compiler optimizations. During the translation process, an annotation-aware Java Virtual Machine (JVM) system then uses this information to produce high-performance native code without performing much of the necessary analyses or transformations. We describe the implementation of a prototype of an annotation-aware JVM consisting of an annotation-aware JIT compilation system. We conclude the paper showing performance results comparing our system with other JVMs running on SPARC architecture. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Discovery of numerous novel small genes in the intergenic regions of the
   Escherichia coli O157:H7 Sakai genome
SO PLOS ONE
AB In the past, short protein-coding genes were often disregarded by genome annotation pipelines. Transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) signals outside of annotated genes have usually been interpreted to indicate either ncRNA or pervasive transcription. Therefore, in addition to the transcriptome, the translatome (RIBOseq) of the enteric pathogen Escherichia coli O157: H7 strain Sakai was determined at two optimal growth conditions and a severe stress condition combining low temperature and high osmotic pressure. All intergenic open reading frames potentially encoding a protein of >= 30 amino acids were investigated with regard to coverage by transcription and translation signals and their translatability expressed by the ribosomal coverage value. This led to discovery of 465 unique, putative novel genes not yet annotated in this E. coli strain, which are evenly distributed over both DNA strands of the genome. For 255 of the novel genes, annotated homologs in other bacteria were found, and a machine-learning algorithm, trained on small protein-coding E. coli genes, predicted that 89% of these translated open reading frames represent bona fide genes. The remaining 210 putative novel genes without annotated homologs were compared to the 255 novel genes with homologs and to 250 short annotated genes of this E. coli strain. All three groups turned out to be similar with respect to their translatability distribution, fractions of differentially regulated genes, secondary structure composition, and the distribution of evolutionary constraint, suggesting that both novel groups represent legitimate genes. However, the machine-learning algorithm only recognized a small fraction of the 210 genes without annotated homologs. It is possible that these genes represent a novel group of genes, which have unusual features dissimilar to the genes of the machine-learning algorithm training set.

TI CD shrinkage profiles of paper - curve fitting and quantitative analysis
SO APPITA JOURNAL
AB An understanding of the dimensional changes of newsprint when printed by lithography is essential to obtain good register on four-colour images on reels taken from all positions across the paper machine web. As paper is dried and stretched in the machine direction (MD) during its manufacture it shrinks in the cross direction (CD). This CD shrinkage is not uniform across the width of the machine and takes the form of a 'U'-shaped CD shrinkage profile. These profiles are important since, when the paper web is printed, it is wetted and expands in the CD to a degree which depends on local shrinkage. There has been a gap in the knowledge of the quantitative CD shrinkage especially at the edges of the paper machine.
   The CD shrinkage profiles of a number of paper machines have been measured by Voith Fabrics (in collaboration with UMIST) using image analysis to detect changes in dimensions of the wire mark. These shrinkage profiles accurately show the shape of the variation but a repeatable method is required to determine parameters from the curves. Accurate values for shrinkage at the edges of the machine are particularly difficult to determine because the gradient is very steep at these points and the estimates obtained by visual inspection are inadequate. In order to determine the required parameters accurately for the different shapes of profile on different machines, it is necessary to fit the experimental points to a model, rather than just use a smooth curve which is pleasing to the eye. This work sets out to determine an appropriate model and to measure (and compare) parameters for a range of newsprint machines. CD shrinkage profiles from three highspeed newsprint machines were each divided into two portions across the paper machine and each half-profile was fitted to various mathematical equations. The best model is a reciprocal function, having three fitted parameters. This model and a negative exponential model explained over 95% of the variation in the data. It was found that, for the three newsprint machines, the CD shrinkage at the edge is constant at around 8%, whereas the CD shrinkage at the centre and the gradient of CD shrinkage at the edge depends on the details of the dryer section.
   The techniques of dividing the profile into two halves, bilinear translation and using non-linear curve fitting with three-and four-parameter functions can be applied to CD profiles of many other paper and machine properties. Examples are given of reciprocal function fits with three parameters to CD profiles of headbox slice lip opening and CD tensile stiffness where over 97% of the variation is explained.

TI Biophysical Properties of Escherichia coli Cytoplasm in Stationary Phase
   by Superresolution Fluorescence Microscopy
SO MBIO
AB In nature, bacteria must survive long periods of nutrient deprivation while maintaining the ability to recover and grow when conditions improve. This quiescent state is called stationary phase. The biochemistry of Escherichia coil in stationary phase is reasonably well understood. Much less is known about the biophysical state of the cytoplasm. Earlier studies of harvested nucleoids concluded that the stationary-phase nucleoid is "compacted" or "supercompacted," and there are suggestions that the cytoplasm is "glass-like." Nevertheless, stationary-phase bacteria support active transcription and translation. Here, we present results of a quantitative superresolution fluorescence study comparing the spatial distributions and diffusive properties of key components of the transcription-translation machinery in intact E. coli cells that were either maintained in 2-day stationary phase or undergoing moderately fast exponential growth. Stationary-phase cells are shorter and exhibit strong heterogeneity in cell length, nucleoid volume, and biopolymer diffusive properties. As in exponential growth, the nucleoid and ribosomes are strongly segregated. The chromosomal DNA is locally more rigid in stationary phase. The population-weighted average of diffusion coefficients estimated from mean-square displacement plots is 2-fold higher in stationary phase for both RNA polymerase (RNAP) and ribosomal species. The average DNA density is roughly twice as high as that in cells undergoing slow exponential growth. The data indicate that the stationary-phase nucleoid is permeable to RNAP and suggest that it is permeable to ribosomal subunits. There appears to be no need to postulate migration of actively transcribed genes to the nucleoid periphery.
   IMPORTANCE Bacteria in nature usually lack sufficient nutrients to enable growth and replication. Such starved bacteria adapt into a quiescent state known as the stationary phase. The chromosomal DNA is protected against oxidative damage, and ribosomes are stored in a dimeric structure impervious to digestion. Stationary-phase bacteria can recover and grow quickly when better nutrient conditions arise. The biochemistry of stationary-phase E. coli is reasonably well understood. Here, we present results from a study of the biophysical state of starved E. coli. Superresolution fluorescence microscopy enables high-resolution location and tracking of a DNA locus and of single copies of RNA polymerase (the transcription machine) and ribosomes (the translation machine) in intact E. coli cells maintained in stationary phase. Evidently, the chromosomal DNA remains sufficiently permeable to enable transcription and translation to occur. This description contrasts with the usual picture of a rigid stationary-phase cytoplasm with highly condensed DNA.

TI AAPM task group report 273: Recommendations on best practices for AI and
   machine learning for computer-aided diagnosis in medical imaging
SO MEDICAL PHYSICS
AB Rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, and specifically in deep learning (DL) techniques, have enabled broad application of these methods in health care. The promise of the DL approach has spurred further interest in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) development and applications using both "traditional " machine learning methods and newer DL-based methods. We use the term CAD-AI to refer to this expanded clinical decision support environment that uses traditional and DL-based AI methods.Numerous studies have been published to date on the development of machine learning tools for computer-aided, or AI-assisted, clinical tasks. However, most of these machine learning models are not ready for clinical deployment. It is of paramount importance to ensure that a clinical decision support tool undergoes proper training and rigorous validation of its generalizability and robustness before adoption for patient care in the clinic.To address these important issues, the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Computer-Aided Image Analysis Subcommittee (CADSC) is charged, in part, to develop recommendations on practices and standards for the development and performance assessment of computer-aided decision support systems. The committee has previously published two opinion papers on the evaluation of CAD systems and issues associated with user training and quality assurance of these systems in the clinic. With machine learning techniques continuing to evolve and CAD applications expanding to new stages of the patient care process, the current task group report considers the broader issues common to the development of most, if not all, CAD-AI applications and their translation from the bench to the clinic. The goal is to bring attention to the proper training and validation of machine learning algorithms that may improve their generalizability and reliability and accelerate the adoption of CAD-AI systems for clinical decision support.

TI Structure-semantics interplay in complex networks and its effects on the
   predictability of similarity in texts
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB The classification of texts has become a major endeavor with so much electronic material available, for it is an essential task in several applications, including search engines and information retrieval. There are different ways to define similarity for grouping similar texts into clusters, as the concept of similarity may depend on the purpose of the task. For instance, in topic extraction similar texts mean those within the same semantic field, whereas in author recognition stylistic features should be considered. In this study, we introduce ways to classify texts employing concepts of complex networks, which may be able to capture syntactic, semantic and even pragmatic features. The interplay between various metrics of the complex networks is analyzed with three applications, namely identification of machine translation (MT) systems, evaluation of quality of machine translated texts and authorship recognition. We shall show that topological features of the networks representing texts can enhance the ability to identify MT systems in particular cases. For evaluating the quality of MT texts, on the other hand, high correlation was obtained with methods capable of capturing the semantics. This was expected because the golden standards used are themselves based on word co-occurrence. Notwithstanding, the Katz similarity, which involves semantic and structure in the comparison of texts, achieved the highest correlation with the NIST measurement, indicating that in some cases the combination of both approaches can improve the ability to quantify quality in MT. In authorship recognition, again the topological features were relevant in some contexts, though for the books and authors analyzed good results were obtained with semantic features as well. Because hybrid approaches encompassing semantic and topological features have not been extensively used, we believe that the methodology proposed here may be useful to enhance text classification considerably, as it combines well-established strategies.

TI Development of HPPMS-Al2O3-coatings for the machining of hard-to-machine
   materials
SO MATERIALWISSENSCHAFT UND WERKSTOFFTECHNIK
AB Translation abstract Die Beschichtung von Zerspanwerkzeugen hat in der Vergangenheit entscheidend zu Verbesserungen und Leistungssteigerungen in der Zerspantechnik beitragen konnen. Aluminiumoxid (Al2O3) nimmt hierbei aufgrund einer Vielzahl an Eigenschaften, wie Warmharte, Oxidations-, Diffusions- und chemischer Bestandigkeit eine wichtige Rolle ein. Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) Al2O3-Beschichtungen, die mittels medium frequency Magnetron Sputtering (mfMS) hergestellt werden, haben ihre Leistungsfahigkeit in der Zerspanung von schwer zerspanbaren Werkstoffen bereits bewiesen. Die High Power Pulsed Magnetron Sputtering (HPPMS)-Technologie kann zu weiteren Verbesserungen der Schichtmorphologie und -eigenschaften aufgrund hoher Ionisation des abgesputterten Materials fuhren. In diesem Zusammenhang ist die Abscheidung von Al2O3 mittels HPPMS bisher wenig erforscht. Bisher ist noch unklar, welche Phasen abgeschieden werden bzw. wie die Prozessparameter die Phasenbildung beeinflussen. Ziel der Untersuchungen ist es, die Erkenntnisse uber die Abscheidung von PVD-Al2O3-Schichten und deren Einsatzverhalten auf die industrielle Ebene mittels HPPMS zu ubertragen, neue Einsatzbereiche des potenzialtrachtigen Schichtsystems zu erschlie ss en und somit einen Beitrag zur Weiterentwicklung in der Zerspantechnik von schwer zerspanbaren Werkstoffen zu leisten.
   Coating of cutting tools has been contributing to improvements and performance increases in the machining technology. Al2O3 plays an important role due to its high hot hardness as well as high oxidation and diffusion resistance and chemical stability. Physical vapor deposition (PVD) aluminium oxide (Al2O3) coatings deposited by means of medium frequency magnetron sputtering (mfMS) have already proven their capabilities in the machining of hard-to-machine materials. The High Power Pulsed Magnetron Sputtering (HPPMS) technology could offer an improvement of the coating morphology and properties due to high ionization of the sputtered material. In this connection, deposition of the Al2O3 by means of HPPMS is not fundamentally researched so far. It is still unclear which phases could be deposited and how the process parameters affect the phase formation. The aim of the investigations is to transfer the knowledge about the deposition of HPPMS-Al2O3 coatings and their application to the industrial level, to create new areas for promising coating systems and thus to contribute to the development of machining technology of the hard-to-machine materials.

TI Unique tRNA gene profile suggests paucity of nucleotide modifications in
   anticodons of a deep-sea symbiotic Spiroplasma
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB The position 34 of a tRNA is always modified for efficient recognition of codons and accurate integration of amino acids by the translation machinery. Here, we report genomics features of a deep-sea gut symbiotic Spiroplasma, which suggests that the organism does not require tRNA(34) anticodon modifications. In the genome, there is a novel set of tRNA genes composed of 32 species for recognition of the 20 amino acids. Among the anticodons of the tRNAs, we witnessed the presence of both U34- and C34 containing tRNAs required to decode NNR (A/G) 2:2 codons as countermeasure of probable loss of anticodon modification genes. In the tRNA fragments detected in the gut transcriptome, mismatches expected to be caused by some tRNA modifications were not shown in their alignments with the corresponding genes. However, the probable paucity of modified anticodons did not fundamentally change the codon usage pattern of the Spiroplasma. The tRNA gene profile that probably resulted from the paucity of tRNA(34) modifications was not observed in other symbionts and deep-sea bacteria, indicating that this phenomenon was an evolutionary deadend. This study provides insights on co-evolution of translation machine and tRNA genes and steric constraints of codon-anticodon interactions in deep-sea extreme environment.

TI REPARATION: ribosome profiling assisted (re-)annotation of bacterial
   genomes
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Prokaryotic genome annotation is highly dependent on automated methods, as manual curation cannot keep up with the exponential growth of sequenced genomes. Current automated methods depend heavily on sequence composition and often underestimate the complexity of the proteome. We developed RibosomeE Profiling Assisted (re-)AnnotaTION (REPARATION), a de novo machine learning algorithm that takes advantage of experimental protein synthesis evidence from ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) to delineate translated open reading frames (ORFs) in bacteria, independent of genome annotation (https://github.com/Biobix/ REPARATION). REPARATION evaluates all possible ORFs in the genome and estimates minimum thresholds based on a growth curve model to screen for spurious ORFs. We applied REPARATION to three annotated bacterial species to obtain a more comprehensive mapping of their translation landscape in support of experimental data. In all cases, we identified hundreds of novel (small) ORFs including variants of previously annotated ORFs and >70% of all (variants of) annotated protein coding ORFs were predicted by REPARATION to be translated. Our predictions are supported by matching mass spectrometry proteomics data, sequence composition and conservation analysis. REPARATION is unique in that it makes use of experimental translation evidence to intrinsically perform a de novo ORF delineation in bacterial genomes irrespective of the sequence features linked to open reading frames.

AB In the spoken Chinese language, the time constituents occur frequently, especially in the domain of appointment schedule, ticket booking and hotel reservation etc. However, in the current Chinese-to-English Machine Translation (MT) systems, it is still a problem to deal with the time constituents. According to our test results of some commercial Chinese-to-English MT systems, about 57.1% Chinese time constituents are wrongly translated, and 58.3% of the errors are caused by false recognition and misunderstanding of the time constituents. In the paper, we present a new approach to recognition and understanding of the time constituents in the Chinese language, which is integrated by a shallow level analyzer and a deep level analyzer. The shallow level analysis is realized by a Finite State Transition Network (FSTN). The time constituents are first recognized by the FSTN, and the results are divided into three types. Two types of the results are determinate and one is uncertain. Aimed at the uncertain results, the deep level analyzer checks the semantic context of time constituents. performs necessary phrase structure analysis, and finally, decides the type of the time constituents. The approach has been employed in our Chinese-to-English spoken language translation system, which is limited in the domain of hotel reservation. However, the approach is domain-independent. The preliminary experiment has proven that the approach is effective and practical.

TI The capitohamate ligaments - A comparison of biomechanical properties
SO JOURNAL OF HAND SURGERY-BRITISH AND EUROPEAN VOLUME
AB The physical attributes of the three capitohamate interosseous ligaments were tested in a computer-controlled multi-axis testing machine using 12 human cadaver specimens, After an intact test run, selected ligaments were cut in random sequence and the test repeated, The remaining ligaments were tested to failure with servohydrolic stress at 5 mm/second.
   In the intact joint complex, the average dorsopalmar rotational displacement was approximately 9 degrees in each direction. Under the load limit, the dorsopalmar translational displacement averaged 0.9 mm and 0.5 mn respectively, proximal-distal translational displacement averaged 0.8 mm and 0.4 mm respectively, and distractional displacement averaged 0.3 mm.
   Based on the sequential sectioning it was found that the dorsal ligament provided 76% (SD 14) of the rotational resistance with palmar rotation of the capitate and 44% (SD 19) of translational constraint with palmar translation of the capitate, The deep ligament provided 51% (SD 15) of the rotational resistance with dorsal rotation of the capitate and 63% (SD 24) of translational resistance with dorsal translation of the capitate, With proximal-distal translation, the dorsal ligament was the most important constraint in each direction, In resisting distraction, each of the three ligaments was equally effective, Failure testing showed the deep ligament was strongest at 289 N, followed by the palmar at 171 N and the dorsal at 133 N.

AB Recent studies have shown that frame-level deep speaker features can be derived from a deep neural network with the training target set to discriminate speakers by a short speech segment. By pooling the frame-level features, utterance-level representations, called d-vectors, can be derived and used in the automatic speaker verification (ASV) task. This simple average pooling, however, is inherently sensitive to the phonetic content of the utterance. An interesting idea borrowed from machine translation is the attention-based mechanism, where the contribution of an input word to the translation at a particular time is weighted by an attention score. This score reflects the relevance of the input word and the present translation. We can use the same idea to align utterances with different phonetic contents.
   This paper proposes a phonetic-attention scoring approach for d-vector systems. By this approach, an attention score is computed for each frame pain This score reflects the similarity of the two frames in phonetic content, and is used to weigh the contribution of this frame pair in the utterance-based scoring. This new scoring approach emphasizes the frame pairs with similar phonetic contents, which essentially provides a soft alignment for utterances with any phonetic contents. Experimental results show that compared with the naive average pooling, this phonetic-attention scoring approach can deliver consistent performance improvement in ASV tasks of both text-dependent and text-independent.

AB Code-switching (CS), a hallmark of worldwide bilingual communities, refers to a strategy adopted by bilinguals (or multilinguals) who mix two or more languages in a discourse often with little change of interlocutor or topic. The units and the locations of the switches may vary widely from single-word switches to whole phrases (beyond the length of the loanword units). Such phenomena pose challenges for spoken language technologies, i.e., automatic speech recognition (ASR), since the systems need to be able to handle the input in a multilingual setting. Several works constructed a CS ASR on many different language pairs. But the common aim of developing a CS ASR is merely for transcribing CS-speech utterances into CS-text sentences within a single individual. In contrast, in this study, we address the situational context that happens during dialogs between CS and non-CS (monolingual) speakers and support monolingual speakers who want to understand CS speakers. We construct a system that recognizes and translates from codeswitching speech to monolingual text. We investigated several approaches, including a cascade of ASR and a neural machine translation (NMT), a cascade of ASR and a deep bidirectional language model (BERT), an ASR that directly outputs monolingual transcriptions from CS speech, and multi-task learning. Finally, we evaluate and discuss these four ways on a JapaneseEnglish CS to English monolingual task.

AB The efficient execution of Java programs presents a challenge to hardware and software designers alike, The difficulty, however, lies with the Java bytecodes, Their model of a simplistic, platform-independent stack machine is well-suited for portability, though at the expense of execution speed. Various approaches are being proposed to increase the speed of Java bytecode programs, including: (i) on-the-by compilation to native code (also known as JIT or 'just-in-time' compilation); (ii) traditional ('ahead-of-time') compilation of bytecodes to some higher-level intermediate form and then to native code; and (iii) translation of bytecodes to a higher-level language and then use of an existing compiler to produce native code, Speedups of the order of 50 over standard bytecode interpretation have been claimed,
   All of these approaches rely upon bytecode analysis (of varying sophistication) to extract information about the program, which is then used to optimize the native code during the translation process, However, extracting information from a lower-level representation such as the Java bytecodes can be very expensive, Also, given the fact that most approaches for executing Java bytecodes cannot spend a great deal of time recovering high-level information, the solutions adopted during the translation process must use faster and less accurate analysis techniques, thus penalizing the quality of the native code,
   In this paper we propose an optimization approach based on bytecode annotations, The bytecodes are annotated during the original source code to bytecode translation, allowing both traditional interpretation by a JVM and aggressive optimization by an annotation-aware bytecode compiler, Annotations hinder neither portability nor compatibility, while preserving optimization information that is expensive to recompute, Preliminary results yield bytecode with C-like performance using JIT technology, (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Advances in human language technology offer the promise of pervasive access to on-line information and electronic services. Since almost everyone speaks and understands a language, the development of natural language systems will allow the average person to interact with computers anytime and anywhere without special skills or training, using common devices such as a mobile telephone. The latest results and component technologies for multilingual and robust speech processing, prosodic analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, discourse understanding, translation, and speech synthesis are reviewed using the Verbmobil system as an example. Verbmobil is a speaker-independent and bidirectional speech-to-speech translation system for spontaneous dialogs in mobile situations. It recognizes spoken input, analyses and translates it, and finally utters the translation. The multilingual system handles dialogs in three business-oriented domains, with context-sensitive translation between three languages (German, English, and Japanese). We will show that the most successful current systems are based on hybrid architectures incorporating both deep and shallow processing schemes. They integrate a broad spectrum of statistical and rule-based methods and combine the results of machine learning from large corpora with linguists' hand-crafted knowledge sources to achieve an adequate level of robustness and accuracy. We argue that packed representations together with formalisms for underspecification capture the uncertainties in each processing phase, so that these uncertainties can be reduced by linguistic, discourse and domain constraints as soon as they become applicable. We show that the current core technologies for natural language and speech processing enable us to create the next generation of information extraction and summarization systems for the Web, speech-based Internet access and multimodal communication assistants combining speech and gesture.

AB On the nowadays society exist a lot of communication problems, particularly when the persons has sensory disabilities as deafness or blindness. This problem take place at the moment of interpreting the sign language. The present paper shows the development of a current research project that integrates an intelligent system in the recognition of images and its reproduction in hardware interpretations ends. For those purposes, a system of image acquisition with a webcam and an interface was implemented in Matlab, through which the video was displayed in real time, the image of the point gained, together with the translation of Colombian sign language. This system was trained to recognize 4-letter alphabet, obtaining an average error of 2%, concluding that such application was effective for translating letters acquired both the right hand or the left; similarly concluded that the type of radial neural network proves to be very useful for this type of operation and the higher classification have this training, the results will be more accurate cast. Finally it is important to note that the system integrates hardware with Arduino system that displays real- time translation in this system was trained to recognize 4 letters of the alphabet, giving an average error of 2%, the same way the PNN neural network proves to be very useful for this type of sorting operations.

TI Concept unification of terms in different languages via web mining for
   Information Retrieval
SO INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT
AB For historical and cultural reasons, English phases, especially proper nouns and new words, frequently appear in Web pages written primarily in East Asian languages such as Chinese, Korean, and Japanese. Although such English terms and their equivalences in these East Asian languages refer to the same concept, they are often erroneously treated as independent index units in traditional Information Retrieval (IR). This paper describes the degree to which the problem arises in IR and proposes a novel technique to solve it. Our method first extracts English terms from native Web documents in an East Asian language, and then unifies the extracted terms and their equivalences in the native language as one index unit. For Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR), one of the major hindrances to achieving retrieval performance at the level of Mono-Lingual Information Retrieval (MLIR) is the translation of terms in search queries which can not be found in a bilingual dictionary. The Web mining approach proposed in this paper for concept unification of terms in different languages can also be applied to solve this well-known challenge in CLIR. Experimental results based on NTCIR and KT-Set test collections show that the high translation precision of our approach greatly improves performance of both Mono-Lingual and Cross-Language Information Retrieval.

TI Single enzyme RT-PCR of full-length ribosomal RNA
SO SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY
AB The ribosome is a two-subunit, macromolecular machine composed of RNA and proteins that carries out the polymerization of a-amino acids into polypeptides. Efforts to engineer ribosomal RNA (rRNA) deepen our understanding of molecular translation and provide opportunities to expand the chemistry of life by creating ribosomes with altered properties. Toward these efforts, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) of the entire 16S and 23S rRNAs, which make up the 30S small subunit and 50S large subunit, respectively, is important for isolating desired phenotypes. However, reverse transcription of rRNA is challenging due to extensive secondary structure and post-transcriptional modifications. One key challenge is that existing commercial kits for RT-PCR rely on reverse transcriptases that lack the extreme thermostability and processivity found in many commercial DNA polymerases, which can result in subpar performance on challenging templates. Here, we develop methods employing a synthetic thermostable reverse transcriptase (RTX) to enable and optimize RT-PCR of the complete Escherichia coli 16S and 23S rRNAs. We also characterize the error rate of RTX when traversing the various post-transcriptional modifications of the 23S rRNA. We anticipate that this work will facilitate efforts to study and characterize many naturally occurring long RNAs and to engineer the translation apparatus for synthetic biology.

TI TRANSLATION ERROR ANALYSIS IN TREAT: A WINDOWS APP USING THE MQM

SO ZBORNIK VELEUCILISTA U RIJECI-JOURNAL OF THE POLYTECHNICS OF RIJEKA
AB The aim of this research paper is to conduct a thorough analysis of inter-annotator agreement in the process of error analysis, which is well-known for its subjectivity and low level of agreement. Since the process is tiresome in its nature and the available user interfaces are pretty distinct from what the average annotator is accustomed to, a user-friendly Windows 10 application offering a more attractive user interface is developed with the aim to simplify the process of error analysis. Translations are performed with Google Translate engine and English-Croatian is selected as the language pair. Since there has been a lot of dispute on inter-annotator agreement and the need for guidelines has been often been emphasized as crucial, the annotators are given a very detailed introduction into the process of error analysis itself. They are given a presentation with a list of the MQM guidelines enriched with tricky cases. All annotators are native speakers of Croatian as the target language and have a linguistic background. The results demonstrate that a stronger agreement indicates more similar backgrounds and that the task of selecting annotators should be conducted more carefully. Furthermore, a training phase on a similar test set is deemed necessary in order to gain a stronger agreement.

AB Software engineering uses UML diagrams as a standard technique for specification and development of software. Various UML, diagrams are used for specification of different aspects of the application. Their interpretation, extension, revision and integration becomes awful difficult if developers use the full freedom of UML, apply their own semantics and do not agree an common parts. We propose an approach that limits this freedom to the necessary extend. Developers have the full freedom on parts of the specification that is independent from others and are committed to fulfill contracts on parts of the specification that is also used by other developers.
   Due to a lack of semantics the integration of various UML diagrams is often left to the intuition of software engineers, which bears the risk of UML-based software development becoming error-prone. In this paper we propose the use of Abstract State Machines (ASMs) as a means to support the integration of UML diagrams by means of invertible translations of UML clusters, i.e. sets of UML diagrams together with constraints defined on them, into easily understandable ASM specifications. In doing so, the rigorous semantics of ASMs induces an unambiguous semantics for the UML clusters. These translations themselves can be formalised by ASM specifications thereby automating the translation process. Furthermore, the evolution of UML clusters is guarded by contracts, which can again by specified by ASMs.

TI Irreversible chemical steps control intersubunit dynamics during
   translation
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB The ribosome, a two-subunit macromolecular machine, deciphers the genetic code and catalyzes peptide bond formation. Dynamic rotational movement between ribosomal subunits is likely required for efficient and accurate protein synthesis, but direct observation of intersubunit dynamics has been obscured by the repetitive, multistep nature of translation. Here, we report a collection of single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays that reveal a ribosomal intersubunit conformational cycle in real time during initiation and the first round of elongation. After subunit joining and delivery of correct aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome, peptide bond formation results in a rapid conformational change, consistent with the counterclockwise rotation of the 30S subunit with respect to the 50S subunit implied by prior structural and biochemical studies. Subsequent binding of elongation factor G and GTP hydrolysis results in a clockwise rotation of the 30S subunit relative to the 50S subunit, preparing the ribosome for the next round of tRNA selection and peptide bond formation. The ribosome thus harnesses the free energy of irreversible peptidyl transfer and GTP hydrolysis to surmount activation barriers to large-scale conformational changes during translation. Intersubunit rotation is likely a requirement for the concerted movement of tRNA and mRNA substrates during translocation.

TI Unsupervised colonoscopic depth estimation by domain translations with a
   Lambertian-reflection keeping auxiliary task
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY
AB Purpose A three-dimensional (3D) structure extraction technique viewed from a two-dimensional image is essential for the development of a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for colonoscopy. However, a straightforward application of existing depth-estimation methods to colonoscopic images is impossible or inappropriate due to several limitations of colonoscopes. In particular, the absence of ground-truth depth for colonoscopic images hinders the application of supervised machine learning methods. To circumvent these difficulties, we developed an unsupervised and accurate depth-estimation method. Method We propose a novel unsupervised depth-estimation method by introducing a Lambertian-reflection model as an auxiliary task to domain translation between real and virtual colonoscopic images. This auxiliary task contributes to accurate depth estimation by maintaining the Lambertian-reflection assumption. In our experiments, we qualitatively evaluate the proposed method by comparing it with state-of-the-art unsupervised methods. Furthermore, we present two quantitative evaluations of the proposed method using a measuring device, as well as a new 3D reconstruction technique and measured polyp sizes. Results Our proposed method achieved accurate depth estimation with an average estimation error of less than 1 mm for regions close to the colonoscope in both of two types of quantitative evaluations. Qualitative evaluation showed that the introduced auxiliary task reduces the effects of specular reflections and colon wall textures on depth estimation and our proposed method achieved smooth depth estimation without noise, thus validating the proposed method. Conclusions We developed an accurate depth-estimation method with a new type of unsupervised domain translation with the auxiliary task. This method is useful for analysis of colonoscopic images and for the development of a CAD system since it can extract accurate 3D information.

AB Recent developments in data science in general and machine learning in particular have transformed the way experts envision the future of surgery. Surgical Data Science (SDS) is a new research field that aims to improve the quality of interventional healthcare through the capture, organization, analysis and modeling of data. While an increasing number of data-driven approaches and clinical applications have been studied in the fields of radiological and clinical data science, translational success stories are still lacking in surgery. In this publication, we shed light on the underlying reasons and provide a roadmap for future advances in the field. Based on an international workshop involving leading researchers in the field of SDS, we review current practice, key achievements and initiatives as well as available standards and tools for a number of topics relevant to the field, namely (1) infrastructure for data acquisition, storage and access in the presence of regulatory constraints, (2) data annotation and sharing and (3) data analytics. We further complement this technical perspective with (4) a review of currently available SDS products and the translational progress from academia and (5) a roadmap for faster clinical translation and exploitation of the full potential of SDS, based on an international multi-round Delphi process.

AB In this paper, we present a crowd-source based Bangla to English parallel corpus and evaluate its accuracy. A complete and informative corpus is necessary for any language for its development through automated process. A Bangla to English parallel corpus has importance in various multi-lingual applications and NLP research works. But there is still scarcity of a complete Bangla to English parallel corpus. In this paper we propose a large scale crowd-source method of construction of a Bangla to English parallel corpus through crowd-sourcing. We chose crowd-sourcing method to venture a new approach in corpus construction and evaluate human behavior pattern in doing so. The translations were collected form under graduate students of university to ensure strong language knowledge. A Bangla to English parallel corpus will help in comparing linguistic features of these languages. In this paper we present an initial dataset prepared via crowd-sourcing which will serve as a baseline for further analysis of crowd source based corpus. Our primary dataset is consists of 517 Bangla sentences and for every Bangla sentence, we collected 4 English sentences on an average and 2143 English sentences in total via crowd-sourcing. This data was collected over a period of 2 months and from 62 users. Finally we analyze the dataset and give some conclusive idea about further research.

TI Optimizing Control Transfer and Memory Virtualization in Full System
   Emulators
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ARCHITECTURE AND CODE OPTIMIZATION
AB Full system emulators provide virtual platforms for several important applications, such as kernel and system software development, co-verification with cycle accurate CPU simulators, or application development for hardware still in development. Full system emulators usually use dynamic binary translation to obtain reasonable performance. This paper focuses on optimizing the performance of full system emulators. First, we optimize performance by enabling classic control transfer optimizations of dynamic binary translation in full system emulation, such as indirect branch target caching and block chaining. Second, we improve the performance of memory virtualization of cross-ISA virtual machines by improving the efficiency of the software translation lookaside buffer (software TLB). We implement our optimizations on QEMU, an industrial-strength full system emulator, along with the Android emulator. Experimental results show that our optimizations achieve an average speedup of 1.98X for ARM-to-X86-64 QEMU running SPEC CINT2006 benchmarks with train inputs. Our optimizations also achieve an average speedup of 1.44X and 1.40X for IA32-to-X86-64 QEMU and AArch64-to-X86-64 QEMU on SPEC CINT2006. We use a set of real applications downloaded from Google Play as benchmarks for the Android emulator. Experimental results show that our optimizations achieve an average speedup of 1.43X for the Android emulator running these applications.

TI Annotation of uORFs in the OMIM genes allows to reveal pathogenic
   variants in 5 ' UTRs
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB An increasing number of studies emphasize the role of non-coding variants in the development of hereditary diseases. However, the interpretation of such variants in clinical genetic testing still remains a critical challenge due to poor knowledge of their pathogenicity mechanisms. It was previously shown that variants in 5 '-untranslated regions (5 ' UTRs) can lead to hereditary diseases due to disruption of upstream open reading frames (uORFs). Here, we performed a manual annotation of upstream translation initiation sites (TISs) in human disease-associated genes from the OMIM database and revealed similar to 4.7 thousand of TISs related to uORFs. We compared our TISs with the previous studies and provided a list of 'high confidence' uORFs. Using a luciferase assay, we experimentally validated the translation of uORFs in the ETFDH, PAX9, MAST1, HTT, TTN,GLI2 and COL2A1 genes, as well as existence of N-terminal CDS extension in the ZIC2 gene. Besides, we created a tool to annotate the effects of genetic variants located in uORFs. We revealed the variants from the HGMD and ClinVar databases that disrupt uORFs and thereby could lead to Mendelian disorders. We also showed that the distribution of uORFs-affecting variants differs between pathogenic and population variants. Finally, drawing on manually curated data, we developed a machine-learning algorithm that allows us to predict the TISs in other human genes.

AB In order to determine the material properties on its micro scale, a new microspecimen tester is developed, which uses a linear servo motor in one axis of translations and five dc servo motors in other axes to build a six-axis stage and employs a six-degree load cell to sense the micro loading due to the deformation of the micro sample. The six-axis stage can achieve the resolution with 0.1 micron in translation and 0.001degrees in rotation, which is proved that there is no backlash, no hysteresis, higher machine stiffness and fatigue frequency of 11Hz in linear servo motor translation compared with dc-motor-screw-driven. The six-degree load cell with the fine resolution of 4mN is generally used to record the micro force, which is also to control the six-axis stage move to reduce the deformation as a feedback during the alignment of the fixed micro sample. A heating and cooling chamber is built up with the temperature from -40-250degreesC for the purpose of thermo-mechanical testing. The tensile testing experiments have been taken by the 6-axis tester and a mini single axis tester with the same samples, the error of which is kept within 2%-5%. Then lots of experiments with different thin films have been made under different conditions.

AB Automatic word sense disambiguation (WSD) from text is a task of great importance in various applications of natural language processing, for example, in machine translation, question answering, automatic summarization or sentiment analysis. There are different approaches to finding the meaning of a word within a context, whether using supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised or knowledge-based methods. Several studies have been conducted to automatically translate from text to sign language, reproducing the result of the translation with a signing avatar, in a way that deaf users have access to informative contents that otherwise are highly inaccessible, because sign language is their mother tongue. The many proposals that have been made look forward to minimize these informative and communicative barriers. Sign languages, however, do not have as many words as the spoken languages, so an automatic translation must be as accurate and free of ambiguities as possible. In this paper, we propose to evaluate the use of public access big data resources, as well as appropriate techniques to access this type of resources for WSD tasks, illustrating their effects in a translation system from text in Spanish to Costa Rican Sign Language (LESCO). The architecture of the actual system incorporates the use of a folksonomy, from which the disambiguation process will benefit. When an exact word is not found for a given detected sense in the source text, the ontology will be fed back with a new relationship of hyperonymy, to alert the curator on the need to propose a new sign in that category, thus promoting an enrichment in a key component of the architecture. As a result of the evaluation, the most appropriate big data public resources and techniques for WSD for sign language will be elucidated.

TI Loanword Identification in Low-Resource Languages with Minimal
   Supervision
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB Bilingual resources play a very important role in many natural language processing tasks, especially the tasks in cross-lingual scenarios. However, it is expensive and time consuming to build such resources. Lexical borrowing happens in almost every language. This inspires us to detect these loanwords effectively, and to use the "loanword (in receipt language)"-"donor word (in donor language)" to extend the bilingual resource for NLP tasks in low-resource languages. In this article, we propose a novel method to identify loanwords in Uyghur. The most important advantage of this method is that the model only relies on large amount of monolingual corpora and only a small scale of annotated data. Our loanword identification model includes two parts: loanword candidate generation and loanword prediction. In the first part, we use two large-scale monolingual corpora and a small bilingual dictionary to train a cross-lingual embedding model. Since semantic unrelated words often cannot be treated as loanword pairs, a loanword candidate list will be generated according to this model and a word list in Uyghur. In the second part, we predict from the preceding candidates based on a log-linear model that integrates several features such as pronunciation similarity, part-of-speech tags, and hybrid language modeling. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct two types of experiments: loanword identification and OOV translation. Experimental results showed that (1) our proposed method achieved significant F1 improvements compared to other models in all four loanword identification tasks in Uyghur, and (2) after extending the existing translation models with loanword identification results, OOV rates in several language pairs reduced significantly and the translation performance improved.

TI Effects of deformation of cylindrical compound parabolic concentrator
   (CPC) on concentration characteristics
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB Compound parabolic concentrators (CPC) have immense potential for middle-and-low temperature heat collection of solar energy. In this study, the propagation process of solar radiation rays in a CPC-tubular solar collector was simulated using an in-house MATLAB code by the Monte Carlo ray tracing (MCAT) method. The effects of ray incidence angle, CPC concentration ratio, and truncation residual ratio on the heat flux distribution on the tubular heat receiver were analyzed. Moreover, the effects of CPC deformations on concentration characteristics were analyzed, involving the rotation and translation of the reflective surface, the truncation of the involute starting point, and the position offset of the heat receiver. The heat flux distribution exhibited two evident peaks on the heat receiver external surface due to the concentration effect of the CPC. A small internal rotation, a small internal or external translation of the reflective surface, and the truncation of the involute starting point had mere effect on the heat flux distribution on the heat receiver. Therefore, the reflective surface can be allowed to have certain translation and internal rotation when machining a CPC. The downward, rightward, and leftward offsets of heat receivers should be avoided in the assembly of heat receivers and CPCs.

TI New complete orthonormal sets of exponential-type orbitals and their
   application to translation of Slater orbitals
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY
AB The new complete orthonormal sets of exponential-type orbitals (ETOs) are introduced in closed form as functions of the exponential, the complex or real regular solid spherical harmonic, and the generalized Laguerre polynomials, Psi(nml)(alpha/)(zeta,(r) over right arrow) = (-1)(alpha) [(2zeta)(3)(n-l-1)!/(2n)(alpha)[(n+l-alpha)!(3)](1/2) (2zetar)(l)e(-zetarL2l=2-alpha)/(n+l+1-alpha) (2zetar)S-lm(theta,phi), where alpha = 1,0,-1,-2,-3,.... These Psi(alpha)-ETOs are represented as finite linear combinations of Slater-type orbitals (STOs). The Coulomb Sturmian and Lambda ETOs are the special classes of Psi(alpha)-ETOs for alpha = 1 and alpha = 0, respectively. By the use of Psi(alpha)-ETOs the simpler expansion formulas for translation of STOs are derived. The translation coefficients are presented by a linear combination of overlap integrals. The final results are especially useful for machine computations of arbitrary multielectron multicenter molecular integrals over STOs that arise in the Hartree-Fock-Roothaan approximation and also in the Hylleraas correlated wave function method which play a significant role in theory and application to quantum mechanics of atoms, molecules, and solids.

TI Exploring Usability as a Formative Construct through UMUX: A
   Multi-Language Approach for Turkish Adaptation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION
AB Within the last decade, the Usability Metric for User Experience is translated into many languages. This study aimed to create an adapted version of UMUX into Turkish, based on item translations made from Arabic, Chinese, English, Italian and Slovene versions, which vary for the content of the items as well as their differences in how they are processed by machine translation systems and understood by human translators. Based on different translations, 45 UMUX variants in Turkish language are assessed psychometrically as a formative construct, regarding the criteria based on PLS measurement models for formative constructs and Rasch analysis. The results are benchmarked with the data collected via UMUX, SUS and CSUQ in Arabic and English or Turkish and English concurrently. Results show that all 45 Turkish variants of UMUX reveal strong psychometric qualities as a formative construct, as well as UMUX and Arabic UMUX. While there is evidence that usability can be measured as a formative construct, differences between item sets suggest that UMUX may not be a complete measure that includes all aspects of usability regarding ISO 9241-11. Our results also suggest that UMUX scores are sensitive to the native language of participants since the mean scores were significantly different between the native and English UMUX versions which were responded concurrently to assess the same software.

TI Translating Java for multiple model checkers: The Bandera back-end
SO FORMAL METHODS IN SYSTEM DESIGN
AB One approach to model checking program source code is to view a model checker as a target machine. In this setting, program source code is translated to a model checker's input language using a process that shares much in common with program compilation. For example, well-defined intermediate program representations are used to stage the translation through a series of analyses and optimizing transformations and target-specific details are isolated in code generation modules.
   In this paper, we present the Bandera Intermediate Representation (BIR)-a guarded-assignment transformation system language that has been designed to support the translation of Java programs to a variety of model checkers. BIR includes constructs, such as inheritance, dynamic creation of data, and locking primitives, that are designed to model the semantics of Java primitives. BIR also includes several non-deterministic choice constructs that support abstraction in modeling and specification of properties of dynamic heap structures.
   We have developed a BIR-based tool infrastructure that has been applied to develop customized analysis frameworks for several different input languages using different model checking tools. We present BIR's type system and operational semantics in sufficient detail to support similar applications by other researchers. This semantics details several state space reductions and state space search variations. We describe the translation of Java to BIR and how BIR is translated to the input languages of several model checkers.

AB The initial behavioral specification goes through significant optimizing transformations before being mapped to architecture during embedded system design. Establishing the validity of these transformations is crucial to ensure that the intended behavior of a system has not been faultily altered during synthesis. Although a lot of these transformations are carried out using some automated tool(s), a significant portion of such transformations are still performed by expert programmers. Thus, there is a need to devise efficient translation validation methodologies to handle diverse code transformations. Many translation validation methods exist which depend on hints provided by the compiler, such as, what transformations have been applied and in what order. However, generating such hints requires a lot of tedious probing into the compilers; the task becomes more demanding when there are humans involved.
   In this tutorial, we intend to present our translation validation framework to check equivalence between a source program and its transformed version, both represented using the control and data flow graph (CDFG) or Finite State Machine with Data path (FSMD) model or its extension, while being completely unaware of the underlying compiler. The tutorial will start with illustrating common compiler optimization techniques with their impact on performance in terms of power, area and timing Next, we will discuss basic program verification techniques like Hoare logic, Theorem Proving, Model Checking, Program equivalence using SMT solvers, etc. We will show why equivalence checking method is most suitable for verifying compiler optimizations. Next, we will present our FSMD based equivalence checking method in detail. Next, we will discuss how bisimulation relations can be inferred from equivalence checkers. We conclude with discussing the future direction of research in this domain.

TI Cross-View Action Recognition Based on a Statistical Translation
   Framework
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS FOR VIDEO TECHNOLOGY
AB Actions captured under view changes pose serious challenges to modern action recognition methods. In this paper, we propose an effective approach for cross-view action recognition based on a statistical translation framework, which boils down to estimation of visual word transfer probabilities across views. Specifically, local features are extracted from action video frames and form bags of words based on k-means clustering. Though the appearance of an action may vary due to view changes, the underlying transfer tendency between visual words across views can be exploited. We propose two methods to measure the visual-word-based transfer relationship that are eventually based on frequency counts of word pairs. In the first method, word transfer probabilities are estimated by maximizing the likelihood of a shared action set with the EM algorithm. In the second method, word transfer probabilities are estimated by using likelihood-ratio tests. The two methods achieve comparable results and perform better when they are combined. For cross-view action classification, we compute action transfer probabilities based on the estimated word transfer probabilities and then implement a K-NN-like classification based on action video transfer probabilities. We verified our method on the public multiview IXMAS dataset and the WVU dataset. Promising results are obtained compared with state-of-the-art methods.

AB As a result of recent changes in the IT, where the role of IT has shifted from an enabler to an industrial sector in its own right, the necessity to provide framework which would allow seamless alignment of the business and IT rose. The goal was to allow the stakeholders from the business as well as IT perspective to model the requirements for the IT service provisioning using the modeling languages they are familiar with and to apply semantic technologies as a mediator that will allow translation between them. IT-Socket, the model based approach for business and IT alignment, developed in the European Research project - plugIT, aims to realize the vision of businesses "plugging-in" to IT by introducing graphical modeling languages as mediators between the domain experts and IT. The research challenges identified include the ability to perform integration and translation between graphical modeling languages by building the reference ontology, enabling automatic generation of machine interpretable domain ontologies from graphical models and allowing automatic translation between domain ontologies. The results of the application of the IT-Socket for business and IT alignment are presented within three use cases: (I) "Certification" of IT infrastructure, (2) "Virtual Organization" by evolving the current service orientation to a higher and more business driven abstraction and (3) "Governance" of IT infrastructure.

TI Unsupervised image translation using adversarial networks for improved
   plant disease recognition
SO COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
AB Acquisition of data in task-specific applications of machine learning like plant disease recognition is a costly endeavor owing to the requirements of professional human diligence and time constraints. In this paper, we present a pipeline that uses GANs in an unsupervised image translation environment to improve learning with respect to the data distribution in a plant disease dataset, reducing the partiality introduced by acute class imbalance and hence shifting the classification decision boundary towards better performance. The empirical analysis of our method is demonstrated on a limited dataset of 2789 tomato plant disease images, highly corrupted with an imbalance in the 9 disease categories. First, we extend the state of the art for the GAN-based image-to-image translation method by enhancing the perceptual quality of the generated images and preserving the semantics. We introduce AR-GAN, where in addition to the adversarial loss, our synthetic image generator optimizes on Activation Reconstruction loss (ARL) function that optimizes feature activations against the natural image. We present visually more compelling synthetic images in comparison to most prominent existing models and evaluate the performance of our GAN framework in terms of various datasets and metrics. Second, we evaluate the performance of a baseline convolutional neural network classifier for improved recognition using the resulting synthetic samples to augment our training set and compare it with the classical data augmentation scheme. We observe a significant improvement in classification accuracy (+ 5.2%) using generated synthetic samples as compared to (+ 0.8%) increase using classic augmentation in an equal class distribution environment.

TI Improving translation initiation site and stop codon recognition by
   using more than two classes
SO BIOINFORMATICS
AB Motivation: The recognition of translation initiation sites and stop codons is a fundamental part of any gene recognition program. Currently, the most successful methods use powerful classifiers, such as support vector machines with various string kernels. These methods all use two classes, one of positive instances and another one of negative instances that are constructed using sequences from the whole genome. However, the features of the negative sequences differ depending on the position of the negative samples in the gene. There are differences depending on whether they are from exons, introns, intergenic regions or any other functional part of the genome. Thus, the positive class is fairly homogeneous, as all its sequences come from the same part of the gene, but the negative class is composed of different instances. The classifier suffers from this problem. In this article, we propose the training of different classifiers with different negative, more homogeneous, classes and the combination of these classifiers for improved accuracy.
   Results: The proposed method achieves better accuracy than the best state-of-the-art method, both in terms of the geometric mean of the specificity and sensitivity and the area under the receiver operating characteristic and precision recall curves. The method is tested on the whole human genome. The results for recognizing both translation initiation sites and stop codons indicated improvements in the rates of both false-negative results (FN) and false-positive results (FP). On an average, for translation initiation site recognition, the false-negative ratio was reduced by 30.2% and the FP ratio decreased by 10.9%. For stop codon prediction, FP were reduced by 41.4% and FN by 31.7%.

TI Reducing image variability across OCT devices with unsupervised unpaired
   learning for improved segmentation of retina
SO BIOMEDICAL OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Diagnosis and treatment in ophthalmology depend on modern retinal imaging by optical coherence tomography (OCT). The recent staggering results of machine learning in medical imaging have inspired the development of automated segmentation methods to identify and quantify pathological features in OCT scans. These models need to be sensitive to image features defining patterns of interest, while remaining robust to differences in imaging protocols. A dominant factor for such image differences is the type of OCT acquisition device. In this paper, we analyze the ability of recently developed unsupervised unpaired image translations based on cycle consistency losses (cycleGANs) to deal with image variability across different OCT devices (Spectralis and Cirrus). This evaluation was performed on two clinically relevant segmentation tasks in retinal OCT imaging: fluid and photoreceptor layer segmentation. Additionally, a visual Turing test designed to assess the quality of the learned translation models was carried out by a group of 18 participants with different background expertise. Results show that the learned translation models improve the generalization ability of segmentation models to other OCT-vendors/domains not seen during training. Moreover, relationships between model hyper-parameters and the realism as well as the morphological consistency of the generated images could be identified.

TI Efficient Object Recognition Using Boundary Representation and Wavelet
   Neural Network
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS
AB Wavelet neural networks combine the functions of time-frequency localization from the wavelet transform and of self-studying from the neural network, which make them particularly suitable for the classification of complex patterns. In this paper, an efficient object recognition method using boundary representation and the wavelet neural network is proposed. The method employs a wavelet neural network (WNN) to characterize the singularities of the object curvature representation and to perform the object classification at the same time and in an automatic way. The local time-frequency attributes of the singularities on the object boundary are detected by making a preliminary wavelet analysis of the curvature representation. Then, the discriminative scale-translation features of the singularities are stored as the initial scale-translation parameters of the wavelet nodes in the WNN. These parameters are trained to their optimum status during the learning stage. With our approach, as opposed to matching features by convolving the signal with wavelet functions at a large number of scales, the computational burden is significantly reduced. Only a few convolutions are performed at the optimum scale-translation grids during the classification, which makes it suitable for real-time recognition tasks. Compared with the artificial-neural-network-based approaches preceded by wavelet filter banks with fixed scale-translation parameters, the support vector machine (SVM) using traditional Fourier descriptors and K-nearest-neighbor (K-NN) classifier based on the state-of-the-art shape descriptors, our scheme demonstrates superior and stable discrimination performance under various noisy and affine conditions.

AB Sub-word segmentation is currently a standard tool for training neural machine translation (MT) systems and other NLP tasks. The goal is to split words (both in the source and target languages) into smaller units which then constitute the input and output vocabularies of the MT system. The aim of reducing the size of the input and output vocabularies is to increase the generalization capabilities of the translation model, enabling the system to translate and generate infrequent and new (unseen) words at inference time by combining previously seen sub-word units. Ideally, we would expect the created units to have some linguistic meaning, so that words are created in a compositional way. However, the most popular word-splitting method, Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), which originates from the data compression literature, does not include explicit criteria to favor linguistic splittings, nor to find the optimal sub-word granularity for the given training data. In this paper, we propose a statistically motivated extension of the BPE algorithm and an effective convergence criterion that avoids the costly experimentation cycle needed to select the best sub-word vocabulary size. Experimental results with morphologically rich languages show that our model achieves nearly-optimal BLEU scores and produces morphologically better word segmentations, which allows to outperform BPE's generalization in the translation of sentences containing new words, as shown via human evaluation.

TI Superior-inferior stability of the shoulder: Role of the coracohumeral
   ligament and the rotator interval capsule
SO MAYO CLINIC PROCEEDINGS
AB Objective: To study the superior-inferior stabilizing functions of the coracohumeral ligament (CHL) and the rotator interval capsule (RIC) with use of a material testing machine.
   Material and Methods: The axial translations of the humerus with the superior-inferior translation force of 30 N applied were recorded under the following joint capsule conditions: (1) intact, (2) vented, (3) the CHL sectioned, and (4) the RIC incised in six cadaver shoulders, The order of sectioning was changed for conditions 3 and 4 in six other cadaver shoulders.
   Results: With the arm in internal and neutral rotations, venting the capsule significantly increased the superior inferior translation, which was unaffected by further sectioning of the CHL and the RIC. With the arm in external rotation, only the CHL contributed significantly to inferior stability, whereas both this ligament and the RIC contributed to superior stability to a lesser degree.
   Conclusion: The CHL is a stabilizer in superior-inferior directions with the arm in external rotation, and the intra-articular pressure that is maintained by the intact RIC is a stabilizer in superior-inferior directions with the arm in internal and neutral rotations. These findings may provide a scientific background to support closure of the interval space to stabilize the shoulder and may explain part of the superior instability observed in shoulders with rotator cuff tears.

TI Signal-to-Signal Translation for Fault Diagnosis of Bearings and Gears
   With Few Fault Samples
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT
AB Deep learning (DL)-based models can achieve satisfactory performance in bearing and gear fault diagnosis relying on sufficient fault vibration signals. However, it is difficult to acquire adequate machine fault data in industrial applications. Generally, data collected in the healthy condition are massive, but rare fault samples are available. To address the diagnostic problem with few fault data, this article proposes a method, namely, multilabel cycle translating adversarial network (MCTAN). The architecture can translate healthy vibration data into auxiliary fault data. Signal-to-signal translation enables auxiliary data to be acquired based on few fault data and adequate healthy data. Then, the auxiliary data are utilized to improve the performance of DL-based fault classification approaches. Experimental results and comparative analysis indicate the superiority and robustness of the proposed method for bearing and gear fault diagnosis on widely used XJTU-SY, Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Jiangnan University (JNU), and Southeast University (SEU) datasets. Even if the ratio of healthy data to fault data ranges from 50:1 to 300:1, the proposed MCTAN succeeds in raising the diagnosis accuracy by up to 25.87% and outperforms other comparative methods.

AB "Are you a werewolf?" is one of the most popular communication games and is played globally. The AIWolf Project developed an agent, named "the AIWolf," that can play " Are you a werewolf?". An AIWolf utters its thoughts using an AIWolf Protocol. As it is difficult for humans to understand the AIWolf Protocol, translation into natural language is required when human players are involved. However, the conventional method of translation uses a word-to-word method, creating the impression that the utterances have been generated by a machine. This study aimed make the utterances of AIWolf sound more human. The authors set the target that a human player would be unable to distinguish human speech from that generated by AIWolves (the Turing test). The authors define the situation as the maximum value of humanity. The output of translated AIWolf Protocol was paraphrased using data from Werewolf BBS Logs. This study considers making the utterances of AIWolf sound more human using Werewolf BBS Logs and a possibility assignment equation with fuzzy sets. In this paper, an experiment was conducted to confirm whether paraphrasing the utterances of AIWolf using Werewolf BBS Logs for human-like speech is useful or not. It was shown that the experimental method produced slightly more human-like speech than the conventional method.

TI SQLSketch: Generating SQL Queries using a sketch-based approach
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
AB In the last decade, many intelligent interfaces and layers have been suggested to allow the use of relational databases and extraction of the content using only the natural language. However most of them struggle when exposed to new databases. In this article, we present SQLSketch, a sketch-based network for generating SQL queries to address the problem of automatically translate Natural Languages questions to SQL using the related databases schemas. We argue that the previous models that use full or partial sequence-to-sequence structure in the decoding phase can, in fact, have counter-effect on the generation operation and came up with more loss of the context or the meaning of the user question. In this regard, we use a full sketch-based structure that decouples the generation process into many small prediction modules. The SQLSketch is evaluated against GreatSQL, a new cross-domain, large-scale and balanced dataset for the Natural Language to SQL translation task. For a long-term aim of making better models and contributing in adding more improvements to the semantic parsing tasks, we propose the GreatSQL dataset as the first balanced cross-domain corpus that includes 45,969 pairs of natural language questions and their corresponding SQL queries in addition to simplified and well structured ground-truth annotations. We establish results for SQLSketch using GreatSQL dataset and compare the performance against two popular types of models that represent the sequential and partial-sketch based approaches. Experimental result shows that SQLSketch outperforms the baseline models by 13% in exact matching accuracy and achieve a score of 23.9% to be the new state-of-the-art model on GreatSQL.

TI Using navigation to measure rotation kinematics ring ACL reconstruction
SO CLINICAL ORTHOPAEDICS AND RELATED RESEARCH
AB Rotational kinematics of the knee is not fully restored after single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Cadaveric experiments using knee testing machines have suggested anatomical reconstruction replacing the anteromedial and posterolateral bundles could restore knee kinematics more effectively than single-bundle reconstruction. However, practical tools to objectively assess knee rotational laxities clinically have not been available. We used an optically based computer-assisted navigation system to measure the tibiofemoral motion kinematics in four fresh whole cadavers. Standard clinical knee laxity tests (anterior drawer, Lachman, and pivot shift) were performed and the kinematics described in terms of tibial axial rotation and anteroposterior translation. Data were obtained for intact knees after excision of the ACL and sequential reconstruction of the anteromedial and posterolateral bundles. In the ACL-deficient knee, the mean maximum tibial rotation during the pivot shift test was 27 degrees and mean maximum translation 11 mm. Reconstruction of the anteromedial bundle reduced the rotational component to 18 degrees and translation to 7 mm. Reconstruction of the posterolateral bundle reduced rotation to 14 degrees. This pilot study suggests computer assisted navigation could provide a practical method to objectively measure the pivot shift and may be used clinically to demonstrate differences in the control of tibiofemoral rotation kinematics afforded by single and two-bundle ACL reconstructions.

AB Nowadays, information retrieval systems face significant challenges in providing users with accurate information due to the enormous growth of information. To better reformulate the query and narrow its results, semantic query expansion techniques add semantically related terms to the original query. However, semantic query expansion for Arabic queries is still a challenge due to the lack of rich semantic sources. Most of the existing solutions rely on using either English sources or specific-domain Arabic ontologies. Using English sources requires a translation phase which may lead to query drift, thus providing unrelated expansion terms. In this paper, we provide an overview of the query expansion approaches. Besides, we propose a hybrid comprehensive reference framework for Arabic semantic query expansion that overcomes the lack of Arabic semantic sources by using rich English ontologies to complement the limited Arabic sources (Arabic Wordnet) currently available. It ensures the Arabic-English translation process using a customized machine learning translation model to avoid query drifting. It also transforms natural language to SPARQL (an ontology query language) to easily query English sources (e.g., DBpedia). For enhanced accuracy, it provides an optimization module where meta-heuristics can be used for pertinent terms selection. This work represents a step forward in combining English sources and AI to design a practical Arabic semantic expansion.

AB Rapid Prototyping (RP)/Layered Manufacturing (LM) machines typically use a Stereo lithography (STL) file as a basis to manufacture parts. However, the conversion of the part CAD file to STL results in the distortion of the part geometry, particularly if the part consists of freeform curved surfaces. Existing algorithms and software tend to reduce this distortion globally, which increases the size and memory requirements of the STL file. This paper presents a new approach for reducing the CAD to STL translation error locally, using chordal error as the criteria. The algorithm presented here compares the STL file to the design surface of the part, expressed as a NURBS surface, and computes the chordal error for multiple points on the STL facets. The point within each STL facet having the largest chordal error is modified to coincide with its corresponding point on the design surface. This replaces the original facet of the STL file with three new facets with significantly lower chordal error than that of the original facet. This Vertex Translation Algorithm (VTA), reduces the chordal error in areas with high curvature and areas having tighter profile tolerance specifications and provides the user the flexibility to selectively modify the STL file according to the tolerance requirements. The algorithm has been validated with the help of a test case.

TI Mining Parallel Corpora from Sina Weibo and Twitter
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Microblogs such as Twitter, Facebook, and Sina Weibo (China's equivalent of Twitter) are a remarkable linguistic resource. In contrast to content from edited genres such as newswire, microblogs contain discussions of virtually every topic by numerous individuals in different languages and dialects and in different styles. In this work, we show that some microblog users post "self-translated" messages targeting audiences who speak different languages, either by writing the same message in multiple languages or by retweeting translations of their original posts in a second language. We introduce a method for finding and extracting this naturally occurring parallel data. Identifying the parallel content requires solving an alignment problem, and we give an optimally efficient dynamic programming algorithm for this. Using our method, we extract nearly 3M Chinese-English parallel segments from Sina Weibo using a targeted crawl of Weibo users who post in multiple languages. Additionally, from a random sample of Twitter, we obtain substantial amounts of parallel data in multiple language pairs. Evaluation is performed by assessing the accuracy of our extraction approach relative to a manual annotation as well as in terms of utility as training data for a Chinese-English machine translation system. Relative to traditional parallel data resources, the automatically extracted parallel data yield substantial translation quality improvements in translating microblog text and modest improvements in translating edited news content.

TI Probabilistic Sequence Translation-Alignment Model for Time-Series
   Classification
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
AB We tackle the time-series classification problem using a novel probabilistic model that represents the conditional densities of the observed sequences being time-warped and transformed from an underlying base sequence. We call it probabilistic sequence translation-alignment model (PSTAM) since it aims to capture both feature alignment and mapping between sequences, analogous to translating one language into another in the field of machine translation. To deal with general time-series, we impose the time-monotonicity constraints on the hidden alignment variables in the model parameter space, where by marginalizing them out it allows effective learning of class-specific time-warping and feature transformation simultaneously. Our PSTAM, thus, naturally enjoys the advantages from two typical approaches widely used in sequence classification: 1) benefits from the alignment-based methods that aim to estimate distance measures between non-equal-length sequences via direct comparison of aligned features, and 2) merits of the model-based approaches that can effectively capture the class-specific patterns or trends. Furthermore, the low-dimensional modeling of the latent base sequence naturally provides a way to discover the intrinsic manifold structure possibly retained in the observed data, leading to an unsupervised manifold learning for sequence data. The benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated on a comprehensive set of evaluations with both synthetic and real-world sequence data sets.

   Schizophrenia Diagnosis: A Systematic Review
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
AB Non-invasive measurements of brain function and structure as neuroimaging in patients with mental illnesses are useful and powerful tools for studying discriminatory biomarkers. To date, functional MRI (fMRI), structural MRI (sMRI) represent the most used techniques to provide multiple perspectives on brain function, structure, and their connectivity. Recently, there has been rising attention in using machine-learning (ML) techniques, pattern recognition methods, applied to neuroimaging data to characterize disease-related alterations in brain structure and function and to identify phenotypes, for example, for translation into clinical and early diagnosis. Our aim was to provide a systematic review according to the PRISMA statement of Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques in making diagnostic discrimination between SCZ patients from healthy controls using neuroimaging data from functional MRI as input. We included studies using SVM as ML techniques with patients diagnosed with Schizophrenia. From an initial sample of 660 papers, at the end of the screening process, 22 articles were selected, and included in our review. This technique can be a valid, inexpensive, and non-invasive support to recognize and detect patients at an early stage, compared to any currently available assessment or clinical diagnostic methods in order to save crucial time. The higher accuracy of SVM models and the new integrated methods of ML techniques could play a decisive role to detect patients with SCZ or other major psychiatric disorders in the early stages of the disease or to potentially determine their neuroimaging risk factors in the near future.

The force ratio between the slave and master axes is generated, and experimental results show that the driving currents for the master/slave linear motor axes are lower when the SFFMB synchronous control function is enabled. This function makes the machine move smoothly even when deviations from squareness occur. These design approaches aim to improve the accuracy and performance at high speed to reduce the working cycle time for a machine with multiple degrees of freedom. This article makes three contributions to the literature. First, by considering the skew force issue, a new SFFMB synchronous gantry-type design is proposed to prevent gantry skew phenomenon. Second, to ensure exact omnidirectional linear movement, a novel hybrid TCP mode is proposed to decouple coordinate transformations into individual translation and rotation components. Third, based on the SFFMB synchronous control strategy and the hybrid TCP mode, we propose an effective calibration method to enhance the TCP accuracy. The new SFFMB synchronous gantry-type design and the accurate hybrid TCP mode are experimentally verified and demonstrated using a hybrid gantry-robot machine developed in our laboratory, which is based on our proposed synchronous control strategy.

TI Quantification of structural changes in the corpus callosumin children
   with profound hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury
SO PEDIATRIC RADIOLOGY
AB Birth-related acute profound hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury has specific patterns of damage including the paracentral lobules.
   To test the hypothesis that there is anatomically coherent regional volume loss of the corpus callosum as a result of this hemispheric abnormality.
   Study subjects included 13 children with proven acute profound hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury and 13 children with developmental delay but no brain abnormalities. A computerised system divided the corpus callosum into 100 segments, measuring each width. Principal component analysis grouped the widths into contiguous anatomical regions. We conducted analysis of variance of corpus callosum widths as well as support vector machine stratification into patient groups.
   There was statistically significant narrowing of the mid-posterior body and genu of the corpus callosum in children with hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury. Support vector machine analysis yielded over 95% accuracy in patient group stratification using the corpus callosum centile widths.
   Focal volume loss is seen in the corpus callosum of children with hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury secondary to loss of commissural fibres arising in the paracentral lobules. Support vector machine stratification into the hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury group or the control group on the basis of corpus callosum width is highly accurate and points towards rapid clinical translation of this technique as a potential biomarker of hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury.

TI Classifying chemical mode of action using gene networks and machine
   learning: A case study with the herbicide linuron
SO COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY D-GENOMICS & PROTEOMICS
AB The herbicide linuron (LIN) is an endocrine disruptor with an anti-androgenic mode of action. The objectives of this study were to (1) improve knowledge of androgen and anti-androgen signaling in the teleostean ovary and to (2) assess the ability of gene networks and machine learning to classify LIN as an anti-androgen using transcriptomic data. Ovarian explants from vitellogenic fathead minnows (FHMs) were exposed to three concentrations of either 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), flutamide (FLUT), or LIN for 12 h. Ovaries exposed to DHT showed a significant increase in 17 beta-estradiol (E-2) production while FLUT and LIN had no effect on E-2. To improve understanding of androgen receptor signaling in the ovary, a reciprocal gene expression network was constructed for DHT and FLUT using pathway analysis and these data suggested that steroid metabolism, translation, and DNA replication are processes regulated through AR signaling in the ovary. Sub-network enrichment analysis revealed that FLUT and LIN shared more regulated gene networks in common compared to DHT. Using transcriptomic datasets from different fish species, machine learning algorithms classified LIN successfully with other anti-androgens. This study advances knowledge regarding molecular signaling cascades in the ovary that are responsive to androgens and anti-androgens and provides proof of concept that gene network analysis and machine learning can classify priority chemicals using experimental transcriptomic data collected from different fish species.

AB Detecting exoplanets and measuring their masses is a priority for astrophysics. Stellar astrometry is capable of detecting and unequivocally measure exoplanet masses, solving the system inclination ambiguity that constrains the accuracy of radial velocity techniques. The astrometric signal of an Earth-like planet around nearby stars is around similar to 1 micro-arcsecond (mu as), while current instrumentation (Hubble, GAIA) reaches 25 mu as at best. After photon noise, the main limiting factor to measure such astrometric signals is related to the optical distortions that arise from small deformations of the optical system. A novel technique, called diffractive pupil, allows to obtain distortion-calibrated astrometry vectors from the image. Currently, analytical methods are being used to extract the distortion map from the diffractive features. However, different sources of noise limit the accuracy of the algorithm. In this paper, we test the ability of machine learning to detect telescope pointing errors and astrometry signals injected in simulated images, as a first step towards distortion calibration correction using machine learning. Our image simulator generates a star field modified by telescope pointing errors, optical distortion, and common noise sources such as photon noise, flat field, read out, and dark current. We evaluate the performance of legacy analytical algorithms for astrometry and compare it with the results of machine learning runs. We find that this type of algorithms show better results than the analytical approach by two orders of magnitude when detecting astrometric signals in images with telescope pointing error perturbations, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of similar to 1.7x10(-6) px for the predicted target star translations in comparison with the similar to 5 x 10(-4) px MAE obtained by the traditional approach.

TI Machine learning-empowered cis-diol metabolic fingerprinting enables
   precise diagnosis of primary liver cancer
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Cis-diol metabolic reprogramming evolves during primary liver cancer (PLC) initiation and progression. However, owing to the low concentrations and highly structural heterogeneity of cis-diols in vivo, severe interference from complex biofluids and limited profiling coverage of existing methods, in-depth profiling of cis-diol metabolites and linking their specific changes with PLC remain challenging. Besides, due to the low specificity of widely used protein biomarkers, accurate classification of PLC from hepatitis still represents an unmet need in clinical diagnostics. Herein, to high-coverage profile cis-diols and explore the translational potential of them as biomarkers, a machine learning-empowered boronate affinity extraction-solvent evaporation assisted enrichment-mass spectrometry (MLE-BESE-MS) was developed. A single analytical platform integrated with multiple complementary functions, including pH-controlled boronate affinity extraction, solvent evaporation-assisted enrichment and nanoelectrospray ionization-based cis-diol identification, was constructed, which significantly improved the metabolite coverage. Meanwhile, by virtue of machine learning (principal components analysis, orthogonal partial least-squares discrimination analysis and random forest), collected cis-diols were statistically screened to extract efficient features for precise PLC diagnosis, and the results outperform the routinely used protein biomarker-based methods both in sensitivity (87.5% vs. less than 70%) and specificity (85.7% vs. ca. 80%). This machine learning-empowered integrated MS platform advanced the targeted metabolic analysis for early cancer diagnosis, rendering great promise for clinical translation.

TI Characterization of English Braille Patterns Using Automated Tools and
   RICA Based Feature Extraction Methods
SO SENSORS
AB Braille is used as a mode of communication all over the world. Technological advancements are transforming the way Braille is read and written. This study developed an English Braille pattern identification system using robust machine learning techniques using the English Braille Grade-1 dataset. English Braille Grade-1 dataset was collected using a touchscreen device from visually impaired students of the National Special Education School Muzaffarabad. For better visualization, the dataset was divided into two classes as class 1 (1-13) (a-m) and class 2 (14-26) (n-z) using 26 Braille English characters. A position-free braille text entry method was used to generate synthetic data. N = 2512 cases were included in the final dataset. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees (DT) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) with Reconstruction Independent Component Analysis (RICA) and PCA-based feature extraction methods were used for Braille to English character recognition. Compared to PCA, Random Forest (RF) algorithm and Sequential methods, better results were achieved using the RICA-based feature extraction method. The evaluation metrics used were the True Positive Rate (TPR), True Negative Rate (TNR), Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), False Positive Rate (FPR), Total Accuracy, Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC) and F1-Score. A statistical test was also performed to justify the significance of the results.

TI Animal behavior and animal personality from a non-human perspective:
   Getting help from the machine
SO PATTERNS
AB We can now track the position of every fly's leg or immerse a tiny fish inside a virtual world by monitoring its gaze in real time. Yet capturing animals' posture or gaze is not like understanding their behavior. Instead, behaviors are still often interpreted by human observers in an anthropomorphic manner. Even newer tools that automatically classify behaviors rely on human observers for the choice of behaviors. In this perspective, we suggest a roadmap toward a "human-free" interpretation of behavior. We present several recent advances, including our recent work on animal personalities. Personality both underlies behavioral differences among individuals and is consistent over time. A mathematical formulation of this idea has allowed us to measure mouse traits objectively, map behaviors across species (humans included), and explore the biological basis of behavior. Our goal is to enable "machine translation'' of raw movement data into intelligible human concepts en route to improving our understanding of animals and people.

AB Machine Learning (ML) can improve the diagnosis, treatment decisions, and understanding of cancer. However, the low explainability of how "black box" ML methods produce their output hinders their clinical adoption. In this paper, we used data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry to generate a ML-based model to predict 10-year overall survival of breast cancer patients. Then, we used Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to interpret the model's predictions. We found that, overall, LIME and SHAP tend to be consistent when explaining the contribution of different features. Nevertheless, the feature ranges where they have a mismatch can also be of interest, since they can help us identifying "turning points" where features go from favoring survived to favoring deceased (or vice versa). Explainability techniques can pave the way for better acceptance of ML techniques. However, their evaluation and translation to real-life scenarios need to be researched further.

TI FNLP-ONT: A feasible ontology for improving NLP tasks in Persian

AB Natural language processing is a composition of several error-prone and challenging tasks, including part of speech tagging, word sense disambiguation, named entity recognition, and compound verb detection. Studying intrasentence relations and roles is essential to improve the mentioned subtasks. Semi-automatic schemes such as ontologies can be applied to clarify word's dependencies. This paper presents an ontology that is targeting to improve POS tagging, WSD, NER, and compound verb detection in Persian with extra properties that may ameliorate machine translation. The ontology is tested in combinations with several state-of-art algorithms on Dadegan corpus. The results show that coping semantic analysis with machine learning methods enhance relation detection and consequently precision of the mentioned subtasks, which is not widely addressed in Persian. Furthermore, the experimental results declare that the accuracy rate increases between 4.5 and 23% for different tasks.

TI Machine Learning Models for Classifying High- and Low-Grade Gliomas: A
   Systematic Review and Quality of Reporting Analysis
SO FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
AB Objectives: To systematically review, assess the reporting quality of, and discuss improvement opportunities for studies describing machine learning (ML) models for glioma grade prediction. Methods: This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses of Diagnostic Test Accuracy (PRISMA-DTA) statement. A systematic search was performed in September 2020, and repeated in January 2021, on four databases: Embase, Medline, CENTRAL, and Web of Science Core Collection. Publications were screened in Covidence, and reporting quality was measured against the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) Statement. Descriptive statistics were calculated using GraphPad Prism 9. Results: The search identified 11,727 candidate articles with 1,135 articles undergoing full text review and 85 included in analysis. 67 (79%) articles were published between 2018-2021. The mean prediction accuracy of the best performing model in each study was 0.89 +/- 0.09. The most common algorithm for conventional machine learning studies was Support Vector Machine (mean accuracy: 0.90 +/- 0.07) and for deep learning studies was Convolutional Neural Network (mean accuracy: 0.91 +/- 0.10). Only one study used both a large training dataset (n > 200) and external validation (accuracy: 0.72) for their model. The mean adherence rate to TRIPOD was 44.5% +/- 11.1%, with poor reporting adherence for model performance (0%), abstracts (0%), and titles (0%). Conclusions: The application of ML to glioma grade prediction has grown substantially, with ML model studies reporting high predictive accuracies but lacking essential metrics and characteristics for assessing model performance. Several domains, including generalizability and reproducibility, warrant further attention to enable translation into clinical practice.

AB This paper tackles the problem of open domain factual Arabic question answering (QA) using Wikipedia as our knowledge source. This constrains the answer of any question to be a span of text in Wikipedia. Open domain QA for Arabic entails three challenges: annotated QA datasets in Arabic, large scale efficient information retrieval and machine reading comprehension. To deal with the lack of Arabic QA datasets we present the Arabic Reading Comprehension Dataset (ARCD) composed of 1,395 questions posed by crowdworkers on Wikipedia articles, and a machine translation of the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (Arabic-SQuAD). Our system for open domain question answering in Arabic (SOQAL) is based on two components: (1) a document retriever using a hierarchical TF-IDF approach and (2) a neural reading comprehension model using the pre-trained bi-directional transformer BERT. Our experiments on ARCD indicate the effectiveness of our approach with our BERT-based reader achieving a 61.3 F1 score, and our open domain system SOQAL achieving a 27.6 F1 score.

TI Dynamic timber cell recognition using two-dimensional image measurement
   machine
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB Image motion blur and defocus blur often occur when there is a relative motion between the imaging camera and the detected object. In this paper, we propose a robust timber cell recognition scheme using the low quality color timber cell images with the above-mentioned image blurs. First, a novel two-dimensional image measurement machine is devised, to obtain the object images sequentially by using a color camera. Second, the image-moment-based blur invariant features are calculated. Third, timber cell recognition is performed by using the computed Euclidean distance based on the moment invariants. We have experimentally proved that the effective use of image blur information improves the recognition accuracy of camera-captured timber cells. Moreover, the allowed maximum translation speed of the moving gallery is also discussed theoretically and experimentally. This scheme can identify the timber species by means of the cell recognition so as to judge the physical property and economic value of different timber species correctly.

TI Building and using a lexical knowledge base of near-synonym differences
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Choosing the wrong word in a machine translation or natural language generation system can convey unwanted connotations, implications, or attitudes. The choice between near-synonyms such as error, mistake, slip, and blunder-words that share the same core meaning, but differ in their nuances-can be made only if knowledge about their differences is available. We present a method to automatically acquire a new type of lexical resource: a knowledge base of near-synonym differences. We develop an unsupervised decision-list algorithm that learns extraction patterns from a special dictionary of synonym differences. The patterns are then used to extract knowledge from the text of the dictionary.
   The initial knowledge base is later enriched with information from other machine-readable dictionaries. Information about the collocational behavior of the near-synonyms is acquired from free text. The knowledge base is used by Xenon, a natural language generation system that shows how the new lexical resource can be used to choose the best near-synonym in specific situations.

AB A unified fault-modeling approach for machines with varying capacity, rating, size is of interest in automating production facilities. Building a unified fault-model is challenging due the presence of system specific attributes in the features derived. We explore how the effect of system specific attributes from the feature vectors can be minimized to improve the performance of system independent fault models(SIFM). In this work, we used three-phase synchronous generators with 3kVA and 5kVA ratings, for detecting the stator inter-turn short circuit faults. Our baseline-system uses statistical features derived from the current signal, with a support vector machine(SVM) used as a backend-classifier.
   In the first approach, we consider the system specific attributes as a nuisance and remove it using nuisance attribute projection (NAP) algorithm. We obtained a performance improvement of 19.63%, 831% and 11.80% classification accuracy for R,Y, B phases respectively, over the baseline-system.
   When we use a SVM backend-classifier, it is required that the features match the kernels used with the SVM. This often limits the performance of the classifier. Next, we explored convolutional neural networks(CNN) with the raw current signal as its input. Max-pooling is a technique used to minimize the size of feature map, simultaneously it construct a condensed feature map by selecting translation-invariant features. Thus, CNNs have the ability to absorb the irrelevant system specific variations, and improve the SIFM performance. It is observed that the CNN based SIFM outperforms NAP-SVM model by 12.56%, 1037% and 20.15%, for R, Y, B phase fault models respectively.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEM ASSURANCE ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT
AB In order to explore the application of robot welding machine technology in modern buildings, this paper analyzes the robot welding technology, combines machine vision to analyze the visual calibration of the welding robot, and corrects the calibration results through experimental data to obtain the robot hand-eye parameters. Moreover, this paper uses Rodriguez transformation to convert the rotation vector into a rotation matrix and combines with the translation vector to obtain the conversion matrix from the camera coordinate system to the calibration board coordinate system. In addition, this paper combines the simulation test to evaluate the technical application effect of robot welding technology. From the simulation results, it can be seen that robot welding technology can meet the welding needs of modern buildings. Finally, this paper analyzes the application of robotic welding technology in modern buildings. The research results show that robot welding technology can play an important role in modern buildings.

AB We present a section boundary detection framework specifically for clinical dictations. Detection is cast as a semi-supervised binary tagging problem and solved using a neural network model composed of a stack of embeddings, unidirectional long-short term memory units (LSTMs), and sigmoid outputs. Physicians' dictations documenting clinical encounters are typically transcribed using automatic speech recognition (ASR) followed by a post-processor (PP) to transform the raw text into written reports. Section boundary detection can be performed directly upon the raw text to better anticipate the post-processing stage: we describe an architecture for real-time ("live") ASR use in which sections detected by the tagger are sent individually to a machine translation-based PP (for which continuous execution in real time would not be possible). Our implementation of section detection makes viable the use of a sophisticated machine learning PP in a live dictation paradigm.

AB Words are the important building blocks of every language. Morphological generator is used to get the inflected form of a word, given its root word and a set of properties such as lexical category and morphological properties. Morphological Generation and analysis are necessary for developing computational grammars as well as machine translation systems. This paper presents a morphological generator for Malayalam nouns using Memory Based Language Processing (MBLP) approach. MBLP is an approach to language processing based on exemplar storage during learning, and analogical reasoning during processing. For training the system, a training corpus is created. It contains the basic examples of root words and their features. The feature set for this Malayalam noun generation system includes number, case, and the last syllable of the root word. Tilburg Memory based Learner (TiMBL) is used for training the system. The system doesn't require a dictionary or rules for its working. It gives a satisfactory result, having an accuracy of 93.68%

AB Domain-specific design flows can enable an efficient path to implementation, as well as making the design process intuitive and the designs reusable. When targeting FPGAs, there are few techniques in high level synthesis that enable thorough exploration of the inherent flexibility of the FPGA fabric as an implementation medium. In this paper, we propose a new methodology, based on micro-coded data paths, that enables design space exploration of processing engine architectures implemented in programmable logic that range from a fixed finite state machine to a soft processor. As a use case, these processing engines can be embedded within programmable logic threads that are used to carry out network packet processing. We demonstrate the application of this methodology on a network address translation application, and show that micro-coded data paths indeed enable both human designers and automated tools to explore the design space in a structured way, thus exploiting the full potential of the FPGA technology.

TI PROGRESS IN THE APPLICATION OF NATURAL-LANGUAGE PROCESSING TO
   INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL TASKS
SO COMPUTER JOURNAL
AB Techniques of automatic natural language processing have been under development since the earliest computing machines, and in recent years these techniques have proven to be robust, reliable and efficient enough to lead to commercial products in many areas. The applications include machine translation, natural language interfaces and the stylistic analysis of texts but NLP techniques have also been applied to other computing tasks besides these. In this paper we will examine and review recent progress in using the lexical, syntactic, semantic and discourse levels of the language analysis for tasks like automatic and semi-automatic indexing of text, text retrieval, text abstracting and summarisation, thesaurus generation from text corpus and conceptual information retrieval. Our own work on the application of syntactic analysis to the matching and ranking of phrases using structured representations of texts, will be included in the overview. Finally, the prospects for gains in terms of overall retrieval effectiveness or quality will be discussed.

TI Memristor-Based Circuit Demonstration of Gated Recurrent Unit for

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON DEVICES
AB Analysis of time-series data can be used to recognize long-term trends and make correct forecasts. Compared with artificial neural network (ANN), gated recurrent unit (GRU) can process time-series signals and has a wide range of applications in natural language processing, speech recognition, machine translation, and so on. However, GRU models suffer from bottlenecks in hardware implementation due to the large number of parameters and circuit complexity. Here, we build a memristor-based GRU unit with full circuit function yet fewer input-output parameters. Inclusion of the as-designed GRU unit into predictable neural network allows the recognition and prediction of handwritten characters with the accuracies of 93% and 92%, respectively. The implementation of GRU network with memristor circuit extends its capability in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

AB Text transcripts without punctuation or sentence boundaries are hard to comprehend for both humans and machines. Punctuation marks play a vital role by providing meaning to the sentence and incorrect use or placement of punctuation marks can often alter it. This can impact downstream tasks such as language translation and understanding, pronoun resolution, text summarization, etc. for humans and machines. An automated punctuation restoration (APR) system with minimal human intervention can improve comprehension of text and help users write better. In this paper we describe a multitask modeling approach as a system to restore punctuation in multiple high resource - Germanic (English and German), Romanic (French)- and low resource languages - Indo-Aryan (Hindi) Dravidian (Tamil) - that does not require extensive knowledge of grammar or syntax of a given language for both spoken and written form of text. For German language and the given Indic based languages this is the first towards restoring punctuation and can serve as a baseline for future work.

AB Standardized evaluation measures have aided in the progress of machine learning approaches in disciplines such as computer vision and machine translation. In this paper, we make the case that robotic learning would also benefit from benchmarking, and present a template for a vision-based manipulation benchmark. Our benchmark is built on "REPLAB," a reproducible and self-contained hardware stack (robot arm, camera, and workspace) that costs about 2000 USD and occupies a cuboid of size 70x40x60 cm. Each REPLAB cell may be assembled within a few hours. Through this low-cost, compact design, REPLAB aims to drive wide participation by lowering the barrier to entry into robotics and to enable easy scaling to many robots. We envision REPLAB as a framework for reproducible research across manipulation tasks, and as a step in this direction, we define a grasping benchmark consisting of a task definition, evaluation protocol, performance measures, and a dataset of over 50,000 grasp attempts. We implement, evaluate, and analyze several previously proposed grasping approaches to establish baselines for this benchmark.

TI An Approach to the Design of Specific Hardware Circuits From C Programs
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB This article presents an approach that helps convert a given C program into a hardware implementation for a digital circuit design. Based on and extended from the concept of hierarchical finite-state machines (HFSMs), four built-in HFSM templates, namely Seq, Par, Loop and Atomic, are proposed and used as the elementary components of a hardware design. A guideline on the refinement of a C program is also proposed; the refined C functions are compiled into HFSMs that in turn generate synthesizable hardware description language (HDL) code as the final design. A set of HFSMs is viewed as an intermediate representation between C and HDL and can be functionally simulated. Two modeling levels, i.e. cycle-accurate and cycle-approximated, are supported. A compilation technique based on syntax-directed translations is used to automate the proposed approach. Experimental results on several well-known algorithmic benchmarks show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TI Retrosynthetic Reaction Prediction Using Neural Sequence-to-Sequence
   Models
SO ACS CENTRAL SCIENCE
AB We describe a fully data driven model that learns to perform a retrosynthetic reaction prediction task, which is treated as a sequence-to-sequence mapping problem. The end-to-end trained model has an encoder-decoder architecture that consists of two recurrent neural networks, which has previously shown great success in solving other sequence-to-sequence prediction tasks such as machine translation. The model is trained on 50,000 experimental reaction examples from the United States patent literature, which span 10 broad reaction types that are commonly used by medicinal chemists. We find that our model performs comparably with a rule-based expert system baseline model, and also overcomes certain limitations associated with rule-based expert systems and with any machine learning approach that contains a rule-based expert system component. Our model provides an important first step toward solving the challenging problem of computational retrosynthetic analysis.

TI Computational mechanisms for metaphor in languages: A survey
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Metaphor computation has attracted more and more attention because metaphor, to some extent, is the focus of mind and language mechanism. However, it encounters problems not only due to the rich expressive power of natural language but also due to cognitive nature of human being. Therefore machine-understanding of metaphor is now becoming a bottle-neck in natural language processing and machine translation. This paper first suggests how a metaphor is understood and then presents a survey of current computational approaches, in terms of their linguistic historical roots, underlying foundations, methods and techniques currently used, advantages, limitations, and future trends. A comparison between metaphors in English and Chinese languages is also introduced because compared with development in English language Chinese metaphor computation is just at its starting stage. So a separate summarization of current progress made in Chinese metaphor computation is presented. As a conclusion, a few suggestions are proposed for further research on metaphor computation especially on Chinese metaphor computation.

TI Transfer learning: a friendly introduction
SO JOURNAL OF BIG DATA
AB Infinite numbers of real-world applications use Machine Learning (ML) techniques to develop potentially the best data available for the users. Transfer learning (TL), one of the categories under ML, has received much attention from the research communities in the past few years. Traditional ML algorithms perform under the assumption that a model uses limited data distribution to train and test samples. These conventional methods predict target tasks undemanding and are applied to small data distribution. However, this issue conceivably is resolved using TL. TL is acknowledged for its connectivity among the additional testing and training samples resulting in faster output with efficient results. This paper contributes to the domain and scope of TL, citing situational use based on their periods and a few of its applications. The paper provides an in-depth focus on the techniques; Inductive TL, Transductive TL, Unsupervised TL, which consists of sample selection, and domain adaptation, followed by contributions and future directions.

AB Code summarization aims to automatically generate functionality descriptions of code snippets. Faithful metrics are needed to measure to which degree the machine generated summaries capture the semantics of the code snippets. Most commonly used metrics in code summarization, such as BLEU-4, METEOR, and ROUGE-L, originate from machine translation and text summarization, and have constantly been found to be inconsistent with human assessment. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation metric, Consensus-based Code Summarization Evaluation (CCSE), which assigns different semantic weights to the n-grams of the summary. We also provide an algorithm to match the n-gram pairs from the reference and candidate based on the similarities. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed metric, we collect summary pairs from two public Java datasets and calculate the correlation coefficients between CCSE and the human evaluations. The experiment results show that, compared with BLEU-4, METEOR, and ROUGE-L, CCSE is more consistent with the scores assessed by human developers.

SO MATTER
AB Assessing the mechanical stability of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is critical to bring these materials to any application. Here, we derive the first interactive map of the structure-mechanical landscape of MOFs by performing a multi-level computational analysis. First, we used high-throughput molecular simulations for 3,385 MOFs containing 41 distinct network topologies. Second, we developed a freely available machine-learning algorithm to automatically predict the mechanical properties of MOFs. For distinct regions of the high-throughput space, in-depth analysis based on in operando molecular dynamics simulations reveals the loss-of-crystallinity pressure within a given topology. The overarching mechanical screening approach presented here reveals the sensitivity on structural parameters such as topology, coordination characteristics and the nature of the building blocks, and paves the way for computational as well as experimental researchers to assess and design MOFs with enhanced mechanical stability to accelerate the translation of MOFs to industrial applications.

TI Deep-learning-based inverse design model for intelligent discovery of
   organic molecules
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB The discovery of high-performance functional materials is crucial for overcoming technical issues in modern industries. Extensive efforts have been devoted toward accelerating and facilitating this process, not only experimentally but also from the viewpoint of materials design. Recently, machine learning has attracted considerable attention, as it can provide rational guidelines for efficient material exploration without time-consuming iterations or prior human knowledge. In this regard, here we develop an inverse design model based on a deep encoder-decoder architecture for targeted molecular design. Inspired by neural machine language translation, the deep neural network encoder extracts hidden features between molecular structures and their material properties, while the recurrent neural network decoder reconstructs the extracted features into new molecular structures having the target properties. In material design tasks, the proposed fully data-driven methodology successfully learned design rules from the given databases and generated promising light-absorbing molecules and host materials for a phosphorescent organic light-emitting diode by creating new ligands and combinatorial rules.

AB In this paper, we propose a robust state-based structured support vector machine (SVM) tracking algorithm combined with incremental principal component analysis (PCA). Different from the current structured SVM for tracking, our method directly learns and predicts the object's states and not the 2-D translation transformation during tracking. We define the object's virtual state to combine the state-based structured SVM and incremental PCA. The virtual state is considered as the most confident state of the object in every frame. The incremental PCA is used to update the virtual feature vector corresponding to the virtual state and the principal subspace of the object's feature vectors. In order to improve the accuracy of the prediction, all the feature vectors are projected onto the principal subspace in the learning and prediction process of the state-based structured SVM. Experimental results on several challenging video sequences validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is an Internet based infrastructure of smart machines/objects/things where each machine has the capability of self-configuration and interact/communicate with physical objects based on standard and interoperable communication protocols. The basic attributes of the physical objects is having identities. They are also having virtual personalities using intelligent interfaces and seamlessly integrated in-to the current evolving information networks. Indeed with this heavy open interaction amongst the objects come issues of reliable and secure object for IoT services. Hence, this paper presents a novel conceptual cross layer based architecture which ensures proper usage of Adaptive Interface Translation Table (AITT) with the new security features for secure IoT services with the help of five layers. Each such layer has a specific responsibility to process their assigned task and forward data to the next layers for further processing and inferences. Finally, we present a conceptual solution and visual aspect for security of IoT application and services.

AB Evaluation of accuracy of natural language processing (NLP) engines plays an important role in their development and improvement. Such evaluation usually takes place at a per-engine level. For example, there are evaluation methods for engines such as speech recognition, machine translation, story boundary detection. etc. Many real-world applications require combinations of these functions. This has become possible now with NLP engines attaining sufficient accuracy to be able to combine them for complex tasks. However, it is not evident how the accuracy of output of such aggregates of engines will be evaluated. We present an evaluation methodology to address this problem. The key contribution of our work is an extensible methodology that narrows down possible combinations of machine outputs and ground truths to be compared at various stages in an aggregate of interoperating engines. We also describe two example evaluation modules that we developed following this methodology.

TI Artificial intelligence in diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis and
   prediction of arthroplasty outcomes: a review
SO ARTHROPLASTY
AB Background Artificial intelligence is an emerging technology with rapid growth and increasing applications in orthopaedics. This study aimed to summarize the existing evidence and recent developments of artificial intelligence in diagnosing knee osteoarthritis and predicting outcomes of total knee arthroplasty. Methods PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched for articles published in peer-reviewed journals between January 1, 2010 and May 31, 2021. The terms included: 'artificial intelligence', 'machine learning', 'knee', 'osteoarthritis', and 'arthroplasty'. We selected studies focusing on the use of AI in diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis, prediction of the need for total knee arthroplasty, and prediction of outcomes of total knee arthroplasty. Non-English language articles and articles with no English translation were excluded. A reviewer screened the articles for the relevance to the research questions and strength of evidence. Results Machine learning models demonstrated promising results for automatic grading of knee radiographs and predicting the need for total knee arthroplasty. The artificial intelligence algorithms could predict postoperative outcomes regarding patient-reported outcome measures, patient satisfaction and short-term complications. Important weaknesses of current artificial intelligence algorithms included the lack of external validation, the limitations of inherent biases in clinical data, the requirement of large datasets in training, and significant research gaps in the literature. Conclusions Artificial intelligence offers a promising solution to improve detection and management of knee osteoarthritis. Further research to overcome the weaknesses of machine learning models may enhance reliability and allow for future use in routine healthcare settings.

SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB The emergence of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) has revolutionized the Internet. Using SDN, network devices can be controlled from a centralized, programmable control plane that is decoupled from their data plane, whereas with NFV, network functions (such as network address translation, firewall, and intrusion detection) can be virtualized instead of being implemented on proprietary hardware. In addition, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques will be key to automating network operations and enhancing customer service. Many of the challenges behind SDN and NFV are currently being investigated in several projects all over the world using AI and ML techniques, such as AI- and software-based networking, autonomic networking, and policy-based network management. Contributions to this Special Issue come from the above areas of research. Following a rigorous review process, four excellent articles were accepted that address and go beyond many of the challenges mentioned above.

TI Automatic weaving method for three-dimensional composite preforms using
   vision system
SO TEXTILE RESEARCH JOURNAL
AB Three-dimensional composite preform is the main structure of fiber-reinforced composites. During the weaving process of large-sized three-dimensional composite preform, relative rotation or translation between the fiber feeder and guided array occurs before feeding. Besides, the weaving needles can be at different heights after moving out from the guided array. These problems are mostly detected and adjusted manually. To make the weaving process more precise and efficient, we propose machine vision-based methods which could realize accurate estimation and adjustment of the relative position-pose between the fiber feeder and guided array, and make the needles pressing process automatic by recognizing the position of the weaving needles. The results show that the estimation error of relative position-pose is within 5%, and the rate of unrecognized weaving needles is 2%. Our proposed methods improve the automation level of weaving, and are conducive to the development of preform forming toward digital manufacturing.

TI Classification of Autism Spectrum Disorder Using Random Support Vector
   Machine Cluster
SO FRONTIERS IN GENETICS
AB Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is mainly reflected in the communication and language barriers, difficulties in social communication, and it is a kind of neurological developmental disorder. Most researches have used the machine learning method to classify patients and normal controls, among which support vector machines (SVM) are widely employed. But the classification accuracy of SVM is usually low, due to the usage of a single SVM as classifier. Thus, we used multiple SVMs to classify ASD patients and typical controls (TC). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of 46 TC and 61 ASD patients were obtained from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database. Only 84 of 107 subjects are utilized in experiments because the translation or rotation of 7 TC and 16 ASD patients has surpassed 2 mm or 2. Then the random SVM cluster was proposed to distinguish TC and ASD. The results show that this method has an excellent classification performance based on all the features. Furthermore, the accuracy based on the optimal feature set could reach to 96.15%. Abnormal brain regions could also be found, such as inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) (orbital and opercula part), hippocampus, and precuneus. It is indicated that the method of random SVM cluster may apply to the auxiliary diagnosis of ASD.

AB It is becoming increasingly difficult to know who is working on what and how in computational studies of Dialectal Arabic. This study comes to chart the field by conducting a systematic literature review that is intended to give insight into the most and least popular research areas, dialects, machine learning approaches, neural network input features, data types, datasets, system evaluation criteria, publication venues, and publication trends. It is a review that is guided by the norms of systematic reviews. It has taken account of all the research that adopted a computational approach to dialectal Arabic identification and detection and that was published between 2000 and 2020. It collected, analyzed, and collated this research, discovered its trends, and identified research gaps. It revealed, inter alia, that our research effort has not been directed evenly between speech and text or between the vernaculars; there is some bias favoring text over speech, regional varieties over individual vernaculars, and Egyptian over all other vernaculars. Furthermore, there is a clear preference for shallow machine learning approaches, for the use of n-grams, TF-IDF, and MFCC as neural network features, and for accuracy as a statistical measure of validation of results. This paper also pointed to some glaring gaps in the research: (1) total neglect of Mauritanian and Bahraini in the continuous Arabic language area and of such enclave varieties as Anatolian Arabic, Khuzistan Arabic, Khurasan Arabic, Uzbekistan Arabic, the Subsaharan Arabic of Nigeria and Chad, Djibouti Arabic, Cypriot Arabic and Maltese; (2) scarcity of city dialect resources; (3) rarity of linguistic investigations that would complement our research; (4) and paucity of deep machine learning experimentation.

TI Predicting Thioflavin Fluorescence of Retinal Amyloid Deposits
   Associated With Alzheimer's Disease from Their Polarimetric Properties
SO TRANSLATIONAL VISION SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Purpose: To use machine learning in those with brain amyloid to predict thioflavin fluorescence (indicative of amyloid) of retinal deposits from their interactions with polarized light.
   Methods: We imaged 933 retinal deposits in 28 subjects with post mortem evidence of brain amyloid using thioflavin fluorescence and polarization sensitive microscopy. Means and standard deviations of 14 polarimetric properties were input to machine learning algorithms. Two oversampling strategies were applied to overcome data imbalance. Three machine learning algorithms: linear discriminant analysis, supporting vector machine, and random forest (RF) were trained to predict thioflavin positive deposits. For each method; accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were computed.
   Results: For the polarimetric positive deposits, using 1 oversampling method, RF had the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.986), which was not different from that with the second oversampling method. RF had 95% accuracy, 94% sensitivity, and 97% specificity. After including deposits with no polarimetric signals, polarimetry correctly predicted 93% of thioflavin positive deposits. Linear retardance and linear anisotropy were the dominant polarimetric properties in RF with 1 oversampling method, and no polarimetric properties were dominant in the second method.
   Conclusions: Thioflavin positivity of retinal amyloid deposits can be predicted from their images in polarized light. Polarimetry is a promising dye-free method of detecting amyloid deposits in ex vivo retinal tissue. Further testing is required for translation to live eye imaging.
   Translational Relevance: This dye-free method distinguishes retinal amyloid deposits, a promising biomarker of Alzheimer's disease, in human retinas imaged with polarimetry.

TI Heart Sound Signal Classification Algorithm: A Combination of Wavelet
   Scattering Transform and Twin Support Vector Machine
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB By classifying the heart sound signals, it can provide very favorable clinical information to the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. According to the characteristics of heart sound signals which are complex and difficult to classify and recognize, a new method of feature extraction and classification about heart sound signal is proposed by a combination of wavelet scattering transform and twin support vector machine in this paper. The method is as follows: The heart sound signal data set is firstly divided into two parts, one as a training set and the other as a testing set. Then the wavelet scattering transform is applied to the heart sound signals in the training set and the testing set. The scattering transform is a new time-frequency analysis method. It overcomes the shortcomings of the traditional wavelet transform which has the time-shift changes. It has the advantages of translation invariance and elastic deformation stability. Thus obtain the scattering feature matrix of the heart sound signal. Due to the large dimension of scattering feature matrix, this paper uses multidimensional scaling (MDS) method to reduce the dimension. This method is compared with the classical dimension reduction method-principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, the dimensionality-reduced feature matrix is input into the twin support vector machine (TWSVM) for training. After training the classifier to get the optimal parameters, the dimensionality-reduced scattering feature matrix of the testing signal is input into the classifier for testing. Experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the proposed method can reach 98% or more, and the running time is greatly reduced compared with support vector machine (SVM).

AB We show that there exists a binary PSPACE-complete language L such that its unary coded version L' is in ASPACE(dm) (log log n), i.e., L' is accepted by an alternating Turing machine using an initially delimited worktape of size log log n. As a consequence, the standard translation between unary languages accepted with log log n space and binary languages accepted with log n space works for alternating machines if and only if P = PSPACE.
   In general, if a binary language L is in DTIMESPACE(2(n) . n(O(1)), n(O(1))), i.e., if L is accepted by a deterministic Turing machine in 2(n) . n(O(1)) time and, simultaneously, in n(O(1)) space, then its unary coded version L' is in ASPACE(dm) (log log n). In turn, if a unary L' is in ASPACE(dm) (log log n), then its binary coded version L is in DTIME(2(n) . n(O(1))) boolean AND DSPACE(n(O(1))), and also in NTIMESPACE(2(n) . n(O(1)), n(O(1))).
   This unexpected power of sublogarithmic space follows from the fact that, with a worktape of size log log n on a unary input 1(n), an alternating machine can simulate a stack with log n bits, representing the contents of the stack by its input head position. The standard push/pop operations are implemented by moving the head along the input.

AB Neural Networks have been utilized to solve various tasks such as image recognition, text classification, and machine translation and have achieved exceptional results in many of these tasks. However, understanding the inner workings of neural networks and explaining why a certain output is produced are no trivial tasks. Especially when dealing with text classification problems, an approach to explain network decisions may greatly increase the acceptance of neural network supported tools. In this paper, we present an approach to visualize reasons why a classification outcome is produced by convolutional neural networks by tracing back decisions made by the network. The approach is applied to various text classification problems, including our own requirements engineering related classification problem. We argue that by providing these explanations in neural network supported tools, users will use such tools with more confidence and also may allow the tool to do certain tasks automatically.

TI Traffic of interacting ribosomes: Effects of single-machine
   mechanochemistry on protein synthesis
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Many ribosomes simultaneously move on the same messenger RNA (mRNA), each synthesizing separately a copy of the same protein. In contrast to the earlier models, here we develop a "unified" theoretical model that not only incorporates the mutual exclusions of the interacting ribosomes, but also describes explicitly the mechanochemistry of each of these macromolecular machines during protein synthesis. Using analytical and numerical techniques of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, we analyze the rates of protein synthesis and the spatiotemporal organization of the ribosomes in this model. We also predict how these properties would change with the changes in the rates of the various chemomechanical processes in each ribosome. Finally, we illustrate the power of this model by making experimentally testable predictions on the rates of protein synthesis and the density profiles of the ribosomes on some mRNAs in E-coli.

The objective is characterized as a success logic tree, which consists of 5 logic operators, Boolean checks, and actions. Operational rules of the objective are simple. Perform all available actions and checks until the success logic tree becomes true, if not specified differently. The objective has formality and the characteristics of the state-function, which make verification and validation, situation awareness, and the controls of a plant enhanced. The specification of the objective is described by a top-down approach and illustrated with examples. The goal of a procedure is achieved through executions of successive objectives.

TI TPE: A Hardware-Based TLB Profiling Expert for Workload Reconstruction
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON EMERGING AND SELECTED TOPICS IN CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS
AB We propose TPE, a hardware-based framework to perform workload execution forensics in microprocessors. Specifically, TPE leverages custom hardware instrumentation to capture the operational profile of the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB), as well as process these information off-line through multiple machine learning and/or deep learning approaches, in order to identify the executed processes and reconstruct the workload. Unlike software-based forensics methods implemented at the operating system (OS) or hypervisor level, whose data logging and monitoring mechanisms may be compromised through software attacks, TPE is implemented directly in hardware and, therefore, provides innate immunity to software tampering. A prototype of TPE is demonstrated in Linux on two representative architectures, i.e., 32-bit x 86 and 64-bit RISC-V, implemented in the Simics and Spike simulation environment respectively. Experimental results using the Mibench workload benchmark suite reveal favorable process identification accuracy at low logging rate, which corroborates the effectiveness and the generalizability of TPE.

AB Implementing first-class continuations can pose a challenge if the target machine makes no provisions for accessing and re-installing the run-time stack. In this paper, we present a novel translation that overcomes this problem. In the first half of the paper, we introduce a theoretical model that shows how to eliminate the capture and the use of first-class continuations in the presence of a generalized stack inspection mechanism. The second half of the paper explains how to translate this model into practice in two different contexts. First, we reformulate the servlet interaction language in the PLT Web server, which heavily relies on first-class continuations. Using our technique, servlet programs can be run directly under the control of non-cooperative web servers such as Apache. Second, we show how to use our new technique to copy and reconstitute the stack on MSIL.Net using exception handlers. This establishes that Scheme's first-class continuations can exist on non-cooperative virtual machines.

AB Task trees are common notations used to describe the interaction between a user and an interactive application. They contain valuable information about the expected user behaviour as well on the expected software reactions and, thus, they can be used to support model-based testing. In this paper, a method for automatically generating test data from task trees is introduced. The task tree notation is extended to support operational profile specification. The user behaviour is automatically extracted from such extended trees as a probabilistic finite input-output state machine, thanks to formal semantics defined for this purpose for the task tree operators. The resulting probabilistic machine can then be used to generate test data simulating the user behaviour. This simulation can be performed using Lutess, a testing environment developed for synchronous software. The translation of the user interaction model into a Lutess description is explained and experimental results are reported. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Over the last decade, Quantum Computing hardware has rapidly developed and become a very intriguing, promising, and active research field among scientists worldwide. To achieve the desired quantum functionalities, quantum algorithms require translation from a high-level description to a machine-specific physical operation sequence. In contrast to classical compilers, state-of-the-art quantum compilers are in their infancy. We believe there is a research need for a quantum compiler that can deal with generic unitary operators and generate basic unitary operations according to quantum machines' diverse underlying technologies and characteristics. In this work, we introduce the Quantum Netlist Compiler (QNC) that converts arbitrary unitary operators or desired initial states of quantum algorithms to OpenQASM-2.0 circuits enabling them to run on actual quantum hardware. Extensive simulations were run on the IBM quantum systems. The results show that QNC is well suited for quantum circuit optimization and produces circuits with competitive success rates in practice.

AB Deep Learning (DL) is an interesting and rapidly developing field of research which has been currently utilized as a part of industry and in many disciplines to address a wide range of problems, from image classification, computer vision, video games, bioinformatics, and handwriting recognition to machine translation. The starting point of this study is the recognition of a big gap between the sector need of specialists in DL technology and the lack of sufficient education provided by the universities. Higher education institutions are the best environment to provide this expertise to the students. However, currently most universities do not provide specifically designed DL courses to their students. Thus, the main objective of this study is to design a novel curriculum including two courses to facilitate teaching and learning of DL topic. The proposed curriculum will enable students to solve real-world problems by applying DL approaches and gain necessary background to adapt their knowledge to more advanced, industry-specific fields.

AB Dynamic binary translators compile machine code from a source architecture to a target architecture at run time. Due to the hard time constraints of just-in-time compilation only highly efficient optimization algorithms can be employed. Common problems are an insufficient number of registers on. the target architecture and the different handling of condition codes in source and target architecture. Without optimizations useless stores and computations are generated by the dynamic binary translator and cause sign significant performance losses. In order to eliminate these useless operations, a very fast liveness analysis is required.
   We present, a, dynamic liveness analysis algorithm that trades precision for fast execution and conducted experiments with the SpecInt95 benchmark suite using our PowerPC to Alpha translator The optimizations reduced the number of stores by about 50 percent. This resulted in a speed-up of 10 to 30 percent depending on the target machine. The dynamic liveness analysis results are very close to the most precise solution.

TI Making the Most of Small Software Engineering Datasets With Modern
   Machine Learning
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
AB This paper provides a starting point for Software Engineering (SE) researchers and practitioners faced with the problem of training machine learning models on small datasets. Due to the high costs associated with labeling data, in Software Engineering, there exist many small (< 5,000 samples) and medium-sized (< 100,000 samples) datasets. While deep learning has set the state of the art in many machine learning tasks, it is only recently that it has proven effective on small-sized datasets, primarily thanks to pre-training, a semi-supervised learning technique that leverages abundant unlabelled data alongside scarce labelled data. In this work, we evaluate pre-trained Transformer models on a selection of 13 smaller datasets from the SE literature, covering both, source code and natural language. Our results suggest that pre-trained Transformers are competitive and in some cases superior to previous models, especially for tasks involving natural language; whereas for source code tasks, in particular for very small datasets, traditional machine learning methods often has the edge. In addition, we experiment with several techniques that ought to aid training on small datasets, including active learning, data augmentation, soft labels, self-training and intermediate-task fine-tuning, and issue recommendations on when they are effective. We also release all the data, scripts, and most importantly pre-trained models for the community to reuse on their own datasets.

AB In the era of big data, natural language processing becomes an important research discipline, owing to the immense quantity of text documents and the progresses in machine learning. Natural language processing has been succesfully employed in many different areas, including machine translation, search engines, virtual assistants, spam filtering, question answering and sentiment analysis. Recent studies in the field of natural language processing indicate that word embedding based representation, in which words have been represented in dense spaces through fixed length vectors, can yield promising results. In this study, we evaluate the predictive performance of 36 word embedding based representation obtained by three word embedding methods (i.e., word2vec, fastText and DOC2vec), two basic weighting functions (i.e., inverse document frequency and smooth inverse document frequency) and three vector pooling schemes (namely, weighted sum, center based approach and delta rule). Experimental analysis indicates that word2vec based representation in conjunction with inverse document frequency based weighting and center based pooling, yields promising results for sentiment analysis in Turkish.

AB We present a publicly available benchmark database for the problem of hand posture recognition from noisy depth data and fused RGB-D data obtained from low-cost time-of-flight (ToF) sensors. The database is the most extensive database of this kind containing over a million data samples (point clouds) recorded from 35 different individuals for ten different static hand postures. This captures a great amount of variance, due to person-related factors, but also scaling, translation and rotation are explicitly represented. Benchmark results achieved with a standard classification algorithm are computed by cross-validation both over samples and persons, the latter implying training on all persons but one and testing on the remaining one. An important result using this database is that cross-validation performance over samples (which is the standard procedure in machine learning) is systematically higher than cross-validation performance over persons, which is to our mind the true application-relevant measure of generalization performance.

TI Implantable brain machine interfaces: first-in-human studies, technology
   challenges and trends
SO CURRENT OPINION IN BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Implantable brain machine interfaces (BMIs) are now on a trajectory to go mainstream, wherein what was once considered last resort will progressively become elective at earlier stages in disease treatment. First-in-human successes have demonstrated the ability to decode highly dexterous motor skills such as handwriting, and speech from human cortical activity. These have been used for cursor and prosthesis control, direct-to-text communication and speech synthesis. Along with these breakthrough studies, technology advancements have enabled the observation of more channels of neural activity through new concepts for centralised/distributed implant architectures. This is complemented by research in flexible substrates, packaging, surgical workflows and data processing. New regulatory guidance and funding has galvanised the field. This culmination of resource, efforts and capability is now attracting significant investment for BMI commercialisation. This paper reviews recent developments and describes the paradigm shift in BMI development that is leading to new innovations, insights and BMI translation.

However, the complexity of operations at the nanoscale introduces a layer of difficulty in the clinical translation of nanodrugs and biomedical nanotechnology. This problem is further exacerbated when engineering and optimizing nanomaterials for biomedical purposes. To navigate this issue, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have been applied for data analysis and inference, allowing for a more applicable understanding of the complex interaction amongst the abundant variables in a system involving the synthesis or use of nanomedicine. Here, we report on the current relationship and implications of nanomedicine and AI. Particularly, we explore AI as a tool for enabling nanomedicine in the context of nanodrug screening and development, brain-machine interfaces and nanotoxicology. We also report on the current state and future direction of nanomedicine and AI in cancer, diabetes, and neurological disorder therapy.

SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Inefficient injection of microparticles through conventional hypodermic needles can impose serious challenges on clinical translation of biopharmaceutical drugs and microparticle-based drug formulations. This study aims to determine the important factors affecting microparticle injectability and establish a predictive framework using computational fluid dynamics, design of experiments, and machine learning. A numerical multiphysics model was developed to examine microparticle flow and needle blockage in a syringe-needle system. Using experimental data, a simple empirical mathematical model was introduced. Results from injection experiments were subsequently incorporated into an artificial neural network to establish a predictive framework for injectability. Last, simulations and experimental results contributed to the design of a syringe that maximizes injectability in vitro and in vivo. The custom injection system enabled a sixfold increase in injectability of large microparticles compared to a commercial syringe. This study highlights the importance of the proposed framework for optimal injection of microparticle-based drugs by parenteral routes.

SO COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
AB Artificial Intelligence allows the improvement of our daily life, for instance, speech and handwritten text recognition, real time translation and weather forecasting are common used applications. In the livestock sector, machine learning algorithms have the potential for early detection and warning of problems, which represents a significant milestone in the poultry industry. Production problems generate economic loss that could be avoided by acting in a timely manner.
   In the current study, training and testing of support vector machines are addressed, for an early detection of problems in the production curve of commercial eggs, using farm's egg production data of 478,919 laying hens grouped in 24 flocks.
   Experiments using support vector machines with a 5 k-fold cross-validation were performed at different previous time intervals, to alert with up to 5 days of forecasting interval, whether a flock will experience a problem in production curve. Performance metrics such as accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and positive predictive value were evaluated, reaching 0-day values of 0.9874, 0.9876, 0.9783 and 0.6518 respectively on unseen data (test-set).
   The optimal forecasting interval was from zero to three days, performance metrics decreases as the forecasting interval is increased. It should be emphasized that this technique was able to issue an alert a day in advance, achieving an accuracy of 0.9854, a specificity of 0.9865, a sensitivity of 0.9333 and a positive predictive value of 0.6135. This novel application embedded in a computer system of poultry management is able to provide significant improvements in early detection and warning of problems related to the production curve.

TI A Beam-Splitting Bianisotropic Metasurface Designed by Optimization and
   Machine Learning
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION
AB Electromagnetic metasurfaces have attracted significant interest recently due to their low profile and advantageous applications. Practically, many metasurface designs start with a set of constraints for the radiated far-field, such as main-beam direction(s) and side lobe levels, and end with a non-uniform physical structure for the surface. This problem is quite challenging, since the required tangential field transformations are not completely known when only constraints are placed on the scattered fields. Hence, the required surface properties cannot be solved for analytically. Moreover, the translation of the desired surface properties to the physical unit cells can be time-consuming and difficult, as it is often a one-to-many mapping in a large solution space. Here, we divide the inverse design process into two steps: a macroscopic and microscopic design step. In the former, we use an iterative optimization process to find the surface properties that radiate a far-field pattern that complies with specified constraints. This iterative process exploits non-radiating currents to ensure a passive and lossless design. In the microscopic step, these optimized surface properties are realized with physical unit cells using machine learning surrogate models. The effectiveness of this end-to-end synthesis process is demonstrated through measurement results of a beam-splitting prototype.

TI Sense disambiguation for Punjabi language using supervised machine
   learning techniques
SO SADHANA-ACADEMY PROCEEDINGS IN ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB Automatic identification of a meaning of a word in a context is termed as Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). It is a vital and hard artificial intelligence problem used in several natural language processing applications like machine translation, question answering, information retrieval, etc. In this paper, an explicit WSD system for Punjabi language using supervised techniques has been analysed. The sense tagged corpus of 150 ambiguous Punjabi noun words has been manually prepared. The six supervised machine learning techniques Decision List, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN), Random Forest and Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been investigated in this proposed work. Every classifier has used same feature space encompassing lexical (unigram, bigram, collocations, and co-occurrence) and syntactic (part of speech) count based features. The semantic features of Punjabi language have been devised from the unlabelled Punjabi Wikipedia text using word2vec continuous bag of word and skip gram shallow neural network models. Two deep learning neural network classifiers multilayer perceptron and long short term memory have also been applied for WSD of Punjabi words. The word embedding features have experimented on six classifiers for the Punjabi WSD task. It has been observed that the performance of the supervised classifiers applied for the WSD task of Punjabi language has been enhanced with the application of word embedding features. In this work, an accuracy of 84% has been achieved by LSTM classifier using word embedding feature.

TI Machine Learning Based Computational Gene Selection Models: A Survey,
   Performance Evaluation, Open Issues, and Future Research Directions
SO FRONTIERS IN GENETICS
AB Gene Expression is the process of determining the physical characteristics of living beings by generating the necessary proteins. Gene Expression takes place in two steps, translation and transcription. It is the flow of information from DNA to RNA with enzymes' help, and the end product is proteins and other biochemical molecules. Many technologies can capture Gene Expression from the DNA or RNA. One such technique is Microarray DNA. Other than being expensive, the main issue with Microarray DNA is that it generates high-dimensional data with minimal sample size. The issue in handling such a heavyweight dataset is that the learning model will be over-fitted. This problem should be addressed by reducing the dimension of the data source to a considerable amount. In recent years, Machine Learning has gained popularity in the field of genomic studies. In the literature, many Machine Learning-based Gene Selection approaches have been discussed, which were proposed to improve dimensionality reduction precision. This paper does an extensive review of the various works done on Machine Learning-based gene selection in recent years, along with its performance analysis. The study categorizes various feature selection algorithms under Supervised, Unsupervised, and Semi-supervised learning. The works done in recent years to reduce the features for diagnosing tumors are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the performance of several discussed methods in the literature is analyzed.

TI Radiomics and Bladder Cancer: Current Status
SO BLADDER CANCER
AB PURPOSE: To systematically review the current literature and discuss the applications and limitations of radiomics and machine-learning augmented radiomics in the management of bladder cancer.
   METHODS: Pubmed (R), Scopus (R), and Web of Science (R) databases were searched systematically for all full-text Englishlanguage articles assessing the impact of Artificial Intelligence OR Radiomics OR Machine Learning AND Bladder Cancer AND (staging OR grading OR prognosis) published up to January 2020.
   RESULTS: Of the 686 articles that were identified, 13 studies met the criteria for quantitative analysis. Staging, Grading and Tumor Classification, Prognosis, and Therapy Response were discussed in 7, 3, 2 and 7 studies, respectively. Data on cost of implementation were not reported. CT and MRI were the most common imaging approaches.
   CONCLUSION: Radiomics shows potential in bladder cancer detection, staging, grading, and response to therapy, thereby supporting the physician in personalizing patient management. Extension and validation of this promising technology in large multisite prospective trials is warranted to pave the way for its clinical translation.

TI Zernike moments-based fingerprint recognition using weighted-support
   vector machine
SO MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB Moments play an important role in image analysis and invariant pattern recognition. There are two types: orthogonal moments and non-orthogonal moments. Orthogonal moments perform better than non-orthogonal moments, they have properties such as robustness to image noise and geometrical invariant properties such as scale, rotation and translation. In this paper, an improvement in fingerprint recognition is done by using the Non-subsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) and the Zernike moments (ZMs). NSCT decomposes the fingerprint images into NSCT subbands. Thereafter, ZMs are used to evaluate the features of fingerprint images. Thereafter, feature selection technique is applied to select potential features from the obtained features using coefficient of determination. Thereafter, a well-known weighted-support vector machine is also used to train and test the evaluated features. Extensive experiments reveal that the proposed technique achieves significant improvement over the existing techniques in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, f-measure, kappa statistics and execution time.

TI Systematic Review of the Effectiveness of Machine Phenotype or Treatment
   Outcomes Using Electroencephalogram Data
SO JOURNAL OF PAIN
AB Recent attempts to utilize machine learning (ML) to predict pain-related outcomes from Electroencephalogram (EEG) data demonstrate promising results. The primary aim of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of ML algorithms for predicting pain intensity, phenotypes or treatment response from EEG. Electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, PsycINFO and The Cochrane Library were searched. A total of 44 eligible studies were identified, with 22 presenting attempts to predict pain intensity, 15 investigating the prediction of pain phenotypes and seven assessing the prediction of treatment response. A meta-analysis was not considered appropriate for this review due to heterogeneous methods and reporting. Consequently, data were narratively synthesized. The results demonstrate that the best performing model of the individual studies allows for the prediction of pain intensity, phenotypes and treatment response with accuracies ranging between 62 to 100%, 57 to 99% and 65 to 95.24%, respectively. The results suggest that ML has the potential to effectively predict pain outcomes, which may eventually be used to assist clinical care. However, inadequate reporting and potential bias reduce confidence in the results. Future research should improve reporting standards and externally validate models to decrease bias, which would increase the feasibility of clinical translation. Perspective: This systematic review explores the state-of-the-art machine learning methods for predicting pain intensity, phenotype or treatment response from EEG data. Results suggest that machine learning may demonstrate clinical utility, pending further research and development. Areas for improvement, including standardized processing, reporting and the need for better methodological assessment tools, are discussed.

TI Dimensioning of the intermediate states of the machined phases "DISMP"
   approach
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB In manufacturing practice for each machining operation, transfer techniques are extensively used for the allocation of manufacturing specification tolerance type and value. This paper focuses more on tolerance type which is the basis for a coherent and complete tolerancing process. We developed an algorithmic method called "DISMP" in order to generate the necessary types of manufacturing specifications that guarantee the respect of the functional requirements. A geometric variation model, based on the invariants degrees of freedom (DOFs) of the datum reference frames (DRF) and the toleranced surfaces serves to specify the two extremities of the tolerance chain. The identification of the controlled DOFs (Cont-DOFs) of the positioning reference frames in each machining phases and also the constrained DOFs (Cons-DOFs) of each machined surface contributes to the development of the way linking between the functional toleranced surface and its functional DRF. To generate the appropriate manufacturing geometric specifications, our method can be divided in five steps. We started by the translation of the ISO functional specification using the topologically and technologically related surfaces rules "TTRS" (Step 1: M1). Mapping the manufacturing process (Step 2: M2 and M3) requires the identification of the Cons-DOFs of the machined surfaces and those controlled by the positioning surfaces "Cont-DOFs" in each phase. The search of all chain links, which constitute the tolerance chain, is realized on Step3 (M4 and M5). Then, in step 4 (M6), we generate ISO standardized manufacturing specification. The fifth step (M7) draft technological constraints related to the manufacturing process, i.e., the case where there are inversion in the order between the toleranced surfaces and its DRF. Finally, we present the manufacturing process phases with ISO standards requirements.

TI Pumping a Ring-Sliding Molecular Motion by a Light-Powered Molecular
   Motor
SO JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Designing artificial molecular machines to execute complex mechanical tasks, like coupling rotation and translation to accomplish transmission of motion, continues to provide important challenges. Herein, we demonstrated a novel molecular machine comprising a second-generation light-driven molecular motor and a bistable [1]rotaxane unit. The molecular motor can rotate successfully even in an interlocked [1]rotaxane system through a photoinduced cis-to-trans isomerization and a thermal helix inversion, resulting in concomitant transitional motion of the [1]rotaxane. The transmission process was elucidated via H-1 NMR,H-1-H-1 COSY, HMQC, HMBC, and 2D ROESY NMR spectroscopies, UV-visible absorption spectrum, and density functional theory calculations. This is the first demonstration of a molecular motor to rotate against the appreciably noncovalent interactions between dibenzo-24-crown-8 and N-methyltriazolium moieties comprising the rotaxane unit, showing operational capabilities of molecular motors to perform more complex tasks.

AB Mandarin, also known as Standard Chinese is the official language of China and Singapore, there are certain differences when mandarin is spoken by people from different homeplaces. The homeplace classification is important in speech recognition and machine translation. In this paper, we proposed a novel model named Bag-of-phonemes (BOP) for homeplace classification of mandarin speakers, which follows the conceptually similar idea of the Bag-of-words (BOW) model in text processing. The low-level Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) speach features of each homeplace are clustered into a set of codewords referred to as phonemes. With this codebook, each speech signal can be represented by a feature vector of distribution on phonemes. Classical classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM) can be applied for classification. This model is tested by RASC863 database, empirical studies show that the new model has a better performance on the RASC863 database comparing to previous works [1].

AB Data-driven segmentation of words into subword units has been used in various natural language processing applications such as automatic speech recognition and statistical machine translation for almost 20 years. Recently it has became more widely adopted, as models based on deep neural networks often benefit from subword units even for morphologically simpler languages. In this paper, we discuss and compare training algorithms for a unigram subword model, based on the Expectation Maximization algorithm and lexicon pruning. Using English, Finnish, North Sami, and Turkish data sets, we show that this approach is able to find better solutions to the optimization problem defined by the Morfessor Baseline model than its original recursive training algorithm. The improved optimization also leads to higher morphological segmentation accuracy when compared to a linguistic gold standard. We publish implementations of the new algorithms in the widely-used Morfessor software package.

TI Improving Named Entity Recognition in Vietnamese Texts by a
   Character-Level Deep Lifelong Learning Model
SO VIETNAM JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamental task which affects the performance of its dependent task, e.g. machine translation. Lifelong machine learning (LML) is a continuous learning process, in which the knowledge base accumulated from previous tasks will be used to improve future learning tasks having few samples. Since there are a few studies on LML based on deep neural networks for NER, especially in Vietnamese, we propose a lifelong learning model based on deep learning with a CRFs layer, named DeepLML-NER, for NER in Vietnamese texts. DeepLML-NER includes an algorithm to extract the knowledge of "prefix-features" of named entities in previous domains. Then the model uses the knowledge in the knowledge base to solve the current NER task. Preprocessing and model parameter tuning are also investigated to improve the performance. The effect of the model was demonstrated by in-domain and cross-domain experiments, achieving promising results.

AB A long-term goal of machine learning research is to build an intelligent dialog agent. Most research in natural language understanding has focused on learning from fixed training sets of labeled data, with supervision either at the word level (tagging, parsing tasks) or sentence level (question answering, machine translation). This kind of supervision is not realistic of how humans learn, where language is both learned by, and used for, communication. In this work, we study dialog-based language learning, where supervision is given naturally and implicitly in the response of the dialog partner during the conversation. We study this setup in two domains: the bAbI dataset of [23] and large-scale question answering from [3]. We evaluate a set of baseline learning strategies on these tasks, and show that a novel model incorporating predictive lookahead is a promising approach for learning from a teacher's response. In particular, a surprising result is that it can learn to answer questions correctly without any reward-based supervision at all.

AB This paper addresses the issue of how to obtain processing tools for argument identification for the vast majority of the languages that, differently from English, have little to no relevant labeled data.
   This issue is addressed by taking an under-resourced language as a case study, namely Portuguese, and by experimenting with three techniques to cope with the scarceness of data: to obtain labelled data by machine translating data sets from another language labelled with respect to argument identification; to transfer to the argument identifier the language knowledge captured in distributional semantic models obtained during the resolution of other tasks for which more data exist; to expand data for argument identification with text augmenting techniques.
   The results obtained demonstrate that it is possible to develop argument identification tools for under-resourced languages with a level of performance that is competitive to the ones for languages with relevant language resources.

TI Support Vector Shape: A Classifier-Based Shape Representation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB We introduce a novel implicit representation for 2D and 3D shapes based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) theory. Each shape is represented by an analytic decision function obtained by training SVM, with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel so that the interior shape points are given higher values. This empowers support vector shape (SVS) with multifold advantages. First, the representation uses a sparse subset of feature points determined by the support vectors, which significantly improves the discriminative power against noise, fragmentation, and other artifacts that often come with the data. Second, the use of the RBF kernel provides scale, rotation, and translation invariant features, and allows any shape to be represented accurately regardless of its complexity. Finally, the decision function can be used to select reliable feature points. These features are described using gradients computed from highly consistent decision functions instead from conventional edges. Our experiments demonstrate promising results.

AB The flourishing idea of Semantic Web is realized as extension of the World Wide Web infrastructure. The WWW has rehabilitated interest in semantic interoperability between various semantic languages. Semantic languages like OWL, WSML and FIPA SL formalize WWW into machine process able and understandable, by their ability to represent machine interpretable contents on the Web. These semantic description languages differ in syntax and semantic representation, resulting in mismatches that hamper semantic information exchange and interoperability for cross service utilization among the resulting information systems. In this paper we propose agent based technique to facilitate translation among heterogeneous contents while preserving the semantics. We propose the architecture to realize the system in a middleware that enables agent based dynamic semantic interoperability between FIPA compliant software agents and semantic web languages including OWL and WSML. We have developed a prototype application through which a software agent communicate and use a web service published in OWL or WSML and vice versa.

AB In machine translation and natural language generation, making the wrong word choice from a set of near-synonyms can be imprecise or awkward, or convey unwanted implications. Using Edmonds's model of lexical knowledge to represent clusters of near-synonyms, our goal is to automatically derive a lexical knowledge-base from the Choose the Right Word dictionary of near-synonym discrimination. We do this by automatically classifying sentences in this dictionary according to the classes of distinctions they express. We use a decision-list learning algorithm to learn words and expressions that characterize the classes DENOTATIONAL DISTINCTIONS and ATTITUDE-STYLE DISTINCTIONS. These results are then used by an extraction module to actually extract knowledge from each sentence. We also integrate a module to resolve anaphors and word-to-word comparisons. We evaluate the results of our algorithm for several randomly selected clusters against a manually built standard solution, and compare them with the results of a baseline algorithm.

TI Accurate Heuristic Terrain Prediction in Powered Lower-Limb Prostheses
   Using Onboard Sensors
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Objective: This study describes the development and offline validation of a heuristic algorithm for accurate prediction of ground terrain in a lower limb prosthesis. This method is based on inference of the ground terrain geometry using estimation of prosthetic limb kinematics during gait with a single integrated inertial measurement unit. Methods: We asked five subjects with below-knee amputations to traverse level ground, stairs, and ramps using a high-range-of-motion powered prosthesis while internal sensor data were remotely logged. We used these data to develop three terrain prediction algorithms. The first two employed state-of-the-art machine learning approaches, while the third was a directly tuned heuristic using thresholds on estimated prosthetic ankle joint translations and ground slope. We compared the performance of these algorithms using resubstitution error for the machine learning algorithms and overall error for the heuristic algorithm. Results: Our optimal machine learning algorithm attained a resubstitution error of 3.4% using 45 features, while our heuristic method attained an overall prediction error of 2.8% using only 5 features derived from estimation of ground slope and horizontal and vertical ankle joint displacement. Compared with pattern recognition, the heuristic performed better on each individual subject, and across both level and non-level strides. Conclusion and significance: These results demonstrate a method for heuristic prediction of ground terrain in a powered prosthesis. The method is more accurate, more interpretable, and less computationally expensive than machine learning methods considered state-of-the-art for intent recognition, and relies only on integrated prosthesis sensors. Finally, the method provides intuitively tunable thresholds to improve performance for specific walking conditions.

TI Computational techniques for ECG analysis and interpretation in light of
   their contribution to medical advances
SO JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE
AB Widely developed for clinical screening, electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings capture the cardiac electrical activity from the body surface. ECG analysis can therefore be a crucial first step to help diagnose, understand and predict cardiovascular disorders responsible for 30% of deaths worldwide. Computational techniques, and more specifically machine learning techniques and computational modelling are powerful tools for classification, clustering and simulation, and they have recently been applied to address the analysis of medical data, especially ECG data. This review describes the computational methods in use for ECG analysis, with a focus on machine learning and 3D computer simulations, as well as their accuracy, clinical implications and contributions to medical advances. The first section focuses on heartbeat classification and the techniques developed to extract and classify abnormal from regular beats. The second section focuses on patient diagnosis from whole recordings, applied to different diseases. The third section presents real-time diagnosis and applications to wearable devices. The fourth section highlights the recent field of personalized ECG computer simulations and their interpretation. Finally, the discussion section outlines the challenges of ECG analysis and provides a critical assessment of the methods presented. The computational methods reported in this review are a strong asset for medical discoveries and their translation to the clinical world may lead to promising advances.

TI OS-ELM-based visual and inertial indoor localisation method with
   adaptive matching step
SO ELECTRONICS LETTERS
AB Indoor localisation has been a hot research topic because of its importance for location-based services. The proposed method takes affine transformation matrices and inertial information as input vectors to online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) and outputs relative translation between the two matching frames. The universal approximation capability and extreme learning speed of OS-ELM enable the proposed method to adapt to several matching steps and reduce the localisation error to a low scale. Fuzzy multi-objective decision making and corner detection are also used to improve the final result. Experimental results validate that the proposed method can provide a good localisation accuracy and improve the efficiency of localisation.

AB With the fast advance of artificial intelligence technology and data-driven machine learning techniques, building high-quality AI-based software in different application domains is becoming a very hot research topic in both academic and industry communities. Today, many machine learning models and artificial technologies have been developed to build smart application systems based on multimedia inputs to achieve intelligent functional features, such as recommendation, object detection, classification, and prediction, natural language processing and translation, and so on. This brings strong demand in quality validation and assurance for AI software systems. Current research work seldom discusses AI software testing questions, challenges, and validation approaches with clear quality requirements and criteria. This paper focuses on AI software quality validation, including validation focuses, features, and process, and potential testing approaches. Moreover, it presents a test process and a classification-based test modeling for AI classification function testing. Finally, it discusses the challenges, issues, and needs in AI software testing.

AB As one of the Muslim life guidelines, based on the meaning of its sentence(s), a hadith can be viewed as a suggestion for doing something, or a suggestion for not doing something, or just information without any suggestion. In this paper, we tried to classify the Bahasa translation of hadith into the three categories using machine learning approach. We tried stemming and stopword removal in preprocessing, and TF-IDF of unigram, bigram, and trigram as the extracted features. As the classifier, we compared between SVM and Neural Network. Since the categories are new, so in order to compare the results of the previous pipelines, we created a baseline classifier using simple rule-based string matching technique. The rule-based algorithm conditions on the occurrence of words such as "janganlah, sholatlah, and so on" to determine the category. The baseline method achieved F1-Score of 0.69, while the best F1-Score from the machine learning approach was 0.88, and it was produced by SVM model with the linear kernel.

AB Grammatical error correction, like other machine learning tasks, greatly benefits from large quantities of high quality training data, which is typically expensive to produce. While writing a program to automatically generate realistic grammatical errors would be difficult, one could learn the distribution of naturally-occurring errors and attempt to introduce them into other datasets. Initial work on inducing errors in this way using statistical machine translation has shown promise; we investigate cheaply constructing synthetic samples, given a small corpus of human-annotated data, using an off-the-rack attentive sequence-to-sequence model and a straight-forward post-processing procedure. Our approach yields error-filled artificial data that helps a vanilla bi-directional LSTM to outperform the previous state of the art at grammatical error detection, and a previously introduced model to gain further improvements of over 5% F-0.5 score. When attempting to determine if a given sentence is synthetic, a human annotator at best achieves 39.39 F-1 score, indicating that our model generates mostly human-like instances.

AB Recently much attention have been paid to region of interests in an image as they are useful in bridging the gap between high level image semantics and low level image features. In this paper we have proposed a method for classification of image objects produced by a standard image segmentation algorithm using multiclass support vector machine classifier integrated with histogram intersection kernel. SIFT is a relatively new feature descriptor which describes a given object in terms of a number of interest points. They are invariant to scaling, translation and partially invariant to illumination changes. This paper primarily focuses on the design of a fast and efficient image object classifier by combining the robust SIFT feature descriptor with intersection kernel SVM which is comparatively better than the existing kernel functions in terms of resource utilization. The experimental results show that the proposed method has good generalization accuracy.

AB Proof-Carrying Code (PCC) is a general framework for verifying the safety properties of machine-language programs. PCC proofs are usually written in a logic extended with language-specific typing rules. In Foundational Proof-Carrying Code (FPCC), on the other hand, proofs are constructed and verified using strictly the foundations of mathematical logic, with no type-specific axioms. FPCC is more flexible and secure because it is not tied to any particular type system and it has a smaller trusted base.
   Foundational proofs, however, are much harder to construct. Previous efforts on FPCC all required building sophisticated semantic models for types. In this paper, we present a syntactic approach to FPCC that avoids the difficulties of previous work. Under our new scheme, the foundational proof for a typed machine program simply consists of the typing derivation plus the formalized syntactic soundness proof for the underlying type system. We give a translation from a typed assembly language into FPCC and demonstrate the advantages of our new system via an implementation in the Coq proof assistant.

TI An encoder-decoder based grapheme-to-phoneme converter for Bangla speech

SO ACOUSTICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB This paper proposes an encoder-decoder based sequence-to-sequence model for Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) conversion in Bangla (Exonym: Bengali). G2P models are key components in speech recognition and speech synthesis systems as they describe how words are pronounced. Traditional, rule-based models do not perform well in unseen contexts. We propose to adopt a neural machine translation (NMT) model to solve the G2P problem. We used gated recurrent units (GRU) recurrent neural network (RNN) to build our model. In contrast to joint-sequence based G2P models, our encoder-decoder based model has the flexibility of not requiring explicit grapheme-to-phoneme alignment which are not straight forward to perform. We trained our model on a pronunciation dictionary of (approximately) 135,000 entries and obtained a word error rate (WER) of 12.49% which is a significant improvement from the existing rule-based and machine-learning based Bangla G2P models.

TI Structural Snapshots of Actively Translating Human Ribosomes
SO CELL
AB Macromolecular machines, such as the ribosome, undergo large-scale conformational changes during their functional cycles. Although their mode of action is often compared to that of mechanical machines, a crucial difference is that, at the molecular dimension, thermodynamic effects dominate functional cycles, with proteins fluctuating stochastically between functional states defined by energetic minima on an energy landscape. Here, we have used cryo-electron microscopy to image ex-vivo-derived human polysomes as a source of actively translating ribosomes. Multiparticle refinement and 3D variability analysis allowed us to visualize a variety of native translation intermediates. Significantly populated states include not only elongation cycle intermediates in pre- and post-translocational states, but also eEF1A-containing decoding and termination/recycling complexes. Focusing on the post-translocational state, we extended this assessment to the single-residue level, uncovering striking details of ribosome-ligand interactions and identifying both static and functionally important dynamic elements.

AB Code obfuscation is a popular approach to turn program comprehension and analysis harder, with the aim of mitigating threats related to malicious reverse engineering and code tampering. However, programming languages that compile to high level bytecode (e.g., Java) can be obfuscated only to a limited extent. In fact, high level bytecode still contains high level relevant information that an attacker might exploit.
   In order to enable more resilient obfuscations, part of these programs might be implemented with programming languages (e.g., C) that compile to low level machine-dependent code. In fact, machine code contains and leaks less high level information and it enables more resilient obfuscations.
   In this paper, we present an approach to automatically translate critical sections of high level Java bytecode to C code, so that more effective obfuscations can be resorted to. Moreover, a developer can still work with a single programming language, i.e., Java.

AB Many of characteristics of support vector machine (SVM) are determined by the type of kernels used Traditional kernels such as polynomial kernel and radial basis function kernel have many limitations. It is valuable to investigate the problem of whether a better performance could be obtained if we construct a scaling kernel by using the scaling function. This paper presents a way for building a wavelet-based reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) and its associate scaling kernel for SVM. The RKHS built is a multiresolution scale subspace, and the scaling kernel is constructed by using a scaling function with its different dilations and translations. Compared to the traditional kernels, results on two approximation problems illustrate that the SVM with scaling kernel enjoys two advantages: (1) it can approximate arbitrary signal and owns better approximation performance; (2) it can implement multi-scale approximation.

AB The usage of Network Address Translation (NAT) devices is common among end users, organizations, and Internet Service Providers. NAT provides anonymity for users within an organization by replacing their internal IP addresses with a single external wide area network address. While such anonymity provides an added measure of security for legitimate users, it can also be taken advantage of by malicious users hiding behind NAT devices. Thus, identifying NAT devices and hosts behind them is essential to detect malicious behaviors in traffic and application usage. In this paper, we propose a machine learning based solution to detect hosts behind NAT devices by using flow level statistics (excluding IP addresses, port numbers, and application layer information) from passive traffic measurements. We capture a large dataset and perform an extensive evaluation of our proposed approach with four existing approaches from the literature. Our results show that the proposed approach could identify NAT behaviors and hosts not only with higher accuracy but also demonstrates the impact of parameter sensitivity of the proposed approach.

TI Making brain-machine interfaces robust to future neural variability
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB A major hurdle to clinical translation of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) is that current decoders, which are trained from a small quantity of recent data, become ineffective when neural recording conditions subsequently change. We tested whether a decoder could be made more robust to future neural variability by training it to handle a variety of recording conditions sampled from months of previously collected data as well as synthetic training data perturbations. We developed a new multiplicative recurrent neural network BMI decoder that successfully learned a large variety of neural-to-kinematic mappings and became more robust with larger training data sets. Here we demonstrate that when tested with a non-human primate preclinical BMI model, this decoder is robust under conditions that disabled a state-of-the-art Kalman filter-based decoder. These results validate a new BMI strategy in which accumulated data history are effectively harnessed, and may facilitate reliable BMI use by reducing decoder retraining downtime.

Automatic extraction of semantic relation between pair of nouns is an important task with many potential applications like information retrieval, information extraction, text summarization, machine translation, question answering, thesaurus construction and word sense disambiguation. This paper describes an approach that extracts hypernym and meronym relation between proper nouns in sentences of a given text. Here machine learning techniques are used to automatically extract proper nouns with a given relationship from a text corpus. This work is based on dependency parsing with ADTree and Naive Bayes classifier. The approach is based on the analysis of the paths between noun pairs in the dependency parse trees of the sentences.

TI Surface-rolling molecules
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Design, syntheses, and testing of new, fullerene-wheeled single molecular nanomachines, namely, nanocars and nanotrucks, are presented. These nanovehicles are composed of three basic components that include spherical fullerene wheels, freely rotating alkynyl axles, and a molecular chassis. The use of spherical wheels based on C-60 and freely rotating axles based on alkynes permits directed nanoscale rolling of the molecular structure on gold surfaces. The rolling motion observed by STM resembles the same motion performed by macroscopic entities in which rolling occurs perpendicular to the axles. A new synthesis methodology, in situ ethynylation of fullerenes, was developed for the realization of the fullerene-wheeled molecular machines. Four generations of the fullerene-wheeled structures were developed, and the latest fourth generation nanocar, 3b, along with three-wheeled triangular compounds, 4a and 4b, provided definitive evidence for fullerene-based wheel-like rolling motion, not stick-slip or sliding translation. The studies here underscore the ability to control directionality of motion in molecular-sized nanostructures through precise molecular design and synthesis.

AB The Abstract State Machine (ASM) theory is a way to specify algorithms, applications and systems in a formal model. Recent ASM languages and tools address either the translation of ASM specifications to a specific target programming language or aim at the execution in a specific environment. In this work-in-progress paper we outline a model-based transformation approach supporting (1) the specification of applications or systems using the Corinthian Abstract State Machine (CASM) modeling language and (2) retargeting those applications to different programming language and hardware target domains. An intermediate model is introduced, which not only captures software-based implementations, but also the generation of hardware-related code in the same model. This approach offers a new formal modeling perspective onto modular, reusable and retargetable software and hardware designs for the development of embedded systems. We provide a short overview of our CASM compiler design as well as the retargetable model-based approach to generate code for different target domains.

AB Transformers have become a predominant machine learning workload, they are not only the de-facto standard for natural language processing tasks, but they are also being deployed in other domains such as vision and speech recognition. Many of the transformer-based applications are real-time systems such as machine translation and web search. These real time systems often come with strict end-to-end inference latency requirements. Unfortunately, while the majority of the transformer computation comes from matrix multiplications, transformers also include several non-linear components that tend to become the bottleneck during an inference. In this work, we accelerate the inference of BERT models on the tensor streaming processor. By carefully fusing all the nonlinear components with the matrix multiplication components, we are able to efficiently utilize the on-chip matrix multiplication units resulting in a deterministic tail latency of 130 mu s for a batch-1 inference through BERT-base, which is 6x faster than the current state-of-the-art.

Recent advancements in technology, including computation, robotics, machine learning, communication, and miniaturization of sensors have been used primarily in manufacturing, military, space exploration, and entertainment. However, few efforts have been made to utilize these technologies to enhance the quality of life of people with disabilities.

TI Roles of the U5 snRNP in spliceosome dynamics and catalysis
SO BIOCHEMICAL SOCIETY TRANSACTIONS
AB Most protein-coding genes in eukaryotes are interrupted by non-coding intervening sequences (introns), which must be precisely removed from primary gene transcripts (pre-mRNAs) before translation of the message into protein. Intron removal by pre-mRNA splicing occurs in the nucleus and is catalysed by complex ribonucleoprotein machines called spliceosomes. These molecular machines consist of several small nuclear RNA molecules and their associated proteins [together termed snRNP (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein) particles], plus multiple accessory factors. Of particular interest are the U2, U5 and U6 snRNPs, which play crucial roles in the catalytic steps of splicing. in the present review, we summarize our current understanding of the role played by the protein components of the US snRNP in pre-mRNA splicing, which include some of the largest and most highly conserved nuclear proteins.

AB Fine-tuning pre-trained cross-lingual language models can transfer task-specific supervision from one language to the others. In this work, we propose to improve cross-lingual fine-tuning with consistency regularization. Specifically, we use example consistency regularization to penalize the prediction sensitivity to four types of data augmentations, i.e., subword sampling, Gaussian noise, code-switch substitution, and machine translation. In addition, we employ model consistency to regularize the models trained with two augmented versions of the same training set. Experimental results on the XTREME benchmark show that our method1 significantly improves cross-lingual fine-tuning across various tasks, including text classification, question answering, and sequence labeling.

Neural networks provide an efficient way for representation learning, yielding important improvement in several tasks. These tasks include document classification, syntactic parsing, automatic speech recognition and machine translation. Whereas the performances achieved by neural networks are impressive, their conception and optimization are still challenging. Moreover, these architectures are merely understood as efficient black boxes and their results remain difficult to interpret and explain. This special issue explores contributions of deep learning to NLP, their promises along with their limits and peculiarities.

AB This paper provides a method for indexing and retrieving Arabic texts, based on natural language processing. Our approach exploits the notion of template in word stemming and replaces the words by their stems. This technique has proven to be effective since it has returned significant relevant retrieval results by decreasing silence during the retrieval phase. Series of experiments have been conducted to test the performance of the proposed algorithm ESAIR (Enhanced Stemmer for Arabic Information Retrieval). The results obtained indicate that the algorithm extracts the exact root with an accuracy rate up to 96% and hence, improving information retrieval.

SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB The combination of white light interferometry with hyperspectral imaging ("hyperspectral interferometry") is a recently proposed technique for single-shot measurement of 3D surface profiles. We consider for the first time its application to speckled wavefronts from optically rough surfaces. The intensity versus wavenumber signal at each pixel provides unambiguous range information despite the speckle-induced random phase shifts. Experimental results with samples undergoing controlled rigid body translation demonstrate a measurement repeatability of 460 nm for a bandwidth of approximately 30 nm. Potential applications include roughness measurement and coordinate measurement machine probes where rapid data acquisition in noncooperative environments is essential.

TI IRES-dependent translated genes in fungi: computational prediction,
   phylogenetic conservation and functional association
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB Background: The initiation of translation via cellular internal ribosome entry sites plays an important role in the stress response and certain physiological conditions in which canonical cap-dependent translation initiation is compromised. Currently, only a limited number of these regulatory elements have been experimentally identified. Notably, cellular internal ribosome entry sites lack conservation of both the primary sequence and mRNA secondary structure, rendering their identification difficult. Despite their biological importance, the currently available computational strategies to predict them have had limited success. We developed a bioinformatic method based on a support vector machine for the prediction of internal ribosome entry sites in fungi using the 5'-UTR sequences of 20 non-redundant fungal organisms. Additionally, we performed a comparative analysis and characterization of the functional relationships among the gene products predicted to be translated by this cap-independent mechanism.
   Results: Using our method, we predicted 6,532 internal ribosome entry sites in 20 non-redundant fungal organisms. Some orthologous groups were enriched with our positive predictions. This is the case of the HSP70 chaperone family, which remarkably has two verified internal ribosome entry sites, one in humans and the other in flies. A second example is the orthologous group of the eIF4G repression protein Sbp1p, which has two homologous genes known to be translated by this cap-independent mechanism, one in mice and the other in yeast. These examples emphasize the wide conservation of these regulatory elements as a result of selective pressure. In addition, we performed a protein-protein interaction network characterization of the gene products of our positive predictions using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model, which revealed a highly connected and modular topology, suggesting a functional association. A remarkable example of this functional association is our prediction of internal ribosome entry sites elements in three components of the RNA polymerase II mediator complex.
   Conclusions: We developed a method for the prediction of cellular internal ribosome entry sites that may guide experimental and bioinformatic analyses to increase our understanding of protein translation regulation. Our analysis suggests that fungi show evolutionary conservation and functional association of proteins translated by this cap-independent mechanism.

AB One interesting trend of SIMD architecture is towards Vector Length Agnostic (VLA) designs. For example, ARM new vector ISA, Scalable Vector Extension (SVE), and RISC-V vector extension are adopting such a direction. VLA decouples the vector register length from the compiled binary so that the same executable could run on different implementations of vector length. However, in the current application world, the majority of SIMD code is fixed-length based, such as ARM-NEON, x86-SSE, x86-AVX, and traditional vector machines. Therefore, how to migrate legacy SIMD code to VLA architecture would be an interesting and important technical challenge.

AB Extended multi bottom-up tree transducers are defined and investigated. They are an extension of multi bottom-up tree transducers by arbitrary, not just shallow, left-hand sides of rules; this includes rules that do not consume input. It is shown that such transducers, even linear ones, can compute all transformations that are computed by linear extended top-down tree transducers, which are a theoretical model for syntax-based machine translation. Moreover, the classical composition results for bottom-up tree transducers are generalized to extended multi bottom-up tree transducers. Finally, characterizations in terms of extended top-down tree transducers and tree bimorphisms are presented.

The semantics of the source and target languages as well as the translation between them have been written in the specification language of the Coq proof assistant. The proof of observational semantic equivalence between the source and generated code has been machine-checked using Coq. An executable compiler was obtained by automatic extraction of executable Caml code from the Coq specification of the translator, combined with a certified compiler back-end generating PowerPC assembly code from Cminor, described in previous work.

In experiments based on a small number of labeled examples (similar to 1.7K-5K sentences) we evaluate its performance intrinsically on both English-Chinese and English-Arabic alignment, where we achieve major improvements over unsupervised baselines (11-27 F1). We evaluate the model extrinsically on data projection for Chinese NER, showing that our alignments lead to higher performance when used to project NER tags from English to Chinese. Finally, we perform an ablation analysis and an annotation experiment that jointly support the utility and feasibility of future manual alignment elicitation.

AB Word sense disambiguation plays an important role in natural language processing, such as information retrieval, text summarization, machine translation etc. This paper proposes a corpus-based Chinese word sense disambiguation approach using HowNet. The method is based on the co-occurrence frequency between the relatives (such as synonym, antonymy, metonymy) of target word and each word in the context. Further, domains have been used to characterize the senses of polysemous word. To our knowledge, this is the first time a Chinese word sense disambiguation method using domain knowledge is reported. The accuracy is 73.2% at present. The experimental result shows that the method is very promising for Chinese word sense disambiguation.

AB The sharing phenomena of components in Bei words sentence is important in the whole syntactic relations in punctuation sentence. Abundent researches by traditional linguistics, which study the structure of bei words sentences, provide a sound basis for studing the sharing of components in Bei words sentence This paper studies whether the xupei sentence missing components is assigned to share the phrase of Bei word, subject or object of preposition, when the yuanpei sentence is Bei word sentence. It is worthy for a deep understanding of Chinese and for the Chinese foreign machine translation.

AB This paper presents a new robot which produces four motions for high speed handling (three translations and one rotation about a given axis in world coordinates). This machine is an evolution of H4's architecture. Firstly, H4 advantages are recalled, and some limitations are mentioned. To compensate for these limitations a new design of the traveling plate is proposed. A description of the whole mechanism is given. The structure's ability to provide Scara Motions is presented. Geometrical conditions that must be followed in order to obtain desired motions are discussed. Kinematics models are derived. The design of the first prototype is described.

TI Artificial Intelligence Predictor for Alzheimer's Disease Trained on
   Blood Transcriptome: The Role of Oxidative Stress
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease diagnosed by clinicians through healthcare records and neuroimaging techniques. These methods lack sensitivity and specificity, so new antemortem non-invasive strategies to diagnose AD are needed. Herein, we designed a machine learning predictor based on transcriptomic data obtained from the blood of AD patients and individuals without dementia (non-AD) through an 8 x 60 K microarray. The dataset was used to train different models with different hyperparameters. The support vector machines method allowed us to reach a Receiver Operating Characteristic score of 93% and an accuracy of 89%. High score levels were also achieved by the neural network and logistic regression methods. Furthermore, the Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of the features selected to train the model along with the genes differentially expressed between the non-AD and AD transcriptomic profiles shows the "mitochondrial translation" biological process to be the most interesting. In addition, inspection of the KEGG pathways suggests that the accumulation of beta-amyloid triggers electron transport chain impairment, enhancement of reactive oxygen species and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Taken together, all these elements suggest that the oxidative stress induced by beta-amyloid is a key feature trained by the model for the prediction of AD with high accuracy.

AB To solve the basic problem in the turning simulation for NC (numerical control) program verification, the NC code translator and three-dimensional kinetic model are discussed in the virtual NC machining environment. Combination of turning process characteristic, a simulation method is proposed to verify the NC program. This method abstracts the workpiece into a series of planes. Turning is accomplished and abstracted by cutting each plane by VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) extrusion node. The lathe tool feed is driven by NC program. This method is tested by virtual environment, and the experiment shows that the method is available and feasible.

AB This paper presents a system, named CAPTOP, for authoring and checking operating procedures for plant operations. It consists of a knowledge base of plant unit operations that can be linked to a graphical front end for inputting operating instructions. The system then builds a formal model of the instruction set as an interlingua and then uses it to output multilingual operating procedures. It avoids the problems of natural language understanding that make machine translation so difficult. Furthermore, the system could also generate output in a formal syntax that can be used as input to another knowledge based component, CHECKOP, for checking the procedure for operability and safety problems.
