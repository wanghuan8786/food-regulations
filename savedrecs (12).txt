AB A dexterous tele-micromanipulation systems using haptic interfaces have been developed for the application in assembling electrical / optical parts for recent electrical devices, micro-machine, etc. This paper describes the development of visual operation support systems for tele-micro manipulation systems.
   Because of its better manipulation positioning accuracy, stiffness and speed characteristics, parallel mechanism micromanipulator was chosen to compose our system[1]. While the parallel manipulator has the above-mentioned merit, there is a demerit that parallel mechanism's workspace is narrow and the translation motion workspace changes depends on the posture of end-effector. Providing workspace information in real time to the human operator, he can recognize the workspace and it helps planning micromanipulation process.
   A parallel manipulator motion is restricted by three factors: mechanical limits of the passive joints, collision between the links and actuators limitations. Results of the numerical workspace analysis considering the above factors are shown. Based on the workspace analysis, VR simulator and workspace display systems for micromanipulator is proposed. The feasibility of the use of workspace display system for micromanipulation is then discussed.

AB Natural language processing, such as Checking and Correction of Texts, Machine Translation, and Information Retrieval, usually starts from words. The identification of words in Indo-European languages is a trivial task. However, this problem named text segmentation has been, and is still a bottleneck for various Asian languages, such as Chinese. There have been two main groups of approaches to Chinese segmentation: dictionary-based approaches and statistical approaches. However, both approaches have difficulty to deal with some Chinese text. To address the difficulties, we propose a hybrid approach using Sensitive Word Concept to Chinese text segmentation. Sensitive words axe the compound words whose syntactic category is different from those of their components. According to the segmentation, a sensitive word may play different roles, leading to significantly different syntactic structures. In this paper, we explain the concept of sensitive words and their efficacy in text segmentation firstly, then describe the hybrid approach that combines the rule-based method and the probability-based method using the concept of sensitive words. Our experimental results showed that the presented approach is able to address the text segmentation problems effectively.

TI AUTOMATED GENERATION AND ANALYSIS OF POWDER COMPACTION DIAGRAMS
SO POWDER TECHNOLOGY
AB The compaction diagram is a useful characterization tool for measuring the strength of powder agglomerates (e.g. granules) and characterizing the microstructural development of powder compacts in dry forming operations. The current work describes a new method for the rapid measurement and analysis of compaction diagrams. A computer-controlled testing machine was used to collect crosshead versus load data during powder compaction in a uniaxial die. The net crosshead translation during loading included the permanent compaction of the powder plus the combined elastic deflections of the powder compact and the testing apparatus. In order to compensate for the elastic deformation in the testing apparatus, baseline data were collected by compressing an empty die and were subtracted from the net crosshead position. At the high pressure endpoint, the elastic deformation in the powder compact (i.e. springback) is the difference between the adjusted crosshead position and the thickness of the pellet after ejection from the die. At intermediate pressures, mathematical models were used to estimate the springback. This approach resulted in improved accuracy, significant time savings and an expanded scope of analytical capability compared to other methods of generating compaction diagrams.

AB This work investigates the compatibility between label smoothing (LS) and knowledge distillation (KD). Contemporary findings addressing this thesis statement take dichotomous standpoints: Muller et al. (2019); Shen et al. (2021b). Critically, there is no effort to understand and resolve these contradictory findings, leaving the primal question - to smooth or not to smooth a teacher network? - unanswered. The main contributions of our work are the discovery, analysis and validation of systematic diffusion as the missing concept which is instrumental in understanding and resolving these contradictory findings. This systematic diffusion essentially curtails the benefits of distilling from an LS-trained teacher, thereby rendering KD at increased temperatures ineffective. Our discovery is comprehensively supported by large-scale experiments, analyses and case studies including image classification, neural machine translation and compact student distillation tasks spanning across multiple datasets and teacherstudent architectures. Based on our analysis, we suggest practitioners to use an LS-trained teacher with a low-temperature transfer to achieve high performance students.

CL Incheon, SOUTH KOREA
AB Transformer conducts self attention which has achieved state-of-the-art performance in many applications. Multi-head attention in transformer basically gathers the features from individual tokens in input sequence to form the mapping to output sequence. There are twofold weaknesses in transformer. First, due to the natural property that attention mechanism would mix up the features of different tokens in input and output sequences, it is likely that the representation of input tokens contains redundant information. Second, the patterns of attention weights between different heads tend to be similar, the model capacity is bounded. To strengthen the sequential learning, this paper presents a variational disentangled mask attention in transformer where the redundant features are enhanced with semantic information. Latent disentanglement in multi-head attention is learned. The attention weights are filtered by a mask which is optimized by semantic clustering. The proposed attention mechanism is then implemented according to a Bayesian learning for clustered disentanglement. The experiments on machine translation show the merit of the disentangled mask attention.

TI Comprehensive analysis of embeddings and pre-training in NLP
SO COMPUTER SCIENCE REVIEW
AB The amount of data and computing power has drastically increased over the last decade, which leads to the development of several new fronts in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). In addition to that, the entanglement of embeddings and large pre-trained models have pushed the field forward, covering a wide variety of tasks starting from machine translation to more complex tasks such as contextual text classification. This paper covers the underlying idea behind all embeddings and pre -trained models and provides an insight into fundamental strategies and implementation details of innovative embeddings. Further, it imparts the pros and cons of each specific embedding design and the associated impact on the result. It also comprehends the comparison of all the different strategies, datasets, architectures discussed in different papers with the help of standard metrics used in NLP. The content covered in this review work aims to shed light on different milestones reached in NLP, allowing the reader to deepen their understanding of NLP, which would motivate to explore the field further.

AB Typically, tokenization is the very first step in most text processing works. As a token serves as an atomic unit that embeds the contextual information of text, how to define a token plays a decisive role in the performance of a model.
   Even though Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) has been considered the de facto standard tokenization method due to its simplicity and universality, it still remains unclear whether BPE works best across all languages and tasks. In this paper, we test several tokenization strategies in order to answer our primary research question, that is, "What is the best tokenization strategy for Korean NLP tasks?"
   Experimental results demonstrate that a hybrid approach of morphological segmentation followed by BPE works best in Korean to/from English machine translation and natural language understanding tasks such as KorNLI, KorSTS, NSMC, and PAWS-X. As an exception, for KorQuAD, the Korean extension of SQuAD, BPE segmentation turns out to be the most effective.

TI Transferrable Expertise From Bionic Arms to Robotic Exoskeletons:
   Perspectives for Stroke and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL ROBOTICS AND BIONICS
AB Upper extremity function is affected by a variety of neurological conditions. Robotic exoskeletons offer a potential solution for motor restoration. However, their systematic adoption is limited by challenges relative to human intention detection and device control. This position article offers a focused perspective on this topic. That is, on how knowledge gained from the design and implementation of human-machine interfaces (HMIs) for bionic arms can benefit the field of rehabilitation exoskeletons. Three broadly used HMIs in bionic arms are here investigated, including surface electromyography, impedance, and body-powered control. We propose that combinations of these HMIs could push forward upper extremity exoskeleton development. In this context, we provide concrete applicative examples in two selected clinical scenarios, including post-stroke and Duchenne muscular dystrophy individuals. The discussed solutions can open new avenues for the translation of robotic exoskeletons in a large set of clinical settings and enable a class of exoskeleton technologies that could support a broader range of impairment and disease types.

TI Why do deep convolutional networks generalize so poorly to small image
   transformations?
SO JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH
AB Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly assumed to be invariant to small image transformations: either because of the convolutional architecture or because they were trained using data augmentation. Recently, several authors have shown that this is not the case: small translations or rescalings of the input image can drastically change the network's prediction. In this paper, we quantify this phenomena and ask why neither the convolutional architecture nor data augmentation are sufficient to achieve the desired invariance. Specifically, we show that the convolutional architecture does not give invariance since architectures ignore the classical sampling theorem, and data augmentation does not give invariance because the CNNs learn to be invariant to transformations only for images that are very similar to typical images from the training set. We discuss two possible solutions to this problem: (1) antialiasing the intermediate representations and (2) increasing data augmentation and show that they provide only a partial solution at best. Taken together, our results indicate that the problem of insuring invariance to small image transformations in neural networks while preserving high accuracy remains unsolved.

AB In terms of flexibility and versatility, the robotic drilling seems a promising solution for the large quantities of holes of aircraft structural parts. However, the low stiffness of the robots may induce chatter vibration in the drilling process, which results in poor surface quality and low machining productivity. Therefore, it is of vital importance to detect and prevent this undesirable instability. In this paper, an approach is presented for the acquisition of vibration signals of the end effector in robotic drilling. To begin with, the robotic drilling system is presented. Then the motion of the end effector is decomposed into the translation motion along the spindle and the plane motion perpendicular to the spindle. With the aid of the rigid body kinematics, the vibration signals of the end effector can be obtained through two triaxial accelerometers with the proposed method. Finally, the effects of accelerometer location and orientation errors are analyzed. The simulation results show that the measurement results are sensitive to both location and orientation errors.

On completion of these two stages, MUSE will be experimented in the Registry Office of Genoa Municipality which is supporting this activity by providing the authors with data, advice on the domain, and the opportunity to test MUSE on the field. The final purpose of this work is to make MUSE's services available to all the foreign citizens interacting with Genoa Municipality's Registry Office. The two languages currently supported are Spanish and Italian. Due to the high modularity of MUSE's architecture, a limited effort will be required to add other languages in the future, if the on site experimentation will be successful.

AB From the reason that a dependency structure explicitly expresses the dependency relations among concepts included in a natural language sentence, dependency structure is concluded to be suited best for the representation of meaning of natural language sentence. This paper presents several kinds of dependency structural configurations that can represent meanings of the major part of declarative natural language sentences.
   The most important application of the structure is the intermediate representation in machine translation system which must be independent of the sort of natural language but, nevertheless, must express every complicated natural language expressions.
   In this paper, the dependency structure including loop shaped dependency relation proposed by Kodama is shown to be indispensable for the illustrations of important variations of relative and comparative natural language sentences.
   Also in this paper, the meanings respectively expressed by a dependency structure and the predicate logical function representing the same geometrical structure, are defined to be equivalent. Making use of the equivalence, ways to describe common nouns and quantifiers are obtained.

TI Locating overlapping industrial parts for robotic assembly
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB The problem of recognising overlapping parts is of considerable interest in industrial automation. While it Is possible to employ carriers or pallets to separate or prearrange the parts for robotic assembly tasks, a vision system which can recognise the parts even though they may be partially overlapped and in random positions is much flexible.
   In this paper, we employ a Hough transform technique to determine the poses (translations and rotations) of overlapping parts in the image. Shapes of parts are broken down into fragments, each representing either a line or a circular arc primitive. The geometrical relations and properties of primitives are used to derive the matching of primitive pairs between the model and the image. This paper also presents methods to determine the top-bottom relation of overlapping parts in grey-level image by tracing the shadowed points along the overlapping boundaries. The detected poses along with the top-bottom relation of overlapping parts provide sufficient information for robotic assembly in complex environment.

AB Embedding a programming language in a QR code is a new and extremely promising opportunity, as it makes devices and objects smarter without necessarily requiring an Internet connection. In this paper, all the steps needed to translate a program written in a high-level programming language to its binary representation encoded in a QR code, and the opposite process that, starting from the QR code, executes it by means of a virtual machine, have been carefully detailed. The proposed programming language was named QRscript, and can be easily extended so as to integrate new features.
   One of the main design goals was to produce a very compact target binary code. In particular, in this work we propose a specific sub-language (a dialect) that is aimed at encoding decision trees. Besides industrial scenarios, this is useful in many other application fields. The reported example, related to the configuration of an industrial networked device, highlights the potential of the proposed technology, and permits to better understand all the translation steps.

AB Traditional text classification requires thousands of annotated data or an additional Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system, which are expensive to obtain in real applications. This paper presents a Contrast-Enhanced Semi-supervised Text Classification (CEST) framework under label-limited settings without incorporating any NMT systems. We propose a certainty-driven sample selection method and a contrast-enhanced similarity graph to utilize data more efficiently in self-training, alleviating the annotation-starving problem. The graph imposes a smoothness constraint on the unlabeled data to improve the coherence and the accuracy of pseudolabels. Moreover, CEST formulates the training as a "learning from noisy labels" problem and performs the optimization accordingly. A salient feature of this formulation is the explicit suppression of the severe error propagation problem in conventional semi-supervised learning. With solely 30 labeled data per class for both training and validation dataset, CEST outperforms the previous state-of-the-art algorithms by 2.11% accuracy and only falls within the 3.04% accuracy range of fully-supervised pre-training language model fine-tuning on thousands of labeled data.

CT 3rd Workshop on Gender Bias in Natural Language Processing (GeBNLP)
CY AUG 05, 2021
CL ELECTR NETWORK
AB Gender bias is a frequent occurrence in NLP-based applications, especially pronounced in gender-inflected languages. Bias can appear through associations of certain adjectives and animate nouns with the natural gender of referents, but also due to unbalanced grammatical gender frequencies of inflected words. This type of bias becomes more evident in generating conversational utterances where gender is not specified within the sentence, because most current NLP applications still work on a sentence-level context. As a step towards more inclusive NLP, this paper proposes an automatic and generalisable re-writing approach for short conversational sentences. The rewriting method can be applied to sentences that, without extra-sentential context, have multiple equivalent alternatives in terms of gender. The method can be applied both for creating gender balanced outputs as well as for creating gender balanced training data. The proposed approach is based on a neural machine translation (NMT) system trained to 'translate' from one gender alternative to another. Both the automatic and manual analysis of the approach show promising results for automatic generation of gender alternatives for conversational sentences in Spanish.

TI Plasma cells: The programming of an antibody-secreting machine
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY
AB Antibodies are an essential component of our immune system, underpinning the effectiveness of both the primary immune response to microbial pathogens and the protective and long-lived immunity against re-challenge. All antibodies are produced by relatively rare populations of plasmablasts and plasma cells, collectively termed antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). It is now apparent that ASCs are unique in the body in terms of their gene expression program and metabolic pathways that enable these cells to have an extraordinary rate of immunoglobulin gene transcription, translation, assembly and secretion. In this review we will discuss the cellular, metabolic and molecular specialization that allows ASCs to maintain such high rates of antibody production, in some cases for the life of the individual. Throughout the review we will link these exquisite cellular and molecular adaptations to the major regulators of ASC gene expression, in an attempt to define how the ASC phenotype and function is genetically programmed.

AB A new method of biometric identity verification using images of fingers (contact-less sensing) is presented. The method utilizes ridge orientation along lines between easily and reliably extracted key points and bispectral invariant features from the ridge orientation profiles. Rotation is corrected in the preprocessing stage after extraction of key points. Robustness to translation and scale are incorporated in the feature extraction. The method does not rely on minutiae extraction and has potential for feature fusion from multiple fingers for improved performance. A radial basis function Support Vector Machine is trained to perform each identity verification. Results were obtained using 1341 index finger images from 41 individuals with 10-fold cross validation. The system shows about 12% misses at a setting of 1% false alarms and the classification accuracy of the fused system is 92.99%. The performance can be improved with the use of multiple fingers. The proposed methodology can facilitate high traffic, soft identity verification in busy premises such as shopping centres with presentation of the hand as a person walks through.

AB Aspect extraction is a subtask of aspect-based opinion mining, which aims to identify and categorize opinion targets such as product features in opinionated text. This is a challenging problem since users often use different words to express the same aspect or even mention about aspects implicitly. Supervised methods, while accurate, are not widely used for this problem mainly because they require annotated data which is costly to obtain, especially for new product and aspect categories. In this paper, we present a supervised aspect extraction method that utilizes annotated data from another language (English), which is translated to the target language (Vietnamese) by a machine translation tool (Google Translate). To alleviate the negative effect of the difference in expressions and words in different languages, we propose using word embedding features to capture the similarity and the relationships between words in order to increase the effectiveness of the extraction process. We also introduce an annotated corpus of aspect categories extracted from restaurant reviews in Vietnamese, in which we conducted experiments to evaluate our method. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Temporal Attention Mechanism is one of the oldest and most challenges in neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and neuromorphic computing. The significances of investigation on the temporal attention mechanism is not only to build a more power efficient neuromorphic computing system but also to explore the knowledge of the perception system of human brain. In this paper, for the purpose of investigating the temporal attention mechanism of human brain, we proposed a hypothesis on attention mechanism with a mathematical model, utilized the proposed mathematical model to a conventional recurrent neural network (RNN). Consequently, we constructed a novel adjustable deep recurrent neural network with programmable attention mechanism. In this model, the attention mechanism is realized through programming the weights of the attention matrix. Moreover, a novel hardware implementation combining memristor and monolithic three-dimensional (3D) integration technology is developed and analyzed. Additionally, a novel nonlinear module hardware for traditional RRNs training phase is designed with memristors. At last, the application of the proposed attention-oriented deep RNNs on neural machine translation is discussed.

TI Mas-o-menos: a simple sign averaging method for discrimination in
   genomic data analysis
SO BIOINFORMATICS
AB Motivation: The successful translation of genomic signatures into clinical settings relies on good discrimination between patient sub-groups. Many sophisticated algorithms have been proposed in the statistics and machine learning literature, but in practice simpler algorithms are often used. However, few simple algorithms have been formally described or systematically investigated.
   Results: We give a precise definition of a popular simple method we refer to as mas-o-menos, which calculates prognostic scores for discrimination by summing standardized predictors, weighted by the signs of their marginal associations with the outcome. We study its behavior theoretically, in simulations and in an extensive analysis of 27 independent gene expression studies of bladder, breast and ovarian cancer, altogether totaling 3833 patients with survival outcomes. We find that despite its simplicity, mas-o-menos can achieve good discrimination performance. It performs no worse, and sometimes better, than popular and much more CPU-intensive methods for discrimination, including lasso and ridge regression.

TI Tensile strength of the medial patellofemoral ligament before and after
   repair or reconstruction
SO JOURNAL OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY-BRITISH VOLUME
AB The tensile strength of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL), and of surgical procedures which reconstitute it, are unknown. Ten fresh cadaver knees were prepared by isolating the patella, leaving only the MPFL as its attachment to the medial femoral condyle. The MPFL was either repaired by using a Kessler suture or reconstructed using either bone anchors or one of two tendon grafting techniques. The tensile strength and the displacement to peak force of the MPFL were then measured using an Instron materials-testing machine.
   The MPFL was found to have a mean tensile strength of 208 N (SD 90) at 26 mm (SD 7) of displacement. The strengths of the other techniques were: sutures alone, 37 N (SD 27); bone anchors plus sutures, 142 N (SD 39); blind-tunnel tendon graft, 126 N (SD 21); and through-tunnel tendon graft, 195 N (SD 66). The last was not significantly weaker than the MPFL itself.

TI The connectionist inductive learning and logic programming system
SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE
AB This paper presents the Connectionist Inductive Learning and Logic Programming System (C-(ILP)-P-2). C-(ILP)-P-2 is a new massively parallel computational model based on a feedforward Artificial Neural Network that integrates inductive learning from examples and background knowledge, with deductive learning from Logic Programming. Starting with the background knowledge represented by a propositional logic program, a translation algorithm is applied generating a neural network that can be trained with examples. The results obtained with this refined network can be explained by extracting a revised logic program from it. Moreover, the neural network computes the stable model of the logic program inserted in it as background knowledge, or learned with the examples, thus functioning as a parallel system for Logic Programming. We have successfully applied C-(ILP)-P-2 to two real-world problems of computational biology, specifically DNA sequence analyses. Comparisons with the results obtained by some of the main neural, symbolic, and hybrid inductive learning systems, using the same domain knowledge, show the effectiveness of C-(ILP)-P-2.

AB The Transformer architecture has been well adopted as a dominant architecture in most sequence transduction tasks including automatic speech recognition (ASR), since its attention mechanism excels in capturing long-range dependencies. While models built solely upon attention can be better parallelized than regular RNN, a novel network architecture, SRU++, was recently proposed. By combining the fast recurrence and attention mechanism, SRU++ exhibits strong capability in sequence modeling and achieves near-state-of-the-art results in various language modeling and machine translation tasks with improved compute efficiency. In this work, we present the advantages of applying SRU++ in ASR tasks by comparing with Conformer across multiple ASR benchmarks and study how the benefits can be generalized to long-form speech inputs. On the popular LibriSpeech benchmark, our SRU++ model achieves 2.0% / 4.7% WER on test-clean / test-other, showing competitive performances compared with the state-of-the-art Conformer encoder under the same set-up. Specifically, SRU++ can surpass Conformer on long-form speech input with a large margin, based on our analysis.

TI Shape autotuning activation function
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB The choice of activation function is essential for building state-of-the-art neural networks. At present, the most widely-used activation function with effectiveness is ReLU. However, ReLU suffers from the weakness including non-zero mean, negative missing, and unbounded output, thus it has potential disadvantages in the optimization process. In this paper, we propose a novel activation function, namely ?Shape Autotuning Activation Function? (SAAF), to overcome these three challenges simultaneously. The SAAF inherits merits of smooth activation functions (such as Sigmoid and Tanh) and piecewise activation functions (such as ReLU and its variants), and avoids their deficiencies. Specifically, the SAAF adaptively adjusts a pair of independent trainable parameters to capture negative information and provide a near-zero mean output, resulting in better generalization performance and faster learning speed. At the same time, it provides bounded outputs to ensure a more stable distribution of output during network training. We evaluated SAAF on deep networks applied to a variety of tasks, including image classification, machine translation, and generative modeling. Comprehensive comparison study shows that the proposed SAAF is superior to state-of-the-art activation functions.

AB Language recognition has been significantly advanced in recent years by means of modern machine learning methods such as deep learning and benchmarks with rich annotations. However, research is still limited in low-resource formal languages. This consists of a significant gap in describing the colloquial language especially for low-resourced ones such as Persian. In order to target this gap for low resource languages, we propose a "Large Scale Colloquial Persian Dataset" (LSCP). LSCP is hierarchically organized in a semantic taxonomy that focuses on multi-task informal Persian language understanding as a comprehensive problem. This encompasses the recognition of multiple semantic aspects in the human-level sentences, which naturally captures from the real-world sentences. We believe that further investigations and processing, as well as the application of novel algorithms and methods, can strengthen enriching computerized understanding and processing of low resource languages. The proposed corpus consists of 120M sentences resulted from 27M tweets annotated with parsing tree, part-of-speech tags, sentiment polarity and translation in five different languages.

TI Systemic misogyny exposed: Translating Rapeglish from the Manosphere
   with a Random Rape Threat Generator
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES
AB Misogyny online in forms such as explicit rape threats has become so prevalent and rhetorically distinctive it resembles a new dialect or language. Much of this Rapeglish' is produced by members of an informal alliance of men's groups online dubbed the Manosphere'. As both a cyberhate researcher and cyberhate target, I have studied as well as contributed to feminist responses to Rapeglish. In 2016, for instance, I helped build a Random Rape Threat Generator (RRTG) - a computer program that splices, shuffles around, and re-stitches in novel combinations fragments of real-life Rapeglish to illustrate the formulaic, machine-like, and impersonal nature of misogynist discourse online. This article uses Yuri Lotman's ideas about intra- and inter-cultural conflict involving something akin to the translation of a foreign language to frame the RRTG as one example of the way women are talking back' both to and with Rapeglish (the latter involving appropriations and subversions of the original discourse).

AB For the sake of having a higher impact, academic publications are written in English and native language. However, as most academic journals and conferences use English as the publication language, new terms are usually introduced in English. As a consequence, introduction of new terms to other languages became harder. This problem is more evident in dynamic fields like Informatics where new terms are frequently introduced. In this work as a solution to this problem, a system for producing an English-Turkish terminology is constructed. Using the English and Turkish abstracts of thesis produced by Turkish universities terminology dictionary is formed automatically. Two existing methods in the literature are used and compared. One of the methods is modified for Turkish and extended to create a more comprehensive dictionary. Created system is able to automatically update itself with new terms using the new publications. Experiments evaluating the accuracy of the system is conducted using a manually built Informatics Terminology. The proposed algorithm is able to improve both the precision and recall of the system.

TI Multilingual sentiment analysis: from formal to informal and scarce
   resource languages
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW
AB The ability to analyse online user-generated content related to sentiments (e.g., thoughts and opinions) on products or policies has become a de-facto skillset for many companies and organisations. Besides the challenge of understanding formal textual content, it is also necessary to take into consideration the informal and mixed linguistic nature of online social media languages, which are often coupled with localised slang as a way to express 'true' feelings. Due to the multilingual nature of social media data, analysis based on a single official language may carry the risk of not capturing the overall sentiment of online content. While efforts have been made to understand multilingual sentiment analysis based on a range of informal languages, no significant electronic resource has been built for these localised languages. This paper reviews the various current approaches and tools used for multilingual sentiment analysis, identifies challenges along this line of research, and provides several recommendations including a framework that is particularly applicable for dealing with scarce resource languages.

AB Handling of human languages, especially written texts, requires analysis and implementation at different linguistic levels such as morphological analysis, Parts-of-Speech(POS) labeling at word level; chunking and clause identification at word group level; syntactic parsing at the sentence or structural level; semantic analysis at the level of meaning and finally discourse analysis at the discourse or text level. Discourse level analysis involves various sub-problems that deal with relationships between sentences and larger linguistic units. One such phenomenon is Anaphora Resolution (AR). Anaphora occurs frequently in written texts and spoken languages. Anaphora resolution is required in almost every application of NLP as information extraction (IE), summarization and Machine translation. The main focus of this paper is Entity Resolution (ER) and pronominal forms. Various approaches have been discussed to resolve Entity-pronoun references in Hindi. This paper will discuss the Rule Based approach among all the approaches, used to identify the anaphors and their antecedents. Rules have been framed for five types of pronouns that have been discussed in this paper.

AB Moments and moment invariants are the most useful tools in pattern recognition. Recently, the Conventional Disc-Harmonic Moments (CDHMs) are used to describe binary and gray scale images. In order to deal with color images in a holistic manner, these CDHMs are generalized as Quaternion Disc-Harmonic Moments (QDHMs) by using the quaternion algebra. Then the Rotation, Scaling and Translation (RST) invariants (CDHMIs and QDHMIs) are derived for more description of images that have undergone affine transformations. In this paper we first illustrate the discrimination power of these moments by evaluating their efficiency in image reconstruction application. Then we propose a new approach for human face recognition based on these moment invariants (CDHMIs and QDHMIs) as descriptors and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) as supervised learning models that analyze data and recognize patterns. Experimental results, obtained using two public datasets, show that the proposed approach is more efficient when the disc-harmonic moments are used instead of other existing descriptors.

AB Now, the iPhone/iPad have been widely used in the daily life. If we can apply this into the healthcare field, it will improve the efficiency for the doctor to scan the medical images information. In this case, we designed and developed a DICOM image portable browsing terminal system based on the iOS platform. It was developed by the Xcode, and contains the features that data synchronization, DICOM files parsing, multi-planar reconstruction(MPR), transferring the window, zoom, and translation of DICOM images. Because the portable devices possess several limitations relatively to PCs, such as low frequency, low memory and poor computing, etc, we used a multi-planar reconstruction accelerated method based on the incremental coordinate' transformation calculation method, which has greatly improved the multi-planer reconstruction speed, and the fluency and operability of the system,. All of them have made the system extremely conveniently, stability and maneuverability. It can be widely used in the whole machine of iOS system for the doctor intelligent diagnostic, has great clinical application value.

TI Verifying Estelle protocol specifications using Numerical Petri Nets
SO COMPUTER SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Verification of Estelle specifications is still the subject of much research. Several techniques have been devised to verify Estelle specifications; however, these techniques have so far been based on the translation of Estelle specifications into another form, such as finite state machines, Petri nets or temporal logic formulas, and impose some restrictions on the specifications to be verified: they use a subset of Estelle or restrict the complexity of the specifications that can be verified; or the specifications need to be specified in a variant of Estelle, rather than standard Estelle. In addition, dynamic behaviours of Estelle are not handled. This paper describes the verification of Estelle specifications by translating them into Numerical Petri Nets, which can then verified by a proven automated verification tool, PROTEAN. The merits of this approach, as compared to the existing methods, are that specifications are fully based on standard Estelle, and dynamic behaviours of Estelle specifications can be handled; and the deficiencies are that priority and delay clauses and systemprocess attribute cannot be modelled.

TI THE ESSENCE OF COMPILING WITH CONTINUATIONS
SO SIGPLAN NOTICES
AB In order to simplify the compilation process, many compilers for higher-order languages use the continuation-passing style (CPS) transformation in a first phase to generate an intermediate representation of the source program. The salient aspect of this intermediate form is that all procedures take an argument that represents the rest of the computation (the ''continuation''). Since the naive CPS transformation considerably increases the size of programs, CPS compilers perform reductions to produce a more compact intermediate representation. Although often implemented as a part of the CPS transformation, this step is conceptually a second phase. Finally, code generators for typical CPS compilers treat continuations specially in order to optimize the interpretation of continuation parameters.
   A thorough analysis of the abstract machine for CPS terms shows that the actions of the code generator invert the naive CPS translation step. Put differently, the combined effect of the three phases is equivalent to a source-to-source transformation that simulates the compaction phase. Thus, fully developed CPS compilers do not need to employ the CPS transformation but can achieve the same results with a simple source-level transformation.

TI Improving Loanword Identification in Low-Resource Language with Data
   Augmentation and Multiple Feature Fusion
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB Loanword identification is studied in recent years to alleviate data sparseness in several natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as machine translation, cross-lingual information retrieval, and so on. However, recent studies on this topic usually put efforts on high-resource languages (such as Chinese, English, and Russian); for low-resource languages, such as Uyghur and Mongolian, due to the limitation of resources and lack of annotated data, loanword identification on these languages tends to have lower performance. To overcome this problem, we first propose a lexical constraint-based data augmentation method to generate training data for low-resource language loanword identification; then, a loanword identification model based on a log-linear RNN is introduced to improve the performance of low-resource loanword identification by incorporating features such as word-level embeddings, character-level embeddings, pronunciation similarity, and part-of-speech (POS) into one model. Experimental results on loanword identification in Uyghur (in this study, we mainly focus on Arabic, Chinese, Russian, and Turkish loanwords in Uyghur) showed that our proposed method achieves best performance compared with several strong baseline systems.

SO INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE LEARNING, VOL 139
SE Proceedings of Machine Learning Research
CT International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)
CY JUL 18-24, 2021
CL ELECTR NETWORK
AB We study a fundamental problem in computational chemistry known as molecular conformation generation, trying to predict stable 3D structures from 2D molecular graphs. Existing machine learning approaches usually first predict distances between atoms and then generate a 3D structure satisfying the distances, where noise in predicted distances may induce extra errors during 3D coordinate generation. Inspired by the traditional force field methods for molecular dynamics simulation, in this paper, we propose a novel approach called ConfGF by directly estimating the gradient fields of the log density of atomic coordinates. The estimated gradient fields allow directly generating stable conformations via Langevin dynamics. However, the problem is very challenging as the gradient fields are roto-translation equivariant. We notice that estimating the gradient fields of atomic coordinates can be translated to estimating the gradient fields of interatomic distances, and hence develop a novel algorithm based on recent score-based generative models to effectively estimate these gradients. Experimental results across multiple tasks show that ConfGF outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin. The code is available at https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/ConfGF.

TI Convolutional auto encoders for sentence representation generation
SO TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES
AB In this study, we have proposed an alternative approach for sentence modeling problem. The difficulty of the choice of answer, the semantically related questions and the lack of syntactic closeness of the answers give rise to the difficulty of selecting the answer. The deep learning field has recently achieved a pivotal success in semantic analysis, machine translation, and text summaries. The essence of this work, inspired by the human orthographic processing mechanism and using multiple convolution filters with pre-rendered 2-Dimension (2D) representations of sentences, input or output size is to learn the basic features of the language without concerns. For this reason, the semantic relations in the sentence structure are learned by the convolutional variational auto-encoders first, and then the question and answer spaces learned by the auto-encoders are linked with proposed intermediate models. We have benchmarked five variations of our proposed model, which is based on Variational Auto-Encoder with multiple latent spaces and able to achieve lower error rates than the baseline model, which is the base Convolutional LSTM.

AB Deep Learning (DL) systems are key enablers for engineering intelligent applications due to their ability to solve complex tasks such as image recognition and machine translation. Nevertheless, using DL systems in safety- and security-critical applications requires to provide testing evidence for their dependable operation. Recent research in this direction focuses on adapting testing criteria from traditional software engineering as a means of increasing confidence for their correct behaviour. However, they are inadequate in capturing the intrinsic properties exhibited by these systems. We bridge this gap by introducing DeepImportance, a systematic testing methodology accompanied by an Importance-Driven (IDC) test adequacy criterion for DL systems. Applying IDC enables to establish a layer-wise functional understanding of the importance of DL system components and use this information to assess the semantic diversity of a test set. Our empirical evaluation on several DL systems, across multiple DL datasets and with state-of-the-art adversarial generation techniques demonstrates the usefulness and effectiveness of DeepImportance and its ability to support the engineering of more robust DL systems.

AB Architecture optimization, which is a technique for finding an efficient neural network that meets certain requirements, generally reduces to a set of multiple-choice selection problems among alternative sub-structures or parameters. The discrete nature of the selection problem, however, makes this optimization difficult. To tackle this problem we introduce a novel concept of a trainable gate function. The trainable gate function, which confers a differentiable property to discrete-valued variables, allows us to directly optimize loss functions that include non-differentiable discrete values such as 0-1 selection. The proposed trainable gate can be applied to pruning. Pruning can he carried out simply by appending the proposed trainable gate functions to each intermediate output tensor followed by fine-tuning the overall model, using any gradient-based training methods. So the proposed method can jointly optimize the selection of the pruned channels while fine-tuning the weights of the pruned model at the same time. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently optimizes arbitrary neural networks in various tasks such as image classification, style transfer, optical flow estimation, and neural machine translation.

AB Layer normalization (LayerNorm) is a technique to normalize the distributions of intermediate layers. It enables smoother gradients, faster training, and better generalization accuracy. However, it is still unclear where the effectiveness stems from. In this paper, our main contribution is to take a step further in understanding LayerNorm. Many of previous studies believe that the success of LayerNorm comes from forward normalization. Unlike them, we find that the derivatives of the mean and variance are more important than forward normalization by re-centering and re-scaling backward gradients. Furthermore, we find that the parameters of LayerNorm, including the bias and gain, increase the risk of over-fitting and do not work in most cases. Experiments show that a simple version of LayerNorm (LayerNorm-simple) without the bias and gain outperforms LayerNorm on four datasets. It obtains the state-of-the-art performance on En-Vi machine translation. To address the over-fitting problem, we propose a new normalization method, Adaptive Normalization (AdaNorm), by replacing the bias and gain with a new transformation function. Experiments show that AdaNorm demonstrates better results than LayerNorm on seven out of eight datasets.

AB Two requirements to utilise the large source of time-series sensor data from the Internet of Things are interoperability and efficient access. We present a Linked Data solution that increases interoperability through the use and referencing of common identifiers and ontologies for integration. From our study of the shape of Internet of Things data, we show how we can improve access within the resource constraints of Lightweight Computers, compact machines deployed in close proximity to sensors, by storing time-series data succinctly as rows and producing Linked Data 'just-in-time'. We examine our approach within two scenarios: a distributed meteorological analytics system and a smart home hub. We show with established benchmarks that in comparison to storing the data in a traditional Linked Data store, our approach provides gains in both storage efficiency and query performance from over 3 times to over three orders of magnitude on Lightweight Computers. Finally, we reflect how pushing computing to edge networks with our infrastructure can affect privacy, data ownership and data locality.

AB This paper describes our attempt to build a Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR) system as a part of the Indian language sub-task of the main Adhoc monolingual and bilingual track in CLEF1 competition. In this track, the task required retrieval of relevant documents from an English corpus in response to a query expressed in different Indian languages including Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali and Marathi. Groups participating in this track were required to submit a English to English monolingual run and a Hindi to English bilingual run with optional runs in rest of the languages. Our submission consisted of a monolingual English run and a Hindi to English cross-lingual run.
   We used a word alignment table that was learnt by a Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system trained on aligned parallel sentences, to map a query in the source language into an equivalent query in the language of the document collection. The relevant documents are then retrieved using a Language Modeling based retrieval algorithm. On the CLEF 2007 data set, our official cross-lingual performance was 54.4% of the monolingual performance and in the post submission

AB For most English words, dictionaries give various senses: e.g., "bank" can stand for a financial institution, shore, set, etc. Automatic selection of the sense intended in a given text has crucial importance in many applications of text processing, such as information retrieval or machine translation: e.g., "(my account in the) bank" is to be translated into Spanish as "(mi cuenta en el) banco" whereas "(on the) bank (of the lake)" as "(en la) orilla (del logo)." To choose the optimal combination of the intended senses of all words, Lesk suggested to consider the global coherence of the text, i.e., which we mean the average relatedness between the chosen senses for an words in the text. Due to high dimensionality of the search space, heuristics are to be used to find a near-optimal configuration. In this paper, we discuss several such heuristics that differ in terms of complexity and quality of the results. In particular, we introduce a dimensionality reduction algorithm that reduces the complexity of computationally expensive approaches such as genetic algorithms.

TI INNOVATIONS IN TEXT INTERPRETATION
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB The field of natural language processing is developing a new concentration on interpreting extended texts, with applications in information retrieval, text categorization, and data extraction. The research that addresses these problems represents the first real task-driven focus since machine translation research in the 1960s. Text interpretation applications have already produced good results in accuracy and throughput.
   This new focus on task-driven text interpretation has been the driving force for a number of advances in the field, because earlier systems fell so far short of the coverage required to interpret bodies of text. The innovations behind this scale-up include work in lexicon development and representation, weak methods of corpus analysis and text pre-processing, and flexible control architectures for parsing. Together, these methods provide coverage and accuracy in interpretation by extending the knowledge that a system can use and controlling how this knowledge is applied. This paper explains the context in which this research is conducted, along with the general progress of the field and some of the details of how our own system realizes these advances.

AB GRhOOT, the German RhetOrical OnTology, is a domain ontology of 110 rhetorical figures in the German language. The overall goal of building an ontology of rhetorical figures in German is not only the formal representation of different rhetorical figures, but also allowing for their easier detection, thus improving sentiment analysis, argument mining, detection of hate speech and fake news, machine translation, and many other tasks in which recognition of non-literal language plays an important role. The challenge of building such ontologies lies in classifying the figures and assigning adequate characteristics to group them, while considering their distinctive features. The ontology of rhetorical figures in the Serbian language was used as a basis for our work. Besides transferring and extending the concepts of the Serbian ontology, we ensured completeness and consistency by using description logic and SPARQL queries. Furthermore, we show a decision tree to identify figures and suggest a usage scenario on how the ontology can be utilized to collect and annotate data.

TI Collaborative semantic representation network for metaphor detection
SO APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
AB Metaphorical expressions are widely present in natural language, which brings huge challenges to various natural language processing tasks such as machine translation. Metaphor detection identifies the metaphorical usage of each word at the lexical level. How to effectively represent metaphor words and context semantics is the core element of this task. In this study, we propose a deep learning model that combines hierarchical feature representation and semantic interaction. Specifically, we extract the word-level and sentence-level representations of sentences as hierarchical feature representations. In this model, multi-attention combining word embedding, part-of-speech and position is proposed to focus on the importance of words from multiple levels. To integrate hierarchical features, efficient collaborative attention was developed to fuse word-level and sentence-level representations. This strategy helps to process features at different levels and makes the fusion vector more complementary and complete, which brings a natural perspective to feature extraction. Experimental results on the VU Amsterdam (VUA) Metaphor Corpus and TroFi show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The integration of new technologies and industry digitalization concerns service interoperability and automation of engineering processes, which involve new and emerging requirements. The description of service contracts and the capability of machines to determine interoperability mismatches become significant. New approaches require a complete and structured definition of service contracts, and the service description can be used to automate the engineering of service translations to enable seamless interoperability.
   Nevertheless, current interface description languages remain unaffected and do not evolve according to the new specifications. This work presents an analysis of the commonly used description languages, WSDL, WADL, and OpenAPI, and a systematic comparison of them.
   The languages have been analyzed and compared based on key requirements for the development of new tools such as interface generators and service contract translators. The results of the comparison highlight the language limitations to fully describe the service contract. The misalignment between the available interface description languages and the service contract requirements is outlined to help extend these languages to fully describe the service contract in future improvements.

AB Non-autoregressive transformer models have achieved extremely fast inference speed and comparable performance with autoregressive sequence-to-sequence models in neural machine translation. Most of the non-autoregressive transformers decode the target sequence from a predefined-length mask sequence. If the predefined length is too long, it will cause a lot of redundant calculations. If the predefined length is shorter than the length of the target sequence, it will hurt the performance of the model. To address this problem and improve the inference speed, we propose a spike-triggered non-autoregressive transformer model for end-to-end speech recognition, which introduces a CTC module to predict the length of the target sequence and accelerate the convergence. All the experiments are conducted on a public Chinese mandarin dataset AISHELL-1. The results show that the proposed model can accurately predict the length of the target sequence and achieve a competitive performance with the advanced transformers. What's more, the model even achieves a real-time factor of 0.0056, which exceeds all mainstream speech recognition models.

AB Neural machine translation systems have become state-of-the-art approaches for Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) task. In this paper, we propose a copy-augmented architecture for the GEC task by copying the unchanged words from the source sentence to the target sentence. Since the GEC suffers from not having enough labeled training data to achieve high accuracy. We pre-train the copy-augmented architecture with a denoising auto-encoder using the unlabeled One Billion Benchmark and make comparisons between the fully pre-trained model and a partially pre-trained model. It is the first time copying words from the source context and fully pre-training a sequence to sequence model are experimented on the GEC task. Moreover, We add token-level and sentence-level multi-task learning for the GEC task. The evaluation results on the CoNLL-2014 test set show that our approach outperforms all recently published state-of-the-art results by a large margin. The code and pre-trained models are released at https://github.com/zhawe01/fairseq-gec.

AB Automatically describing the content of an image is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence that connects computer vision and natural language processing. In this paper, we present a generative model based on a deep recurrent architecture that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation and that can be used to generate natural sentences describing an image. The model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the target description sentence given the training image. Experiments on several datasets show the accuracy of the model and the fluency of the language it learns solely from image descriptions. Our model is often quite accurate, which we verify both qualitatively and quantitatively. For instance, while the current state-of-the-art BLEU-1 score (the higher the better) on the Pascal dataset is 25, our approach yields 59, to be compared to human performance around 69. We also show BLEU-1 score improvements on Flickr30k, from 56 to 66, and on SBU, from 19 to 28. Lastly, on the newly released COCO dataset, we achieve a BLEU-4 of 27.7, which is the current state-of-the-art.

AB Semantic chunk is able to well describe the sentence semantic framework. It plays a very important role in Natural Language Processing applications, such as machine translation, QA system and so on. At present, the Tibetan chunk researches are mainly based on rule-methods. In this paper, according to the distinctive language characteristics of Tibetan, we firstly put forward the descriptive definition of the Tibetan semantic chunk and its labeling scheme and then we propose a feature selection algorithm to select the suitable ones automatically from the candidate feature-templates. Through the experiment conducted on the two different kinds of Tibetan corpus, namely corpus-sentence and corpus-discourse, the F-Measure achieves 95.84%, 94.95% and 91.97%, 88.82% by using of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model and Maximum Entropy (ME) model respectively. The positive results show that the definition of Tibetan semantic chunk in this paper is reasonable and operable. Furthermore, its boundary recognition is feasible and effective via statistical techniques in small scale corpus.

TI Challenges and Opportunities for Next-Generation Intracortically Based
   Neural Prostheses
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Neural prosthetic systems aim to help disabled patients by translating neural signals from the brain into control signals for guiding computer cursors, prosthetic arms, and other assistive devices. Intracortical electrode arrays measure action potentials and local field potentials from individual neurons, or small populations of neurons, in the motor cortices and can provide considerable information for controlling prostheses. Despite several compelling proof-of-concept laboratory animal experiments and an initial human clinical trial, at least three key challenges remain which, if left unaddressed, may hamper the translation of these systems into widespread clinical use. We review these challenges: achieving able-bodied levels of performance across tasks and across environments, achieving robustness across multiple decades, and restoring able-bodied quality proprioception and somatosensation. We also describe some emerging opportunities for meeting these challenges. If these challenges can be largely or fully met, intracortically based neural prostheses may achieve true clinical viability and help increasing numbers of disabled patients.

TI Three-axis NC milling simulation based on adaptive triangular mesh
SO COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
AB NC milling simulation has become an important step in computer aided manufacturing (CAM). To achieve real-time simulation, the total number of polygons has to be reduced, which results in poor image quality. This paper presents an adaptive triangular mesh algorithm to reduce the number of polygons while image quality remains high. Binary tree is used to represent the milling surface, and the optimization of the mesh is performed dynamically in the process of simulation. In this algorithm, the resolution of triangles is automatically updated according to local surface flatness, thus greatly reducing the number of triangles at planar regions. By doing this, real-time and high quality of visual presentation is insured and the translation, rotation and zooming operations are still applicable. When machining precision is evaluated, or overcut, undercut and interference are inspected, full resolution model stored in memory is automatically loaded to ensure the accuracy and correctness of these inspections. Finally, an example is presented to illustrate the validity of proposed algorithm. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Detailed knowledge of macromolecular structure is essential for the understanding of how the cellular machines work. Rigid body fitting is the common way to interpret the information contained in a 3D electron microscope (3DEM) medium-low resolution map in terms of its available atomic structural components. This fitting process, termed multi-resolution docking, consists in localizing atomic resolution structures into the 3DEM map by means of an exhaustive search of all possible relative rotations and translations. This exhaustive search is a highly computing demanding process and several search queries are also typically needed to select goodfitting structures.
   Here, we present a novel and efficient Grid approach for performing these docking searches. This approach has been designed over the Gridway meta-scheduler Results showing the high efficiency achieved are discussed together with the corresponding analysis of the performance obtained. The experiments were conducted on a Grid testbed built up from resources inside EGEE (LCG version of the pre-WS Globus components), the European production-level Grid infrastructure, and resourcesfrom a research testbed based on the Globus Toolkit 4 (Web Services components).

TI The essence of compiling with continuations
SO ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES
AB In order to simplify the compilation process, many compilers for higher-order languages use the continuation-passing style (CPS) transformation in a first phase to generate an intermediate representation of the source program. The salient aspect of this intermediate form is that all procedures take an argument that represents the rest of the computation (the "continuation"). Since the naive CPS transformation considerably increases the size of programs, CPS compilers perform reductions to produce a more compact intermediate representation. Although often implemented as a part of the CPS transformation, this step is conceptually a second phase. Finally, code generators for typical CPS compilers treat continuations specially in order to optimize the interpretation of continuation parameters.
   A thorough analysis of the abstract machine for CPS terms shows that the actions of the code generator invert the naive CPS translation step. Put differently, the combined effect of the three phases is equivalent to a source-to-source transformation that simulates the compaction phase. Thus, fully developed CPS compilers do not need to employ the CPS transformation but can achieve the same results with a simple source-level transformation.

TI ALS blood expression profiling identifies new biomarkers, patient
   subgroups, and evidence for neutrophilia and hypoxia
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
AB BackgroundAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a debilitating disease with few treatment options. Progress towards new therapies requires validated disease biomarkers, but there is no consensus on which fluid-based measures are most informative.MethodsThis study analyzed microarray data derived from blood samples of patients with ALS (n=396), ALS mimic diseases (n=75), and healthy controls (n=645). Goals were to provide in-depth analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), characterize patient-to-patient heterogeneity, and identify candidate biomarkers.ResultsWe identified 752 ALS-increased and 764 ALS-decreased DEGs (FDR<0.10 with>10% expression change). Gene expression shifts in ALS blood broadly resembled acute high altitude stress responses. ALS-increased DEGs had high exosome expression, were neutrophil-specific, associated with translation, and overlapped significantly with genes near ALS susceptibility loci (e.g., IFRD1, TBK1, CREB5). ALS-decreased DEGs, in contrast, had low exosome expression, were erythroid lineage-specific, and associated with anemia and blood disorders. Genes encoding neurofilament proteins (NEFH, NEFL) had poor diagnostic accuracy (50-53%). However, support vector machines distinguished ALS patients from ALS mimics and controls with 87% accuracy (sensitivity: 86%, specificity: 87%). Expression profiles were heterogeneous among patients and we identified two subgroups: (i) patients with higher expression of IL6R and myeloid lineage-specific genes and (ii) patients with higher expression of IL23A and lymphoid-specific genes. The gene encoding copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS) was most strongly associated with survival (HR=0.77; P=1.84e-05) and other survival-associated genes were linked to mitochondrial respiration. We identify a 61 gene signature that significantly improves survival prediction when added to Cox proportional hazard models with baseline clinical data (i.e., age at onset, site of onset and sex). Predicted median survival differed 2-fold between patients with favorable and risk-associated gene expression signatures.ConclusionsPeripheral blood analysis informs our understanding of ALS disease mechanisms and genetic association signals. Our findings are consistent with low-grade neutrophilia and hypoxia as ALS phenotypes, with heterogeneity among patients partly driven by differences in myeloid and lymphoid cell abundance. Biomarkers identified in this study require further validation but may provide new tools for research and clinical practice.

TI A Speech-Enabled Fixed-Phrase Translator for Emergency Settings:
   Crossover Study
SO JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS
AB Background: In the context of the current refugee crisis, emergency services often have to deal with patients who have no language in common with the staff. As interpreters are not always available, especially in emergency settings, medical personnel rely on alternative solutions such as machine translation, which raises reliability and data confidentiality issues, or medical fixed-phrase translators, which sometimes lack usability. A collaboration between Geneva University Hospitals and Geneva University led to the development of BabelDr, a new type of speech-enabled fixed-phrase translator. Similar to other fixed-phrase translators (such as Medibabble or UniversalDoctor), it relies on a predefined list of pretranslated sentences, but instead of searching for sentences in this list, doctors can freely ask questions.
   Objective: This study aimed to assess if a translation tool, such as BabelDr, can be used by doctors to perform diagnostic interviews under emergency conditions and to reach a correct diagnosis. In addition, we aimed to observe how doctors interact with the system using text and speech and to investigate if speech is a useful modality in this context.
   Methods: We conducted a crossover study in December 2017 at Geneva University Hospitals with 12 French-speaking doctors (6 doctors working at the outpatient emergency service and 6 general practitioners who also regularly work in this service). They were asked to use the BabelDr tool to diagnose two standardized Arabic-speaking patients (one male and one female). The patients received a priori list of symptoms for the condition they presented with and were instructed to provide a negative or noncommittal answer for all other symptoms during the diagnostic interview. The male patient was standardized for nephritic colic and the female, for cystitis. Doctors used BabelDr as the only means of communication with the patient and were asked to make their diagnosis at the end of the dialogue. The doctors also completed a satisfaction questionnaire.
   Results: All doctors were able to reach the correct diagnosis based on the information collected using BabelDr. They all agreed that the system helped them reach a conclusion, even if one-half felt constrained by the tool and some considered that they could not ask enough questions to reach a diagnosis. Overall, participants used more speech than text, thus confirming that speech is an important functionality in this type of tool. There was a negative association (P=.02) between the percentage of successful speech interactions (spoken sentences sent for translation) and the number of translated text items, showing that the doctors used more text when they had no success with speech.
   Conclusions: In emergency settings, when no interpreter is available, speech-enabled fixed-phrase translators can be a good alternative to reliably collect information from the patient.

TI Knowledge Graph and Deep Learning-based Text-to-GQL Model for
   Intelligent Medical Consultation Chatbot
SO INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS
AB Text-to-GQL (Text2GQL) is a task that converts the user's questions into GQL (Graph Query Language) when a graph database is given. That is a task of semantic parsing that transforms natural language problems into logical expressions, which will bring more efficient direct communication between humans and machines. The existing related work mainly focuses on Text-to-SQL tasks, and there is no available semantic parsing method and data set for the graph database. In order to fill the gaps in this field to serve the medical Human-Robot Interactions (HRI) better, we propose this task and a pipeline solution for the Text2GQL task. This solution uses the Adapter pre-trained by "the linking of GQL schemas and the corresponding utterances" as an external knowledge introduction plug-in. By inserting the Adapter into the language model, the mapping between logical language and natural language can be introduced faster and more directly to better realize the end-to-end human-machine language translation task. In the study, the proposed Text2GQL task model is mainly constructed based on an improved pipeline composed of a Language Model, Pre-trained Adapter plug-in, and Pointer Network. This enables the model to copy objects' tokens from utterances, generate corresponding GQL statements for graph database retrieval, and builds an adjustment mechanism to improve the final output. And the experiments have proved that our proposed method has certain competitiveness on the counterpart datasets (Spider, ATIS, GeoQuery, and 39.net) converted from the Text2SQL task, and the proposed method is also practical in medical scenarios.

TI Voxel-wise supervised analysis of tumors with multimodal engineered
   features to highlight interpretable biological patterns
SO MEDICAL PHYSICS
AB Background Translation of predictive and prognostic image-based learning models to clinical applications is challenging due in part to their lack of interpretability. Some deep-learning-based methods provide information about the regions driving the model output. Yet, due to the high-level abstraction of deep features, these methods do not completely solve the interpretation challenge. In addition, low sample size cohorts can lead to instabilities and suboptimal convergence for models involving a large number of parameters such as convolutional neural networks. Purpose Here, we propose a method for designing radiomic models that combines the interpretability of handcrafted radiomics with a sub-regional analysis. Materials and methods Our approach relies on voxel-wise engineered radiomic features with average global aggregation and logistic regression. The method is illustrated using a small dataset of 51 soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patients where the task is to predict the risk of lung metastasis occurrence during the follow-up period. Results Using positron emission tomography/computed tomography and two magnetic resonance imaging sequences separately to build two radiomic models, we show that our approach produces quantitative maps that highlight the signal that contributes to the decision within the tumor region of interest. In our STS example, the analysis of these maps identified two biological patterns that are consistent with STS grading systems and knowledge: necrosis development and glucose metabolism of the tumor. Conclusions We demonstrate how that method makes it possible to spatially and quantitatively interpret radiomic models amenable to sub-regions identification and biological interpretation for patient stratification.

TI Radiomics in radiooncology - Challenging the medical physicist
SO PHYSICA MEDICA-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PHYSICS
AB Purpose: Noticing the fast growing translation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to medical image analysis this paper emphasizes the future role of the medical physicist in this evolving field. Specific challenges are addressed when implementing big data concepts with high-throughput image data processing like radiomics and machine learning in a radiooncology environment to support clinical decisions.
   Methods: Based on the experience of our interdisciplinary radiomics working group, techniques for processing minable data, extracting radiomics features and associating this information with clinical, physical and biological data for the development of prediction models are described. A special emphasis was placed on the potential clinical significance of such an approach.
   Results: Clinical studies demonstrate the role of radiomics analysis as an additional independent source of information with the potential to influence the radiooncology practice, i.e. to predict patient prognosis, treatment response and underlying genetic changes. Extending the radiomics approach to integrate imaging, clinical, genetic and dosimetric data ('panomics') challenges the medical physicist as member of the radiooncology team.
   Conclusions: The new field of big data processing in radiooncology offers opportunities to support clinical decisions, to improve predicting treatment outcome and to stimulate fundamental research on radiation response both of tumor and normal tissue. The integration of physical data (e.g. treatment planning, dosimetric, image guidance data) demands an involvement of the medical physicist in the radiomics approach of radiooncology. To cope with this challenge national and international organizations for medical physics should organize more training opportunities in artificial intelligence technologies in radiooncology.

AB The shape and the condition of stent are important features in classification of Huanghua pears. As the commonly used thinning and erosion-dilation algorithm in judging the presence of the stem is too slow, a new fast algorithm was put forward. Compared with other part of the pear, the stem is obviously thin and long, with the help of various sized templates, the judgment of whether the stem is present was easily made, meanwhile the stem head and the intersection point of stem bottom and pear were labeled. Furthermore, after the slopes of the tangential line of stem head and tangential Line of stem bottom were found, the included angle of these two lines was calculated. It was found that the included angle of the broken stem was obviously different from that of the good stent After the analysis of 53 pictures of pears, the accuracy to judge whether the stem is present is 100% and whether the stem is good reaches 93%. Also, the algorithm is of robustness and can be made invariant to translation and rotation. Meanwhile, the method to describe the shape of irregular fruits was studied. Fourier transformation and inverse Fourier transformation pair were adopted to describe the shape of Huanghua pears, and the algorithm for shape identification, which was based on artificial neural network, was developed. The first sixteen harmonic components of the Fourier descriptor were enough to represent the primary shape of pear, and the identification accuracy could reach 90% by applying the Fourier descriptor in combination with artificial neural network.

TI Machine learning-based phenotypic screening for postmitotic growth
   inducers uncover vitamin D3 metabolites as small molecule ribosome
   agonists
SO CELL PROLIFERATION
AB Objectives To restore tissue growth without increasing the risk for cancer during aging, there is a need to identify small molecule drugs that can increase cell growth without increasing cell proliferation. While there have been numerous high-throughput drug screens for cell proliferation, there have been few screens for post-mitotic anabolic growth. Materials and Methods A machine learning (ML)-based phenotypic screening strategy was used to discover metabolites that boost muscle growth. Western blot, qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence staining were used to evaluate myotube hypertrophy/maturation or protein synthesis. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based thermal proteome profiling-temperature range (TPP-TR) technology was used to identify the protein targets that bind the metabolites. Ribo-MEGA size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis was used to verify whether the ribosome proteins bound to calcitriol. Results We discovered both the inactive cholecalciferol and the bioactive calcitriol are amongst the top hits that boost post-mitotic growth. A large number of ribosomal proteins' melting curves were affected by calcitriol treatment, suggesting that calcitriol binds to the ribosome complex directly. Purified ribosomes directly bound to pure calcitriol. Moreover, we found that calcitriol could increase myosin heavy chain (MHC) protein translation and overall nascent protein synthesis in a cycloheximide-sensitive manner, indicating that calcitriol can directly bind and enhance ribosomal activity to boost muscle growth. Conclusion Through the combined strategy of ML-based phenotypic screening and MS-based omics, we have fortuitously discovered a new class of metabolite small molecules that can directly activate ribosomes to promote post-mitotic growth.

TI Toward Global IoT-Enabled Smart Cities Interworking Using Adaptive
   Semantic Adapter
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB Since the Internet-of-Things (IoT) has been introduced, it is considered as one of the emerging technologies providing great opportunities to many vertical industries. One of the major IoT application areas that gets significant attention is smart city. Since it is unrealistic to expect full convergence toward a single IoT platform in the near future, it is mandatory to enable interworking between different platforms based on multiple standards, coexisting in the emerging smart cities. In this paper, we take the example of two global IoT standards, FIWARE and oneM2M, which are actively used in many smart city projects, and analyze them to show the feasibility of IoT platforms interworking. Based on the analysis, we design and implement a novel IoT interworking architecture providing a semantic driven integration framework suitable for smart city. The core idea behind our approach is to introduce interworking proxies that: 1) conduct a static mapping of sensor information between IoT platforms and 2) perform semantic interoperability using semantically annotated resources via a semantic interworking proxy that dynamically discovers new kinds of information and adapts itself to enable automatic translation of semantic data between given source and target IoT platforms while it is running. We present the system based on these proxies and evaluate it in Santander smart city. The results demonstrate that it is able to discover and manage IoT sensors connected to both oneM2M and FIWARE. It appears that the semantic approach provides the flexibility and dynamic adaptivity needed for fast growing and rapidly changing urban environments.

TI Mechanistic Evaluation of Motion in Redox-Driven Rotaxanes Reveals
   Longer Linkers Hasten Forward Escape's and Hinder Backward Translations
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Mechanistic understanding of the translational movements in molecular switches is essential for designing machine-like prototypes capable of following set pathways of motion. To this end, we demonstrated that increasing the station-to-station distance will speed up the linear movements forward and slow down the movements backward in a homologous series of bistable rotaxanes. Four redox-active rotaxanes, which drove a cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) (CBPQT(4+)) mobile ring between a tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) station and an oxyphenylene station, were synthesized with only variations to the lengths of the glycol linker connecting the two stations (n = 5, 8, 11, and 23 atoms). We undertook the first mechanistic study of the full cycle of motion in this class of molecular switch using cyclic voltammetry. The kinetics parameters (k, Delta G(double dagger) of switching were determined at different temperatures to provide activation enthalpies (Delta H-double dagger) and entropies (Delta S-double dagger). Longer glycol linkers led to modest increases in the forward escape (t(1/2) = 60 to <7 ms). The rate-limiting step involves movement of the tetracationic CBPQT(4+) ring away from the singly oxidized TTF+ unit by overcoming one of the thiomethyl (SMe) speed bumps before proceeding on to the secondary oxyphenylene station. Upon reduction, however, the return translational movement of the CBPQT(4+) ring from the oxyphenylene station back to the neutral TTF station was slowed considerably by the longer linkers (t(1/2) = 1.4 to >69 s); though not because of a diffusive walk. The reduced rate of motion backward depended on folded structures that were only present with longer linkers.

TI BiLSTM-CRF Manipuri NER with Character-Level Word Representation
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Named Entity Recognition and Classification (NER) serves as a foundation for many natural language processing tasks such as question answering, text summarization, news/document clustering and machine translation. Manipuri's early NER systems are based on machine learning approaches and employ handcrafted morphological features and domain-specific rules. The domain-specific rules for Manipuri NER are hard to extract as the language is highly agglutinative, inflectional and falls in the category of low resource language. In recent years, deep learning, empowered by continuous vector representation and semantic composition through non-linear processing, has been employed in the various NER task yielding state-of-the accuracy. In this paper, we propose a Manipuri NER model using Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) deep neural network in unison with an embedding technique. The embedding technique is a BiLSTM character-level word representation in conjunction with word embedding, which acts as a feature for the Bi-LSTM NER model. The proposed model also employs a Conditional Random Field (CRF) classifier to capture the dependency among output NER tags. Various Gradient Descent (GD) optimizers for the neural model were experimented with to establish an efficient GD optimizer for accurate NER. The NER model with RMSprop GD optimizer achieved an F-Score measure of approximately 98.19% at learning rate eta = 0.001 and with decay constant of rho = 0.9. Further, while performing an intrinsic evaluation on the word embedding, it is found that the proposed embedding technique as a feature can capture the semantic and syntactic rule of the language with 88.14% average clustering accuracy for all NE classes.

TI Development of the Smart Tools Proneness Questionnaire (STP-Q): an
   instrument to assess the individual propensity to use smart tools
SO ERGONOMICS
AB Humans have developed a prolonged and special relationship with their tools, which themselves exhibit the propensity to become ever more intelligent across the years. A 'smart tool' is defined as to representing any entity, machine, or device that can complete an informational, mechanical, or electronic work. This work explains the development of the Smart Tool Proneness Questionnaire (STP-Q), which is designed to measure an individual's propensity to use smart tools. Data collection was designed to (1) identify the psychological dimensions underlying smart tool use (2) establish the questionnaire's reliability (3) validity, (4) propose a normalisation, and (5) provide an English translation of the French original. The work therefore implements a reliable and valid questionnaire, sensitive to inter-individual differences regarding the propensity to use smart tools. Statistical analysis reveals that the individual self-reported propensity for smart tool use rests on three factors (1) utilitarian use, (2) hedonic and social use, and (3) proneness to delegate. From a theoretical perspective, this individual propensity to use smart tools might be considered key to our species development. In practical terms, measuring an individual's propensity to use smart tools can be of considerable benefit to the design of future smart tools in both professional and non-professional settings. Practitioner summary: The STP-Q, a self-reported measure of an individual's propensity to use smart tools, was developed. STP-Q offers practitioners a measure of individual propensity to use smart tools along three dimensions: utilitarian use, hedonic and social use, and proneness to task delegate. Individual results can easily be interpreted from normalizations that STP-Q provides.

TI Customizable text generation via conditional text generative adversarial
   network
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
AB Automatically generating meaningful and coherent text has many applications, such as machine translation, dialogue systems, BOT application, etc. Text generation technology has attracted more attention over the past decades. A bunch of excellent methods are proposed; however, there are still challenges to generate text rivals the real one by human, such as most machines output fixed length text, or can only generate text quite the same with the input training text. In this paper, we put forward a novel text generation system, called customizable conditional text generative adversarial network, which is capable of generating diverse text content of variable length with customizable emotion label. It is more convenient for generating actual original text with specific sensitive orientation. We propose a conditional text generative adversarial network (CTGAN), in which emotion label is adopted as an input channel to specify the output text, and variable length text generation strategy is put forward. After generating initial texts by CTGAN, to make the generated text data match the real scene, we design an automated word-level replacement strategy, which extracts the keywords (e.g. nouns) from the training texts and replaces the specific keywords in the generated texts. Finally, we design a comprehensive evaluation metric based on various text evaluations, called mixed evaluation metric. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets testify that our proposed CTGAN behaves better than other text generation methods, i.e., generated text are more real compared with the real text than other generation methods, achieving state-of-the-art generation performance.

TI Classification of Pediatric Asthma: From Phenotype Discovery to Clinical
   Practice
SO FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
AB Advances in big data analytics have created an opportunity for a step change in unraveling mechanisms underlying the development of complex diseases such as asthma, providing valuable insights that drive better diagnostic decision-making in clinical practice, and opening up paths to individualized treatment plans. However, translating findings from data-driven analyses into meaningful insights and actionable solutions requires approaches and tools which move beyond mining and patterning longitudinal data. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent advances in phenotyping of asthma, to discuss key hurdles currently hampering the translation of phenotypic variation into mechanistic insights and clinical setting, and to suggest potential solutions that may address these limitations and accelerate moving discoveries into practice. In order to advance the field of phenotypic discovery, greater focus should be placed on investigating the extent of within-phenotype variation. We advocate a more cautious modeling approach by "supervising" the findings to delineate more precisely the characteristics of the individual trajectories assigned to each phenotype. Furthermore, it is important to employ differentmethods within a study to compare the stability of derived phenotypes, and to assess the immutability of individual assignments to phenotypes. If we are to make a step change toward precision (stratified or personalized) medicine and capitalize on the available big data assets, we have to develop genuine cross-disciplinary collaborations, wherein data scientists who turn data into information using algorithms and machine learning, team up with medical professionals who provide deep insights on specific subjects from a clinical perspective.

TI STRUCTURE-BORNE SOUND POWER EMISSION FROM RESILIENTLY MOUNTED FANS -
   CASE-STUDIES AND DIAGNOSIS
SO JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION
AB A method for calculating the structure-borne sound power emission through the resilient mounts of machines is investigated by comparing calculated power with in situ measured power for a range of fans on concrete floors. The structure-borne sound power is the structure-borne equivalent of the airborne sound power of the source and is of great potential interest in predicting structure-borne sound. Initially, the simplifying assumptions invoked ih the derivation are investigated by using data obtained from a typical fan installation. For the case studied it was found that the relative phases of the excitation at the various mount points could be assumed to be random, allowing significant simplification in the formulation. In addition, spatial averages of the free velocity of the machine source and the mobility of the supporting floor over the mount positions were found to be adequate. Furthermore, power transmission by rotations was shown to be insignificant compared with that due to vertical translation. These findings are not general but serve to increase confidence that acceptably accurate calculation of structure-borne sound power is feasible by using simplified formulations. Power has been calculated for four fan installations and compared with the directly measured power. In three of the cases the measured power significantly exceeded the calculated values indicating the presence of a dominant flanking transmission path (i.e., the mounts were bridged in some way). In one case the flanking via a duct support was quantified and was shown to dominate transmission through the mounts. In other cases reasonable agreement was obtained although some flanking transmission was still present. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited

TI Detection method of domain names generated by DGAs based on semantic
   representation and deep neural network
SO COMPUTERS & SECURITY
AB Botnets have become one of the main threats to cyberspace security currently. More and more bots utilize the domain generation algorithm (DGA) to generate malicious domain names to communicate with Command & Control (C&C) servers. A well-designed DGA can bypass the traditional detection methods such as sinkhole and rule filtering, which raises new challenges to cyberspace security. In the field of machine learning, the n-gram is a semantic model that characterizes the relationship among neighboring morphemes while deep convolutional neural networks have a robust capability in processing information with translation-invariant properties. In this paper, we combined n-gram and a deep convolutional neural network and then proposed a novel n-gram combined character based domain classification (n-CBDC) model. The n-CBDC model runs in an end-to-end way that doesn't require hand-extracted features or domain name system (DNS) contextual information; it only needs to input the domain name itself and can automatically estimate the probability that the domain name was generated by DGAs. Experiments on real-world data show that the proposed method can effectively detect domain names generated by DGAs with 98.69% average detection rate and 0.9829 average F-measure, and significantly outperformed the state-of-art methods in detecting pronounceable and wordlist-based DGA domain names with more than 93.89% detection rate. Therefore, the proposed detection method is robust and has a wide range of adaptability in detecting various types of domain names generated by DGAs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a class of recurrent neural networks that are widely used for machine learning tasks involving sequences, including machine translation, text generation, and speech recognition. Large-scale LSTMs, which are deployed in many real-world applications, are highly compute intensive. To address this challenge, we propose AxLSTM, an application of approximate computing to improve the execution efficiency of LSTMs. An LSTM is composed of cells, each of which contains a cell state along with multiple gating units that control the addition and removal of information from the state. The LSTM execution proceeds in timesteps, with a new symbol of the input sequence processed at each timestep. AxLSTM consists of two techniques-Dynamic Timestep Skipping (DTS) and Dynamic State Reduction (DSR). DTS identifies, at runtime, input symbols that are likely to have little or no impact on the cell state and skips evaluating the corresponding timesteps. In contrast, DSR reduces the size of the cell state in accordance with the complexity of the input sequence, leading to a reduced number of computations per timestep. We describe how AxLSTM can be applied to the most common application of LSTMs, viz., sequence-to-sequence learning. We implement AxLSTM within the TensorFlow deep learning framework and evaluate it on 3 state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence models. On a 2.7 GHz Intel Xeon server with 128 GB memory and 32 processor cores, AxLSTM achieves 1.08 x -1.31x speedups with minimal loss in quality, and 1.12 x -1.37x speedups when moderate reductions in quality are acceptable.

TI Discriminating subclinical depression from major depression using
   multi-scale brain functional features: A radiomics analysis
SO JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
AB Background: The diagnosis of subclinical depression (SD) currently relies exclusively on subjective clinical scores and structured interviews, which shares great similarities with major depression (MD) and increases the risk of misdiagnosis of SD and MD. This study aimed to develop a method of disease classification for SD and MD by resting-state functional features using radiomics strategy.
   Methods: Twenty-six SD, 36 MD subjects and 33 well-matched healthy controls (HC) were recruited and underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). A novel radiomics analysis was proposed to discriminate SD from MD. Multi-scale brain functional features were extracted to explore a comprehensive representation of functional characteristics. A two-level feature selection strategy and support vector machine (SVM) were employed for classification.
   Results: The overall classification accuracy among SD, MD and HC groups was 84.21%. Particularly, the model excellently distinguished SD from MD with 96.77% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and 92.31% specificity. Moreover, features with high discriminative power to distinguish SD from MD showed a strong association with default mode network, frontoparietal network, affective network, and visual network regions.
   Limitation: The sample size was relatively small, which may limit the application in clinical translation to some extent.
   Conclusion: These findings demonstrated that a valid radiomics approach based on functional measures can discriminate SD from MD with a high classification performance, facilitating an objective and reliable diagnosis individually in clinical practice.

AB Semantic web technology is more and more often applied to a large spectrum of applications where domain knowledge is conceptualized and formalized (Ontology) as a support for diversified processing (Reasoning) operated by machines. Moreover through a subtle joining of human reasoning (cognitive) and mechanical reasoning (logic-based), it is possible for humans and machines to share complementary tasks. To name few of those applications areas: Corporate Portals and Knowledge Management, E-Commerce, E-Work, Healthcare, E-Government, Natural Language understanding and Automated Translation, Information search, Data and Services Integration, Social networks and collaborative filtering, Knowledge Mining, etc. From a social and economic perspective, this emerging technology should contribute to growth in economic wealth, but it must also show clear cut value in our everyday activities in being technology transparent and efficient. The uptake of Semantic Web technology by industry is progressing slowly, One of the problems is that academia is not always aware of the concrete problems that arise in industry. Conversely, industry is not often well informed about the academic developments that can potentially meet its needs. In this paper we present an ongoing work in the cross-fertilization between industry and academy. In particular, we present a collection of applications fields and use cases from enterprises which are interested in the promises of Semantic Web technology. We explain our approach in the analysis of the industry needs. We summarize industrial knowledge processing requirements in the form of a typology of knowledge processing tasks. These results are intended to focus academia on the development of plausible knowledge-based solutions for concrete industrial problems, and therefore, facilitate the uptake of Semantic Web technology within industry.

AB Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs) are documents rich in research information that provide many benefits to students and future generations of scholars in various disciplines. Therefore, research is taking place to extract data from ETDs and make them more accessible. However, much of the related research involved ETDs in the English language, while Arabic ETDs remain an untapped source of data, although the number of Arabic ETDs available digitally is growing. Therefore, the need to make them more browsable and accessible increases. Some ways to achieve this need include data annotation, indexing, translation, and classification. As the size of the data increases, manual subject classification becomes less feasible. Accordingly, automatic subject classification becomes essential for the searchability and management of data. There are two main roadblocks to performing automatic subject classification of Arabic ETDs. The first is the lack of a large public corpus of Arabic ETDs for training purposes, while the second is the Arabic language's linguistic complexity, especially in academic documents. This research aims to collect key metadata of Arabic ETDs, and apply different automatic subject classification methodologies. The first goal is aided by scraping data from the AskZad Digital Library. The second goal is achieved by exploring different machine learning and deep learning techniques. The experiments' results show that deep learning using pretrained language models yielded the highest accuracy of approximately 0.83, while classical machine learning techniques yielded approximately 0.41 and 0.70 for multiclass classification one-vs-all classification respectively. This indicates that using pretrained language models assists in understanding languages which is essential for the classification of text.

TI Artificial intelligence and anesthesia: A narrative review
SO SAUDI JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA
AB Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have led to diagnostic, therapeutic, and intervention-based applications in the field of medicine. Today, there is a deep chasm between AI-based research articles and their translation to clinical anesthesia, which needs to be addressed. Machine learning (ML), the most widely applied arm of AI in medicine, confers the ability to analyze large volumes of data, find associations, and predict outcomes with ongoing learning by the computer. It involves algorithm creation, testing and analyses with the ability to perform cognitive functions including association between variables, pattern recognition, and prediction of outcomes. AI-supported closed loops have been designed for pharmacological maintenance of anesthesia and hemodynamic management. Mechanical robots can perform dexterity and skill-based tasks such as intubation and regional blocks with precision, whereas clinical-decision support systems in crisis situations may augment the role of the clinician. The possibilities are boundless, yet widespread adoption of AI is still far from the ground reality. Patient-related "Big Data" collection, validation, transfer, and testing are under ethical scrutiny. For this narrative review, we conducted a PubMed search in 2020-21 and retrieved articles related to AI and anesthesia. After careful consideration of the content, we prepared the review to highlight the growing importance of AI in anesthesia. Awareness and understanding of the basics of AI are the first steps to be undertaken by clinicians. In this narrative review, we have discussed salient features of ongoing AI research related to anesthesia and perioperative care.

TI A Wireless Brain-Machine Interface for Real-Time Speech Synthesis
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background: Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) involving electrodes implanted into the human cerebral cortex have recently been developed in an attempt to restore function to profoundly paralyzed individuals. Current BMIs for restoring communication can provide important capabilities via a typing process, but unfortunately they are only capable of slow communication rates. In the current study we use a novel approach to speech restoration in which we decode continuous auditory parameters for a real-time speech synthesizer from neuronal activity in motor cortex during attempted speech.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Neural signals recorded by a Neurotrophic Electrode implanted in a speech-related region of the left precentral gyrus of a human volunteer suffering from locked-in syndrome, characterized by near-total paralysis with spared cognition, were transmitted wirelessly across the scalp and used to drive a speech synthesizer. A Kalman filter-based decoder translated the neural signals generated during attempted speech into continuous parameters for controlling a synthesizer that provided immediate (within 50 ms) auditory feedback of the decoded sound. Accuracy of the volunteer's vowel productions with the synthesizer improved quickly with practice, with a 25% improvement in average hit rate (from 45% to 70%) and 46% decrease in average endpoint error from the first to the last block of a three-vowel task.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results support the feasibility of neural prostheses that may have the potential to provide near-conversational synthetic speech output for individuals with severely impaired speech motor control. They also provide an initial glimpse into the functional properties of neurons in speech motor cortical areas.

TI DIGITAL DOPING FOR HISTORIANS: CAN HISTORY, MEMORY, AND HISTORICAL
   THEORY BE RENDERED ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT?
SO HISTORY AND THEORY
AB Artificial intelligence is making history, literally. Machine learning tools are playing a key role in crafting images and stories about the past in popular culture. AI has probably also already invaded the history classroom. Large language models such as GPT-3 are able to generate compelling, non-plagiarized texts in response to simple natural language inputs, thus providing students with an opportunity to produce high-quality written assignments with minimum effort. In a similar vein, tools like GPT-3 are likely to revolutionize historical studies, enabling historians and other professionals who deal in texts to rely on AI-generated intermediate work products, such as accurate translations, summaries, and chronologies. But present-day large language models fail at key tasks that historians hold in high regard. They are structurally incapable of telling the truth and tracking pieces of information through layers of texts. What's more, they lack ethical self-reflexivity. Therefore, for the time being, the writing of academic history will require human agency. But for historical theorists, large language models might offer an opportunity to test basic hypotheses about the nature of historical writing. Historical theorists can, for instance, have customized large language models write a series of descriptive, narrative, and assertive histories about the same events, thereby enabling them to explore the precise relation between description, narration, and argumentation in historical writing. In short, with specifically designed large language models, historical theorists can run the kinds of large-scale writing experiments that they could never put into practice with real historians.

TI Dropped personal pronoun recovery in Chinese SMS*
SO NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING
AB In written Chinese, personal pronouns are commonly dropped when they can be inferred from context. This practice is particularly common in informal genres like Short Message Service messages sent via cell phones. Restoring dropped personal pronouns can be a useful preprocessing step for information extraction. Dropped personal pronoun recovery can be divided into two subtasks: (1) detecting dropped personal pronoun slots and (2) determining the identity of the pronoun for each slot. We address a simpler version of restoring dropped personal pronouns wherein only the person numbers are identified. After applying a word segmenter, we used a linear-chain conditional random field to predict which words were at the start of an independent clause. Then, using the independent clause start information, as well as lexical and syntactic information, we applied a conditional random field or a maximum-entropy classifier to predict whether a dropped personal pronoun immediately preceded each word and, if so, the person number of the dropped pronoun. We conducted a series of experiments using a manually annotated corpus of Chinese Short Message Service. Our approaches substantially outperformed a rule-based approach based partially on rules developed by Chung and Gildea (2010, Effects of Empty Categories on Machine Translation. Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP). Association for Computational Linguistics. pp. 636-45). Our approaches also outperformed (though by a considerably smaller margin) a machine-learning approach based closely on work by Yang, Liu, and Xue in (2015, Recovering Dropped Pronouns from Chinese Text Messages. Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL). Association for Computational Linguistics. pp. 309-13). Features derived from parsing largely did not help our approaches. We conclude that, given independent clause start information, the parse information we used was largely superfluous for identifying dropped personal pronouns.

AB Large computations, when amenable to distributed parallel execution, are often executed on computer clusters, for scalability and cost reasons. Such computations are used in many applications, including, to name but a few, machine learning, webgraph mining, and statistical machine translation. Oftentimes, though, the input data is private and only the result of the computation can be published. Zero-knowledge proofs would allow, in such settings, to verify correctness of the output without leaking (additional) information about the input.
   In this work, we investigate theoretical and practical aspects of zero-knowledge proofs for cluster computations. We design, build, and evaluate zero-knowledge proof systems for which: (i) a proof attests to the correct execution of a cluster computation; and (ii) generating the proof is itself a cluster computation that is similar in structure and complexity to the original one. Concretely, we focus on MapReduce, an elegant and popular form of cluster computing.
   Previous zero-knowledge proof systems can in principle prove a MapReduce computation's correctness, via a monolithic NP statement that reasons about all mappers, all reducers, and shuffling. However, it is not clear how to generate the proof for such monolithic statements via parallel execution by a distributed system. Our work demonstrates, by theory and implementation, that proof generation can be similar in structure and complexity to the original cluster computation.
   Our main technique is a bootstrapping theorem for succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (SNARKs) that shows how, via recursive proof composition and Proof-Carrying Data, it is possible to transform any SNARK into a distributed SNARK for MapReduce which proves, piece-wise and in a distributed way, the correctness of every step in the original MapReduce computation as well as their global consistency.

TI Generalizable fully automated multi-label segmentation of four-chamber
   view echocardiograms based on deep convolutional adversarial networks
SO JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE
AB A major issue in translation of the artificial intelligence platforms for automatic segmentation of echocardiograms to clinics is their generalizability. The present study introduces and verifies a novel generalizable and efficient fully automatic multi-label segmentation method for four-chamber view echocardiograms based on deep fully convolutional networks (FCNs) and adversarial training. For the first time, we used generative adversarial networks for pixel classification training, a novel method in machine learning not currently used for cardiac imaging, to overcome the generalization problem. The method's performance was validated against manual segmentations as the ground-truth. Furthermore, to verify our method's generalizability in comparison with other existing techniques, we compared our method's performance with a state-of-the-art method on our dataset in addition to an independent dataset of 450 patients from the CAMUS (cardiac acquisitions for multi-structure ultrasound segmentation) challenge. On our test dataset, automatic segmentation of all four chambers achieved a dice metric of 92.1%, 86.3%, 89.6% and 91.4% for LV, RV, LA and RA, respectively. LV volumes' correlation between automatic and manual segmentation were 0.94 and 0.93 for end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume, respectively. Excellent agreement with chambers' reference contours and significant improvement over previous FCN-based methods suggest that generative adversarial networks for pixel classification training can effectively design generalizable fully automatic FCN-based networks for four-chamber segmentation of echocardiograms even with limited number of training data.

TI DNA Origami Chromophore Scaffold Exploiting HomoFRET Energy Transport to
   Create Molecular Photonic Wires
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB DNA-scaffolded molecular photonic wires (MPWs) displaying prearranged donor-acceptor chromophore pairs that engage in extended Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) cascades represent an emerging nanoscale photonic material with numerous potential applications in data storage, encryption, and communications. For translation to such applications, these devices must first demonstrate robust performance with high transfer efficiencies over extended distances. Here, we report the optimization of FRET in a 6-helix DNA origami architecture supporting a 14-dye site system that contains a central 10-dye homogeneous FRET (HomoFRET) relay span and overall extends over 29 nm in length. Varying the dye density by controlling their presence or absence across all of the individually addressable sites presented an incredibly large optimization space (1024 HomoFRET and 16 384 total permutations). High-throughput experiments, with over 500 measurements of DNA templates assembled in parallel, allowed for the study of HomoFRET transfer as a function of fluorophore density and arrangement. Transfer within solution-phase MPWs initially obtained with steady-state spectroscopy experiments revealed values only reaching -1% efficiency. Extensive photophysical characterization, utilizing six different spectroscopic techniques and 11 total methodologies, determined that the diminished FRET efficiency of each individual component step is the principal cause of the limited transfer in solution. Monte Carlo and machine-learning methods provided additional insights into design optimization. A representative MPW set selected based on the previous findings was subsequently characterized in film deposition and also under cryogenic conditions. Under these improved conditions, selected MPWs demonstrated 59 +/- 6% energy transport efficiency over a length of 29 nm; this is similar to 25% longer and 10-fold more efficient than the previously reported optimized DNA MPWs.

AB Many people around the world are suffering from vocal and hearing disabilities and they communicate with others by actions rather than speech. They prefer sign language (hand gestures) to convey what revolves in their mind. Every language has some set of rules of grammar to express information in meaningful way but not everyone can recognize what is being conveyed through sign language. Thus the automatic translation of a sign language serves as basic need for overcoming many difficulties and providing convenience for impaired people in the developing era of technology. For many years, a lot of researchers have been working on developing the better algorithm for sign language communication using machine learning and computer vision techniques that passes through many stages such as pre-processing, segmentation, extraction of features and classification. But the efficient features can produce more effective and accurate results. This paper aims at comparing performance of different classifiers to deep convolutional neural network (CNN) on sign language dataset providing with and without local feature descriptor and bag of visual words. This is defmitely a classification task for which CNN, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are being widely considered. CNN is capable of extracting and representing high-level abstractions in the dataset that results good accuracy but some traditional classifiers are also capable for that when providing with good features. We evaluate the performance of MLP and SVM without and with Speed up Robust Features (SURF) on the same data given to CNN. Results are also discussed in this paper that shows MLP and SVM employing descriptor gives high accuracy than CNN.

AB At eBay, sellers can offer virtually any type of listing, rendering the world's largest inventory, with well over a billion items. Yet, the noisy nature of the input data and the extremely long-tailed item distribution pose a variety of challenges for search and recommendation, such as understanding the unique attributes (aspects) of the products, their importance to both sellers and buyers, and their intra-relationships, all essential to providing a high-quality user experience on the site.
   In this talk, I will present several challenges and corresponding solution frameworks recently developed at eBay Research for aspect extraction, normalization, weighting, and relation inference; the mapping of relationships between e-commerce entities for matching uploaded listings to catalog products and feeding the e-commerce knowledge graph; the recommendation of categories for sellers' contributions; and the automatic generation of textual fields (title, description) to bridge the gap between sellers and buyers by helping them speak the same language. Our methods combine a variety of language processing and computer vision approaches applied on the different types of data contributed by sellers. Learning to rank, named entity recognition, object identification, machine translation, and summarization are just a few example techniques that come to play. Our methods drive different usage scenarios by enabling a better representation of users and items and an effective computation of their similarities. I will also describe how our applied research teams perform their work, from the development of initial prototypes, through offline and online production processes, to different evaluation schemes. I will conclude the talk by reviewing open challenges in large-scale e-commerce that will have to be addressed in the years to come.

TI Automatic Quantitative Analysis of Human Respired Carbon Dioxide
   Waveform for Asthma and Non-Asthma Classification Using Support Vector
   Machine
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Currently, carbon dioxide (CO2) waveforms measured by capnography are used to estimate respiratory rate and end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) in the clinic. However, the shape of the CO2 signal carries significant diagnostic information about the asthmatic condition. Previous studies have shown a strong correlation between various features that quantitatively characterize the shape of CO2 signal and are used to discriminate asthma from non-asthma using pulmonary function tests, but no reliable progress was made, and no translation into clinical practice has been achieved. Therefore, this paper reports a relatively simple signal processing algorithm for automatic differentiation of asthma and non-asthma. CO2 signals were recorded from 30 non-asthmatic and 43 asthmatic patients. Each breath cycle was decomposed into subcycles, and features were computationally extracted. Thereafter, feature selection was performed using the area (A(z)) under the receiver operating characteristics curve analysis. A classification was performed via a leave-oneout cross-validation procedure by employing a support vector machine. Our results show maximum screening capabilities for upward expiration (AR(1)), downward inspiration (AR(2)), and the sum of AR(1) and AR(2), with an A(2) of 0.892, 0.803, and 0.793, respectively. The proposed method obtained an average accuracy of 94.52%, sensitivity of 97.67%, and specificity of 90% for discrimination of asthma and non-asthma. The proposed method allows for automatic classification of asthma and non-asthma condition by analyzing the shape of the CO2 waveform. The developed method may possibly be incorporated in real-time for assessment and management of the asthmatic conditions.

AB Brain-machine interfaces (BMI) are tools for measuring neural activity in the brain, used to treat numerous conditions. It is essential that the next generation of intracortical BMIs is wireless so as to remove percutaneous connections, i.e. wires, and the associated mechanical and infection risks. This is required for the effective translation of BMIs into clinical applications and is one of the remaining bottlenecks. However, due to cortical tissue thermal dissipation safety limits, the on-implant power consumption must be strictly limited. Therefore, both the neural signal processing and wireless communication power should be minimal, while the implants should provide signals that offer high behavioural decoding performance (BDP). The Multi-Unit Activity (MUA) signal is the most common signal in modern BMIs. However, with an ever-increasing channel count, the raw data bandwidth is becoming prohibitively high due to the associated communication power exceeding the safety limits. Data compression is therefore required. To meet this need, this work developed hardware-efficient static Huffman compression schemes for MUA data. Our final system reduced the bandwidth to 27 bps/channel, compared to the standard MUA rate of 1 kbps/channel. This compression is over an order of magnitude more than has been achieved before, while using only 0.96 uW/channel processing power and 246 logic cells. Our results were verified on 3 datasets and less than 1% loss in BDP was observed. As such, with the use of effective data compression, an order more of MUA channels can be fitted on-implant, enabling the next generation of high-performance wireless intracortical BMIs.

TI Ethical layering in AI-driven polygenic risk scores-New complexities,
   new challenges
SO FRONTIERS IN GENETICS
AB Researchers aim to develop polygenic risk scores as a tool to prevent and more effectively treat serious diseases, disorders and conditions such as breast cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease. Recently, machine learning techniques, in particular deep neural networks, have been increasingly developed to create polygenic risk scores using electronic health records as well as genomic and other health data. While the use of artificial intelligence for polygenic risk scores may enable greater accuracy, performance and prediction, it also presents a range of increasingly complex ethical challenges. The ethical and social issues of many polygenic risk score applications in medicine have been widely discussed. However, in the literature and in practice, the ethical implications of their confluence with the use of artificial intelligence have not yet been sufficiently considered. Based on a comprehensive review of the existing literature, we argue that this stands in need of urgent consideration for research and subsequent translation into the clinical setting. Considering the many ethical layers involved, we will first give a brief overview of the development of artificial intelligence-driven polygenic risk scores, associated ethical and social implications, challenges in artificial intelligence ethics, and finally, explore potential complexities of polygenic risk scores driven by artificial intelligence. We point out emerging complexity regarding fairness, challenges in building trust, explaining and understanding artificial intelligence and polygenic risk scores as well as regulatory uncertainties and further challenges. We strongly advocate taking a proactive approach to embedding ethics in research and implementation processes for polygenic risk scores driven by artificial intelligence.

AB The prediction of brain metastasis (BM) response to stereotactic radiosurgery could assist clinicians when choosing BM treatments. This study investigates the prediction of in-field progression, out-of-field progression, and 1-year overall survival (OS) endpoints using a machine learning classifier. It also investigates the effect of feature type and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner variability on classifier performance. The study data set consisted of n = 110 BMs across 91 patients for which endpoints, seven clinical features, and MRI scans were available. 635 radiomic features were extracted from the MRI for the BM region-of-interest (ROI) and a 5mm BM ROI dilation. A 1000-iteration bootstrap experimental design was used with a random forest classifier to provide area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) estimates. This experimental design was used for multiple endpoints, groups of features, and data partitioning by scanner model. In-field progression, out-of-field progression, and 1-year OS were predicted with respective AUC estimates of 0.70, 0.57 and 0.66. For all endpoints, clinical and/or radiomic features from the BM ROI provided optimal performance. MR scanner variability was found to decrease classifier AUC in general, though pre-processing methods were found to counteract this effect for some scanner models. This study shows that in-field progression, out-of-field progression, and 1-year OS can all be predicted to some degree, with in-field progression being predicted most accurately. The effects of scanner variability indicate that more diverse data sets and robust methods to account for scanner variability are required before clinical translation.

TI COVID term: a bilingual terminology for COVID-19
SO BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING
AB Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has shown its destructiveness with more than one million confirmed cases and dozens of thousands of death, which is highly contagious and still spreading globally. World-wide studies have been conducted aiming to understand the COVID-19 mechanism, transmission, clinical features, etc. A cross-language terminology of COVID-19 is essential for improving knowledge sharing and scientific discovery dissemination.
   Methods: We developed a bilingual terminology of COVID-19 named COVID Term with mapping Chinese and English terms. The terminology was constructed as follows: (1) Classification schema design; (2) Concept representation model building; (3) Term source selection and term extraction; (4) Hierarchical structure construction; (5) Quality control (6) Web service. We built open access for the terminology, providing search, browse, and download services.
   Results: The proposed COVID Term include 10 categories: disease, anatomic site, clinical manifestation, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, living organism, qualifiers, psychological assistance, medical equipment, instruments and materials, epidemic prevention and control, diagnosis and treatment technique respectively. In total, COVID Terms covered 464 concepts with 724 Chinese terms and 887 English terms. All terms are openly available online (COVID Term URL: http://covidterm.imicams.ac.cn).
   Conclusions: COVID Term is a bilingual terminology focused on COVID-19, the epidemic pneumonia with a high risk of infection around the world. It will provide updated bilingual terms of the disease to help health providers and medical professionals retrieve and exchange information and knowledge in multiple languages. COVID Term was released in machine-readable formats (e.g., XML and JSON), which would contribute to the information retrieval, machine translation and advanced intelligent techniques application.

TI Eliciting Attribute-Level User Needs From Online Reviews With Deep
   Language Models and Information Extraction
SO JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN
AB Eliciting user needs for individual components and features of a product or a service on a large scale is a key requirement for innovative design. Synthesizing data as an initial discovery phase of a design process is usually accomplished with a small number of participants, employing qualitative research methods such as observations, focus groups, and interviews. This leaves an entire swath of pertinent user behavior, preferences, and opinions not captured. Sentiment analysis is a key enabler for large-scale need finding from online user reviews generated on a regular basis. A major limitation of current sentiment analysis approaches used in design sciences, however, is the need for laborious labeling and annotation of large review datasets for training, which in turn hinders their scalability and transferability across different domains. This article proposes an efficient and scalable methodology for automated and large-scale elicitation of attribute-level user needs. The methodology builds on the state-of-the-art pretrained deep language model, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), with new convolutional net and named entity recognition (NER) layers for extracting attribute, description, and sentiment words from online user review corpora. The machine translation algorithm BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy) is utilized to extract need expressions in the form of predefined part-of-speech combinations (e.g., adjective-noun, verb-noun). Numerical experiments are conducted on a large dataset scraped from a major e-commerce retail store for apparel and footwear to demonstrate the performance, feasibility, and potentials of the developed methodology.

TI Review on Generative Adversarial Networks: Focusing on Computer Vision
   and Its Applications
SO ELECTRONICS
AB The emergence of deep learning model GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) is an important turning point in generative modeling. GAN is more powerful in feature and expression learning compared to machine learning-based generative model algorithms. Nowadays, it is also used to generate non-image data, such as voice and natural language. Typical technologies include BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), GPT-3 (Generative Pretrained Transformer-3), and MuseNet. GAN differs from the machine learning-based generative model and the objective function. Training is conducted by two networks: generator and discriminator. The generator converts random noise into a true-to-life image, whereas the discriminator distinguishes whether the input image is real or synthetic. As the training continues, the generator learns more sophisticated synthesis techniques, and the discriminator grows into a more accurate differentiator. GAN has problems, such as mode collapse, training instability, and lack of evaluation matrix, and many researchers have tried to solve these problems. For example, solutions such as one-sided label smoothing, instance normalization, and minibatch discrimination have been proposed. The field of application has also expanded. This paper provides an overview of GAN and application solutions for computer vision and artificial intelligence healthcare field researchers. The structure and principle of operation of GAN, the core models of GAN proposed to date, and the theory of GAN were analyzed. Application examples of GAN such as image classification and regression, image synthesis and inpainting, image-to-image translation, super-resolution and point registration were then presented. The discussion tackled GAN's problems and solutions, and the future research direction was finally proposed.

TI Surgical spectral imaging
SO MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS
AB Recent technological developments have resulted in the availability of miniaturised spectral imaging sensors capable of operating in the multi- (MSI) and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) regimes. Simultaneous advances in image-processing techniques and artificial intelligence (AI), especially in machine learning and deep learning, have made these data-rich modalities highly attractive as a means of extracting biological information non-destructively. Surgery in particular is poised to benefit from this, as spectrally-resolved tissue optical properties can offer enhanced contrast as well as diagnostic and guidance information during interventions. This is particularly relevant for procedures where inherent contrast is low under standard white light visualisation. This review summarises recent work in surgical spectral imaging (SSI) techniques, taken from Pubmed, Google Scholar and arXiv searches spanning the period 2013-2019. New hardware, optimised for use in both open and minimally-invasive surgery (MIS), is described, and recent commercial activity is summarised. Computational approaches to extract spectral information from conventional colour images are reviewed, as tip-mounted cameras become more commonplace in MIS. Model-based and machine learning methods of data analysis are discussed in addition to simulation, phantom and clinical validation experiments. A wide variety of surgical pilot studies are reported but it is apparent that further work is needed to quantify the clinical value of MSI/HSI. The current trend toward data-driven analysis emphasises the importance of widely-available, standardised spectral imaging datasets, which will aid understanding of variability across organs and patients, and drive clinical translation.

TI Robust Real-Time Musculoskeletal Modeling Driven by Electromyograms
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Objective: Current clinical biomechanics involves lengthy data acquisition and time-consuming offline analyses with biomechanical models not operating in real-time for man-machine interfacing. We developed a method that enables online analysis of neuromusculoskeletal function in vivo in the intact human. Methods: We used electromyography (EMG)-driven musculoskeletal modeling to simulate all transformations from muscle excitation onset (EMGs) to mechanical moment production around multiple lower-limb degrees of freedom (DOFs). We developed a calibration algorithm that enables adjusting musculoskeletal model parameters specifically to an individual's anthropometry and force-generating capacity. We incorporated the modeling paradigm into a computationally efficient, generic framework that can be interfaced in real-time with any movement data collection system. Results: The framework demonstrated the ability of computing forces in 13 lower-limb muscle-tendon units and resulting moments about three joint DOFs simultaneously in real-time. Remarkably, it was capable of extrapolating beyond calibration conditions, i.e., predicting accurate joint moments during six unseen tasks and one unseen DOF. Conclusion: The proposed framework can dramatically reduce evaluation latency in current clinical biomechanics and open up new avenues for establishing prompt and personalized treatments, as well as for establishing natural interfaces between patients and rehabilitation systems. Significance: The integration of EMG with numerical modeling will enable simulating realistic neuromuscular strategies in conditions including muscular/orthopedic deficit, which could not be robustly simulated via pure modeling formulations. This will enable translation to clinical settings and development of healthcare technologies including real-time bio-feedback of internal mechanical forces and direct patient-machine interfacing.

TI Depression recognition using a proposed speech chain model fusing speech
   production and perception features
SO JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
AB Background: Increasing depression patients puts great pressure on clinical diagnosis. Audio-based diagnosis is a helpful auxiliary tool for early mass screening. However, current methods consider only speech perception features, ignoring patients' vocal tract changes, which may partly result in the poor recognition.
   Methods: This work proposes a novel machine speech chain model for depression recognition (MSCDR) that can capture text-independent depressive speech representation from the speaker's mouth to the listener's ear to improve recognition performance. In the proposed MSCDR, linear predictive coding (LPC) and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) features are extracted to describe the processes of speech generation and of speech perception, respectively. Then, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory network sequentially capture intra- and inter-segment dynamic depressive features for classification.
   Results: We tested the MSCDR on two public datasets with different languages and paradigms, namely, the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus-Wizard of Oz and the Multi-modal Open Dataset for Mental-disorder Analysis. The accuracy of the MSCDR on the two datasets was 0.77 and 0.86, and the average F1 score was 0.75 and 0.86, which were better than the other existing methods. This improvement reveals the complementarity of speech production and perception features in carrying depressive information.
   Limitations: The sample size was relatively small, which may limit the application in clinical translation to some extent.
   Conclusion: This experiment proves the good generalization ability and superiority of the proposed MSCDR and suggests that the vocal tract changes in patients with depression deserve attention for audio-based depression diagnosis.

TI Personalized Prediction of Response to Smartphone-Delivered Meditation
   Training: Randomized Controlled Trial
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB Background: Meditation apps have surged in popularity in recent years, with an increasing number of individuals turning to these apps to cope with stress, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. Meditation apps are the most commonly used mental health apps for depression and anxiety. However, little is known about who is well suited to these apps.
   Objective: This study aimed to develop and test a data-driven algorithm to predict which individuals are most likely to benefit from app-based meditation training.
   Methods: Using randomized controlled trial data comparing a 4-week meditation app (Healthy Minds Program [HMP]) with an assessment-only control condition in school system employees (n=662), we developed an algorithm to predict who is most likely to benefit from HMP. Baseline clinical and demographic characteristics were submitted to a machine learning model to develop a "Personalized Advantage Index" (PAI) reflecting an individual's expected reduction in distress (primary outcome) from HMP versus control.
   Results: A significant group x PAI interaction emerged (t658=3.30; P=.001), indicating that PAI scores moderated group differences in outcomes. A regression model that included repetitive negative thinking as the sole baseline predictor performed comparably well. Finally, we demonstrate the translation of a predictive model into personalized recommendations of expected benefit.
   Conclusions: Overall, the results revealed the potential of a data-driven algorithm to inform which individuals are most likely to benefit from a meditation app. Such an algorithm could be used to objectively communicate expected benefits to individuals, allowing them to make more informed decisions about whether a meditation app is appropriate for them.

TI Inclusion of Clinicians in the Development and Evaluation of Clinical
   Artificial Intelligence Tools: A Literature Review
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB The application of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare domains has received much attention in recent years, yet significant questions remain about how these new tools integrate into frontline user workflow, and how their design will impact implementation. Lack of acceptance among clinicians is a major barrier to the translation of healthcare innovations into clinical practice. In this systematic review, we examine when and how clinicians are consulted about their needs and desires for clinical AI tools. Forty-five articles met criteria for inclusion, of which 24 were considered design studies. The design studies used a variety of methods to solicit and gather user feedback, with interviews, surveys, and user evaluations. Our findings show that tool designers consult clinicians at various but inconsistent points during the design process, and most typically at later stages in the design cycle (82%, 19/24 design studies). We also observed a smaller amount of studies adopting a human-centered approach and where clinician input was solicited throughout the design process (22%, 5/24). A third (15/45) of all studies reported on clinician trust in clinical AI algorithms and tools. The surveyed articles did not universally report validation against the "gold standard " of clinical expertise or provide detailed descriptions of the algorithms or computational methods used in their work. To realize the full potential of AI tools within healthcare settings, our review suggests there are opportunities to more thoroughly integrate frontline users' needs and feedback in the design process.

TI Dynamic functional connectome predicts individual working memory
   performance across diagnostic categories
SO NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL
AB Working memory impairment is a common feature of psychiatric disorders. Although its neural mechanisms have been extensively examined in healthy subjects or individuals with a certain clinical condition, studies investigating neural predictors of working memory in a transdiagnostic sample are scarce. The objective of this study was to create a transdiagnostic predictive working memory model from whole-brain functional connectivity using connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM), a recently developed machine learning approach. Restingstate functional MRI data from 242 subjects across 4 diagnostic categories (healthy controls and individuals with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and attention deficit/hyperactivity) were used to construct dynamic and static functional connectomes. Spatial working memory was assessed by the spatial capacity task. CPM was conducted to predict individual working memory from dynamic and static functional connectivity patterns. Results showed that dynamic connectivity-based CPM models successfully predicted overall working memory capacity and accuracy as well as mean reaction time, yet their static counterparts fell short in the prediction. At the neural level, we found that dynamic connectivity of the frontoparietal and somato-motor networks were negatively correlated with working memory capacity and accuracy, and those of the default mode and visual networks were positively associated with mean reaction time. Moreover, different feature selection thresholds, parcellation strategies and model validation methods as well as diagnostic categories did not significantly influence the prediction results. Our findings not only are coherent with prior reports that dynamic functional connectivity encodes more behavioral information than static connectivity, but also help advance the translation of cognitive "connectome fingerprinting" into real-world application.

TI Audio Example Recognition and Retrieval Based on Geometric Incremental
   Learning Support Vector Machine System
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB With the fast development of computer and information technology, multimedia data has become the most important form of information media. Auditory information plays an important role in information location, this comes from the fact that it can be difficult to find useful information. Thus audio classification becomes more important in audio analysis as it prepares for content-based audio retrieval. There is quite a bit of research on the topic of audio classification methods, audio feature analysis, and extraction based on audio classification. Many works of literature extract features of audio signals based on time or Fourier transform frequency domain. The emergence of the wavelet theory provides a time-frequency analysis tool for signal analysis. Wavelet transformation is a local transformation of the signal in time and frequency which can effectively extract information from the signal, and perform multi-scale refinement analysis on functions or signals through operations such as stretching and translation instead of the traditional Fourier transformation. In the time-frequency analysis of the signal, the wavelet analysis captures the local time and frequency characters of the signal which can improve the ability of signal analysis. It can also change certain locals of the signal without affecting other aspects of it. In this paper, the frequency domain features are combined with the wavelet domain features. At the same time that the MFCC features are extracted, the discrete wavelet transform is used to extract the features of the wavelet domain. Then the statistical features are extracted for each audio example, and the SVM model is used to realize the different forms of audio classification identification.

TI A Ranking-Based Scoring Function for Peptide-Spectrum Matches
SO JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH
AB The analysis of the large volume of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) proteomics data that is generated these days relies on automated algorithms that identify peptides from their mass spectra. An essential component of these algorithms is the scoring function used to evaluate the quality of peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs). In this paper, we present new approach to scoring of PSMs. We argue that since this problem is at its core a ranking task (especially in the case of de novo sequencing), it can be solved effectively using machine learning ranking algorithms. We developed a new discriminative boosting-based approach to scoring. Our scoring models draw upon a large set of diverse feature functions that measure different qualities of PSMs. Our method improves the performance of our de novo sequencing algorithm beyond the current state-of-the-art, and also greatly enhances the performance of database search programs. Furthermore, by increasing the efficiency of tag filtration and improving the sensitivity of PSM scoring, we make it practical to perform large-scale MS/MS analysis, such as proteogenomic search of a six-frame translation of the human genome (in which we achieve a reduction of the running time by a factor of 15 and a 60% increase in the number of identified peptides, compared to the InsPecT database search tool). Our scoring function is incorporated into PepNovo+ which is available for download or can be run online at http://bix.ucsd.edu.

TI Power in Numbers: Harnessing Combinatorial and Integrated Screens to
   Advance Nanomedicine
SO JACS AU
AB Nanocarriers have significant potential to advance personalized medicine through targeted drug delivery. However, to date, efforts to improve nanoparticle accumulation at target disease sites have largely failed to translate clinically, stemming from an incomplete understanding of nano-bio interactions. While progress has been made to evaluate the effects of specific physical and chemical nanoparticle properties on trafficking and uptake, there is much to be gained from controlling these properties singularly and in combination to determine their interactions with different cell types. We and others have recently begun leveraging library-based nanoparticle screens to study structure-function relationships of lipid- and polymer-based drug delivery systems to guide nanoparticle design. These combinatorial screening efforts are showing promise in leading to the successful identification of critical characteristics that yield improved and specific accumulation at target sites. However, there is a crucial need to equally consider the influence of biological complexity on nanoparticle delivery, particularly in the context of clinical translation. For example, tissue and cellular heterogeneity presents an additional dimension to nanoparticle trafficking, uptake, and accumulation; applying imaging and screening tools as well as bioinformatics may further expand our understanding of how nanoparticles engage with cells and tissues. Given recent advances in the fields of omics and machine learning, there is substantial promise to revolutionize nanocarrier development through the use of integrated screens, harnessing the combinatorial parameter space afforded both by nanoparticle libraries and clinically annotated biological data sets in combination with high throughput in vivo studies.

AB Swinging types (STs) provide a specification and verification formalism for designing software in terms of many-sorted logic. Current formalisms, be they set- or order-theoretic, algebraic or coalgebraic, rule-or net-based, handle either static system components (in terms of functions or relations) or dynamic ones (in terms of transition systems) and either structural or behavioral aspects, while STs combine equational, Horn and modal logic for the purpose of applying computation and proof rules from all three logics.
   UML provides a collection of object-oriented pictorial specification techniques, equipped with an informal semantics, but hardly cares about consistency, i.e. the guarantee that a specification has models and thus can be implemented. To achieve this goal and to make verification possible a formal semantics is indispensable. Swinging types have term models that are directly derived from the specifications. The paper takes first steps towards a translation of class diagrams, OCL constraints and state machines into STs. Partly, we proceed along examples, partly we describe generally how, e.g., classes can be turned into signatures.
   Swinging types are particularly suitable for interpreting UML models because they integrate static and dynamic components. UML treats them separately, STs handle them within the same formalism. Hence, one may check, for instance, whether static operations are correctly refined to local message passing primitives.
   A crucial point of a formal semantics of UML models is a reasonable notion of state. If constraints involve static data as well as states and state transitions, the modal-logic view on states as (implicit) predicates is less adequate than the ST representation as terms denoting tuples of attribute values, "histories" of object manipulations or compositions of substates (composite states).

SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
AB The article analyzes the problems of using artificial intelligence (AI) in the administration of justice in the Russian Federation and in foreign countries. The article examines the current problems of judicial proceedings due to the introduction of digital technology in judicial practice. The processes of digitalization affecting the language of court proceedings are investigated. The aim of this study is to analyze the peculiarities of communication between artificial intelligence and human beings in the assignment of certain judicial functions to AI. Analysis and synthesis, the comparative-legal method, as well as methods of forecasting and semantic studies were used as research methods. The analysis shows that AI allows releasing the judge from performing monotonous activities (information-documentary, expert-analytical, linguistic-translation work) and organizational support of legal proceedings, taking into account that semantic search will give the judge an opportunity to formulate inquiries to the machine in natural language, and the machine is designed to respond in natural language too, without reducing relevance of information. The foreign practice of using AI in court proceedings is analyzed. The results obtained indicate that the use of AI systems in court proceedings as an additional means of assistance and control along with increasing the efficiency of judicial reforms contributes to the prevention of judicial errors, identification of existing problems and risks. The importance of creating a mechanism to control judicial discretion through the potential of AI is emphasized. It is assumed that the development of the problem under study requires not only normative regulation, but also the use of AI as a tool to correlate the law with unambiguously interpreted logical rules.

TI Application of Artificial Intelligence Methods to Pharmacy Data for
   Cancer Surveillance and Epidemiology Research: A Systematic Review
SO JCO CLINICAL CANCER INFORMATICS
AB PURPOSE The implementation and utilization of electronic health records is generating a large volume and variety of data, which are difficult to process using traditional techniques. However, these data could help answer important questions in cancer surveillance and epidemiology research. Artificial intelligence (AI) data processing methods are capable of evaluating large volumes of data, yet current literature on their use in this context of pharmacy informatics is not well characterized.
   METHODS A systematic literature review was conducted to evaluate relevant publications within four domains (cancer, pharmacy, AI methods, population science) across PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library and included all publications indexed between July 17, 2008, and December 31, 2018. The search returned 3,271 publications, which were evaluated for inclusion.
   RESULTS There were 36 studies that met criteria for full-text abstraction. Of those, only 45% specifically identified the pharmacy data source, and 55% specified drug agents or drug classes. Multiple AI methods were used; 25% used machine learning (ML), 67% used natural language processing (NLP), and 8% combined ML and NLP.
   CONCLUSION This review demonstrates that the application of AI data methods for pharmacy informatics and cancer epidemiology research is expanding. However, the data sources and representations are often missing, challenging study replicability. In addition, there is no consistent format for reporting results, and one of the preferred metrics, F-score, is often missing. There is a resultant need for greater transparency of original data sources and performance of AI methods with pharmacy data to improve the translation of these results into meaningful outcomes.

TI Pred-BVP-Unb: Fast prediction of bacteriophage Virion proteins using
   un-biased multi-perspective properties with recursive feature
   elimination
SO GENOMICS
AB Bacteriophage virion proteins (BVPs) are bacterial viruses that have a great impact on different biological functions of bacteria. They are significantly used in genetic engineering and phage therapy applications. Correct identification of BVP through conventional pathogen methods are slow and expensive. Thus, designing a Bioinformatics predictor is urgently desirable to accelerate correct identification of BVPs within a huge volume of proteins. However, available prediction tools performance is inadequate due to the lack of useful feature representation and severe imbalance issue. In the present study, we propose an intelligent model, called PredBVP-Unb for discrimination of BVPs that employed three nominal sequences-driven descriptors, i.e. Bi-PSSM evolutionary information, composition & translation, and split amino acid composition. The imbalance phenomena between classes were coped with the help of a synthetic minority oversampling technique. The essential attributes are selected by a robust algorithm called recursive feature elimination. Finally, the optimal feature space is provided to support vector machine classifier using a radial base kernel in order to train the model. Our predictor remarkably outperforms than existing approaches in the literature by achieving the highest accuracy of 92.54% and 83.06% respectively on the benchmark and independent datasets. We expect that Pred-BVP-Unb tool can provide useful hints for designing antibacterial drugs and also helpful to expedite large scale discovery of new bacteriophage virion proteins. The source code and all datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/Muhammad-Arif-NUST/BVP_Pred_Unb.

AB For Line-Laser sensor products that CCD images are unknown, we present a method for the calibration of Line-Laser sensor measurement system using multi-directional and non-featured planes, and a method for system calibration optimization using multi-angle standard spheres. By building a mathematical model, we convert the line laser sensor measurement data into CMM measurement points. According to the constraint relationships of planes or spheres, the point measured by the Line-Laser sensor and the CMM should conform to the same equation, then we can solve the calibration matrix of the line laser sensor and the coordinate measuring machine by nonlinear optimization Both simulation analyses and real experiments were conducted. A line laser sensor was used to measure a frosted standard ball with a radius of 12.696 mm. The radius deviation measured by the line laser sensor system and the center deviation of the sphere comparing with the CMM were observed. The experimental results show that the radius deviation of the calibration laser sensor measurement system is less than 0.02mm, and the center distance deviation of the sphere is less than 0.02mm. This method utilizing non-featured planes simplifies the calibration equipment and can reduce the fitting error when using standard ball from multiple angles for calibration. This method is different from the method of calibrating the single direction of the laser sensor. It can simultaneously calibrate the rotation matrix and translation matrix of the two-dimensional line laser sensor to the coordinate measuring machine, and optimize the global optimal calibration parameters.

TI Using Artificial Intelligence to Manage Thrombosis Research, Diagnosis,
   and Clinical Management
SO SEMINARS IN THROMBOSIS AND HEMOSTASIS
AB Thrombosis development in either arterial or venous system remains a major cause of death and disability worldwide. This poorly controlled in vivo clotting could result in many severe complications including myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, stroke, and cerebral venous thrombosis, to name a few. These conditions are collectively known as thromboembolic disorders (TEDs). Appropriate understanding of TEDs is challenging, as they are multifactorial and involve several and often different risk factors. Hence, it requires a collective effort and data from numerous research studies to fully comprehend molecular mechanisms for prediction, prevention, treatment, and overall management of these conditions. To accomplish this arduous feat, a comprehensive approach is required that can compile thousands of available experimental data and transform these into more applicable and purposeful findings. Thus, large datasets could be utilized to generate models that could be predictive of how an individual would respond when subjected to any kind of additional risk factors or surgery, hospitalization, etc., or in the presence of some susceptible genetic variations. Artificial intelligence-based methods harness the capabilities of computer software to imitate human behaviors such as language translation, visual perception, and, most importantly, decision making. These emerging tools, if appropriately explored, might assist in processing of large data and tackle the complexities of identifying novel or interesting pathways that could otherwise be hidden due to their enormity. This narrative review attempts to compile the applications of various subfields of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the context of thrombosis research to date. It further reflects on the potential of artificial intelligence in transforming enormous research data into translational application in the form of predictive computational models.

TI From Circuit Complexity to Faster All-Pairs Shortest Paths
SO SIAM REVIEW
AB We present a randomized method for computing the min-plus product (a.k.a. tropical product) of two n x n matrices, yielding a faster algorithm for solving the all-pairs shortest path problem (APSP) in dense n-node directed graphs with arbitrary edge weights. In the real random-access machine model, where additions and comparisons of reals are unit cost (but all other operations have logarithmic cost), the algorithm runs in time n(3)/2(Omega)(log n)(1/2) and is correct with high probability. On the word random-access machine which permits constant-time operations on log(n)-bit words, the algorithm runs in n(3)/2(Omega)(log n)(1/2) + n(2+o(1)) log(nM) time on graphs with edge weights in ([0, M] boolean AND Z) boolean OR {infinity}. Prior algorithms needed either Theta (n(3)/log(c) n) time for various c <= 2, or Theta (M(alpha)n(beta)) time for various alpha > 0 and beta > 2. Our algorithm applies a tool from circuit complexity, namely, the Razborov-Smolensky polynomials for approximately representing AC(0)[p] circuits, to efficiently reduce a matrix product over the min-plus algebra to a relatively small number of rectangular matrix products over F-2. Each rectangular matrix product can be computed using a particularly efficient method due to Coppersmith. We also give a deterministic version of the algorithm running in n(3)/2(log delta) n time for some delta > 0, which utilizes the Yao-Beigel-Tarui translation of AC(0)[m] circuits into "nice" depth-two circuits

TI Artificial Intelligence, Speech, and Language Processing Approaches to
   Monitoring Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review
SO JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
AB Background: Language is a valuable source of clinical information in Alzheimer's disease, as it declines concurrently with neurodegeneration. Consequently, speech and language data have been extensively studied in connection with its diagnosis.
   Objective: Firstly, to summarize the existing findings on the use of artificial intelligence, speech, and language processing to predict cognitive decline in the context of Alzheimer's disease. Secondly, to detail current research procedures, highlight their limitations, and suggest strategies to address them.
   Methods: Systematic review of original research between 2000 and 2019, registered in PROSPERO (reference CRD42018116606). An interdisciplinary search covered six databases on engineering (ACM and IEEE), psychology (PsycINFO), medicine (PubMed and Embase), and Web of Science. Bibliographies of relevant papers were screened until December 2019.
   Results: From 3,654 search results, 51 articles were selected against the eligibility criteria. Four tables summarize their findings: study details (aim, population, interventions, comparisons, methods, and outcomes), data details (size, type, modalities, annotation, balance, availability, and language of study), methodology (pre-processing, feature generation, machine learning, evaluation, and results), and clinical applicability (research implications, clinical potential, risk of bias, and strengths/limitations).
   Conclusion: Promising results are reported across nearly all 51 studies, but very few have been implemented in clinical research or practice. The main limitations of the field are poor standardization, limited comparability of results, and a degree of disconnect between study aims and clinical applications. Active attempts to close these gaps will support translation of future research into clinical practice.

TI A Siamese Neural Network for Learning Semantically-Informed Sentence
   Embeddings
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB Semantic representation is a way of expressing the meaning of a text that can be processed by a machine to serve a particular natural language processing (NLP) task that usually requires meaning comprehension such as text summarisation, question answering or machine translation. In this paper, we present a semantic parsing model based on neural networks to obtain semantic representation of a given sentence. We utilise semantic representation of each sentence to generate semantically informed sentence embeddings for extrinsic evaluation of the proposed semantic parser, in particular for the semantic textual similarity task. Our neural parser utilises self-attention mechanism to learn semantic relations between words in a sentence to generate semantic representation of a sentence in UCCA (Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation) semantic annotation framework (Abend and Rappoport, 2013), which is a cross-linguistically applicable graph-based semantic representation. The UCCA representations are conveyed into a Siamese Neural Network built on top of two Recursive Neural Networks (Siamese-RvNN) to derive semantically informed sentence embeddings which are evaluated on semantic textual similarity task. We conduct both single-lingual and cross-lingual experiments with zero-shot and few-shot learning, which have shown superior performance even in low-resource scenario. The experimental results show that the proposed self-attentive neural parser outperforms the other parsers in the literature on English and German, and shows significant improvement in the cross-lingual setting for French which has comparatively low sources. Moreover, the results obtained from other downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis confirm that semantically informed sentence embeddings provide higher-quality embeddings compared to other pre-trained models such as SBERT (Reimers et al., 2019) or SimCSE (Gao et al., 2021), which do not utilise such structured information.

TI Interval type-2 fractional fuzzy inference systems: Towards an evolution
   in fuzzy inference systems
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB Following type-1 fractional fuzzy inference systems presented recently as the new generation of fuzzy inference systems, interval type-2 fractional fuzzy inference systems (IT2FFISs) as a leap further ahead in the evolution of fuzzy inference systems (FISs) are introduced in this article. The IT2FFISs, which are outlined in this article, add to the armamentarium of FISs some particular concepts such as interval type-2 fractional membership functions, type-2 fractional translation rule, type-2 fracture index, the concept of switching, the entanglement, the degeneracy concept, and so forth. An IT2FFIS exploits not only the tolerance for the uncertainty in the interpretation of the meaning of a word, but also the relevance between the quality and quantity levels of the given information to infer an answer to an inference query. The IT2FFISs make an increase in machine intelligence quotient possible by an increase in the range of FISs order rather than their type. Moreover, the synergy of the concepts coming with various modes of IT2FFISs such as the aggressive mode opens a gate to a space of fuzzy systems outputs which used to be indiscoverable. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that as the type-2 fracture index approaches zero, the space of IT2FFISs outputs contracts and eventually it coincides the space of IT2FISs output when the fracture index is equal to zero. It is also proved that, provided a particular order of the IT2FFIS is taken into account, independent of the problem in question, a typical IT2FIS never leads to results which are more satisfactory than those obtained by the IT2FFIS corresponding to the typical IT2FIS.

TI Multi-Head Self-Attention Gated-Dilated Convolutional Neural Network for
   Word Sense Disambiguation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is to determine correct sense of ambiguous word based on its context. WSD is widely used in text classification, machine translation and information retrieval and so on. WSD accuracy is low because disambiguation features can not cover more language phenomenon and the discriminative ability of WSD model is not high. In order to improve accuracy of simplified Chinese WSD, a WSD model based on multi-head self-attention and gated-dilated convolutional neural network(AGDCNN) is proposed. Ambiguous word is viewed as the center and 4 adjacent lexical units are extracted successively toward the left and right side. Words, parts of speech, and semantic categories in 4 adjacent lexical units are vectorized and the vectorized results are input into gated-dilated convolutional neural network to get discriminative features. Then, multi-head self-attention is adopted to learn the difference and connection among discriminative features fully. Finally, classification weights are output from adaptive average pooling layer. Experiments are conducted on SemEval-2007: Task#5 and SemEval-2021: Task#2. Experimental results show that AGDCNN model has higher accuracy compared with other methods. Our goal is to improve the quality of simplified Chinese WSD as much as possible based on current linguistic resources and machine learning methods. The challenge we face is to extract effective discriminative features and design disambiguation model in high quality. Our novelty lies in that gated-dilated convolution is combined with multi-head self-attention to extract effective discriminative features, and learn their difference and connection from word form, parts of speech, and semantic categories.

TI PersianQuAD: The Native Question Answering Dataset for the Persian
   Language
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Developing Question Answering systems (QA) is one of the main goals in Artificial Intelligence. With the advent of Deep Learning (DL) techniques, QA systems have witnessed significant advances. Although DL performs very well on QA, it requires a considerable amount of annotated data for training. Many annotated datasets have been built for the QA task; most of them are exclusively in English. In order to address the need for a high-quality QA dataset in the Persian language, we present PersianQuAD, the native QA dataset for the Persian language. We create PersianQuAD in four steps: 1) Wikipedia article selection, 2) question-answer collection, 3) three-candidates test set preparation, and 4) Data Quality Monitoring. PersianQuAD consists of approximately 20,000 questions and answers made by native annotators on a set of Persian Wikipedia articles. The answer to each question is a segment of the corresponding article text. To better understand PersianQuAD and ensure its representativeness, we analyze PersianQuAD and show it contains questions of varying types and difficulties. We also present three versions of a deep learning-based QA system trained with PersianQuAD. Our best system achieves an F1 score of 82.97% which is comparable to that of QA systems on English SQuAD, made by the Stanford University. This shows that PersianQuAD performs well for training deep-learning-based QA systems. Human performance on PersianQuAD is significantly better (96.49%), demonstrating that PersianQuAD is challenging enough and there is still plenty of room for future improvement. PersianQuAD and all QA models implemented in this paper are freely available.

CL Rome, ITALY
AB Recent advances in verification have made it possible to envision trusted implementations of real-world languages. Java with its type-safety and fully specified semantics would appear to be an ideal candidate; yet, the complexity of the translation steps used in production virtual machines have made it a challenging target for verifying compiler technology. One of Java's key innovations, its memory model, poses significant obstacles to such an endeavor. The Java Memory Model is an ambitious attempt at specifying the behavior of multithreaded programs in a portable, hardware agnostic, way. While experts have an intuitive grasp of the properties that the model should enjoy, the specification is complex and not well-suited for integration within a verifying compiler infrastructure. Moreover, the specification is given in an axiomatic style that is distant from the intuitive reordering-based reasonings traditionally used to justify or rule out behaviors, and ill suited to the kind of operational reasoning one would expect to employ in a compiler. This paper takes a step back, and introduces a Buffered Memory Model (BMM) for Java. We choose a pragmatic point in the design space sacrificing generality in favor of a model that is fully characterized in terms of the reorderings it allows, amenable to formal reasoning, and which can be efficiently applied to a specific hardware family, namely x86 multiprocessors. Although the BMM restricts the reorderings compilers are allowed to perform, it serves as the key enabling device to achieving a verification pathway from bytecode to machine instructions. Despite its restrictions, we show that it is backwards compatible with the Java Memory Model and that it does not cripple performance on TSO architectures.

TI Natural Language Processing in Electronic Health Records in relation to
   healthcare decision-making: A systematic review
SO COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB Background: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is widely used to extract clinical insights from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, the lack of annotated data, automated tools, and other challenges hinder the full utilisation of NLP for EHRs. Various Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL) and NLP techniques are studied and compared to understand the limitations and opportunities in this space comprehensively.Methodology: After screening 261 articles from 11 databases, we included 127 papers for full-text review covering seven categories of articles: (1) medical note classification, (2) clinical entity recognition, (3) text summarisation, (4) deep learning (DL) and transfer learning architecture, (5) information extraction, (6) Medical language translation and (7) other NLP applications. This study follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.Result and Discussion: EHR was the most commonly used data type among the selected articles, and the datasets were primarily unstructured. Various ML and DL methods were used, with prediction or classification being the most common application of ML or DL. The most common use cases were: the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) classification, clinical note analysis, and named entity recognition (NER) for clinical descriptions and research on psychiatric disorders.Conclusion: We find that the adopted ML models were not adequately assessed. In addition, the data imbalance problem is quite important, yet we must find techniques to address this underlining problem. Future studies should address key limitations in studies, primarily identifying Lupus Nephritis, Suicide Attempts, perinatal self-harmed and ICD-9 classification.

TI Refinement of the clinical variant interpretation framework by
   statistics evidence and machine learning
SO MED
AB Background: Although the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) guidelines for variant interpretation are used widely in clinical genetics, there is room for improvement of these knowledge-based guidelines.
   Methods: Statistical assessment of average deleteriousness of startlost, stop-lost, and in-frame insertion and deletion (indel) variants and extraction of deleterious subsets was performed, being informed by proportions of rare variants in the general population of the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). A machine learning-based model scoring the pathogenicity of start-lost variants (the PoStaL model) was constructed by predicting possible translation initiation sites on transcripts by deep learning and training a random forest on known pathogenic and likely benign variants.
   Findings: The proportion of rare variants was highest in stop-lost variants, followed by in-frame indels and start-lost variants, suggesting that the criteria in the ACMG/AMP guidelines assigning PVS (pathogenic very strong) to start-lost variants and PM (pathogenic moderate) to stop-lost and in-frame indel variants would not be appropriate. Regarding deleterious subsets, stop-lost variants introducing extensions of more than 30 amino acids and in-frame indels computationally predicted to be damaging are enriched for rare and known pathogenic variants. For start-lost variants, we developed the PoStaL model, which outperforms existing tools. We also provide comprehensive lists of the PoStaL scores for start-lost variants and the length of extended amino acids by stop-lost variants.
   Conclusions: Our study could contribute to refinement of the ACMG/AMP guidelines, provides resources for future investigation, and provides an example of how to improve knowledge-based frameworks by data-driven approaches.

TI Translating a mineral systems model into continuous and data-driven
   targeting models: An example from the Dolatabad chromite district,
   southeastern Iran
SO JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION
AB The Dolatabad chromite district, a well-endowed mineralized tract located in SE Iran, hosts numerous podiform chromite deposits. Its favorable geological setting and known chromite endowment suggest that the district has good potential for the discovery of additional chromite mineralization. However, the processes that controlled the development and preservation of the chromite ores are poorly known. As such, a better understanding of the ore-forming processes will be critical for the success of future exploration activities in the Dolatabad chromite district. Recognition of these critical genetic processes and the mapping of their spatial expressions are the precursors to mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) as well as any mineral exploration activities on the ground. This study adopted a mineral systems approach to MPM, which entailed the formulation of a probabilistic framework to the recognition of the critical genetic processes and translation of these processes to mappable evidence maps. Here, we developed three proxies, representing trap, deposition, and preservation processes, that were subjected to a range of weighting procedures, including continuous (i.e., fuzzy gamma, geometric average, and data-driven index overlay) and data-driven machine-learning (i.e., multilayer perceptron neural network and random forests) methods. The machine-learning procedures outperformed the continuous procedures, suggesting that the former approaches are more reliable in targeting mineralized zones. The targets delineated by random forest algorithm, the superior model generated in this study, predicted c. 71% of the known chromite mineralization in c. 6% of the study area.

AB ARM has become the leading processor architecture for mobile and IoT devices, while it has recently started claiming a bigger slice of the server market pie as well. As such, it will not be long before malware more regularly target the ARM architecture. Therefore, the stealthy operation of Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) is an obligation to successfully analyze and proactively mitigate this growing threat. Stealthy VMI has proven itself perfectly suitable for malware analysis on Intel's architecture, yet, it often lacks the foundation required to be equally effective on ARM.
   In this paper, we closely examine both ARMv7 and ARMv8 architectures to identify shortcomings and develop novel techniques necessary for effective virtualization-based dynamic malware analysis. We implement and open-source a prototype, named altp2m, for the open source Xen Project hypervisor on ARM. Compared to traditional VMI approaches, our solution enables hypervisors to dynamically allocate and switch among multiple guest memory views by utilizing the Second Level Address Translation (SLAT). Further, we implement an alternative single-stepping mechanism and leverage the execute-only capability of the SLAT mechanism on ARMv8 to enable stealthy in-guest instrumentation. To target also ARMv7-based systems, we manipulate the TLB organization through altp2m to coordinate the guest kernel execution flow. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, we combine all building blocks of our work to form the foundation for the dynamic malware analysis system DRAKVUF on ARM. Overall, our experiments reveal that our novel dynamic analysis system is stealthy, efficient, and is perfectly suited to assist malware analysts to quickly comprehend the behavior and reduce the mitigation time of malware targeting ARM.

TI Improving N-6-methyladenosine site prediction with heuristic selection
   of nucleotide physical-chemical properties
SO ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY
AB N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is one of the most common and abundant post-transcriptional RNA modifications found in viruses and most eukaryotes. m(6)A plays an essential role in many vital biological processes to regulate gene expression. Because of its widespread distribution across the genomes, the identification of m(6)A sites from RNA sequences is of significant importance for better understanding the regulatory mechanism of m(6)A. Although progress has been achieved in m(6)A site prediction, challenges remain. This article aims to further improve the performance of m(6)A site prediction by introducing a new heuristic nucleotide physical-chemical property selection (HPCS) algorithm. The proposed HPCS algorithm can effectively extract an optimized subset of nucleotide physical chemical properties under the prescribed feature representation for encoding an RNA sequence into a feature vector. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed HPCS algorithm under different feature representations, including pseudo dinucleotide composition (PseDNC), auto-covariance (AC), and cross-covariance (CC). Based on the proposed HPCS algorithm, we implemented an m6A site predictor, called M(6)A-HPCS, which is freely available at http://csbio.njust.edu.cn/bioinf/M(6)A-HPCS. Experimental results over rigorous jackknife tests on benchmark datasets demonstrated that the proposed M(6)A-HPCS achieves higher success rates and outperforms existing state-of-the-art sequence-based m(6)A site predictors.

TI Identifying, Indexing, and Ranking Chemical Formulae and Chemical Names
   in Digital Documents
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB End-users utilize chemical search engines to search for chemical formulae and chemical names. Chemical search engines identify and index chemical formulae and chemical names appearing in text documents to support efficient search and retrieval in the future. Identifying chemical formulae and chemical names in text automatically has been a hard problem that has met with varying degrees of success in the past. We propose algorithms for chemical formula and chemical name tagging using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) that achieve higher accuracy than existing (published) methods. After chemical entities have been identified in text documents, they must be indexed. In order to support user-provided search queries that require a partial match between the chemical name segment used as a keyword or a partial chemical formula, all possible (or a significant number of) subformulae of formulae that appear in any document and all possible subterms (e.g., "methyl") of chemical names (e.g., "methylethyl ketone") must be indexed. Indexing all possible subformulae and subterms results in an exponential increase in the storage and memory requirements as well as the time taken to process the indices. We propose techniques to prune the indices significantly without reducing the quality of the returned results significantly. Finally, we propose multiple query semantics to allow users to pose different types of partial search queries for chemical entities. We demonstrate empirically that our search engines improve the relevance of the returned results for search queries involving chemical entities.

TI Time-resolved molecular dynamics of bacteriophage HK97 capsid maturation
   interpreted by electron cryo-microscopy and X-ray crystallography
SO JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY
AB The bacteriophage HK97 capsid is a molecular machine that exhibits large-scale conformational rearrangements of its 420 identical protein subunits during capsid maturation. Immature empty capsids, termed Prohead II, assemble in vivo in an Escherichia coli expression system. Maturation of these particles may be induced in vitro, converting them into Head II capsids that are indistinguishable in conformation from the capsid of an infectious phage particle. One method of in vitro maturation requires acidification to drive the reaction through two expansion intermediates (EI-I, EI-II) to its penultimate particle state (EI-III), which has 86% more internal volume than Prohead II. Neutralization of EI-III produces the fully mature capsid, Head II. The three expansion intermediates and the acid expansion pathway were characterized by cryo-EM analysis and 3D reconstruction. We now report that, although large-scale structural changes are involved, the electron density maps for these intermediate states are readily interpreted in terms of quasi-atomic models based on subunit structures determined by prior crystallographic analysis of Head II. Progression through the expansion intermediate states primarily represents rigid-body rotations and translations of the subunits, accompanied by refolding of two small regions, the N-terminal arm and a beta-hairpin called the E-loop. Movies made with these pseudo-atomic coordinates and the Head II X-ray coordinates illuminate various aspects of the maturation pathway in the course of which the pattern of inter-subunit interactions is sequentially transformed while the integrity of the capsid is maintained.

TI Scoring model based on the signature of non-m6A-related
   neoantigen-coding lncRNAs assists in immune microenvironment analysis
   and TCR-neoantigen pair selection in gliomas
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
AB Background Small peptides encoded by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have attracted attention for their various functions. Recent studies indicate that these small peptides participate in immune responses and antigen presentation. However, the significance of RNA modifications remains unclear. Methods Thirteen non-m6A-related neoantigen-coding lncRNAs were selected for analysis from the TransLnc database. Next, a neoantigen activation score (NAS) model was established based on the characteristics of the lncRNAs. Machine learning was employed to expand the model to two additional RNA-seq and two single-cell sequencing datasets for further validation. The DLpTCR algorithm was used to predict T cell receptor (TCR)-peptide binding probability. Results The non-m6A-related NAS model predicted patients' overall survival outcomes more precisely than the m6A-related NAS model. Furthermore, the non-m6A-related NAS was positively correlated with tumor cells' evolutionary level, immune infiltration, and antigen presentation. However, high NAS gliomas also showed more PD-L1 expression and high mutation frequencies of T-cell positive regulators. Interestingly, results of intercellular communication analysis suggest that T cell-high neoplastic cell interaction is weaker in both of the NAS groups which might arise from decreased IFNGR1 expression. Moreover, we identified unique TCR-peptide pairs present in all glioma samples based on peptides encoded by the 13 selected lncRNAs. And increased levels of neoantigen-active TCR patterns were found in high NAS gliomas. Conclusions Our work suggests that non-m6A-related neoantigen-coding lncRNAs play an essential role in glioma progression and that screened TCR clonotypes might provide potential avenues for chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy for gliomas.

TI Evaluating and Enhancing the Robustness of Sustainable Neural
   Relationship Classifiers Using Query-Efficient Black-Box Adversarial
   Attacks
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Neural relation extraction (NRE) models are the backbone of various machine learning tasks, including knowledge base enrichment, information extraction, and document summarization. Despite the vast popularity of these models, their vulnerabilities remain unknown; this is of high concern given their growing use in security-sensitive applications such as question answering and machine translation in the aspects of sustainability. In this study, we demonstrate that NRE models are inherently vulnerable to adversarially crafted text that contains imperceptible modifications of the original but can mislead the target NRE model. Specifically, we propose a novel sustainable term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF) based black-box adversarial attack to evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art CNN, CGN, LSTM, and BERT-based models on two benchmark RE datasets. Compared with white-box adversarial attacks, black-box attacks impose further constraints on the query budget; thus, efficient black-box attacks remain an open problem. By applying TFIDF to the correctly classified sentences of each class label in the test set, the proposed query-efficient method achieves a reduction of up to 70% in the number of queries to the target model for identifying important text items. Based on these items, we design both character- and word-level perturbations to generate adversarial examples. The proposed attack successfully reduces the accuracy of six representative models from an average F1 score of 80% to below 20%. The generated adversarial examples were evaluated by humans and are considered semantically similar. Moreover, we discuss defense strategies that mitigate such attacks, and the potential countermeasures that could be deployed in order to improve sustainability of the proposed scheme.

TI Serum neurofilament levels reflect outer retinal layer changes in
   multiple sclerosis
SO THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS
AB Background: Serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) and distinct intra-retinal layers are both promising biomarkers of neuro-axonal injury in multiple sclerosis (MS). We aimed to unravel the association of both markers in early MS, having identified that neurofilament has a distinct immunohistochemical expression pattern among intra-retinal layers.
   Methods: Three-dimensional (3D) spectral domain macular optical coherence tomography scans and sNfL levels were investigated in 156 early MS patients (female/male: 109/47, mean age: 33.39.5years, mean disease duration: 2.03.3years). Out of the whole cohort, 110 patients had no history of optic neuritis (NHON) and 46 patients had a previous history of optic neuritis (HON). In addition, a subgroup of patients (n=38) was studied longitudinally over 2years. Support vector machine analysis was applied to test a regression model for significant changes.
   Results: In our cohort, HON patients had a thinner outer plexiform layer (OPL) volume compared to NHON patients (B=-0.016, SE=0.006, p=0.013). Higher sNfL levels were significantly associated with thinner OPL volumes in HON patients (B=-6.734, SE=2.514, p=0.011). This finding was corroborated in the longitudinal subanalysis by the association of higher sNfL levels with OPL atrophy (B=5.974, SE=2.420, p=0.019). sNfL levels were 75.7% accurate at predicting OPL volume in the supervised machine learning.
   Conclusions: In summary, sNfL levels were a good predictor of future outer retinal thinning in MS. Changes within the neurofilament-rich OPL could be considered as an additional retinal marker linked to MS neurodegeneration.

TI Brain functional connectome-based prediction of individual decision
   impulsivity
SO CORTEX
AB Extensive neuroimaging research has attempted to identify neural correlates and pre- dictors of decision impulsivity. However, the nature and extent of decision impulsivity- brain association have varied substantially across studies, likely due to small sample sizes, limited image quality, different imaging measurement selections, and non-specific methodologies. The objective of this study was to develop a reliable predictive model of decision impulsivity-brain relationship in a large sample by applying connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM), a recently developed machine learning approach, to whole- brain functional connectivity data ("neural fingerprints"). For 809 healthy young partici- pants from the Human Connectome Project, high-quality resting-state functional MRI data were utilized to construct brain functional connectome and delay discounting test was used to assess decision impulsivity. Then, CPM with leave-one-out cross-validation was conducted to predict individual decision impulsivity from whole-brain functional con- nectivity. We found that CPM successfully and reliably predicted the delay discounting scores in novel individuals. Moreover, different feature selection thresholds, parcellation strategies and cross-validation approaches did not significantly influence the prediction results. At the neural level, we observed that the decision impulsivity-associated functional networks included brain regions within default-mode, subcortical, somato-motor, dorsal attention, and visual systems, suggesting that decision impulsivity emerges from highly integrated connections involving multiple intrinsic networks. Our findings not only may expand existing knowledge regarding the neural mechanism of decision impulsivity, but also may present a workable route towards translation of brain imaging findings into real-world economic decision-making.

Enhancers are further categorized into two classes on the basis of its structure and strength, namely strong enhancers and weak enhancers. Owing to technological improvement, huge numbers of DNA sequences are explored in data banks. So the identification of these unprocessed data via traditional methods is challenging due to intricate and vague structures. In addition, only limited numbers of recognized structures are available. In order to tackle the limitations of traditional methods, it is indispensable to adopt the concept of intelligent and machine learning. In this regard, a two-layer automated model is proposed. In the first layer, it discriminates between enhancer and non-enhancer. In case of enhancer, further, the second layer identifies the types of enhancer. DNA sequences are expressed using pseudo dinucleotide composition, pseudo trinucleotide composition and pseudo tetra nucleotide composition. In order to combine the strength of various feature spaces, a hybrid feature space is formed by amalgamating these three feature spaces. After compiling the results, it is observed that support vector machine achieved encouraging results in conjunction with hybrid feature space, which is 77.86 and 65.83% of accuracies on examined datasets. The obtained results exposed that the proposed model performed prominent compared to the existing approaches so far notifiable in the literature. It is realized that the developed model might be more useful and expedient for basic research and academia.

TI A MAJOR E-LEARNING PROJECT TO RENOVATE SCIENCE LEANING ENVIRONMENT IN
   TAIWAN
SO TURKISH ONLINE JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
AB This article summarizes a major e-Learning project recently funded by the National Science Council of Taiwan and envisions some of the future research directions in this area. This project intends to initiate the 'Center for excellence in e-Learning Sciences (CeeLS): i(4) future learning environment' at the National Taiwan Normal University. In collaboration with multiple leading institutes and universities involved in the areas of science education, computer science and computer engineering from around the world, NTNU proposes to develop an innovative science learning environment which integrates various modern technologies such as image processing, speech processing, automatic video processing, speech recognition, mobile technologies, machine translation, natural language processing, data mining and machine learning. Our aim is to create an intelligent classroom embedded with individualized and interactive learning materials and assessment tools. To realize the aforementioned goals, the CeeLS endeavors to bring together a group of experts in the area of science education, cognitive science, computer science, and computer engineering. We will propose three closely interrelated research directions conducted by three major projects: (1) Project Classroom 2.0, to establish this envisioned future classroom; (2) Project Mobile 2.0, to enhance the interactions among teacher, students, and student peers, and (3) Project Testing 2.0, to pioneer new technologies on assessment and to assist the CeeLS to carry out program evaluations for the project. Four major changes (in both cognitive and affective domains including students' domain knowledge, higher-order thinking ability and attitudes and motivation in the subject matters) will be investigated and evaluated under the innovative learning environment. The investigations will include: (1) Teachers' Teaching Approaches (TTA), (2) Students' Learning Strategies (SLS), (3) Student-Teacher Interactions (STI), and (4) Student Science Learning Outcomes (SLO).

TI An Improved in vitro Model of Cortical Tissue
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
AB Intracortical electrodes for brain-machine interfaces rely on intimate contact with tissues for recording signals and stimulating neurons. However, the long-term viability of intracortical electrodes in vivo is poor, with a major contributing factor being the development of a glial scar. In vivo approaches for evaluating responses to intracortical devices are resource intensive and complex, making statistically significant, high throughput data difficult to obtain. In vitro models provide an alternative to in vivo studies; however, existing approaches have limitations which restrict the translation of the cellular reactions to the implant scenario. Notably, there is no current robust model that includes astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes and neurons, the four principle cell types, critical to the health, function and wound responses of the central nervous system (CNS). In previous research a co-culture of primary mouse mature mixed glial cells and immature neural precursor cells were shown to mimic several key properties of the CNS response to implanted electrode materials. However, the method was not robust and took up to 63 days, significantly affecting reproducibility and widespread use for assessing brain-material interactions. In the current research a new co-culture approach has been developed and evaluated using immunocytochemistry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The resulting method reduced the time in culture significantly and the culture model was shown to have a genetic signature similar to that of healthy adult mouse brain. This new robust CNS culture model has the potential to significantly improve the capacity to translate in vitro data to the in vivo responses.

TI Discriminating the brain activities for brain-computer interface
   applications through the optimal allocation-based approach
SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
AB The translation of brain activities into signals in brain-computer interface (BCI) systems requires a robust and accurate classification to develop a communication system for motor disabled people. In BCIs, motor imagery (MI) tasks generate brain activities, which are generally measured by electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The aim of this research was to introduce a method for the extraction of discriminatory information from the MI-based EEG signals for BCI applications. The proposed scheme develops an optimal allocation (OA)-based approach to discover the most effective representatives with minimal variability from a large number of MI-based EEG data. To investigate a suitable classifier for the OA-based features, the least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) methods are applied separately on the extracted features for discriminating the MI activities. Experimental results on datasets, IVa and IVb of BCI Competition III, show that the OA-based features with the LS-SVM classifier yields better performances compared to the NB classifiers. The results also demonstrate that the classification performance is improved up to 21.16 %, through the use of the OA algorithm with the LS-SVM, compared to the reported four prominent methods. This implies that the OA technique is promising for extracting representative characteristics from MI-based EEG data, which can be reliably used with the LS-SVM to identify different signals of brain activities in the development of BCI systems.

AB In this paper, we present a virtual machine based SSD Simulator, VSSIM (Virtual SSD Simulator). VSSIM intends to address the issues of the trace driven simulation, e. g. trace re-scaling, accurate replay, etc. VSSIM operates on top of QE-MU/KVM with software based SSD module. VSSIM runs in realtime and allows the user to measure both the host performance and the SSD behavior under various design choices. VSSIM can flexibly model the various hardware components, e. g. the number of channels, the number of ways, block size, page size, planes per chip, program, erase, read latency of NAND cells, channel switch delay, and way switch delay. VSSIM can also facilitate the implementation of the SSD firmware algorithms. To demonstrate the capability of VSSIM, we performed a number of case studies. The results of the simulation study deliver an important guideline in the firmware and hardware designs of future NAND based storage devices. Followings are some of the findings: (i) as the page size increases, the performance benefit of increasing the channel parallelism against increasing the way parallelism becomes less significant, (ii) due to the bi-modality in IO size distribution, FTL should be designed to handle multiple mapping granularity, (iii) hybrid mapping does not work in four or more way SSD due to severe log block fragmentation, (iv) as a performance metric, the Write Amplification Factor can be misleading, (v) compared to sequential write, random write operation can be benefited more from the channel level parallelism and therefore in multi-channel environment, it is beneficial to categorize larger fraction of IO as random. VSSIM is validated against commodity SSD, Intel X25M SSD. VSSIM models the sequential IO performance of X25M within 3 % offset.

AB There are many systems for measuring precise position of stages or probes. Three-dimensional coordinate measuring machine is an example. These machines, however, do not measure orientation of the stage. In recent years, positioning stages using parallel mechanisms have been developed. To obtain the information of their geometrical motions, we have to measure the orientation in addition to position. In this paper, we shall propose an interferometric system for measuring the position and orientation of such a positioning stage. In this system multiple retro-reflectors such as corner cubes are fixed on the moving stage and multiple interferometers are formed with the corner cubes as reflectors. Light beams are incident on the corner cubes from different incident directions. We have two ways to measure the positions of the corner cubes with interferometers. One is "fringe counting method", measuring the moving distance of the corner cubes in several directions directly, and calculating the position and orientation of the stage from the moving distances. The other is "multi-directional coincidence method", utilizing multiple image sensors to detect the interferograms in several directions. From the interferograms, we obtain fractional fringe orders by image processing, and estimate the integer fringe orders, which conform to the fractional orders for all the interferograms. The simulation results in 2-dimension (2-D) showed that an error within 0.1 mum in translation and 0.01 degree in rotation are achieved in the measuring ranges of several millimeters with the fringe counting method. Simulation for one-dimensional multi-directional coincidence method showed the potentiality of the method.

TI Real-Time and In Situ Monitoring of the Synthesis of Silica
   Nanoparticles
SO ACS SENSORS
AB The real-time and in situ monitoring of the synthesis of nanomaterials(NMs) remains a challenging task, which is of pivotal importance by assisting fundamental studies (e.g., synthesis kinetics and colloidal phenomena) and providingoptimized quality control. In fact, the lack of reproducibility in the synthesis of NMsis a bottleneck against the translation of nanotechnologies into the market towarddaily practice. Here, we address an impedimetric millifluidic sensor with dataprocessing by machine learning (ML) as a sensing platform to monitor silicananoparticles (SiO2NPs) over a 24 h synthesis from a single measurement. TheSiO2NPs were selected as a model NM because of their extensive applications.Impressively, simple ML-fitted descriptors were capable of overcoming interferencesderived from SiO2NP adsorption over the signals of polarizable Au interdigitateelectrodes to assure the determination of the size and concentration of nanoparticlesover synthesis while meeting the trade-offbetween accuracy and speed/simplicity ofcomputation. The root-mean-square errors were calculated as similar to 2.0 nm (size) and 2.6x1010nanoparticles mL-1(concentration).Further, the robustness of the ML size descriptor was successfully challenged in data obtained along independent syntheses usingdifferent devices, with the global average accuracy being 103.7 +/- 1.9%. Our work advances the developments required to transform aclosedflow system basically encompassing the reactionalflask and an impedimetric sensor into a scalable and user-friendly platformto assess thein situsynthesis of SiO2NPs. Since the sensor presents a universal response principle, the method is expected to enablethe monitoring of other NMs. Such a platform may help to pave the way for translating "sense-act" systems into practice use in nanotechnology

TI Oligo kernels for datamining on biological sequences: a case study on
   prokaryotic translation initiation sites
SO BMC BIOINFORMATICS
AB Background: Kernel-based learning algorithms are among the most advanced machine learning methods and have been successfully applied to a variety of sequence classification tasks within the field of bioinformatics. Conventional kernels utilized so far do not provide an easy interpretation of the learnt representations in terms of positional and compositional variability of the underlying biological signals.
   Results: We propose a kernel-based approach to datamining on biological sequences. With our method it is possible to model and analyze positional variability of oligomers of any length in a natural way. On one hand this is achieved by mapping the sequences to an intuitive but high-dimensional feature space, well-suited for interpretation of the learnt models. On the other hand, by means of the kernel trick we can provide a general learning algorithm for that high-dimensional representation because all required statistics can be computed without performing an explicit feature space mapping of the sequences. By introducing a kernel parameter that controls the degree of position-dependency, our feature space representation can be tailored to the characteristics of the biological problem at hand. A regularized learning scheme enables application even to biological problems for which only small sets of example sequences are available. Our approach includes a visualization method for transparent representation of characteristic sequence features. Thereby importance of features can be measured in terms of discriminative strength with respect to classification of the underlying sequences. To demonstrate and validate our concept on a biochemically well-defined case, we analyze E. coli translation initiation sites in order to show that we can find biologically relevant signals. For that case, our results clearly show that the Shine-Dalgarno sequence is the most important signal upstream a start codon. The variability in position and composition we found for that signal is in accordance with previous biological knowledge. We also find evidence for signals downstream of the start codon, previously introduced as transcriptional enhancers. These signals are mainly characterized by occurrences of adenine in a region of about 4 nucleotides next to the start codon.
   Conclusions: We showed that the oligo kernel can provide a valuable tool for the analysis of relevant signals in biological sequences. In the case of translation initiation sites we could clearly deduce the most discriminative motifs and their positional variation from example sequences. Attractive features of our approach are its flexibility with respect to oligomer length and position conservation. By means of these two parameters oligo kernels can easily be adapted to different biological problems.

TI Quality of Radiomics Research on Brain Metastasis: A Roadmap to Promote
   Clinical Translation
SO KOREAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
AB Objective: Our study aimed to evaluate the quality of radiomics studies on brain metastases based on the radiomics quality score (RQS), Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) checklist, and the Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI) guidelines.
   Materials and Methods: PubMed MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched for articles on radiomics for evaluating brain metastases, published until February 2021. Of the 572 articles, 29 relevant original research articles were included and evaluated according to the RQS, TRIPOD checklist, and IBSI guidelines.
   Results: External validation was performed in only three studies (10.3%). The median RQS was 3.0 (range, -6 to 12), with a low basic adherence rate of 50.0%. The adherence rate was low in comparison to the "gold standard" (10.3%), stating the potential clinical utility (10.3%), performing the cut-off analysis (3.4%), reporting calibration statistics (6.9%), and providing open science and data (3.4%). None of the studies involved test-retest or phantom studies, prospective studies, or cost-effectiveness analyses. The overall rate of adherence to the TRIPOD checklist was 60.3% and low for reporting title (3.4%), blind assessment of outcome (0%), description of the handling of missing data (0%), and presentation of the full prediction model (0%). The majority of studies lacked pre-processing steps, with bias-field correction, isovoxel resampling, skull stripping, and gray-level discretization performed in only six (20.7%), nine (31.0%), four (3.8%), and four (13.8%) studies, respectively.
   Conclusion: The overall scientific and reporting quality of radiomics studies on brain metastases published during the study period was insufficient. Radiomics studies should adhere to the RQS, TRIPOD, and IBSI guidelines to facilitate the translation of radiomics into the clinical field.

TI FOREST AND LABYRINTH. TOWARD AN ECOLOGY OF THE SUBJECT
SO LOGOS
AB The concept of the subject is articulated here as a correlation between two terms - movements and actions. Classical theories of action presupposed the subject as a unique way to correlate movements and actions and to translate the one into the other. The "soul; i.e., a natural complex of cognitive and volitional abilities, was a reliable tool for that translation. However, the modern period faces the problem of "the failure of the soul; which brings about the concept of the subject. Different ways of translating movements into actions do not always permit stable subjectification, which indicates that "transport" is a mediating term in the opposition of movements and actions. There is an intermediary region between the "physics" of movement and the "ethics" of action, and that region is the "logic" of transport which is to be understood as an open-ended collection of ways to correlate movements with actions. The problematic function of transport becomes clear when it is impossible to rely on the soul as a black box that is responsible for the stability in the translation of movements into actions.
   The solution to the problem of the failure of the soul appears particularly in Henry David Thoreau's "forest," which is constructed as a way to restore a classical ecology of the subject in the face of a proliferation of different modes of transport that threaten the uniformity of subjective experience. According to Roland Barthes' seminar, the opposite of Thoreau's "forest" would be the "labyrinth" as an anti-subject machine. The labyrinth is not merely a place of loss, but the production of loss that turns any movement into action or decision while at the same time cancelling any action and drawing the subject out of its own structure. Labyrinth and forest as alternatives to the classical construction of the subject delineate a general space for subjectification, which has problems that cannot be encompassed by theories of praxis.

AB Within the Dutch standards laboratory (NMi Van Swinden Laboratorium) a traceable atomic force microscope (AFM) is currently being developed where we aim at a measurement uncertainty of 1 nm. As part of this development novel methods have been developed for the calibration of this instrument. The SPM has been constructed using a commercial AFM head that has been embedded in a metrology frame using an accurate 3D translation stage. The position of the AFM probe relative to the sample is determined along three orthogonal measurement axes by three individual laser interferometers. Due to the properties of the 3D translation stage the Abbe offset between the probe position and the measurement axes should remain below 0.1 mm in order to realize an overall measurement uncertainty of 1 nm. Since the laser interferometers use a four-pass optical configuration the measurement axis is defined by the virtual centre of the four positions of the laserspots onto the plane retro mirror. In order to accurately determine this virtual centre and therefore the position of the measurement axis a device has been designed to measure the four laserspot positions of each axis within the SPM. Since the AFM probe position is determined in 3D accurate calibration of the angles between the measurement axes is important if the measurement error is to be minimized to 1 nm. Different calibration setups to accurately determine these angles will be presented. Additionally, a method for the alignment of the optical axes of the laser interferometers with respect to the end mirrors of the interferometers will be discussed. In order to calculate the overall measurement uncertainty of the scanning probe microscope we decided to use the virtual measurement machine concept since a purely analytical approach for these types of measurement instruments is nearly impossible (Schwenke et al 2000 Ann. CIRP 49 395-8). The model or virtual SPM that has been developed for the simulation of the instrumental characteristics will be presented.

TI ON BEAUTIFUL CLARITY: IN MEMORY OF MIKHAIL YASOV
SO PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
AB The article has a memorial character. It provides a brief overview of the contribution of M. D. Yasnov to the development of modern poetry for children and highlights his role as an organizer of poetic space. The study notes the characteristic techniques of language game in children's verses, which draw the child's attention to sounds and letters, word composition, role of function words and homonymy. The predominance of classical poetry meter is combined with the richness of the subject sphere of his poetry and unexpected intonation patterns, the richness of the emotional palette and genre diversity. The authors outline the parameters of the poetic world of childhood in the books ofYasnov, the gradual expansion of the child's outlook from their home, yard and school to the open world of nature and society. With equal attention, Yasnov portrays large and small objects, from outer space to a blade of grass, reproduces the children's mythological worldview, where everything turns out to be interconnected. The establishment of cultural tics between different national literatures is facilitated by the translation activities ofYasnov. The Petersburg poet Yasnov inherits the tradition of acmeism with its pathos of dialogue with the world culture. The authors make a conclusion about the unity of Yasnov's poetic system in its different areas translations, poems for children, and "adult" poems. The conclusion is illustrated by the poems from the book "Ambidexter", supplemented with an analysis of the poem "U shveynoy mashinki ni dnya peredyshki..." [A sewing machine has not a day ofrespite...], which allows one to see the significance of the theme of historical memory in Yasnov's work. The material presented is not only a tribute to the memory of the remarkable poet; it is of interest to practical teachers of Russian literature.

AB In the structural design of shear wall buildings, the initial process requires the interaction between the architecture and engineering teams to define the appropriate distribution of the walls, a stage typically carried out through a trial-and-error procedure, without any consideration of previous similar projects. In previous work, a database of 165 Chilean residential projects of reinforced shear wall concrete buildings was built, which fed a regressive neural network model to predict the wall's engineering thickness and length values from an architectural 30-feature input vector, which accounts for geometric and topological properties, archiving remarkable results regarding the coefficient of determination (R2). However, a regressive model of this nature does not incorporate a spatial detail or contextual information of each wall's perimeter, and also, the prediction of other parameters such as the wall translation has a poor performance. For this reason, the present research proposes a framework based on convolutional neural network (CNN) models to generate the final engineering floor plan by combining two independent floor plan predictions, considering the architectural data as input. The first plan prediction is assembled using two regressive models that predict the wall engineering values of the thickness, the length, the wall translation on both axes from the architectural plan, and the floor bounding box width and aspect ratio. The second plan prediction is assembled using a model that generates a likely image of each wall's engineering floor plan. Both independently predicted plans are combined to lead the final engineering floor plan, which allows predicting the wall's rectangles design parameters and propose new structural elements not present in architecture, making the methodology an excellent candidate to accelerate the building wall layout's early conceptual design.

TI Generative Adversarial Networks Improve the Reproducibility and
   Discriminative Power of Radiomic Features
SO RADIOLOGY-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Purpose: To assess the contribution of a generative adversarial network (GAN) to improve intermanufacturer reproducibility of radiomic features (RFs).
   Materials and Methods: The authors retrospectively developed a cycle-GAN to translate texture information from chest radiographs acquired using one manufacturer (Siemens) to chest radiographs acquired using another (Philips), producing fake chest radiographs with different textures. The authors prospectively evaluated the ability of this texture-translation cycle-GAN to reduce the intermanufacturer variability of RFs extracted from the lung parenchyma. This study assessed the cycle-GAN's ability to fool several machine learning (ML) classifiers tasked with recognizing the manufacturer on the basis of chest radiography inputs. The authors also evaluated the cycle-GAN's ability to mislead radiologists who were asked to perform the same recognition task. Finally, the authors tested whether the cycle-GAN had an impact on radiomic diagnostic accuracy for chest radiography in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF).
   Results: RFs, extracted from chest radiographs after the cycle-GAN's texture translation (fake chest radiographs), showed decreased intermanufacturer RF variability. Using cycle-GAN-generated chest radiographs as inputs, ML classifiers categorized the fake chest radiographs as belonging to the target manufacturer rather than to a native one. Moreover, cycle-GAN fooled two experienced radiologists who identified fake chest radiographs as belonging to a target manufacturer class. Finally, reducing intermanufacturer RF variability with cycle-GAN improved the discriminative power of RFs for patients without CHF versus patients with CHF (from 55% to 73.5%, P <.001).
   Conclusion: Both ML classifiers and radiologists had difficulty recognizing the chest radiographs' manufacturer. The cycle-GAN improved RF intermanufacturer reproducibility and discriminative power for identifying patients with CHF. This deep learning approach may help counteract the sensitivity of RFs to differences in acquisition. Supplemental material is available for this article. (C) RSNA, 2020

TI BOTULINUM NEUROTOXIN-C1 BLOCKS NEUROTRANSMITTER RELEASE BY MEANS OF
   CLEAVING HPC-1/SYNTAXIN
SO EMBO JOURNAL
AB The anaerobic bacterium Clostridium botulinum produces several related neurotoxins that block exocytosis of synaptic vesicles in nerve terminals and that are responsible for the clinical manifestations of botulism. Recently, it was reported that botulinum neurotoxin type B as well as tetanus toxin act as zinc-dependent proteases that specifically cleave synaptobrevin, a membrane protein of synaptic vesicles (Link et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 189, 1017-1023; Schiavo et al., Nature, 359, 832-835). Here we report that inhibition of neurotransmitter release by botulinum neurotoxin type C1 was associated with the proteolysis of HPC-1 (= syntaxin), a membrane protein present in axonal and synaptic membranes. Breakdown of HPC-1/syntaxin was selective since no other protein degradation was detectable. In vitro studies showed that the breakdown was due to a direct interaction between HPC-1/syntaxin and the toxin light chain which acts as a metallo-endoprotease. Toxin-induced cleavage resulted in the generation of a soluble fragment of HPC-1/syntaxin that is 2-4 kDa smaller than the native protein. When HPC-1/syntaxin was translated in vitro, cleavage occurred only when translation was performed in the presence of microsomes, although a full-length product was obtained in the absence of membranes. However, susceptibility to toxin cleavage was restored when the product of membrane-free translation was subsequently incorporated into artificial proteoliposomes. In addition, a translated form of HPC-1/syntaxin, which lacked the putative transmembrane domain at the C-terminus, was soluble and resistant to toxin action. We conclude that HPC-1/syntaxin is involved in exocytotic membrane fusion. Furthermore, these results indicate that the botulinum neurotoxins have evolved as related proteins recognizing the exocytotic fusion machine whereby individual toxin components target different components of the membrane fusion complex.

TI Coracoclavicular Ligament Reconstruction A Systematic Review and a
   Biomechanical Study of a Triple Endobutton Technique
SO MEDICINE
AB Operative intervention is recommended for complete acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocation to restore AC stability, but the best operative technique is still controversial.
   Twelve fresh-frozen male cadaveric shoulders (average age, 62.8 +/- 7.8 years) were equally divided into endobutton versus the modified Weaver-Dunn groups. Each potted scapula and clavicle was fixed in a custom made jig to allow translation and load to failure testing using a Zwick BZ2.5/TS1S material testing machine (Zwick/Roell Co, Germany). A systematic review of 21 studies evaluating reconstructive methods for coracoclavicular or AC joints using a cadaveric model was also performed.
   From our biomechanical study, after ligament reconstruction, the triple endobutton technique demonstrated superior, anterior, and posterior displacements similar to that of the intact state (P > 0.05). In themodified Weaver-Dunn reconstruction group, however, there was significantly greater anterior (P < 0.001) and posterior (P = 0.003) translation after ligament reconstruction. In addition, there was no significant difference after reconstruction between failure load of the triple endobutton group and that of the intact state (686.88 vs 684.9N, P > 0.05), whereas the failure load after the modified Weaver-Dunn reconstruction was decreased comparedwith the intact state (171.64 vs 640.86N, P < 0.001).
   From our systematic review of 21 studies, which involved comparison of the modified Weaver-Dunn technique with other methods, the majority showed that the modified Weaver-Dunn procedure had significantly (P < .05) greater laxity than other methods including the endobutton technique.
   The triple endobutton reconstruction proved superior to the modified Weaver-Dunn technique in restoration of AC joint stability and strength. Triple endobutton reconstruction of the coracoclavicular ligament is superior to the modifiedWeaver-Dunn reconstruction in controlling both superior and anteroposterior displacements with a failure load that approximates the intact ligament.

AB High tensile strength cables, low-resistance motor windings, and shape memory actuators are common examples of technical fibers used in robots and other electromechanical assemblies. Because properties like tensile strength, crystal structure, and polymer alignment depend strongly on processing history, these materials cannot be 3D printed with the same properties they have on the spool. Strings and fibers are inserted in mechanical parts at the end of the manufacturing process for these assemblies. When the fibers take complex paths, the installation is often done by hand. This activity can dominate the process time, increase its human labor and reduce its social sustainability [1].
   This paper applies the non-traditional approach of machine embroidery to insert sheets of patterned fibers in layered additive manufacturing processes such as 3D printing and lamination. Fibers are aligned with features in laser-cut or printed parts without the manual labor of hand threading. We demonstrate that water-soluble stabilizer materials originally designed for textiles can hold hard mechanical parts in a machine embroidery hoop with enough strength and rigidity to withstand sewing through pre-existing holes in the part. Alignment to within 250 microns has been demonstrated with a sub- $300 consumer embroidery machine.
   Case studies in this paper include a cable-driven mechanism, a soft-to-hard electronic connection, and an electromechanical sensor. Process-compatible and commercially available materials that can be embroidered include conductive threads, shrinking threads, water-soluble threads and high tensile strength fibers.
   The biggest hurdle for a user interested in this automated fiber installation process is linking the existing design file with an embroidery machine file. There is a much larger user base for 2D and 3D computer-assisted design (CAD) software than for expensive and proprietary embroidery digitizing software. We take the route chosen by the laser cutter industry, where the user produces a CAD file in their preferred editor, and makes annotations that communicate where and how densely to stitch. Translation software scans the file for a particular line style and generates stitch coordinates along it. Development is done in Jupyter/iPython notebooks that allow end-users to inspect, understand, and modify the conversion code. The intent is for users of existing planar fabrication technology (whether laser, printed circuit board, or micro/nano) to apply this method to their own CAD files for a versatile and straightforward way to put advanced materials in their devices without adding manual labor. This general approach can solve a class of assembly problems relevant to underactuated tendon-driven robotics and other electromechanical systems, expanding the range of devices that can be put together using automation.

AB Micro/nano positioning stages play an essential role in micro/nano precision technology, so the design and development of a new six-axis micro positioning stage are presented in this research. Based on Steward's theory, the stage adopts negative Poisson's ratio with flexure hinges. Since each of the axes is a planar mechanism structure, the stage is fabricated out of aluminum with the micro machining - a simple and well - developed fabrication technique for cost down and batch production. The stage consists of a top plate and a base plate, two hexagons of which the diameters are respectively 22 mm and 95.2 mm with a distance of 21.6 mm in between, and six trapezoid amplifiers, each of which is connected to the base plate at an angle of 30 degrees. Each amplifier consists of three layers two inner layers of symmetrical flexure hinges and one outer layer of non-symmetrical flexure hinge.
   In this research, the stress, strain and amplification are calculated with the software of SolidWorks Ansys@. In experiment, each amplifier is driven by a piezoelectric transducer (PZT), and the displacements are measure wit a laser displacement sensor and recorded for comparison of the single-axis amplifier with the six-axis stage. The results show that the amplification of the displacement of a single-axis amplifier is 15 times, that the horizon translation, the vertical translation, the tilt angle and the rotational angle are 50 Pm, 50 pm, 0.5 degrees and 0.5 degrees respectively, and that the displacement resolution and the rotational resolution are 15.6 nm and 2.7 mu rad respectively. It is obvious that the six-axis stage of this research, indeed, retains the features of high amplification and minimization, and is a novel and low-cost six-axis micro positioning stage.

TI Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based computer-aided technique to diagnose
   major depressive disorder (MDD)
SO BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL
AB Recently, Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based computer-aided (CAD) techniques have shown their promise as decision-making tools to diagnose major depressive disorder (MDD) or simply depression. Although the research results have motivated the use of CAD techniques to help assist psychiatrists in clinics yet their clinical translation has been less clear and remains a research topic. In this paper, a proposed machine learning (ML) scheme was tested and validated with resting-state EEG data involving 33 MDD patients and 30 healthy controls. The EEG-derived measures such as power of different EEG frequency bands and EEG alpha interhemispheric asymmetry were investigated as input features to the proposed ML scheme to discriminate the MDD patients and healthy controls, and to prove their feasibility for diagnosing depression. The acquired EEG data were subjected to noise removal and feature extraction. As a result, a data matrix was constructed by the columns-wise concatenation of the extracted features. Furthermore, the z-score standardization was performed to standardize each column of the data matrix according to its mean and variance. The data matrix may have redundant and irrelevant features; therefore, to determine the most significant features, a weight was assigned to each feature based on its ability to separate the target classes according to the criterion, i.e., receiver operating characteristics (roc). Hence, only the most significant features were used for testing and training the classifier models: Logistic regression (LR), Support vector machine (SVM), and Naive Bayesian (NB). Finally, the classifier models were validated with 10-fold cross-validation that has provided the performance metrics such as test accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. As a result of the investigations, most significant features such as EEG signal power and EEG alpha interhemispheric asymmetry from the brain areas such as frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital were found significant. In addition, the proposed ML framework proved automatic identification of aberrant EEG patterns specific to disease conditions and provide high classification results i.e., LR classifier (accuracy = 97.6%, sensitivity = 96.66%, specificity = 98.5%), NB classification (accuracy = 96.8%, sensitivity = 96.6%, specificity = 97.02%), and SVM (accuracy = 98.4%, sensitivity = 96.66%, specificity = 100%). In conclusion, the proposed ML scheme along with the EEG signal power and EEG alpha interhemispheric asymmetry are proved suitable as clinical diagnostic tools for MDD. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Modular software for an augmented cognition system
SO Foundations of Augmented Cognition, Vol 11
CT 1st International Conference on Augmented Cognition held in Conjunction
   with the 11th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction
CY JUL 22-27, 2005
CL Las Vegas, NV
AB A closed loop Augmented Cognition system can be modeled as five components: an operator, the machine being operated, an operator-machine interface (OMI), physiological sensors, and an augmentation manager. Augmentation manager is the software that provides adaptive control of the OMI. This software must monitor the machine's status, the operator's behavior, and physiological sensor measurements, and compute the optimum presentation of current information and future tasks. The number and complexity of connections between the augmentation manager and the rest of the system seems to require an architecture that is tightly interwoven, without separable modules. However, while the disadvantages should not be overlooked, there are significant advantages to a modular architecture for an augmentation manager.
   Boeing developed a modular architecture for the augmentation manager in its Augmented Cognition system. This software runs as a separate process from the sensors, displays, and machines (simulated uninhabited air vehicle control stations) that make up the rest of the system. All interaction is through a fixed set of interface routines. The augmentation manager cannot and does not have knowledge of the OMI displays; instead there is the concept of an "interaction object" that is mapped (not necessarily one-to-one) to features of the display.
   Disadvantages found with this approach were mainly associated with the additional effort required. Code had to be added to the OMI and simulated control stations to call the interface routines that send and receive data. A moderately large code module was required to do the translation from augmentation manager's interaction objects into OMI display objects. A major effort was required to create a module that used physiological sensor data to produce cognitive state gauges.
   The basic advantage to a modular approach is the capability to connect or disconnect individual modules without impacting the operation of the remainder of the system. In Boeing's Augmented Cognition system, if the augmentation manager itself is completely disconnected the system just reverts to the baseline non-augmented operation. Multiple different sensor suites have been connected to drive closed loop operation, with no changes required to the configuration of the rest of the system. The current augmentation manager's speed and memory requirements have not stressed the available computing resources; but if the software continues to expand, it can be re-hosted on upgraded hardware without affecting the platforms used for the OMI and simulated control stations.
   Finally, modular architecture confers a benefit during development, in that individual modules can be developed in parallel. The augmentation manager was developed concurrently with the simulated control stations and with sensor hardware and software. Integration was still required but the effort was minimized because the interfaces had been largely defined up front.

TI Multimodal characterization of the semantic N400 response within a rapid
   evaluation brain vital sign framework
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
AB Background: For nearly four decades, the N400 has been an important brainwave marker of semantic processing. It can be recorded non-invasively from the scalp using electrical and/or magnetic sensors, but largely within the restricted domain of research laboratories specialized to run specific N400 experiments. However, there is increasing evidence of significant clinical utility for the N400 in neurological evaluation, particularly at the individual level. To enable clinical applications, we recently reported a rapid evaluation framework known as"brain vital signs"that successfully incorporated the N400 response as one of the core components for cognitive function evaluation. The current study characterized the rapidly evoked N400 response to demonstrate that it shares consistent features with traditional N400 responses acquired in research laboratory settings-thereby enabling its translation into brain vital signs applications.
   Methods: Data were collected from 17 healthy individuals using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG), with analysis of sensor-level effects as well as evaluation of brain sources. Individual-level N400 responses were classified using machine learning to determine the percentage of participants in whom the response was successfully detected.
   Results: The N400 response was observed in both M/EEG modalities showing significant differences to incongruent versus congruent condition in the expected time range (p <0.05). Also as expected, N400-related brain activity was observed in the temporal and inferior frontal cortical regions, with typical left-hemispheric asymmetry. Classification robustly confirmed the N400 effect at the individual level with high accuracy (89%), sensitivity (0.88) and specificity (0.90).
   Conclusion: The brain vital sign N400 characteristics were highly consistent with features of the previously reported N400 responses acquired using traditional laboratory-based experiments. These results provide important evidence supporting clinical translation of the rapidly acquired N400 response as a potential tool for assessments of higher cognitive functions.

TI PASSIVE NAVIGATION AS A PATTERN-RECOGNITION PROBLEM
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION
AB The most basic visual capabilities found in living organisms are based on motion. Machine vision, of course, does not have to copy animal vision, but the existence of reliably functioning vision modules in nature gives us some reason to believe that it is possible for an artificial system to work in the same or a similar way. In this article it is argued that many navigational capabilities can be formulated as pattern recognition problems. An appropriate retinotopic representation of the image would make it possible to extract the information necessary to solve motion-related tasks through the recognition of a set of locations on the retina. This argument is illustrated by introducing a representation of image motion by which an observer's egomotion could be derived from information globally encoded in the image-motion field. In the past, the problem of determining a system's own motion from dynamic imagery has been considered as one of the classical visual reconstruction problems, wherein local constraints have been employed to compute from exact 2-D image measurements (correspondence, optical flow) the relative 3-D motion and structure of the scene in view. The approach introduced here is based on new global constraints defined on local normal-flow measurements-the spatio-temporal derivatives of the image-intensity function. Classifications are based on orientations of normal-flow vectors, which allows selection of vectors that form global patterns in the image plane. The position of these patterns is related to the 3-D motion of the observer, and their localization provides the axis of rotation and the direction of translation. The constraints introduced are utilized in algorithmic procedures formulated as search techniques. These procedures are very stable, since they are not affected by small perturbations in the image measurements. As a matter of fact, the solution to the two directions of translation and rotation is not affected, as long as the measurement of the sign of the normal flow is correct.

TI Language-based translation and prediction of surgical navigation steps
   for endoscopic wayfinding assistance in minimally invasive surgery
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY
AB Purpose In the context of aviation and automotive navigation technology, assistance functions are associated with predictive planning and wayfinding tasks. In endoscopic minimally invasive surgery, however, assistance so far relies primarily on image-based localization and classification. We show that navigation workflows can be described and used for the prediction of navigation steps. Methods A natural description vocabulary for observable anatomical landmarks in endoscopic images was defined to create 3850 navigation workflow sentences from 22 annotated functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) recordings. Resulting FESS navigation workflows showed an imbalanced data distribution with over-represented landmarks in the ethmoidal sinus. A transformer model was trained to predict navigation sentences in sequence-to-sequence tasks. The training was performed with the Adam optimizer and label smoothing in a leave-one-out cross-validation study. The sentences were generated using an adapted beam search algorithm with exponential decay beam rescoring. The transformer model was compared to a standard encoder-decoder-model, as well as HMM and LSTM baseline models. Results The transformer model reached the highest prediction accuracy for navigation steps at 0.53, followed by 0.35 of the LSTM and 0.32 for the standard encoder-decoder-network. With an accuracy of sentence generation of 0.83, the prediction of navigation steps at sentence-level benefits from the additional semantic information. While standard class representation predictions suffer from an imbalanced data distribution, the attention mechanism also considered underrepresented classes reasonably well. Conclusion We implemented a natural language-based prediction method for sentence-level navigation steps in endoscopic surgery. The sentence-level prediction method showed a potential that word relations to navigation tasks can be learned and used for predicting future steps. Further studies are needed to investigate the functionality of path prediction. The prediction approach is a first step in the field of visuo-linguistic navigation assistance for endoscopic minimally invasive surgery.

TI An ecological approach to climate change-informed tree species selection
   for reforestation
SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB Accounting for climate change in reforestation practices has the potential to be one of the most efficacious adaptation strategies for maintaining future forest ecosystem services. There is a rich literature projecting spatial shifts in climatic suitability for tree species and strong scientific evidence for the necessity of assisted migration. However, there has been limited translation of this research into operational reforestation, due in part to mismatches to the information needs of practitioners. Here, we describe a practitioner-focused climate change informed tree species selection (CCISS) model to support reforestation decisions in British Columbia (BC). CCISS projects the climate change redistribution of bioclimate units from the multi-scaled Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification (BEC) system with machine-learning for 90 modelled futures. It leverages the reforestation knowledge from BEC to make site-specific species projections of reforestation feasibility with climate change uncertainty metrics. We present 21st-century feasibility projections for a comprehensive set of tree species native to western North America. Some general trends are evident: augmentation of the number of feasible species in sub-boreal regions due to the rapid expansion of feasibility for temperate species; attrition at low elevations in southern BC due to declines in the feasibility of native species with little compensation by non-native species; and turnover at mid-elevations as declining feasibility for subalpine species is compensated by uphill expansion of climatic feasibility for submontane species. Edaphic (soil) factors are important; feasibility declines are higher on relatively dry sites than on wetter sites for most species. Our analysis emphasizes that changes in feasibility are species-specific, spatially variable, and influenced by edaphic site factors. By employing the multi-scaled BEC system that currently informs operational reforestation, CCISS facilitates translation of research into actionable guidance for practitioners.

TI Automated Detection of Older Adults' Naturally-Occurring Compensatory
   Balance Reactions: Translation From Laboratory to Free-Living Conditions
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL ENGINEERING IN HEALTH AND MEDICINE
AB Objective: Older adults' falls are a critical public health problem. The majority of free-living fall risk assessment methods have investigated fall predictive power of step-related digital biomarkers extracted from wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) data. Alternatively, the examination of characteristics and frequency of naturally-occurring compensatory balance reactions (CBRs) may provide valuable information on older adults' propensity for falls. To address this, models to automatically detect naturally-occurring CBRs are needed. However, compared to steps, CBRs are rare events. Therefore, prolonged collection of criterion standard data (along with IMU data) is required to validate model's performance in free-living conditions. Methods: By investigating 11 fallers' and older non-fallers' free-living criterion standard data, 8 naturally-occurring CBRs, i.e., 7 trips (self-reported using a wrist-mounted voice-recorder) and 1 hit/bump (verified using egocentric vision data) were localized in the corresponding trunk-mounted IMU data. Random forest models were trained on independent/unseen datasets curated from multiple sources, including in-lab data captured using a perturbation treadmill. Subsequently, the models' translation/generalization to older adults' out-of-lab data were assessed. Results: A subset of models differentiated between naturally-occurring CBRs and free-living activities with high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (>= 99%). Conclusions: The findings suggest that accurate detection of naturally-occurring CBRs is feasible. Clinical/Translational Impact- As a multi-institutional validation study to detect older adults' naturally-occurring CBRs, suitability for larger-scale free-living studies to investigate falls etiology, and/or assess the effectiveness of perturbation training programs is discussed.

TI Displacement Imaging During Focused Ultrasound Median Nerve Modulation:
   A Preliminary Study in Human Pain Sensation Mitigation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ULTRASONICS FERROELECTRICS AND FREQUENCY CONTROL
AB Focused ultrasound (FUS)-based viscoelastic imaging techniques using high frame rate (HFR) ultrasound to track tissue displacement can be used for mechanistic monitoring of FUS neuromodulation. However, a majority of techniques avoid imaging during the active push transmit (interleaved or postpush acquisitions) to mitigate ultrasound interference, which leads to missing temporal information of ultrasound effects when FUS is being applied. Furthermore, critical for clinical translation, use of both axial steering and real-time (<1 s) capabilities for optimizing acoustic parameters for tissue engagement are largely missing. In this study, we describe a method of noninterleaved, single Vantage imaging displacement within an active FUS push with simultaneous axial steering and real-time capabilities using a single ultrasound acquisition machine. Results show that the pulse sequence can track micron-sized displacements using frame rates determined by the calculated time-of-flight (TOF), without interleaving the FUS pulses and imaging acquisition. Decimation by 3-7 frames increases signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by 15.09 +/- 7.03 dB. Benchmarking tests of CUDA-optimized code show increase in processing speed of 35- and 300-fold in comparison with MATLAB parallel processing GPU and CPU functions, respectively, and we can estimate displacement from steered push beams +/- 10 mm from the geometric focus. Preliminary validation of displacement imaging in humans shows that the same driving pressures led to variable nerve engagement, demonstrating important feedback to improve transducer coupling, FUS incident angle, and targeting. Regarding the use of our technique for neuromodulation, we found that FUS altered thermal perception of thermal pain by 0.9643 units of pain ratings in a single trial. Additionally, 5 mu m of nerve displacement was shown in on-target versus off-target sonications. The initial feasibility in healthy volunteers warrants further study for potential clinical translation of FUS for pain suppression.

TI Systematic Review of Plant Ribosome Heterogeneity and Specialization
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB Plants dedicate a high amount of energy and resources to the production of ribosomes. Historically, these multi-protein ribosome complexes have been considered static protein synthesis machines that are not subject to extensive regulation but only read mRNA and produce polypeptides accordingly. New and increasing evidence across various model organisms demonstrated the heterogeneous nature of ribosomes. This heterogeneity can constitute specialized ribosomes that regulate mRNA translation and control protein synthesis. A prominent example of ribosome heterogeneity is seen in the model plant,Arabidopsis thaliana, which, due to genome duplications, has multiple paralogs of each ribosomal protein (RP) gene. We support the notion of plant evolution directing high RP paralog divergence toward functional heterogeneity, underpinned in part by a vast resource of ribosome mutants that suggest specialization extends beyond the pleiotropic effects of single structural RPs or RP paralogs. Thus, Arabidopsis is a highly suitable model to study this phenomenon. Arabidopsis enables reverse genetics approaches that could provide evidence of ribosome specialization. In this review, we critically assess evidence of plant ribosome specialization and highlight steps along ribosome biogenesis in which heterogeneity may arise, filling the knowledge gaps in plant science by providing advanced insights from the human or yeast fields. We propose a data analysis pipeline that infers the heterogeneity of ribosome complexes and deviations from canonical structural compositions linked to stress events. This analysis pipeline can be extrapolated and enhanced by combination with other high-throughput methodologies, such as proteomics. Technologies, such as kinetic mass spectrometry and ribosome profiling, will be necessary to resolve the temporal and spatial aspects of translational regulation while the functional features of ribosomal subpopulations will become clear with the combination of reverse genetics and systems biology approaches.

TI The meniscofemoral ligament - Effect on cranio-caudal and rotatory
   laxity in the ovine stifle
SO VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ORTHOPAEDICS AND TRAUMATOLOGY
AB Purpose: A cadaveric study of ovine stifles was performed to examine the contribution of the meniscofemoral ligament to the cranio-caudal and internal-external rotatory laxity of this joint in sheep.
   Methods: Twenty ovine stifles were harvested, denuded of muscular attachments, and the femur and tibia fixed in hone pots. These were inserted into a four degree-of-freedom rig incorporated into a materials testing machine. Forces up to a maximum of 100 N were applied in the cranial and caudal directions, and the resultant translations and coupled rotations measured. Tibial internal and external rotations in response to a 6Nm torque were also measured. These parameters were assessed at 30, 60, 90 and 110 degrees of flexion in twenty intact stifles. In ten stifles a small posterior arthrotomy was used to divide the caudal cruciate ligament (CCL), followed by division of the meniscofemoral ligament (MFL). The sequence of division was reversed for a further ten stifles. The effects of each intervention on the above parameters were evaluated.
   Results: Division of the MFL resulted in an increase in caudal translation at all angles of flexion in both the intact and CCL deficient stifle. There was also an increase in internal rotation of the tibia after application of a 6Nm torque. This was significant at 30 and 110 degrees of flexion in the intact stifle and at all angles of flexion in the CCL-deficient stifle.
   Conclusions: These results indicate a secondary role for the MFL in the cranio-caudal and internal/external rotatory stability of the ovine stifle joint. This is the first study demonstrating a functional role for the MFL in any species, and may have a bearing on stifle injuries.

TI High-Performance Bidiagonal Reduction using Tile Algorithms on
   Homogeneous Multicore Architectures
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE
AB This article presents a new high-performance bidiagonal reduction (BRD) for homogeneous multicore architectures. This article is an extension of the high-performance tridiagonal reduction implemented by the same authors [Luszczek et al., IPDPS 2011] to the BRD case. The BRD is the first step toward computing the singular value decomposition of a matrix, which is one of the most important algorithms in numerical linear algebra due to its broad impact in computational science. The high performance of the BRD described in this article comes from the combination of four important features: (1) tile algorithms with tile data layout, which provide an efficient data representation in main memory; (2) a two-stage reduction approach that allows to cast most of the computation during the first stage (reduction to band form) into calls to Level 3 BLAS and reduces the memory traffic during the second stage (reduction from band to bidiagonal form) by using high-performance kernels optimized for cache reuse; (3) a data dependence translation layer that maps the general algorithm with column-major data layout into the tile data layout; and (4) a dynamic runtime system that efficiently schedules the newly implemented kernels across the processing units and ensures that the data dependencies are not violated. A detailed analysis is provided to understand the critical impact of the tile size on the total execution time, which also corresponds to the matrix bandwidth size after the reduction of the first stage. The performance results show a significant improvement over currently established alternatives. The new high-performance BRD achieves up to a 30-fold speedup on a 16-core Intel Xeon machine with a 12000x12000 matrix size against the state-of-the-art open source and commercial numerical software packages, namely LAPACK, compiled with optimized and multithreaded BLAS from MKL as well as Intel MKL version 10.2.

SP Appl Comp Secur Associates
AB Safe virtual execution (SVE) allows a host computer system to reduce the risks associated with running untrusted programs. SVE prevents untrusted programs from directly accessing system resources, thereby giving the host the ability to control how individual resources m I ay be used. SVE is used in a variety of safety-conscious software systems, including the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), software fault isolation (SFI), system call interposition layers, and execution monitors. While SVE is the conceptual foundation for these systems, each uses a different implementation technology. The lack of a unifying framework for building SVE systems results in a variety of problems: many useful SVE systems,are not portable and therefore are usable only on, a limited number of platforms; code reuse among,. different SVE systems is often difficult or impossible; and building SVE systems from scratch can be both time consuming and error prone.
   To address these concerns, we have developed a portable, extensible framework for constructing SVE systems. Our framework, called Strata, is based on software dynamic translation (SDT), a technique for modifying binary programs as they execute. Strata is designed to be ported easily to new platforms and to date has been targeted to SPARC/Solaris, x86/Linux, and MIPS/IRIX. This portability ensures that SVE applications implemented in Strata are available to a wide variety of host systems. Strata also affords the opportunity for code reuse among different SVE applications by establishing a common implementation framework.
   Strata implements a basic safe virtual execution engine using SDT The base functionality supplied by this engine is easily extended to implement specific SVE systems. In this paper we describe the organization of Strata and demonstrate its extension by building two SVE systems: system call interposition and stack-smashing prevention. To illustrate the use of the system call interposition extensions, the paper presents implementations of several useful security policies.

TI Reducing Arm Fatigue in Virtual Reality by Introducing 3D-Spatial Offset
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Arm fatigue is an important factor affecting user experience in Virtual Reality (VR). In this work, we have proposed ProxyHand and StickHand, virtual hand techniques to address this issue. Using ProxyHand or StickHand, users can flexibly adjust the 3D-spatial offset between the physical hand and its virtual representation. This will allow users to keep their arms in a comfortable posture (vertically down) even when they have to manipulate objects in locations that require lifting of arms using the default interaction method. Proposed ProxyHand and StickHand have a similar Underlying concept that is to introduce a 3D-spatial offset between the physical hand and its virtual representation in VR. However, they respond differently to the user's hand movements because of different working mechanisms. Question arises whether the 3D-spatial offset will negatively impact the hand control ability as the directness of interaction is being violated. To investigate this, we conducted user studies where users were asked to perform object translation, rotation and hybrid tasks. ProxyHand and StickHand are used in combination in some scenarios to maximize positive impact on the user experience in VR. This raises the question to find the best possible combination of these virtual hands to reduce arm fatigue. Firstly, for this purpose, we combined both virtual hands by manually allowing users to switch between ProxyHand and StickHand. Secondly, we used machine learning to automatically switch between both the virtual hands. Results showed that introduction of a 3D-spatial offset largely reduced the arm fatigue while offering equal performance to the default interaction method for all these tasks; translation, rotation and hybrid task. Users preferred using ProxyHand and StickHand to interact in the VR environment for longer periods of time.

AB In a workshop organized in December 2017 in Leiden, the Netherlands, a group of lawyers, computer scientists, artists, activists and social and cultural scientists collectively read a computer science paper about 'improving fairness'. This session was perceived by many participants as eye-opening on how different epistemologies shape approaches to the problem, method and solutions, thus enabling further cross-disciplinary discussions during the rest of the workshop. For many participants it was both refreshing and challenging, in equal measure, to understand how another discipline approached the problem of fairness. Now, as a follow-up we propose a translation tutorial that will engage participants at the FAT* conference in a similar exercise. We will invite participants to work in small groups reading excerpts of academic papers from different disciplinary perspectives on the same theme. We argue that most of us do not read outside our disciplines and thus are not familiar with how the same issues might be framed and addressed by our peers. Thus the purpose will be to have participants reflect on the different genealogies of knowledge in research, and how they erect walls, or generate opportunities for more productive inter-disciplinary work. We argue that addressing, through technical measures or otherwise, matters of ethics, bias and discrimination in AI/ML technologies in society is complicated by the different constructions of knowledge about what ethics (or bias or discrimination) means to different groups of practitioners. In the current academic structure, there are scarce resources to test, build on-or even discard-methods to talk across disciplinary lines. This tutorial is thus proposed to see if this particular method might work.

TI The digital humanities and re-imagined language description: A
   linguistic model of Malay with potential for other languages
SO DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP IN THE HUMANITIES
AB The declaration of 2019 as the International Year of Indigenous Languages raised the question how it will be possible in practice for hitherto uninvestigated languages to be investigated at all. The suggestion put forward in this article is that traditional language description reimagined in the context of the Digital Humanities has the capacity to create models, which can be re-used mutatis mutandis for other languages. The methodology makes use of MaLex, which is a collection of procedures and datasets designed for Malay in the first instance, but with the potential to be modified for other languages. MaLex is placed in its historical context within the Humanities, and digital procedures are explicitly connected to traditional scholarship. The use of digital methods creates new opportunities to scale up practical linguistic analysis using large datasets. MaLex procedures include a stemmer, a tagger, a parser, and a spelling-to-phoneme algorithm, and make a rough English translation of Malay text. MaLex simulates the approach of the practical linguist analysing a new language, and as new components are added, they are made to integrate with existing components, so that MaLex works like a single machine, drawing on an integrated infrastructure.

TI An ensemble model for classifying idioms and literal texts using BERT

SO INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT
AB An idiom is a common phrase that means something other than its literal meaning. Detecting idioms automatically is a serious challenge in natural language processing (NLP) domain appli-cations like information retrieval (IR), machine translation and chatbot. Automatic detection of Idioms plays an important role in all these applications. A fundamental NLP task is text classi-fication, which categorizes text into structured categories known as text labeling or categoriza-tion. This paper deals with idiom identification as a text classification task. Pre-trained deep learning models have been used for several text classification tasks; though models like BERT and RoBERTa have not been exclusively used for idiom and literal classification. We propose a pre-dictive ensemble model to classify idioms and literals using BERT and RoBERTa, fine-tuned with the TroFi dataset. The model is tested with a newly created in house dataset of idioms and literal expressions, numbering 1470 in all, and annotated by domain experts. Our model outperforms the baseline models in terms of the metrics considered, such as F-score and accuracy, with a 2% improvement in accuracy.

TI Deep Feature Fusion Model for Sentence Semantic Matching
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Sentence semantic matching (SSM) is a fundamental research in solving natural language processing tasks such as question answering and machine translation. The latest SSM research benefits from deep learning techniques by incorporating attention mechanism to semantically match given sentences. However, how to fully capture the semantic context without losing significant features for sentence encoding is still a challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a deep feature fusion model and integrate it into the most popular deep learning architecture for sentence matching task. The integrated architecture mainly consists of embedding layer, deep feature fusion layer, matching layer and prediction layer. In addition, we also compare the commonly used loss function, and propose a novel hybrid loss function integrating MSE and cross entropy together, considering confidence interval and threshold setting to preserve the indistinguishable instances in training process. To evaluate our model performance, we experiment on two real world public data sets: LCQMC and Quora. The experiment results demonstrate that our model outperforms the most existing advanced deep learning models for sentence matching, benefited from our enhanced loss function and deep feature fusion model for capturing semantic context.

AB Nowadays, it is very common for one person to be in different social networks. Linking identical users across different social networks, also known as the User Identity Linkage (UIL) problem, is fundamental for many applications. There are two major challenges in the UIL problem. First, it's extremely expensive to collect manually linked user pairs as training data. Second, the user attributes in different networks are usually defined and formatted very differently which makes attribute alignment very hard. In this paper we propose CoLink, a general unsupervised framework for the UIL problem. Col,ink employs a co-training algorithm, which manipulates two independent models, the attribute-based model and the relationship-based model, and makes them reinforce each other iteratively in an unsupervised way. We also propose the sequence-to-sequence learning as a very effective implementation of the attribute-based model, which can well handle the challenge of the attribute alignment by treating it as a machine translation problem. We apply CoLink to a UIL task of mapping the employees in an enterprise network to their LinkedIn profiles. The experiment results show that CoLink generally outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches by an F1 increase over 20%.

Existing methods focus on learning image-tag correlation or correlation between tags to improve annotation accuracy. However, most of these methods evaluate their performance using top-k retrieval performance, where k is fixed. Although such setting gives convenience for comparing different methods, it is not the natural way that humans annotate images. The number of annotated tags should depend on image contents. Inspired by the recent progress in machine translation and image captioning, we propose a novel Recurrent Image Annotator (RLA) model that forms image annotation task as a sequence generation problem so that RIA can natively predict the proper length of tags according to image contents. We evaluate the proposed model on various image annotation datasets. In addition to comparing our model with existing methods using the conventional top-k evaluation measures, we also provide our model as a high quality baseline for the arbitrary length image tagging task. Moreover, the results of our experiments show that the order of tags in training phase has a great impact on the final annotation performance.

AB Segmentation of fetal organs such as head, femur, and humerus on ultrasound image is one of the challenges in realization of automated system for fetal biometry measurements. Although many methods have been developed to overcome this problem, most of them are generally specific to one organ of the body alone. The research in this paper will focus on a machine learning method that has been available before: multilayer super pixel classification using random forest. The focus of this study is to improve the accuracy by exploring compactness parameter in the formation of super-pixels. In addition, we also add moment image features such as translation, rotation, and scale invariant to improve the segmentation performance. The experimental results showed that the difference in compactness parameters will provide different result for the accuracy, F1-score, recall, and specificity. The addition of moment features can also improve the performance of image segmentation of fetal organs even though increase was not significant. Fetal head segmentation using proposed method has higher F1-score and specificity, but lower accuracy and recall compared to previous methods. Whereas fetal femur and humerus segmentation using proposed method has higher accuracy, F1-score, recall and specificity compared to previous method.

TI Designing the Space of Linguistic Knowledge: A Typographic Analysis of
   Sixteenth-Century Dictionaries
SO LIBRARY TRENDS
AB Scrutinizing the ways in which early printed reference works were designed is a way of bringing typography and book history into the domain of library and information science. The core subject of this discipline is the concept of user-oriented organization of knowledge; it has a close connection to information-seeking behavior and retrieval. By studying the typographic arrangement of knowledge in early printed reference works, one can approach the history of the storage, organization, and retrieval of scientific information. The article discusses the typographic "architecture" of the dictionaries published by the Antwerp printer Christophe Plantin and, more specifically, the three dictionaries of the Dutch language compiled by Plantin's learned proofreader Cornelis Kiliaan (ca. 1530-1607). Kiliaan was one of the first authors to introduce etymology and comparative linguistics into his dictionaries. By analyzing the typographic macrostructures and microstructures of his works, it is possible to discover the lines along which they developed-in the words of Paul Valery-into machines a savoir. The article also compares Plantin's dictionaries with the international benchmark for lexicographic publishing in the Renaissance world, viz, the translation dictionaries compiled and printed by the Parisian publisher Robert Estienne.

TI Morphological decomposition in Arabic ASR systems
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB In recent years, the use of morphological decomposition strategies for Arabic Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has become increasingly popular. Systems trained on morphologically decomposed data are often used in combination with standard word-based approaches. and they have been found to yield consistent performance improvements. The present article contributes to this ongoing research endeavour by exploring the use of the 'Morphological Analysis and Disambiguation for Arabic' (MADA) tools for this purpose. System integration issues concerning language modelling and dictionary construction, as well as the estimation of pronunciation probabilities, are discussed. In particular, a novel solution for morpheme-to-word conversion is presented which makes use of an N-gram Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) approach. System performance is investigated within a multi-pass adaptation/combination framework. All the systems described in this paper are evaluated on an Arabic large vocabulary speech recognition task which includes both Broadcast News and Broadcast Conversation test data. It is shown that the use of MADA-based systems, in combination with word-based systems, can reduce the Word Error Rates by up to 8.1% relative. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although transistor scaling keeps following Moore's law, and more area is available for designers, the clock frequency and ILP rate do not present the same level of growth anymore. This way, new architectural alternatives are necessary. Reconfigurable fabric appears to be one emerging possibility: besides exploiting the parallelism among instructions, it can also accelerate sequences of data dependent ones. However, reconfiguration wide spread usage is still withheld by the need of special tools and compilers, which clearly do not sustain the reuse of legacy code without any kind of modification. Based on all these facts, this work proposes it new Binary Translation algorithm, implemented in hardware and working in parallel to the processor, responsible for transforming sequences of instructions at run-time to be executed on a dynamic coarse-grain reconfigurable array, tightly coupled to a traditional RISC machine. Therefore, we can take advantage of using pure combinational logic to optimize even control-flow oriented code in a totally transparent process, without any modification in the source code or binary. Using the Simplescalar Toolset together with the MIBench embedded benchmark suite, we show performance improvements and area evaluation when comparing against a traditional superscalar architecture.

AB Knowledge based systems usually rely on large size domain models needed to support reasoning and decision-making. The development of realistic models represents a critical and labour intensive phase. Automatic terminology acquisition (TA) has been proposed as the task of automatically extracting specialized dictionaries from raw texts useful for application purposes like precise information retrieval and machine translation. In this paper we argue that TA provides a significant contribution in the development of ontological components of a knowledge bases. We therefore propose an automatic knowledge acquisition architecture for the TA process based on robust methods for text processing and on algorithms for learning decision trees. An incremental semiautomatic approach is proposed to enable the first steps in the development of a domain ontology. The novel aspects of the method rely on the use of syntagmatic and lexical properties of terms combined with analogous (negative) evidences observable for non-terms. The underlying assumptions as well as the different adopted linguistic representations have been extensively investigated over a large test set. The scale of the target test data provides empirical evidence of the superiority of the method over more quantitative approaches. The proposed architecture is thus a viable approach to the development of conceptual domain dictionaries.

TI Coordinate Matching of Multiple Points Based on Constant Cross Ratio
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB Orthogonal beam splitting imaging system has essential applications in dynamic pose measurement. Fast and effective matching of the feature points' coordinates of the target to be tested is the key to achieving dynamic measurement. Traditional coordinate matching methods have problems, such as slow speed and large dynamic error. Therefore, this study proposes multiple points' coordinate matching algorithm based on the cross-ratio invariability among feature points. According to the imaging feature of the orthogonal beam splitting imaging system, considering the cross-ratio invariabilities and sequence in projective transformation as constraints for coordinate matching, a collinear multi-point cooperative target was designed to complete the matching of image coordinates and object points. The possible overlap of coordinates during pose measurement was also discussed. The experimental results show that the coordinate matching time for per frame of the proposed method is only 3 ms. The error of the rotation matrix of the proposed method combined with optimal solution to the perspective-n-point problem method does not exceed 6 degrees, furthermore, the error of the translation vector does not exceed 1. 4%, which can be applied in rapid pose measurement.

AB The motivation for this paper is to present a way to verify if an utterance within a corpus is pronounced at a fast or slow pace. An alternative method to the well-known Word-Per-Minute (wpm) method for cases where this approach is not applicable. For long segmentations, such as the full introduction section of a speech or presentation, the measurement of wpm is a viable option. For short comparisons of the same single word or multiple syllables, Syllables-Per-Second (sps) is also a viable option. However, when there are multiple short utterances that are frequent in task oriented dialogues or natural free flowing conversation, such as those of the direct Human-to-Human dialogues of the HCRC Map Task corpus or the computer mediated inter-lingual dialogues of the ILMT-s2s corpus, it becomes difficult to obtain a meaningful value for the utterance speech rate. In this paper we explain the method used to provide a alternative speech rate value to the utterance of the ILMT-s2s corpus and the HCRC Map Task corpus.

TI An emerging role for the ribosome as a nexus for post-translational
   modifications
SO CURRENT OPINION IN CELL BIOLOGY
AB The ribosome is one of life's most ancient molecular machines that has historically been viewed as a backstage participant in gene regulation, translating the genetic code across all kingdoms of life in a rote-like fashion. However, recent studies suggest that intrinsic components of the ribosome can be regulated and diversified as a means to intricately control the expression of the cellular proteome. In this review, we discuss advances in the characterization of ribosome post-translational modifications (PTMs) from past to present. We specifically focus on emerging examples of ribosome phosphorylation and ubiquitylation, which are beginning to showcase that PTMs of the ribosome are versatile, may have functional consequences for translational control, and are intimately linked to human disease. We further highlight the key questions that remain to be addressed to gain a more complete picture of the array of ribosome PTMs and the upstream enzymes that control them, which may endow ribosomes with greater regulatory potential in gene regulation and control of cellular homeostasis.

AB We discuss how to obtain information of execution characteristics, such as parallelizability and memory utilization, with the final aim to improve the performance and predictability of feature and corner detection algorithms for use in e.g. robotics and autonomous machines. Our aim is to obtain a better understanding of how computer vision algorithms use hardware resources and how to improve the time predictability and execution time of such algorithms when executing on multi-core CPUs. We evaluate a fork-join model applicable to feature detection algorithms and present a method for measuring how well the algorithm performance correlates with hardware resource usage. We have applied our method to the Featured from Accelerated Segment Test (FAST) algorithm. Our characterization of FAST reveals that it is an algorithm with excellent parallelism opportunities, resulting in an almost linear speed-up per core. Our measurements also reveal that the performance of FAST correlates very little with the number number of misses in the Ll data cache, Ll instruction cache, data translation lookaside buffer and L2 cache. Thus, the FAST algorithm will not have a negative effect on the execution time when the input data fits in the L2 cache.

AB Using image capturing techniques, numerical calculations, and laser measurements, an optical measurement system for welding location and distance was constructed to replace the current need to rely on human judgment. This system combines an optical measurement system, a clamping workbench for workpieces, and a device with two sets of welding guns equipped with two planar biaxial translation devices, each consisting of two screws and step motors. Two set clamping mechanisms on the arm are used to fix the laser range finders and image capturing devices. In this study, the image measurement system responsible for obtaining the location and distance for the welding bead is a laser range finder, which integrates position information to determine the location of the welding torch. All of the movement information is eventually sent to the controller to adjust the welding gun and cooperate with the cylinder holder platform for the automatic welding process, providing significantly improved production efficiency. Additionally, this system is functionally able to measure lines, outer and inner circles, angles, distances, and relative heights, and can send the data to the torch to carry out the welding process.

AB The need to exchange large amounts of information in all fields especially in the automotive one, with minimal space requirements, weight, complexity of conjunction and cost, perform the development of several automotive networks such as Local Interconnect Network (LIN), Controller Area Network (CAN), Time Triggered Protocol (CAN) and FlexRay. The CAN is currently the most used, but it has many limits. It is not strictly deterministic and it is not the ideal protocol for application that needs high degree of safety. These drawbacks have been the starting points for the development of the FlexRay protocol which is more efficient than CAN protocol. We adopted a new way to achieve the design and the implementation of the FlexRay Controller which consists of the translation of the (Specification and Description Language) SDL diagrams into StateFlow diagrams. With these diagrams, we generate the VHDL code of the controller which will be implemented in an FPGA to create the hardware chip for FlexRay. We had used ModelSim to verify the correctness of the designed blocks. We give in this paper the adopted procedure for the Macrotick block Generation and its verification by ModelSim.

AB Gray-code is a well-known binary number system where neighboring values differ in one digit only. Tsuiki (2002) has introduced Gray code to the field of real number computation. He assigns to each number a unique 1 perpendicular to-sequence, i.e., an infinite sequence of {-1, 1, perpendicular to} containing at most one copy of perpendicular to (meaning undefinedness). In this paper we take a logical and constructive approach to study real number computation based on Gray-code. Instead of Tsuiki's indeterministic multihead Type-2 machine, we use pre-Gray code, which is a representation of Gray-code as a sequence of constructors, to avoid the difficulty due to perpendicular to which prevents sequential access to a stream. We extract real number algorithms from proofs in an appropriate formal theory involving inductive and coinductive definitions. Examples are algorithms transforming pre-Gray code into signed digit code of real numbers, and conversely, the average for pre-Gray code and a translation of finite segments of pre-Gray code into its normal form. These examples are formalized in the proof assistant Minlog.

TI Semi-automatic porting of a large-scale Fortran CFD code to GPUs
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN FLUIDS
AB The development of automatic techniques to port a substantial portion of FEFLO, a general-purpose legacy CFD code operating on unstructured grids, to run on GPUs is described. FEFLO is a typical adaptive, edge-based finite element code for the solution of compressible and incompressible flows, which is primarily written in Fortran 77 and has previously been ported to vector, shared memory parallel and distributed memory parallel machines. Owing to the large size of FEFLO and the likelihood of human error in porting, as well as the desire for continued development within a single codebase, a specialized Python script, based on FParser (Int. J. Comput. Sci. Eng. 2009; 4:296305), was written to perform automated translation from the OpenMP-parallelized edge and point loops to GPU kernels implemented in CUDA, along with GPU memory management. The results of verification benchmarks and performance indicate that performances achieved by such a translator can rival those of codes rewritten by specialists. The approach should be of general interest, as how best to run on GPUs is being presently considered for many so-called legacy codes. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Brain-computer interfaces: military, neurosurgical, and ethical
   perspective
SO NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS
AB Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are devices that acquire and transform neural signals into actions intended by the user. These devices have been a rapidly developing area of research over the past 2 decades, and the military has made significant contributions to these efforts. Presently, BCIs can provide humans with rudimentary control over computer systems and robotic devices. Continued advances in BCI technology are especially pertinent in the military setting, given the potential for therapeutic applications to restore function after combat injury, and for the evolving use of BCI devices in military operations and performance enhancement. Neurosurgeons will play a central role in the further development and implementation of BCIs, but they will also have to navigate important ethical questions in the translation of this highly promising technology. In the following commentary the authors discuss realistic expectations for BCI use in the military and underscore the intersection of the neurosurgeon's civic and clinical duty to care for those who serve their country.

AB We describe the design, implementation, and use of a machine-certified framework for correct compilation and execution of programs in garbage-collected languages. Our framework extends Leroy's Coq-certified Compcert compiler and Cminor intermediate language. We add: (i) a new intermediate language, GCminor, that includes primitives for allocating memory in a garbage-collected heap and for specifying GC roots; (ii) a precise, low-level specification for a Cminor library for garbage collection; and (iii) a proven semantics-preserving translation from GCminor to Cminor plus the GC library. GCminor neatly encapsulates the interface between mutator and collector code, while remaining simple and flexible enough to be used with a wide variety of source languages and collector styles. Front ends targeting GCminor can be implemented using any compiler technology and any desired degree of verification, including full semantics preservation, type preservation, or informal trust.
   As an example application of our framework, we describe a compiler for Haskell that translates the Glasgow Haskell Compiler's Core intermediate language to GCminor. To support a simple but useful memory safety argument for this compiler, the front end uses a novel combination of type preservation and runtime checks, which is of independent interest.

TI A new experimental test apparatus for angle binder draw bead simulations
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
AB A novel device for obtaining pulling and holding forces for draw bead tooling on inclined binder surfaces has been developed. A mechanical design featuring two load cells. a male-female draw bead set, translation and rotation degrees of freedom, and a screw-driven clamping system has been incorporated into a standard tensile test machine. On a real time basis, pulling force, holding force, and draw-in displacement are downloaded directly into a PC for data processing. Results for the sheet metal materials considered confirm quantitatively that the binder angle significantly influences the draw bead pulling force. For example, for the materials, bead penetrations. and bead geometries studied. the pulling force at a 20 degrees binder angle ranged from 55% to 96% of that corresponding to a 0 degrees binder angle. The pulling force data are useful for the purpose of theoretical and numerical draw bead model calibration. The proposed experimental system, called the Oakland University Angle Draw Bead Simulation (OU-ADBS) test, represents a significant breakthrough in draw bead simulation technology due to its relatively low cost and clever design.

TI A Relation Extraction Method of Chinese Named Entities Based on Location

AB Named Entity Relations are a foundation of semantic networks, ontology and the semantic Web, and are widely used in information retrieval and machine translation, as well as automatic question and answering systems. Relation feature selection and extraction are two key issues. The location features possess excellent computability and operability, and the semantic features have strong intelligibility and reality. Currently, relation extraction of Chinese named entities mainly adopts the Vector Space Model (VSM) or a traditional semantic computing method, and these two methods use either the location features or the semantic features only, resulting in unsatisfactory extraction. To improve the extraction results, we propose a method that combines the information gain of the positions of words and the semantic computing based on HowNet to extract Chinese named entity relations, and present a relation extraction method of Chinese named entities, called LSE, which is scalable, semi-supervised and domain independent. Extensive experiments have been performed to show that our approach is superior, with an F-score of 0.881, which is at least 0.115 better than existing extraction methods that use either the location features or the semantic features.

AB English-language policies about the desired behavior of computer systems often suffer from translation errors when implemented with a proliferation of low-level rules governing access control, resource allocation and configuration. To solve this, Dynamic Policy Enforcement systems replace these low-level rules with a relatively small number of semantically grounded, machine-understandable policy statements. These statements use domain terms defined in an ontology that are formally defined so that they can be enforced by the system but also meaningful to human administrators to ensure that they accurately represent organizational policies. In this paper, we describe the application of one such Dynamic Policy Enforcement system, KAoS, to the control of distributed, information-management services defined by the Air Force Research Laboratory's Joint Battlespace Infosphere (JBI) program. Our research allows administrators to define the desired behavior of the participants in the system, both human and software, with one collection of well defined policies. As a result, a single set of tools for the definition, analysis, control, and monitoring of policy can be used to implement access control, service configuration, and service delivery prioritization.

TI AN EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF ELASTIC-PLASTIC BEHAVIOR OF A FIBROUS
   BORON ALUMINUM COMPOSITE .1. MATRIX-DOMINATED MODE
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY
AB Initial and subsequent yield surfaces, and plastic strains in a unidirectionally reinforced boron-6061-O aluminum composite were found experimentally for various monotonic and cyclic loading sequences in plane stress. An axially reinforced thin-walled tube was instrumented and loaded in an MTS servo hydraulic testing machine under incrementally applied monotonic and cyclic stress paths. The results confirm the connections previously established between matrix and composite hardening. Kinematic translation of the composite yield surfaces and bimodal plasticity dominate the behavior. Changes in the size of the overall yield surface were also found; these are believed to be caused, in part, by age hardening of the aluminum matrix. New results are reported for plastic strain magnitudes and directions in several loading sequences, at different loading rates. The measurements indicate that the direction of the plastic strain vector is not normal to the experimentally detected yield surface. However, related modeling in an earlier paper showed that the plastic strain vectors are contained within the cone of normals at each loading point. The effect of loading rate appears to be significant only at very low rates.

AB Deep learning researchers have a keen interest in proposing new novel activation functions that can boost neural network performance. A good choice of activation function can have a significant effect on improving network performance and training dynamics. Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is a popular hand-designed activation function and is the most common choice in the deep learning community due to its simplicity though ReLU has some drawbacks. In this paper, we have proposed two new novel activation functions based on approximation of the maximum function, and we call these functions Smooth Maximum Unit (SMU and SMU-1). We show that SMU and SMU-1 can smoothly approximate ReLU, Leaky ReLU, or more general Maxout family, and GELU is a particular case of SMU. Replacing ReLU by SMU, Top-1 classification accuracy improves by 6.22%, 3.39%, 3.51%, and 3.08% on the CIFAR100 dataset with ShuffleNet V2, PreActResNet-50, ResNet-50, and SeNet-50 models respectively. Also, our experimental evaluation shows that SMU and SMU-1 improve network performance in a variety of deep learning tasks like image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and machine translation compared to widely used activation functions.

TI Paving the Way for Future EEG Studies in Construction: Dependent
   Component Analysis for Automatic Ocular Artifact Removal from Brainwave
   Signals
SO JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT
AB Construction workers' poor mental states can lead to numerous safety and productivity issues. One major trend in construction research is quantitatively evaluating workers' psychophysiological states. With the advances in wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) devices, such assessment can be possible by interpreting workers' brainwave patterns. However, the recorded EEG signals are highly contaminated with signal noises, particularly ocular-related artifacts generated from blinking and eye movement. Although most of the noise can be suppressed by well-established filtering techniques, ocular artifacts cannot be eliminated easily and automatically by conventional techniques. To overcome this challenge, this study proposes a procedure to reduce ocular artifacts by integrating dependence component analysis, image processing, and machine learning algorithms. The results demonstrated the potential of the proposed procedure to produce high-quality EEG signals accurately, continuously, and automatically during construction operations. The findings contribute to the body of knowledge by overcoming the barriers to reliable translation of EEG signals in numerous construction-related investigations, especially those that add substantially to the understanding of the effect of workplace stressors on workers' health and safety.

SO ENERGIES
AB Energy disaggregation, known in the literature as Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), is the task of inferring the power demand of the individual appliances given the aggregate power demand recorded by a single smart meter which monitors multiple appliances. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network that combines a regression subnetwork with a classification subnetwork for solving the NILM problem. Specifically, we improve the generalization capability of the overall architecture by including an encoder-decoder with a tailored attention mechanism in the regression subnetwork. The attention mechanism is inspired by the temporal attention that has been successfully applied in neural machine translation, text summarization, and speech recognition. The experiments conducted on two publicly available datasets-REDD and UK-DALE-show that our proposed deep neural network outperforms the state-of-the-art in all the considered experimental conditions. We also show that modeling attention translates into the network's ability to correctly detect the turning on or off an appliance and to locate signal sections with high power consumption, which are of extreme interest in the field of energy disaggregation.

AB Diacritic restoration is a challenging problem in natural language processing (NLP). With diacritic restoration, one can text faster and easier. Diacritic restoration is also helpful in making use of diacritic-missing texts, which are normally discarded in many NLP applications. This paper deals with the diacritic restoration problem for Vietnamese text. Three state-of-the-art deep learning models including Gated Recurrent Unit, Bidirectional Long-short Term Memory and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit have been examined for the problem and the last one turned out to be the best among them. Besides deep learning models, it was found in this paper that word tokenization, which is the final pre-processing step applied on the data before feeding it to deep learning models also have influences on the final accuracy. Between two examined word tokenization methods: morpheme-based tokenization and phrase-based tokenization, the former yield better results regardless of the applied deep learning models. The experimental results show that the combination of morpheme-based tokenization and Bidirectional-GRU achieve the best performance of diacritic restoration with the Bleu-score of 88.06%.

   learning of task-oriented dialogue system
SO SPEECH COMMUNICATION
AB Building dialogue systems plays an important role in modern life. amongst them, task-oriented dialogue for resolving problems in actual life is most worth exploring. Motivated by the development of end-to-end approaches, a task-oriented dialogue model based on bidirectional LSTM and self-attention mechanism is proposed. It not only makes good use of context and effectively solves the long-term dependency, but also identifies the relationship between sentences, optimizes feature vectors, and has good parallelism. In our method, the dialogue state tracker(DST) is firstly improved. Our dialogue state tracker can identify the multiple slot key-value pairs involved in the utterance without manual label. In addition, we apply the data augmentation of merging machine translation and bilingual dictionary to create more diversified data sets. Finally, in the experimental part, the enhanced data and the results of DST are fed into the proposed B&Anet (bidirectional long and short memory network and self-attention mechanism network) model. The evaluation results on DSTC2 (dialogue state tracking chanllenge2) show that our method achieves competitive performance.

   camera relocalization from a single RGB image
SO COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING
AB Camera relocalization refers to the problematic of the camera pose estimation including 3D translation and 3D rotation expressed in the world coordinate system with no temporal constraint. Camera relocalization is necessary in localization systems. However, it is still challenging to have both a real-time and accurate method. In this paper, we introduce our data-oriented hybrid method merging both machine learning and geometric approaches for fast and accurate camera relocalization from a single RGB image. We propose an efficient multi-output deep-forest regression based on a sparse feature detection, that uses a whole learned feature vector at each split function to improve the accuracy of 2D-3D point correspondences. Especially, multiple coordinate regression of our deep-forest allows to deal with ambiguous repetitive structure. The learned feature extraction is able to be pre-trained and reused for different scenes. The use of sparse feature detection reduces processing time and increases accuracy of predictions. Finally, we show favorable results in terms of accuracy and computational time compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Representing words as vectors which encode their semantic properties is an important component in natural language processing. Recent advances in distributional semantics have led to the rise of neural network-based models that use unsupervised learning to represent words as dense, distributed vectors, called 'word embeddings'. These embeddings have led to breakthroughs in performance in multiple natural language processing applications, and also hold the key to improving natural language processing for low-resource languages by helping machine learning algorithms learn patterns more easily from these richer representations of words, thereby allowing better generalization from less data. In this paper, we train the skip-gram model on more than 140 million Urdu words to create the first large-scale word embeddings for the Urdu language. We analyze the quality of the learned embeddings by looking at the closest neighbours to different words in the vector space and find that they capture a high degree of syntactic and semantic similarity between words. We evaluate this quantitatively by experimenting with different vector dimensionalities and context window sizes and measuring their performance on Urdu translations of standard word similarity tasks. The embeddings are made freely available in order to advance research on Urdu language processing.

AB Sequence to Sequence models have shown a lot of promise for dealing with problems such as Neural Machine Translation (NMT), Text Summarization, Paraphrase Generation etc. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) work well with large and labeled training sets but in sequence-to-sequence problems, mapping becomes a much harder task due to the differences in syntax, semantics and length. Moreover usage of DNNs is constrained by the fixed dimensionality of the input and output, which is not the case with most of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems. Our primary focus was to build transliteration systems for Indian languages. In the case of Indian languages, monolingual corpora are abundantly available but a parallel one which can be directly applied to transliteration problem is scarce. With the available parallel corpus, we could only build weak models. We propose a system to leverage the mono-lingual corpus to generate a clean and quality parallel corpus for transliteration, which is then iteratively used to tune the existing weak transliteration models. The results that we got prove our hypothesis that the process of generation of clean data can be validated objectively by evaluating the models alongside the efficiency of the system to generate data in each iteration.

AB Because of some reasons such as machining error and assembly clearance, the loading device will produce kinematic error during movement. While kinematic error will have a great significance on the position accuracy of the loading device. For the above reasons, firstly, the topological structure of the loading device was described based on lower body arrays. The kinematic error matrices of adjacent parts in the loading device were obtained by multi-body system kinematic theory and homogeneous translation matrix (HTM). Then an improved error modeling method was put forward, which combined mult-ibody system theory with stream of variation theory. And the kinematic error model of the loading device was set up with this method. Numerical results could clearly display the error transformation and propagation among components. Finally, the effect of every kinematic error on final deviation was analyzed, and error sources of a greater effect on the final deviation were obtained. This method can provide a theoretical basis to improve the accuracy of the loading device.

In particular, ncRNA-protein interactions play an important role in post-transcriptional gene regulation like mRNA localization, mRNA stabilization, poly-adenylation, splicing and translation. The experimental methods to solve RNA-protein interaction prediction problem remain expensive and time-consuming. Here, we present the RPI-Pred (RNA-protein interaction predictor), a new support-vector machine-based method, to predict protein-RNA interaction pairs, based on both the sequences and structures. The results show that RPI-Pred can correctly predict RNA-protein interaction pairs with & SIM;94% prediction accuracy when using sequence and experimentally determined protein and RNA structures, and with & SIM;83% when using sequences and predicted protein and RNA structures. Further, our proposed method RPI-Pred was superior to other existing ones by predicting more experimentally validated ncRNA-protein interaction pairs from different organisms. Motivated by the improved performance of RPI-Pred, we further applied our method for reliable construction of ncRNA-protein interaction networks. The RPI-Pred is publicly available at:

AB Transliteration converts words in a source language (e.g., English) into phonetically equivalent words in a target language (e.g., Vietnamese). This conversion needs to take into account phonology of the target language, which are rules determining how phonemes can be organized. For example, a transliterated word in Vietnamese that begins with a consonant cluster is phonologically invalid. While statistical transliteration approaches have been widely adopted, most do not explicitly model the target language's phonology, and thus produce invalid outputs. The problem is compounded for low-resource languages where training data is scarce. In this work, we present a phonology-augmented statistical framework suitable for languages with minimal linguistic resources. We propose the concept of pseudo-syllables as structures representing how segments of a foreign word are arranged according to the target language's phonology. We use Vietnamese, a tonal language with monosyllabic structure as an example. We show that the proposed system outperforms the statistical baseline by up to 70.3% relative, when there are limited training examples (94 word pairs). We also investigate the trade-off between training corpus size and transliteration performance of different methods on two distinct corpora.

A high precision three-axis translation stage moves the probe stylus, and the position of the stage is determined by three mutually orthogonal plane mirror laser interferometer transducers. The coordinates indicated by the probe are compared with the coordinates indicated by the interferometers and the errors of the probe are then calculated. The working volume of the calibrator is 100 x 100 x 100 mu m. The measurement strategy and design considerations are discussed, and results are given to demonstrate its performance.

TI Unveiling the relationship between complex networks metrics and word
   senses
SO EPL
AB The automatic disambiguation of word senses (i.e., the identification of which of the meanings is used in a given context for a word that has multiple meanings) is essential for such applications as machine translation and information retrieval, and represents a key step for developing the so-called Semantic Web. Humans disambiguate words in a straightforward fashion, but this does not apply to computers. In this paper we address the problem of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) by treating texts as complex networks, and show that word senses can be distinguished upon characterizing the local structure around ambiguous words. Our goal was not to obtain the best possible disambiguation system, but we nevertheless found that in half of the cases our approach outperforms traditional shallow methods. We show that the hierarchical connectivity and clustering of words are usually the most relevant features for WSD. The results reported here shed light on the relationship between semantic and structural parameters of complex networks. They also indicate that when combined with traditional techniques the complex network approach may be useful to enhance the discrimination of senses in large texts. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2012

AB In an influential paper titled "The Benefits of Relaxing Punctuality" [2], Alur Feder and Henzinger introduced Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) as a fragment of the real-time logic Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) in which exact or punctual timing constraints are banned. Their main result showed that model checking and satisfiability for MITL are both EXPSPACE-Complete..
   Until recently, it was widely believed that admitting even the simplest punctual specifications in any linear-time temporal logic would automatically lead to undecidability. Although this was recently disproved, until now no punctual fragment of MTL was known to have even primitive recursive complexity (with certain decidable fragments having provably non-primitive recursive complexity).
   In this paper we identify a 'co-flat' subset of MTL that is capable of expressing a large class of punctual specifications and for which model checking (although not satisfiability) has no complexity cost over MITL Our logic is moreover qualitatively different from MITL in that it can express properties that are not timed-regular Correspondingly, our decision procedures do not involve translating formulas into finite-state automata, but rather into certain kinds of reversal-bounded Turing machines. Using this translation we show that the model checking problem for our logic is EXPSPACE- Complete.

TI SIT: A Spatial Interaction-Aware Transformer-Based Model for Freeway
   Trajectory Prediction
SO ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
AB Trajectory prediction is one of the core functions of autonomous driving. Modeling spatial-aware interactions and temporal motion patterns for observed vehicles are critical for accurate trajectory prediction. Most recent works on trajectory prediction utilize recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model temporal patterns and usually need convolutional neural networks (CNNs) additionally to capture spatial interactions. Although Transformer, a multi-head attention-based network, has shown its notable ability in many sequence-modeling tasks (e.g., machine translation in natural language processing), it has not been explored much in trajectory prediction. This paper presents a Spatial Interaction-aware Transformer-based model, which uses the multi-head self-attention mechanism to capture both interactions of neighbor vehicles and temporal dependencies of trajectories. This model applies a GRU-based encoder-decoder module to make the prediction. Besides, different from methods considering the spatial interactions only among observed trajectories in both encoding and decoding stages, our model will also consider the potential spatial interactions between future trajectories in decoding. The proposed model was evaluated on the NGSIM dataset. Compared with other baselines, our model exhibited better prediction precision, especially for long-term prediction.

TI A decade: Review of scene text detection methods
SO COMPUTER SCIENCE REVIEW
AB The rapid development of scene text detection shows us the need for text recognition in a scene image. Road signs recognition, reading the scene image for machine translation, text recognition on commercial products, billboards, and vehicle plates are examples of text recognition on natural images. This review discussed the related research of scene text detection in the last ten years. We analysed the past strategies in scene text detection, the strengths and the weaknesses of each method. Additionally, we showed the relationship between text detection methods before and after using deep learning. Scene text detection has evolved to detect horizontal text, multi-orientation, multilingual, curved text, and arbitrary-shaped text. Researchers have proposed various methods to address this need. We evaluate the capability of the proposed framework based on the testing results of several representative benchmark datasets. This review aims to obtain opportunities or proposals to improve the existing accuracy, speed, or generalization cases (the various condition of the text appearances). We present future trends for scene text detection research to complete the review. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Improving the Performance of an Associative Classifier in the Context of
   Class-Imbalanced Classification
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Class imbalance remains an open problem in pattern recognition, machine learning, and related fields. Many of the state-of-the-art classification algorithms tend to classify all unbalanced dataset patterns by assigning them to a majority class, thus failing to correctly classify a minority class. Associative memories are models used for pattern recall; however, they can also be employed for pattern classification. In this paper, a novel method for improving the classification performance of a hybrid associative classifier with translation (better known by its acronym in Spanish, CHAT) is presented. The extreme center points (ECP) method modifies the CHAT algorithm by exploring alternative vectors in a hyperspace for translating the training data, which is an inherent step of the original algorithm. We demonstrate the importance of our proposal by applying it to imbalanced datasets and comparing the performance to well-known classifiers by means of the balanced accuracy. The proposed method not only enhances the performance of the original CHAT algorithm, but it also outperforms state-of-the-art classifiers in four of the twelve analyzed datasets, making it a suitable algorithm for classification in imbalanced class scenarios.

AB As the largest professional network, LinkedIn hosts millions of user profiles and job postings. Users effectively find what they need by entering search queries. However, finding what they are looking for can be a challenge, especially if they are unfamiliar with specific keywords from their industry. Query Suggestion is a popular feature where a search engine can suggest alternate, related queries. At LinkedIn, we have productionized a deep learning Seq2Seq model to transform an input query into several alternatives. This model is trained by examining search history directly typed by users. Once online, we can determine whether or not users clicked on suggested queries. This new feedback data indicates which suggestions caught the user's attention. In this work, we propose training a model with both the search history and user feedback datasets. We examine several ways to incorporate feedback without any architectural change, including adding a novel pairwise ranking loss term during training. The proposed new training technique produces the best combined score out of several alternatives in offline metrics. Deployed in the LinkedIn search engine, it significantly outperforms the control model with respect to key business metrics.

AB Epigraphic Documents are the ancient handwritten text documents inscribed on stone, metals, wood and shell. They are the most authentic, solitary and unique documented evidences available for the study of ancient history. In the recent years, Archeological Departments worldwide have taken up the massive initiative of converting their repository of ancient Epigraphic Documents into digital libraries for the perennial purpose of their preservation and easy dissemination. The visual quality of the digitized Epigraphic Document images is poor as they are captured from sources that would have suffered from various kinds of degradations like aging, depositions and risky handling. Enhancement of these images is an essential prerequisite to make them suitable for automatic character recognition and machine translation. A new approach for enhancement of Epigraphic Document images using Retinex method is presented in this paper. This method enhances the visual clarity of the degraded images by highlighting the foreground text and suppressing the background noise. The method has been tested on digitized estampages of ancient stone inscriptions of 11th century written in old Kannada language. The results achieved are efficient in terms of root mean square contrast and standard deviation.

AB Processing sequential data of variable length is a major challenge in a wide range of applications, such as speech recognition, language modeling, generative image modeling and machine translation. Here, we address this challenge by proposing a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, the Fast-Slow RNN (FS-RNN). The FS-RNN incorporates the strengths of both multiscale RNNs and deep transition RNNs as it processes sequential data on different timescales and learns complex transition functions from one time step to the next. We evaluate the FS-RNN on two character level language modeling data sets, Penn Treebank and Hutter Prize Wikipedia, where we improve state of the art results to 1.1 9 and 1.2 5 bits-per-character (BPC), respectively. In addition, an ensemble of two FS-RNNs achieves 1.20 BPC on Hutter Prize Wikipedia outperforming the best known compression algorithm with respect to the BPC measure. We also present an empirical investigation of the learning and network dynamics of the FS-RNN, which explains the improved performance compared to other RNN architectures. Our approach is general as any kind of RNN cell is a possible building block for the FS-RNN architecture, and thus can be flexibly applied to different tasks.

AB Voice-based human-machine interface has become a prevalent feature for modern intelligent vehicles, especially in navigation and infotainment applications. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) converts spoken audio streams to plain texts, but a follow-up Natural Language Processing (NLP) sub-system is needed to understand the contextual meaning from the text and act. For the specific human-vehicle navigation dialogue application, the two major tasks include (1) intent detection - decide whether a sentence is navigation-related, and (2) semantic parsing - retrieve important information (e.g., point-of-interest destinations) from the words. To address these two tasks, this study proposes a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture, with the consideration of (1) one joint model vs. two separate models, (2) a context window approach vs. sequence-to-sequence translation approach, as well as (3) alternate model hyper-parameter selections. The experiment is conducted with both the benchmark ATIS dataset and the CU-Move in-vehicle dialogue corpus, and the result is compared against related state-of-the-art methods. Overall, the proposed solution on the CU-Move data achieves accuracies of 98.24% for intent detection and 99.60% for semantic parsing, outperforming other related methods.

AB We consider the problem of building high-level, class-specific feature detectors from only unlabeled data. For example, is it possible to learn a face detector using only unlabeled images? To answer this, we train a deep sparse autoencoder on a large dataset of images (the model has 1 billion connections, the dataset has 10 million 200x200 pixel images downloaded from the Internet). We train this network using model parallelism and asynchronous SGD on a cluster with 1,000 machines (16,000 cores) for three days. Contrary to what appears to be a widely-held intuition, our experimental results reveal that it is possible to train a face detector without having to label images as containing a face or not. Control experiments show that this feature detector is robust not only to translation but also to scaling and out-of-plane rotation. We also find that the same network is sensitive to other high-level concepts such as cat faces and human bodies. Starting from these learned features, we trained our network to recognize 22,000 object categories from ImageNet and achieve a leap of 70% relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art.

TI Equivariant Wavelets: Fast Rotation and Translation Invariant Wavelet
   Scattering Transforms
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Wavelet scattering networks, which are convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with fixed filters and weights, are promising tools for image analysis. Imposing symmetry on image statistics can improve human interpretability, aid in generalization, and provide dimension reduction. In this work, we introduce a fast-to-compute, translationally invariant and rotationally equivariant wavelet scattering network (EqWS) and filter bank of wavelets (triglets). We demonstrate the interpretability and quantify the invariance/equivariance of the coefficients, briefly commenting on difficulties with implementing scale equivariance. On MNIST, we show that training on a rotationally invariant reduction of the coefficients maintains rotational invariance when generalized to test data and visualize residual symmetry breaking terms. Rotation equivariance is leveraged to estimate the rotation angle of digits and reconstruct the full rotation dependence of each coefficient from a single angle. We benchmark EqWS with linear classifiers on EMNIST and CIFAR-10/100, introducing a new second-order, cross-color channel coupling for the color images. We conclude by comparing the performance of an isotropic reduction of the scattering coefficients and RWST, a previous coefficient reduction, on an isotropic classification of magnetohydrodynamic simulations with astrophysical relevance.

AB General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an important framework for data protection that applies to all European Union countries. Recently, DAPRECO knowledge base (KB) which is a repository of if-then rules written in LegalRuleML as a formal logic representation of GDPR has been introduced to assist compliance checking. DAPRECO KB is, however, constructed manually and the current version does not cover all the articles in GDPR. Looking for an automated method, we present our machine translation approach to obtain a semantic parser translating the regulations in GDPR to their logic representation on DAPRECO KB. We also propose a new version of GDPR Semantic Parsing data by splitting each complex regulation into simple subparagraph-like units and re-annotating them based on published data from DAPRECO project. Besides, to improve the performance of our semantic parser, we propose two mechanisms: Sub-expression intersection and PRESEG. The former deals with the problem of duplicate sub-expressions while the latter distills knowledge from pre-trained language model BERT. Using these mechanisms, our semantic parser obtained a performance of 60.49% F1 in sub-expression level, which outperforms the baseline model by 5.68%.

CT International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)
CY JUL 18-24, 2021
CL ELECTR NETWORK
AB This paper proposes Omnidirectional Representations from Transformers (OmNINET). In OmniNet, instead of maintaining a strictly horizontal receptive field, each token is allowed to attend to all tokens in the entire network. This process can also be interpreted as a form of extreme or intensive attention mechanism that has the receptive field of the entire width and depth of the network. To this end, the omnidirectional attention is learned via a meta-learner, which is essentially another self-attention based model. In order to mitigate the computationally expensive costs of full receptive field attention, we leverage efficient self-attention models such as kernel-based (Choromanski et al., 2020), low-rank attention (Wang et al., 2020) and/or Big Bird (Zaheer et al., 2020) as the meta-learner. Extensive experiments are conducted on autoregressive language modeling (LM1B, C4), Machine Translation, Long Range Arena (LRA), and Image Recognition. The experiments show that OmniNet achieves considerable improvements across these tasks, including achieving state-of-the-art performance on LM1B, WMT' 14 En-De/En-Fr, and Long Range Arena. Moreover, using omnidirectional representation in Vision Transformers leads to significant improvements on image recognition tasks on both few-shot learning and fine-tuning setups.

AB Autoregressive convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely exploited for sequence generation tasks such as audio synthesis, language modeling and neural machine translation. WaveNet is a deep autoregressive CNN composed of several stacked layers of dilated convolution that is used for sequence generation. While WaveNet produces state-of-the art audio generation results, the naive inference implementation is quite slow; it takes a few minutes to generate just one second of audio on a high-end GPU. In this work, we develop the first accelerator platform FastWave for autoregressive convolutional neural networks, and address the associated design challenges. We design the Fast-Wavenet inference model in Vivado HLS and perform a wide range of optimizations including fixed-point implementation, array partitioning and pipelining. Our model uses a fully parameterized parallel architecture for fast matrix-vector multiplication that enables per-layer customized latency fine-tuning for further throughput improvement.

AB We propose a hardware-based solution for performing real-time workload forensics that enables identification of a process while it is being executed. More specifically, we divide execution flow of a process into consecutive frames and we extract descriptive features related to the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) utilization profile for each such frame. These features are then processed through trained machine learning models to analyze program behavior and identify workload at the granularity of a process. Unlike previous research on workload forensics that performs ex post facto analysis based on the complete process execution profile, this method continuously analyzes the segmented workload execution flow; thus, it does not require knowledge of process creation, switch, and termination timestamps. Furthermore, as compared with software-based workload forensics solutions, whose data logging mechanism may be compromised by software attacks, the proposed hardware-based logging mechanism does not rely on services from the operating system (OS) or high-level applications and is, therefore, inherently immune to software tampering. The proposed workload forensics method was evaluated using a Linux OS loaded on Spike, an open-source RISC-V simulator. Experimental results using the Mibench benchmark suite indicate an overall identification accuracy of 98.9% with practicable logging overhead.

TI Control Strategy for Switched Reluctance Motor Based on Embedded System
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS
AB Mechatronics systems are are complex interdisciplinary products where many parts are present that overlap each other; electronic control board, electromechanical machines, and power drives. With FP GAs, their control can Tim faster as multiple operations are executed in parallel. A simulation tool that facilitates the direct translation into hardware of mechatronic control algorithms is desirable. The Xilinx System Generator (XSG), a high level tool for designing high-performance DSP systems under Simulink. In this paper such tool is exercised to implement a control mechanism for speed control of switched reluctance motor (SRM) with torque ripple reduction employing a heuristic approach of ant colony algorithm. The control scheme consists of proportional-integral (PI) speed controller in the outer loop and hysteresis controller in the inner loop along with control of turn on and turn off angles for the 3 phase, 6/4 switched reluctance motor. The efficiency of proposed technique is evaluated through simulative results that show proposed approach's performances in terms of ripples, stator current harmonics waves and short time design.

AB Rigid motions are fundamental operations in image processing. While bijective and isometric in R-3, they lose these properties when digitized in Z(3). To understand how the digitization of 3D rigid motions affects the topology and geometry of a chosen image patch, we classify the rigid motions according to their effect on the image patch. This classification can be described by an arrangement of hypersurfaces in the parameter space of 3D rigid motions of dimension six. However, its high dimensionality and the existence of degenerate cases make a direct application of classical techniques, such as cylindrical algebraic decomposition or critical point method, difficult. We show that this problem can be first reduced to computing sample points in an arrangement of quadrics in the 3D parameter space of rotations. Then we recover information about remaining three parameters of translation. We implemented an ad-hoc variant of state-of-the-art algorithms and applied it to an image patch of cardinality 7. This leads to an arrangement of 81 quadrics and we recovered the classification in less than one hour on a machine equipped with 40 cores.

TI Human Activity-understanding: A Multilayer Approach Combining Body
   Movements and Contextual Descriptors Analysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED ROBOTIC SYSTEMS
AB A deep understanding of human activity is key to successful human-robot interaction (HRI). The translation of sensed human behavioural signals/cues and context descriptors into an encoded human activity remains a challenge because of the complex nature of human actions. In this paper, we propose a multilayer framework for the understanding of human activity to be implemented in a mobile robot. It consists of a perception layer which exploits a D-RGB-based skeleton tracking output used to simulate a physical model of virtual human dynamics in order to compensate for the inaccuracy and inconsistency of the raw data. A multi-support vector machine (MSVM) model trained with features describing the human motor coordination through temporal segments in combination with environment descriptors (object affordance) is used to recognize each sub-activity (classification layer). The interpretation of sequences of classified elementary actions is based on discrete hidden Markov models (DHMMs) (interpretation layer). The framework assessment was performed on the Cornell Activity Dataset (CAD-120) [1]. The performances of our method are comparable with those presented in [2] and clearly show the relevance of this model-based approach.

AB Textual Entailment Recognition (RTE) consists in detecting inference relationships between natural language sentences. It has a wide range of applications such as machine translation, question answering or text summarization. Significant interest has been brought to RTE with several challenges. However, most of current approaches are dedicated to open domains. The major challenge facing RTE in specialized domains is the lack of relevant training corpora and resources. In this paper we present an automatic corpus construction approach for RTE in the medical domain. We also quantify the impact of using (open-)domain RDF datasets on supervised learning based RTE. We evaluate the relevance of our corpus construction method by comparing the results obtained by an efficient memory based learning algorithm on PASCAL RTE corpora and on our automatically constructed corpus. The results show an accuracy increase of +6 to +28% and an improvement of +8 to +23% in terms of F-measure. We also found that semantic annotations from large open-domain datasets increased F1 score by 6%, while smaller medical RDF datasets actually decreased the overall performance. We discuss these findings and give some pointers to future investigations.

AB We present a generalization of the Koenderink-van Doorn (KvD) algorithm that allows robust monocular localization with large motion between the camera frames for a wide range of optical systems including omnidirectional systems and standard perspective cameras. The KvD algorithm estimates simultaneously ego-motion parameters, i.e. rotation, translation, and object distances in an iterative way. However due to the linearization of the rotational component of optic flow, the original algorithm fails for larger rotations. We present a generalization of the algorithm to arbitrary rotations that is especially suited for omnidirectional cameras where features can be tracked for long sequences. This reduces the need for vector summation of several individual motion estimates that leads to accumulation of odometry errors.
   The significant improvement in the performance of the proposed generalized algorithm compared to the original KvD implementation is validated using simulated data. The algorithm is also tested in a real-world experiment with ground-truth data obtained from an external tracking system. The experiment was carried out using a novel compact omnidirectional camera that is designed for small aerial vehicles. It consists of an off-the-shelf webcam that is combined with a reflective surface machined into acrylic glass.

TI Automatic Acquisition of Context-Specific Lexical Paraphrases
SO 20TH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
CT 20th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence
CY JAN 06-12, 2007
CL Hyderabad, INDIA
AB Lexical paraphrasing aims at acquiring word-level paraphrases. It is critical for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, such as Question Answering (QA), Information Extraction (IE), and Machine Translation (MT). Since the meaning and usage of a word can vary in distinct contexts, different paraphrases should be acquired according to the contexts. However, most of the existing researches focus on constructing paraphrase corpora, in which little contextual constraints for paraphrase application are imposed. This paper presents a method that automatically acquires context-specific lexical paraphrases. In this method, the obtained paraphrases of a word depend on the specific sentence the word occurs in. Two stages are included, i.e. candidate paraphrase extraction and paraphrase validation, both of which are mainly based on web mining. Evaluations are conducted on a news title corpus and the presented method is compared with a paraphrasing method that exploits a Chinese thesaurus of synonyms - Tongyi Cilin (Extended) (CilinE for short). Results show that the f-measure of our method (0.4852) is significantly higher than that using CilinE (0.1127). In addition, over 85% of the correct paraphrases derived by our method cannot be found in CilinE, which suggests that our method is effective in acquiring out-of-thesaurus paraphrases.

TI Automating data collection methods in electronic health record systems:

SO HEALTH SYSTEMS
AB Social Determinant of Health (SDOH) data are important targets for research and innovation in Health Information Systems (HIS). The ways we envision SDOH in "smart" information systems will play a considerable role in shaping future population health landscapes. Current methods for data collection can capture wide ranges of SDOH factors, in standardised and nonstandardised formats, from both primary and secondary sources. Advances in automating data linkage and text classification show particular promise for enhancing SDOH in HIS. One challenge is that social communication processes embedded in data collection are directly related to the inequalities that HIS attempt to measure and redress. To advance equity, it is imperative thatcare-providers, researchers, technicians, and administrators attend to power dynamics in HIS standards and practices. We recommend: 1. Investing in interdisciplinary and intersectoral knowledge generation and translation. 2. Developing novel methods for data discovery, linkage and analysis through participatory research. 3. Channelling information into upstream evidence-informed policy.

SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
AB The current wave of deep learning (the hyper-vitamined return of artificial neural networks) applies not only to traditional statistical machine learning tasks: prediction and classification (e.g., for weather prediction and pattern recognition), but has already conquered other areas, such as translation. A growing area of application is the generation of creative content, notably the case of music, the topic of this article. The motivation is in using the capacity of modern deep learning techniques to automatically learn musical styles from arbitrary musical corpora and then to generate musical samples from the estimated distribution, with some degree of control over the generation. This article provides a tutorial on music generation based on deep learning techniques. After a short introduction to the topic illustrated by a recent example, the article analyzes some early works from the late 1980s using artificial neural networks for music generation and how their pioneering contributions foreshadowed current techniques. Then, we introduce some conceptual framework to analyze various concepts and dimensions involved. Various examples of recent systems are introduced and analyzed to illustrate the variety of concerns and of techniques.

TI Cross-Section Bead Image Prediction in Laser Keyhole Welding of AISI
   1020 Steel Using Deep Learning Architectures
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB A deep learning model was applied for predicting a cross-sectional bead image from laser welding process parameters. The proposed model consists of two successive generators. The first generator produces a weld bead segmentation map from laser intensity and interaction time, which is subsequently translated into an optical microscopic (OM) image by the second generator. Both generators exhibit an encoder-decoder structure based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). In the second generator, a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) was additionally employed with multiscale discriminators and residual blocks, considering the size of the OM image. For a training dataset, laser welding experiments with AISI 1020 steel were conducted on a large process window using a 2 KW fiber laser, and a total of 39 process conditions were used for the training. High-resolution OM images were successfully generated, and the predicted bead shapes were reasonably accurate (R-Squared: 89.0% for penetration depth, 93.6% for weld bead area).

AB Transformer, a state-of-the-art neural network architecture, has been used successfully for different sequence-to-sequence transformation tasks. This model architecture disperses the attention distribution over entire input to learn long-term dependencies, which is important for some sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as neural machine translation and text summarization. However, automatic speech recognition (ASR) has a characteristic to have monotonic alignment between text output and speech input. Techniques like Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), RNN Transducer (RNN-T) and Recurrent Neural Aligner (RNA) build on top of this monotonic alignment and use local encoded speech representations for corresponding token prediction. In this paper, we present an effective cross attention biasing technique in transformer that takes monotonic alignment between text output and speech input into consideration by making use of cross attention weights. Specifically, a Gaussian mask is applied on cross attention weights to limit the input speech context range locally given alignment information. We further introduce a regularizer for alignment regularization. Experiments on LibriSpeech dataset find that our proposed model can obtain improved output-input alignment for ASR, and yields 14.5%-25.0% relative word error rate (WER) reductions.

TI R3DG features: Relative 3D geometry-based skeletal representations for
   human action recognition
SO COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING
AB Recently introduced cost-effective depth sensors coupled with real-time skeleton extraction algorithms have generated a renewed interest in skeleton-based human action recognition. Most of the existing skeleton-based approaches use either the joint locations or the joint angles to represent the human skeleton. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a new family of skeletal representations for human action recognition, which we refer to as R3DG features. The proposed representations explicitly model the 3D geometric relationships between various body parts using rigid body transformations, i.e., rotations and translations in 3D space. Using the proposed skeletal representations, human actions are modeled as curves in R3DG feature spaces. Finally, we perform action recognition by classifying these curves using a combination of dynamic time warping, Fourier temporal pyramid representation and support vector machines. Experimental results on five benchmark action datasets show that the proposed representations perform better than many existing skeletal representations. The proposed approach also outperforms various state-of-the-art skeleton-based human action recognition approaches. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Data resources in natural language processing (NLP) are mainly two kinds in terms of dictionaries and corpora. Their quality plays a crucial role in the quality and performance improvement of NLP tasks and systems. Indeed, the quality of NLP systems such as machine translation (MT) systems, search engines, text analyzing systems, etc., depends very much on the quality of data resources serving them Boitet (Revue francaise de linguistique appliquee XII:25-38, 2007 [1]). A data resource in NLP is evaluated good quality if it contains not only good data quality, but also various domains and numerous language pairs. Therefore, apart from the data quality factor, other factors regarding volume, covered domains and number of language pairs are also very important for the data resources in NLP. In this paper, we focus on proposing solutions to unify existing data resources in NLP for creating larger ones with a common structure and format, containing various domains and numerous language pairs. The results of the experiments are encouraging as we've created a very large corpus unified from many given corpora.

SO LITERARY AND LINGUISTIC COMPUTING
AB One of the major challenges in the process of machine translation is word sense disambiguation (WSD), which is defined as choosing the correct meaning of a multi-meaning word in a text. Supervised learning methods are usually used to solve this problem. The disambiguation task is performed using the statistics of the translated documents (as training data) or dual corpora of source and target languages. In this article, we present a supervised learning method for WSD, which is based on K-nearest neighbor algorithm. As the first step, we extract two sets of features: the set of words that have occurred frequently in the text and the set of words surrounding the ambiguous word. In order to improve the classification accuracy, we perform a feature selection process and then propose a feature weighting strategy to tune the classifier. In order to show that the proposed schemes are not language dependent, we apply the suggested schemes to two sets of data, i.e. English and Persian corpora. The evaluation results show that the feature selection and feature weighting strategies have a significant effect on the accuracy of the classification system. The results are also encouraging compared with the state of the art.

TI A BLOCK ORGANIZED MODEL BUILDER
SO MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING
AB A new language has been developed for defining simulation models for biomedical science and implemented as a preprocessor for SCoP (Simulation Control Program) written by the National Biomedical Simulation Resource. The preprocessor creates a C program by translation of statements in a model definition file. The language defines variables and equations in labelled blocks of statements which are either mathematical equations or English phrases. The availability of several kinds of equation definition blocks simplifies the description of the corresponding classes of equations. Sub-blocks are provided for some special operations, such as logical tests. Algebraic logical operators are included. Special statements called directives instruct the preprocessor to create specific variables or generate code to call specific numerical methods routines from SCoP's library. Models may be decomposed into sub-models stored on separate model definition files and automatically assembled by the preprocessor in hierarchical fashion. The model description language has been implemented in the C language by generating machine independent code with the Unix lex and yacc programs. An example of the use of the model description language, including hierarchical assembly, is illustrated by a model of the human ovulatory cycle.

   Coherence Tomography
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMOPHYSICS
AB Photo-thermal optical coherence tomography (PT-OCT) is a functional extension of conventional OCT with the ability to generate maps of light absorption co-registered with the micron resolution structural tomograms of OCT. Potentially, signal analysis of such light absorption maps can be used to obtain refined depth-resolved insight into the chemical composition of tissue. Such analysis, however, is complex because the underlying physics of PT-OCT is multifactorial. That is, aside from tissue chemical composition, optical, thermal, and mechanical properties of tissue affect PT-OCT signals; certain system/instrumentation parameters also influence PT-OCT signals. As such, obtaining refined depth-resolved insight into tissue chemical composition requires in-depth understanding of the interplay between sample and system parameters and the induced signals. Moreover, translation of PT-OCT to clinics requires introduction of new experimentation strategies for enhancing the detection specificity and imaging speed of PT-OCT. In this review paper, we present and discuss our recent works aimed at addressing the above theoretical and technological challenges.

AB Four-bar mechanisms are widespread in industrial and quotidian applications, but their design requires deep knowledge and experience in Mechanisms and Machine Theory. In this area, path synthesis is a common problem. It consists in calculating the length of the bars defining a mechanism so that a particular point of its structure follows the desired trajectory. This paper presents SALAR Mechanism Synthesizer, a new open-source software package that aims to be an easy-to-use yet powerful tool for addressing this kind of problem. This tool offers four different optimizers from the literature, one of them specially designed for mechanism synthesis. It also includes a new method for expressing and comparing paths, and hence, to define the optimization criterion. This method, referred to as normalized shape-descriptor vector(s) (NSDV(s)) and presented in this paper, allows us to handle paths without being affected by translation, rotation, and scale changes. The software package has been used for addressing six well-known problems from the literature. According to the results achieved, it arises as a valuable tool in terms of accuracy, convenience, and availability.

TI Translational AI and Deep Learning in Diagnostic Pathology
SO FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB There has been an exponential growth in the application of AI in health and in pathology. This is resulting in the innovation of deep learning technologies that are specifically aimed at cellular imaging and practical applications that could transform diagnostic pathology. This paper reviews the different approaches to deep learning in pathology, the public grand challenges that have driven this innovation and a range of emerging applications in pathology. The translation of AI into clinical practice will require applications to be embedded seamlessly within digital pathology workflows, driving an integrated approach to diagnostics and providing pathologists with new tools that accelerate workflow and improve diagnostic consistency and reduce errors. The clearance of digital pathology for primary diagnosis in the US by some manufacturers provides the platform on which to deliver practical AI. AI and computational pathology will continue to mature as researchers, clinicians, industry, regulatory organizations and patient advocacy groups work together to innovate and deliver new technologies to health care providers: technologies which are better, faster, cheaper, more precise, and safe.

AB How to generate relevant and informative response is one of the core topics in response generation area. Following the task formulation of neural machine translation, previous works mainly consider response generation task as a mapping from a source sentence to a et sentence. However, the dialogue model tends to generate safe, commonplace responses (e.g., I dont know) regardless of the input, when learning to maximize the likelihood of response for the given message in an almost loss-less manner just like MT. Different from existing works, we propose a Global-Local Selective Encoding model (GLSE) to extend the seq2seq framework to generate more relevant and informative responses. Specifically, two types of selective gate network are introduced in this work: (i) A local selective word-sentence gate is added after encoding phase of Seq2Seq learning framework, which learns to tailor the original message information and generates a selected input representation. (ii) A global selective bidirectional-context gate is set to control the bidirectional information flow from a BiGRU based encoder to decoder. Empirical studies indicate the advantage of our model over several classical and strong baselines.

TI Labelled network subgraphs reveal stylistic subtleties in written texts
SO JOURNAL OF COMPLEX NETWORKS
AB The vast amount of data and increase of computational capacity have allowed the analysis of texts from several perspectives, including the representation of texts as complex networks. Nodes of the network represent the words, and edges represent some relationship, usually word co-occurrence. Even though networked representations have been applied to study some tasks, such approaches are not usually combined with traditional models relying upon statistical paradigms. Because networked models are able to grasp textual patterns, we devised a hybrid classifier, called labelled subgraphs, that combines the frequency of common words with small structures found in the topology of the network. Our approach is illustrated in two contexts, authorship attribution and translationese identification. In the former, a set of novels written by different authors is analysed. To identify translationese, texts from the Canadian Hansard and the European Parliament were classified as to original and translated instances. Our results suggest that labelled subgraphs are able to represent texts and it should be further explored in other tasks, such as the analysis of text complexity, language proficiency and machine translation.

TI Calibration and accuracy analysis of robotic belt grinding system using
   the ruby probe and criteria sphere
SO ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING
AB Calibration in the robotic belt grinding of complex blades is considered as one of the key bottlenecks of measurement accuracy. To enhance the accuracy of robotic calibration system, an improved method is proposed in this paper to calibrate the tool (grinding machine) frame and workpiece (aero-engine blade) frame by holding the ruby probe as the main calibration tool. Firstly, the sphere-to-sphere method replacing the traditional point-to-point method is put forward to calibrate the flexible and fixed probe frame. Secondly, the calibrated flexible and fixed probe frame is employed to precisely seek the origin point of tool frame and then to calibrate it accurately. Thirdly, both the rough calibration (manual calibration) and fine calibration (auto calibration) are adopted to calibrate the workpiece frame, the resulting translation and rotation errors are controlled at small values to improve the calibration accuracy. Finally, a typical case on robotic belt grinding of aero-engine blade is conducted to validate the calibration results of the robotic belt grinding system (RBGS). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recurrent neural network architectures combining with attention mechanism, or neural attention model, have shown promising performance recently for the tasks including speech recognition, image caption generation, visual question answering and machine translation. In this paper, neural attention model is applied on two sequence labeling tasks, dialogue act detection and key term extraction. In the sequence labeling tasks, the model input is a sequence, and the output is the label of the input sequence. The major difficulty of sequence labeling is that when the input sequence is long, it can include many noisy or irrelevant part. If the information in the whole sequence is treated equally, the noisy or irrelevant part may degrade the classification performance. The attention mechanism is helpful for sequence classification task because it is capable of highlighting important part among the entire sequence for the classification task. The experimental results show that with the attention mechanism, discernible improvements were achieved in the sequence labeling task considered here. The roles of the attention mechanism in the tasks are further analyzed and visualized in this paper.

TI The core promoter: At the heart of gene expression
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENE REGULATORY MECHANISMS
AB The identities of different cells and tissues in multicellular organisms are determined by tightly controlled transcriptional programs that enable accurate gene expression. The mechanisms that regulate gene expression comprise diverse multiplayer molecular circuits of multiple dedicated components. The RNA polymerase II (Pol II) core promoter establishes the center of this spatiotemporally orchestrated molecular machine. Here, we discuss transcription initiation, diversity in core promoter composition, interactions of the basal transcription machinery with the core promoter, enhancer-promoter specificity, core promoter-preferential activation, enhancer RNAs, Pol II pausing, transcription termination, Pol II recycling and translation. We further discuss recent findings indicating that promoters and enhancers share similar features and may not substantially differ from each other, as previously assumed. Taken together, we review a broad spectrum of studies that highlight the importance of the core promoter and its pivotal role in the regulation of metazoan gene expression and suggest future research directions and challenges.

TI GeoSegmenter: A statistically learned Chinese word segmenter for the
   geoscience domain
SO COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
AB Unlike English, the Chinese language has no space between words. Segmenting texts into words, known as the Chinese word segmentation (CWS) problem, thus becomes a fundamental issue for processing Chinese documents and the first step in many text mining applications, including information retrieval, machine translation and knowledge acquisition. However, for the geoscience subject domain, the CWS problem remains unsolved. Although a generic segmenter can be applied to process geoscience documents, they lack the domain specific knowledge and consequently their segmentation accuracy drops dramatically.
   This motivated us to develop a segmenter specifically for the geoscience subject domain: the GeoSegmenter. We first proposed a generic two-step framework for domain specific CWS. Following this framework, we built GeoSegmenter using conditional random fields, a principled statistical framework for sequence learning. Specifically, GeoSegmenter first identifies general terms by using a generic baseline segmenter. Then it recognises geoscience terms by learning and applying a model that can transform the initial segmentation into the goal segmentation. Empirical experimental results on geoscience documents and benchmark datasets showed that GeoSegmenter could effectively recognise both geoscience terms and general terms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Convergence of nanotechnology with radiation therapy-insights and

SO TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
AB Improvements in accuracy and efficacy in treating tumors with radiation therapy (RT) over the years have been fueled by parallel technological and conceptual advances in imaging and image-guidance techniques, radiation treatment machines, computational methods, and the understanding of the biology of tumor response to RT. Recent advances in our understanding of the hallmarks of cancer and the emergence of strategies to combat these traits of cancer have resulted in an expanding repertoire of targeted therapeutics, many of which can be exploited for enhancing the efficacy of RT. Complementing this advent of new treatment options is the evolution of our knowledge of the interaction between nanoscale materials and human tissues (nanomedicine). As with the changes in RT paradigms when the field has encountered newer and maturing disciplines, the incorporation of nanotechnology innovations into radiation oncology has the potential to refine or redefine its principles and revolutionize its practice. This review provides a summary of the principles, applications, challenges and outlook for the use of metallic nanoparticles in RT.

AB The major challenge for the semiconductor industry is to design devices in short time with complex logical functionality. At the very top of the list of challenges to be solved is verification. The goal of the verification is to ensure that the design meets the logical functional requirements as defined in the logical functional specification. Verification of the devices takes 40 to 70 per cent of the total development effort for the design. The increasing complexity of hardware designs raises the need for the development of new techniques and methodologies that can provide the verification team with the means to achieve its goals quickly and with limited resources.
   We present a framework that enables verification test generation using circuit model presented in VHDL hardware description language. The framework consists of several tools. We use the third party tool VSYML for VHDL description translation. Our tool then extracts finite state machine (FSM) model from translated VHDL description. The goal of the model is to use it for verification test generation. We introduce our software tool and algorithm, as well. The experimental results are presented for the benchmark suite ITC'99. The obtained results demonstrated the viability of the framework.

SP Yokohama Natl Univ
AB The WWW Consortium (W3C) has recently presented a working draft of XQuery, which is intended to serve as standardized query language for XML. XQuery and other high-level query languages for XML documents are not yet implemented by commercial products. Yet many browsers have already built-in XSLT support for transforming XML documents. XSLT is a standard way of performing structural rearrangement or presentational transformation of XML documents, but formulating complex queries is, compared to XQuery, difficult and error-prone. If XQuery expressions could be translated into XSLT (e.g. by a translator written in Java or XSLT itself), the benefits of XQuery would be immediately available to a wide range of commercial products. This paper introduces a process for translating queries formulated in XQuery syntax into XSL stylesheets. The process is described independently from a particular implementation by means of an ASM (Abstract State Machine). The ASM traverses the parse tree of a particular query and translates each node into corresponding XSLT commands. The result of this translation process is an XSL stylesheet that can be applied to an XML document in order to perform the given query. The presented ASM can be easily coded in Java or XSLT to implement a prototype XQ2XSL translator.

SO COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN
AB We introduce a fabrication method of doubly-curved shell structures by CFRP with control over fiber directions. Doubly-curved surfaces are tessellated into structured quadrilateral patches according to the purpose of use. One can design the tessellation in the parameter space, and map it to the 3D parametric surface, or use the orthogonal net of curves on surfaces such as lines of curvature, principal stretch lines, and principal stress lines. These patches, which we call generalized principal patches, are flattened onto a plane, and connected one by one by aligning the equi-length adjacent edges using translations and rotations forming generalized principal strips. Carbon fiber tows are placed onto these strips with one stroke by tailored fiber placement embroidery machines so that the fibers are not disconnected within strips. Preforms are stacked layer by layer into a mold of particular parts, and VaRTM or L-RTM method is employed to fabricate CFRP parts. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method by manufacturing an automobile hood and a marine propeller blade. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Named entity recognition is a fundamental task of Natural Language Processing and belongs to the category of sequence labeling problems. In the text, the named entity is the main carrier of information, which is used to express the main content of the text. Accurately identifying these contents is essential for implementing various natural language processing techniques such as information extraction, information retrieval, machine translation, and question and answer system. Named entities in business documents contain a lot of important information that can bring significant business value to the business. In this paper, we propose the method of combining Bi-directional long-short-term memory network and conditional random field, combining n-gram features and character features, and introducing attention mechanism to identify the tenderee, bidding agent and project number three entities in the bidding documents. Compared with the LSTM, BiLSTM can obtain the context information better and extract more features. The CRF uses the features obtained by BiLSTM to decode and obtain the final labeling result. In the comparative experiment of the collected data sets of 20,000 bidding documents, the BiLSTM-CRF model proposed in this paper can produce better labeling effect than other models and meet our expectations.

AB This paper describes a method based on a sequence-to-sequence learning (Seq2Seq) with attention and context preservation mechanism for voice conversion (VC) tasks. Seq2Seq has been outstanding at numerous tasks involving sequence modeling such as speech synthesis and recognition, machine translation, and image captioning. In contrast to current VC techniques, our method 1) stabilizes and accelerates the training procedure by considering guided attention and proposed context preservation losses, 2) allows not only spectral envelopes but also fundamental frequency contours and durations of speech to be converted, 3) requires no context information such as phoneme labels, and 4) requires no time-aligned source and target speech data in advance. In our experiment, the proposed VC framework can be trained in only one day, using only one GPU of an NVIDIA Tesla K80, while the quality of the synthesized speech is higher than that of speech converted by Gaussian mixture model-based VC and is comparable to that of speech generated by recurrent neural network-based text-to-speech synthesis, which can be regarded as an upper limit on VC performance.

This paper analyses the test results using the latest dataset on the implementation of content management utilization on WordNet in the form of taxonomy in measuring semantic similarity values. Further implementation results are compared with Gold Standard datasets for measured performance. The dataset used for testing is SimLex-999. In performance measurement, Pearson Correlation and Spearman Correlation are used. The use of these two correlations because each correlation has several advantages and disadvantages. Based on the test results, Seco Formula resulted in Pearson Correlation and Spearman Correlation of 0.583 and 0.582 respectively. While New Formula resulted in Pearson Correlation and Spearman Correlation respectively of 0.602 and 0.594. The correlation results show strong positive correlation relationship. Therefore, the method of information content in WordNet is feasible to be used to measure the value of semantic similarity.

TI Architecting Flash-based Solid-State Drive for High-performance I/O
   Virtualization
SO IEEE COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE LETTERS
AB Flash-based solid-state drive (SSD) is now being widely deployed in cloud computing platforms due to the potential advantages of better performance and less energy consumption. However, current virtualization architecture lacks support for high-performance I/O virtualization over persistent storage, which results in sub-optimal I/O performance for guest virtual machines (VMs) on SSD. Further, current software-based I/O virtualization violates the "don't hide power" principle due to inefficient support for some advanced SSD commands (e.g., TRIM) and constrained parallelism, leading to sub-optimal performance and life cycle.
   This paper observes that the massive internal parallelism and the block emulation in the flash translation layer (FTL) make flash-based SSD an ideal candidate to support high-performance I/O virtualization for persistent storage. Based on this observation, we propose VFlash, the first storage I/O virtualization architecture that extends existing SSDs with trivial hardware changes to directly expose multiple virtual SSDs to guest VMs. Performance evaluation using a modified FlashSim with two FTL schemes (i.e., DFTL and FAST) shows that VFlash incurs only small performance overhead over native SSDs and can efficiently exploit parallelism.

AB Helicases are molecular-motor enzymes that manipulate DNA or RNA during replication, repair, recombination, transcription, translation and processing of nucleic acids. The mechanisms for helicase activity have been studied intensely over the past decade. Recent advances in our understanding of the helicase mode of action have led to a general convergence of models that describe this diverse class of enzymes. one mechanism has been proposed that appears to have withstood the test of time, namely the inchworm mechanism. As the name implies, this mechanism involves a process whereby a helicase maintains at least two sites of contact with the nucleic acid. These binding sites can move relative to one another in a sequential fashion, resulting in net movement of the enzyme along the nucleic acid. The inchworm mechanism appears to be applicable to oligomeric states beyond the simple monomeric molecular motor. Although there are certainly many pertinent questions that remain unanswered, striking similarities in both form and function of seemingly disparate enzymes are becoming evident.

AB In order to controll the qualities of photographic materials the sensitometry parameters of films such as contrast, latitude, density, speed and average gradient are determined. Thereby a system for film sensitometry (FS) and image structure characteristics (ISC) multiple measurements has been designed and made out when microscope, artificial intelligence and computer technology are connected properly. The main structure of the system is composed of an automatic and high precision microscope with dual light paths which is used as a micro-copier (downsizing) or a data processing machine (enlarging), a best quality 2D moving platform and a. special automatic cassette that they are assembled together to guarantee the repeated precisions and the stabilities of the system. Then using a 6 million pixels scientific level CCD camera with some new functions of image processing, the collection and the translation of images are very quick so that the main points of the routine measurement are finished within only a few seconds and have suitable accuracy. Experimental results indicate that the use of the system enables the measure qualities to be improved, for example the highest resolving power can reach over 18001p/mm, RMS granularity and MTF curves are suitable.

AB Word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014) have been used to bolster the performance of natural language processing systems in a wide variety of tasks, including information retrieval (Roy et al., 2018) and machine translation (Qi et al., 2018). However, approaches to learning word embeddings typically require large corpora of running text to learn high quality representations. For many languages, such resources are unavailable. This is the case for Wolastoqey, also known as Malecite-Passamaquoddy, an endangered low-resource Indigenous language. As there exist no large corpora of running text for Wolastoqey, in this paper, we leverage a bilingual dictionary to learn Wolastoqey word embeddings by encoding their corresponding English definitions into vector representations using pretrained English word and sequence representation models. Specifically, we consider representations based on pretrained word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), and sentence-BERT (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) models. We evaluate these embeddings in word prediction tasks focused on part-of-speech, animacy, and transitivity; semantic clustering; and reverse dictionary search. In all evaluations we demonstrate that approaches using these embeddings outperform task-specific baselines, without requiring any language-specific training or fine-tuning.

AB Clinical dual-modal photoacoustic (PA)/ultrasound (US) imaging has gained a lot of attention, providing structural and function information of human tissues non-invasively. By combining conventional US imaging machines and pulsed lasers, clinical PA/US imaging can be easily implemented. In this case, PA/US imaging is usually conducted in 2D space. However, 2D PA/US imaging has low reproducibility due to its high operator dependence. For this reason, 3D PA/US imaging technology has been developed worldwide. In this work, we demonstrate a clinical handheld PA/US imaging scanner with weight and dimensions of 600 g and 70 x 62 x 110 mm(3), respectively. Further, we present online panoramic maximum amplitude projection (MAP) imaging. Since one scan data of 25 x 38 mm(2) is displayed in 16.7 sec, additional scan data of n x 25 x 38 mm(2) can be visualized in approximately n x 16.7 sec. Where n is the number of scans. Using the imaging system and scanner, we could visualize various 3D images of the human body and identify vascular networks in shallow and deep tissues both online and offline.

AB Code review is effective, but human-intensive (e.g., developers need to manually modify source code until it is approved). Recently, prior work proposed a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) approach to automatically transform source code to the version that is reviewed and approved (i.e., the after version). Yet, its performance is still suboptimal when the after version has new identifiers or literals (e.g., renamed variables) or has many code tokens. To address these limitations, we propose AutoTransform which leverages a Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) approach to handle new tokens and a Transformer-based NMT architecture to handle long sequences. We evaluate our approach based on 14,750 changed methods with and without new tokens for both small and medium sizes. The results show that when generating one candidate for the after version (i.e., beam width = 1), our AutoTransform can correctly transform 1,413 changed methods, which is 567% higher than the prior work, highlighting the substantial improvement of our approach for code transformation in the context of code review. This work contributes towards automated code transformation for code reviews, which could help developers reduce their effort in modifying source code during the code review process.

AB Natural language generation (NLG) benchmarks provide an important avenue to measure progress and develop better NLG systems. Unfortunately, the lack of publicly available NLG benchmarks for low-resource languages poses a challenging barrier for building NLG systems that work well for languages with limited amounts of data. Here we introduce IndoNLG, the first benchmark to measure natural language generation (NLG) progress in three low-resource-yet widely spokenlanguages of Indonesia: Indonesian, Javanese, and Sundanese. Altogether, these languages are spoken by more than 100 million native speakers, and hence constitute an important use case of NLG systems today. Concretely, IndoNLG covers six tasks: summarization, question answering, chit-chat, and three different pairs of machine translation (MT) tasks. We collate a clean pretraining corpus of Indonesian, Sundanese, and Javanese datasets, Indo4B-Plus, which is used to pretrain our models: IndoBART and IndoGPT. We show that IndoBART and IndoGPT achieve competitive performance on all tasks-despite using only one-fifth the parameters of a larger multilingual model, mBARTLARGE (Liu et al., 2020). This finding emphasizes the importance of pretraining on closely related, local languages to achieve more efficient learning and faster inference for very low-resource languages like Javanese and Sundanese.

AB Few-shot learning has drawn researchers' attention to overcome the problem of data scarcity. Recently, large pre-trained language models have shown great performance in few-shot learning for various downstream tasks, such as question answering and machine translation. Nevertheless, little exploration has been made to achieve few-shot learning for the fact-checking task. However, fact-checking is an important problem, especially when the amount of information online is growing exponentially every day. In this paper, we propose a new way of utilizing the powerful transfer learning ability of a language model via a perplexity score. The most notable strength of our methodology lies in its capability in few-shot learning. With only two training samples, our methodology can already outperform the Major Class baseline by more than an absolute 10% on the Fl-Macro metric across multiple datasets. Through experiments, we empirically verify the plausibility of the rather surprising usage of the perplexity score in the context of fact-checking and highlight the strength of our few-shot methodology by comparing it to strong fine-tuning-based baseline models. Moreover, we construct and publicly release two new fact-checking datasets related to COVID -19.

AB There are a rich variety of NLP problems that can be best expressed with graph structures. Due to the great power in modeling non-Euclidean data like graphs, deep learning on graphs techniques (i.e., Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)) have opened a new door to solving challenging graph-related NLP problems, and have already achieved great success. Despite the success, deep learning on graphs for NLP (DLG4NLP) still faces many challenges (e.g., automatic graph construction, graph representation learning for complex graphs, learning mapping between complex data structures).
   This tutorial will cover relevant and interesting topics on applying deep learning on graph techniques to NLP, including automatic graph construction for NLP, graph representation learning for NLP, advanced GNN based models (e.g., graph2seq, graph2tree, and graph2graph) for NLP, and the applications of GNNs in various NLP tasks (e.g., machine translation, natural language generation, information extraction and semantic parsing). In addition, handson demonstration sessions will be included to help the audience gain practical experience on applying GNNs to solve challenging NLP problems using our recently developed open source library - Graph4NLP, the first library for researchers and practitioners for easy use of GNNs for various NLP tasks.

TI Point Cloud Registration Algorithm Based on Cosine Similarity
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB A point cloud registration algorithm based on cosine similarity (PCR-CS) is proposed. This algorithm mainly solves the problem of point cloud rigid registration, which involves finding the rotation matrix R and the translation matrix T of the point cloud registration to realize registration between the original point cloud P and the target point cloud Q. In the proposed algorithm, first, the two points clouds to be registered arc decentralized and the cosine similarity of the point clouds is studied. Then, the two three-dimensional point clouds to be registered are projected onto the XY plane and rasterized on the XY plane. The data points on the statistical grid form the statistical matrices S-P and S-Q Moreover, the differential evolution algorithm is used to find the optimal R under the condition of the cosine similarity of the two points clouds to achieve point cloud registration. Finally, the center point is used to calculate T. Experiment results show that compared with other algorithms, the proposed algorithm has higher registration accuracy. In addition, even when the point cloud data arc accompanied by noise or missing data, it can achieve good registration results.

AB Attention mechanism is now being widely used in machine translation, image segmentation, and many other neural network-based applications. In the attention mechanism, there is an index called "attention score" which could reflect the relevance degrees between the output tokens with the input tokens. In this paper, we proposed a method using the attention score in extracting the question-related sentences from the articles of reading comprehension tests. We investigated and compared the accuracies of the extracted sentences when in word-level embedding, sentence-level embedding, and using the traditional cosine similarity. Through the evaluation of the randomly selected results of the extracted sentences, the method using the attention mechanism with sentence-level embedding obtained the accuracy of 88.3%, which was 80.9% when using word-level embedding and 83.5% when using the general cosine similarity. Meanwhile, the sentence-level embedding method also obtained the highest precision and recall in the three methods. The results suggest that using the attention mechanism with sentence-level embedding could extract the question-related sentences more accurately than traditional cosine similarity.

AB Ribosomes are the intracellular ribonucleoprotein machines responsible for the translation of mRNA sequence into protein sequence. As an essential cell component, the ribosome is the target of numerous antibiotics that bind to critical functional sites to impair protein synthesis. Mutations causing resistance to antibiotics arise in antibiotic binding sites, and an understanding of the basis of resistance will be an essential component of efforts to develop new antibiotics by rational drug design. We have identified a number of antibiotic-resistance mutations in ribosomal genes of the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus. This species offers two primary advantages for examining the structural basis of antibiotic-resistance, in particular, its potential for genetic manipulation and the suitability of its ribosomes for analysis by X-ray crystallography. Mutations we have identified in this organism are in many instances identical to those found in other bacterial species, including important pathogens, a result of the extreme conservation of ribosome functional sites. Here I summarize the advantages of this organism as a model system to study antibiotic-resistance mechanisms at the molecular level.

AB The purpose of the present work is to develop a simple procedure for making physical models of three-dimensional (3D) digital topographic maps by rapid prototyping (RP) using digital elevation model (DEM) data. It is also intended to reduce data loss by choosing the right tools and minimizing intermediate data translations. As a typical digital map, NSDTF-DEM can be translated into ArcInfo ASCII Grid format, so that it can be manipulated by ARCGIS to restore the elevation, and in this way any data loss associated with intermediate file transfer will be eliminated. By AccuTrans3D software DEM files can further be converted into Stereo lithography (STL) surface with intricate geometries. The STL surface is then manipulated in Materialise Magics software to obtain a solid STL part, which can be used as input files for RP to obtain a physical model. All the openly available software that used in this method runs under Microsoft Windows 7 operating systems. The RP machine applied in this procedure is paper-based 3D printer, which takes less time and costs less but produces environmental friendly models with high accuracy.

AB The deep understanding of the human activity is an essential key for a successful Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). The translation of the sensed human behavioral signals/cues and context descriptors into an encoded human activity is still a challenge because of the complex nature of the human actions. We propose a multilayer framework for the understanding of the human activity and suitable for being implemented in a mobile robot. It is based on the ideomotor theory which argues that each human action can be seen as goal-directed movements that cause intended effects in the environment.(1) The perception layer collects data related to the kinematics and dynamics of human body and the environment/context descriptors; the classification layer combines a segment-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) method with the Video Annotation Tool from Irvine, California (VATIC) for the classification of the elementary actions; the interpretation layer allows the understanding of goal-directed activity by using a fuzzy logic-based decisional engine (developed with SpirOps AI software). In this paper, we are limited to detail the classification method, the tools and the results.

TI Microarray-based cancer prediction using single genes
SO BMC BIOINFORMATICS
AB Background: Although numerous methods of using microarray data analysis for cancer classification have been proposed, most utilize many genes to achieve accurate classification. This can hamper interpretability of the models and ease of translation to other assay platforms. We explored the use of single genes to construct classification models. We first identified the genes with the most powerful univariate class discrimination ability and then constructed simple classification rules for class prediction using the single genes.
   Results: We applied our model development algorithm to eleven cancer gene expression datasets and compared classification accuracy to that for standard methods including Diagonal Linear Discriminant Analysis, k-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest. The single gene classifiers provided classification accuracy comparable to or better than those obtained by existing methods in most cases. We analyzed the factors that determined when simple single gene classification is effective and when more complex modeling is warranted.
   Conclusions: For most of the datasets examined, the single-gene classification methods appear to work as well as more standard methods, suggesting that simple models could perform well in microarray-based cancer prediction.

TI Context constraint disambiguation of word semantics by field association
   schemes
SO INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT
AB Word sense disambiguation is important in various aspects of natural language processing, including Internet search engines, machine translation, text mining, etc. However, the traditional methods using case frames are not effective for solving context ambiguities that requires information beyond sentences. This paper presents a new scheme for solving context ambiguities using a field association scheme. Generally, the scope of case frames is restricted to one sentence; however, the scope of the field association scheme can be applied to a set of sentences. In this paper, a formal disambiguation algorithm is proposed to control the scope for a set of variable number of sentences with ambiguities as well as solve ambiguities by calculating the weight of fields. In the experiments, 52 English and 20 Chinese words are disambiguated by using 104,532 Chinese and 38,372 English field association terms. The accuracy of the proposed field association scheme for context ambiguities is 65% higher than the case frame method. The proposed scheme shows better results than other three known methods, namely UNED-LS-U, IIT-2, and Relative-based in corpus SENSEVAL-2. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a novel method is proposed for face recognition based on Pulse Coupled Neural network (PCNN) time signature. In this approach, a probe face is first extracted PCNN time signature as the recognition features, which a two-dimensional image is projected to a low one-dimensional feature space and then is classified based on the known samples. An extensive experimental investigation is conducted using AT&T face database covering face recognition under controlled/ideal conditions, different illumination conditions and different facial expressions. The recognition ratio is 83.75% when only PCNN time signature, including 5 features is used as the recognition features and three exemplar images per person are available. The recognition ratio is 94.50% when the PCNN time signature is integrated with PCA feature based on Euclidean distance. The recognition ratio is 98.50% when the PCNN time signature is integrated with ICA feature based on Support Vector Machine (SVM). The simulation result demonstrates that proposed recognition method is robust due to the translation, rotation and scale invariance of PCNN time signature, insensitive to illumination and facial expressions changes as well as fast due to the low feature dimensions.

TI ANEC: An Amharic Named Entity Corpus and Transformer Based Recognizer
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Named Entity Recognition is an information extraction task that serves as a pre-processing step for other natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation, information retrieval, and question answering. Named entity recognition enables the identification of proper names as well as temporal and numeric expressions in an open domain text. For Semitic languages such as Arabic, Amharic, and Hebrew, the named entity recognition task is more challenging due to the heavily inflected structure of these languages. In this study, we annotate a new comparatively large Amharic named entity recognition dataset and make it publicly available. Using this new dataset, we build multiple Amharic named entity recognition systems based on recent deep learning approaches including transfer learning (RoBERTa), and bidirectional long short-term memory coupled with a conditional random fields layer. By applying the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique to mitigate the imbalanced classification problem, our best performing RoBERTa based named entity recognition system achieves an f1-score of 93%, which is the new state-of-the-art result for Amharic named entity recognition.

AB We present a method for matching a text sentence from a given corpus to a given video clip and vice versa. Traditionally video and text matching is done by learning a shared embedding space and the encoding of one modality is independent of the other. In this work, we encode the dataset data in a way that takes into account the query's relevant information. The power of the method is demonstrated to arise from pooling the interaction data between words and frames. Since the encoding of the video clip depends on the sentence compared to it, the representation needs to be recomputed for each potential match. To this end, we propose an efficient shallow neural network. Its training employs a hierarchical triplet loss that is extendable to paragraph/video matching. The method is simple, provides explainability, and achieves state-of-the-art results for both sentence-clip and video-text by a sizable margin across five different datasets: ActivityNet, DiDeMo, YouCook2, MSR-VTT, and LSMDC. We also show that our conditioned representation can be transferred to video-guided machine translation, where we improved the current results on VATEX.

AB This paper describes a statistical post-processing method for automatic singing transcription that corrects pitch and rhythm errors included in a transcribed note sequence. Although the performance of frame-level pitch estimation has been improved drastically by deep learning techniques, note-level transcription of singing voice is still an open problem. Inspired by the standard framework of statistical machine translation, we formulate a hierarchical generative model of a transcribed note sequence that consists of a music language model describing the pitch and onset transitions of a true note sequence and a transcription error model describing the addition of deletion, insertion, and substitution errors to the true sequence. Because the length of the true sequence might be different from that of the observed transcribed sequence, the most likely sequences with possible different lengths are estimated with Viterbi decoding and the most likely length is then selected with a sophisticated language model based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The experimental results show that the proposed method can correct musically unnatural transcription errors.

AB This paper proposes a new methodology for intelligent sense-enabled lexical search on text documents. The proposed methodology extracts words from an input text document which are semantically related to a particular sense of the query word. The entire methodology is divided in to two tasks namely, Word Sense disambiguation (WSD) of each word in the input text followed by semantic search i.e, extracting those words that are semantically related to a particular sense of the query word. The significance of the proposed methodology is that, to the best of our knowledge this is the first work that supports sense-enabled lexical search in a text document simultaneously considering the problems with polysemous words. Extraction of semantically related words to a given query word has role in many applications such as document indexing, vocabulary learning for humans, machine translation, etc. Experimental results show that the proposed system surpasses the existing system in terms of precision and computational time. This improved precision and execution time enhances the end user's experience quality in using the system.

AB The security analysis of sensitive issues and medical diagnosis are immensely focus to determine exact location of event happening regions. In this paper we propose a model of clustering and pooling techniques to local features using Bag-of-Words (BoW) descriptor in SVM framework for event detection in video sequences. The proposed model extracts local features from six categories of Columbia Consumer Video (CCV) event detection benchmark. We developed the clusters of these features using KD-search tree and Lloyds algorithm. The clusters of features is pooled to vectors by using bag of words model. Introducing the inferring temporal instance labelling, the model performed fast for event detection. The significant performance of the research problem can thrilled out the social media by retrieving the best possible content. The proposed model can efficiently perform the experiments of event detection related to big data problem in visual media. Furthermore, the proposed approach in the model is invariant to rotation, translation and scale changes in the video sequence and robust to the illumination and viewpoints.

AB Developing user friendly Human-Computer-Interfaces is important in many areas of computer applications. Traditional input devices such as the keyboard and mouse are designed for general purpose computers only, they are not likely to provide intuitive user experiences for multi-dimensional input entry. Therefore, we design and implement an embedded system for users to interactive with a computer in 6-degree of freedom. The system can capture the 3-D rotation and 3-D translation motions which are the basic 6-D motion parameters. In our proposed approach, the translational motion is estimated using a computer vision method by tracking the speckled pattern generated by a laser beam on a rough surface. The orientation information is estimated by measuring the gravitational and magnetic fields of the Earth. A gyroscope is included together with the use of Kalman filter to improve the dynamic responses. A prototype is built to evaluate the performance of the proposed tracking method. Experiments have been carried out which show that the approach can work with good accuracy and the whole system can be built using off-the-shelf low cost components.

AB The success of machine learning algorithms generally depends on data representation. So far there has been a great deal of literature on unsupervised feature learning and joint training of deep learning. There is little specific guidance, however, on combining hand-designed features or the operations on them with features which are learned from unsupervised learning. In this paper, using MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") handwritten digit database as an example, we propose a novel method for training sparse auto-encoders. In this method, we first get some small-scale features through training, then generate more features through operations such as rotation and translation. Finally, we use the whole dataset to fine-tune the network. This approach avoids optimizing cost function for all nodes in the traditional sparse auto-encoder training process, which is very time-consuming. Simulation results show that the proposed method can speed up the training process by over 50%, while keeping the recognition accuracy at the same level or even better. The present findings also contribute to the field's understanding of sparse representation that large-scale sparse features can be generated by small-scale sparse features.

AB Constructing a pronunciation lexicon with variants in a fully automatic and language-independent way is a challenge, with many uses in human language technologies. Moreover, with the growing use of web data, there is a recurrent need to add words to existing pronunciation lexicons, and an automatic method can greatly simplify the effort required to generate pronunciations for these out-of-vocabulary words. In this paper, a machine translation approach is used to perform grapheme-to-phoneme (g2p) conversion, the task of finding the pronunciation of a word from its written form. Two alternative methods are proposed to derive pronunciation variants. In the first case, an n-best pronunciation list is extracted directly from the g2p converter. The second is a novel method based on a pivot approach, traditionally used for the paraphrase extraction task, and applied as a post-processing step to the g2p converter. The performance of these two methods is compared under different training conditions. The range of applications which require pronunciation lexicons is discussed and the generated pronunciations are further tested in some preliminary automatic speech recognition experiments.

AB In 1984, IBM and the University of Oslo set up a joint project, probably the first project of its kind in Norway. Its aim was to develop Norwegian language resources for IBM application software for PCs, midrange computers, and mainframes. The primary objective: to create a "base dictionary" module that would drive language sensitive functions. The technology was based on simple character sequence recognition; its great asset being high compaction and rapid access to correct data. The module was to be built on documented linguistic forms. The dictionary should cover the general part of the vocabulary, and a broad coverage module was created for Norwegian Bokmal. Later, one module for Nynorsk was developed as well. At that stage, however, the project had become a regular IBM project. In the following years, other linguistic functions were added and eventually, the result served as the foundation for a grammar and for machine translation. The project was terminated because of the corporate financial crisis of the late 1980s. Later, the dictionaries were transferred to the University of Oslo. They are now an integral part of the basic infrastructure for Norwegian academic computational linguistics.

   ENGINEERING MANUFACTURE
AB This paper presents the geometric error measurement and compensation of a six-degree -of-freedom (6-DOF) hybrid positioning stage consisting of a 3-DOF parallel kinematic mechanism and a 3-DOF serial mechanism. The parallel kinematic mechanism uses ball joints and wedge-shaped mechanisms to provide the required rotational and sliding movement. The advantages of this mechanism include a simple structure, easy assembly, and zero accumulated linkage errors. The study commences by describing the kinematic mechanisms of the positioning stage, and then evaluates the degrees of freedom of the parallel kinematic mechanism. Subsequently, a homogeneous transformation matrix approach is employed to perform an inverse analysis of the kinematics of the entire positioning stage. The study then discusses the effects of geometric errors caused by imprecision in the manufacturing and assembly processes on the positional accuracy of the stage. Finally, a coordinate measuring machine is used to measure the translation and orientation errors of the positioning stage. By comparing the measured data with the values derived from the inverse kinematics analysis, an error compensation model is constructed.

AB Many programs written to analyze data are expressed in terms of array operations in an imperative programming language with loops. However, for data analysts who need to analyze vast volumes of data, large-scale data-intensive processing is becoming a necessity. hence, they want to convert their programs, originally written to run on a single computer, to work on current Rig Data systems, such as Map-Reduce and Spark, so that they can process larger amounts of data. We present a novel framework, called SQLgen, that automatically translates imperative programs with loops and array operations to distributed data-parallel programs. Unlike related work, SQLgen translates these programs to SQL, which can be translated to more efficient code since it can he optimized using a relational database optimizer SQLgen has been implemented on Spark SQL. We compare the performance of SQLgen with DIABLO, hand-written RDD-based, and Spark SQL programs on real world problems. SQLgen is up to 78x faster than DIABLO and up to 25x faster than hand-written RIM-based programs, giving performance close to that of hand-written programs in Spark SQL.

AB Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been widely used in processing natural language tasks and achieve huge success. Traditional RNNs usually treat each token in a sentence uniformly and equally. However, this may miss the rich semantic structure information of a sentence, which is useful for understanding natural languages. Since semantic structures such as word dependence patterns are not parameterized, it is a challenge to capture and leverage structure information. In this paper, we propose an improved variant of RNN, Multi-Channel RNN (MC-RNN), to dynamically capture and leverage local semantic structure information. Concretely, MC-RNN contains multiple channels, each of which represents a local dependence pattern at a time. An attention mechanism is introduced to combine these patterns at each step, according to the semantic information. Then we parameterize structure information by adaptively selecting the most appropriate connection structures among channels. In this way, diverse local structures and dependence patterns in sentences can be well captured by MC-RNN. To verify the effectiveness of MC-RNN, we conduct extensive experiments on typical natural language processing tasks, including neural machine translation, abstractive summarization, and language modeling. Experimental results on these tasks all show significant improvements of MC-RNN over current top systems.

AB Neural network accelerators are widely deployed in application systems for computer vision, speech recognition, and machine translation. Due to ubiquitous deployment of these systems, a strong incentive rises for adversaries to attack such artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Trojan is one of the most important attack models in hardware security domain. Hardware Trojans are malicious modifications to original ICs inserted by adversaries, which lead the system to malfunction after being triggered. The globalization of the semiconductor gives a chance for the adversary to conduct the hardware Trojan attacks.
   Previous works design Neural Network (NN) Trojans with access to the model, toolchain, and hardware platform. However, the threat model is impractical which hinders their real adoption. In this work, we propose a memory Trojan methodology without the help of toolchain manipulation and model parameter information. We first leverage the memory access patterns to identify the input image data. Then we propose a Trojan triggering method based on the dedicated input image other than the circuit events, which has better controllability. The triggering mechanism works well even with environment noise and preprocessing towards the original images. In the end, we implement and verify the effectiveness of accuracy degradation attack.

SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB A kind of three-dimensional measurement system consisting of an ultra-large-scale line structured-light sensor and a two-axis guide rail is designed to realize the high-accuracy rapid three-dimensional measurement of large-scale free-form surface workpiece. The structured-light sensor acquires the image driven by the two-axis guide rail, and obtains the three-dimensional coordinates of the target workpiece by calculation. A novel approach for simultaneous calibration of the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of ultra-large-scale line structured-light sensor is proposed to transform two-dimensional image coordinate to three-dimensional camera coordinate. The method calibrates the quasi-one-dimensional target, and calculates the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of line structured-light sensor with the obtained images of target and laser light during translation. Experimental result shows that the calibration results are reliable and the system measurement error is within 0.6 mm, which meets the design requirement. The calibration process is simple, easy to make target, and suitable for the industrial field calibration.

TI DNA Methylation Patterns Facilitate the Identification of MicroRNA
   Transcription Start Sites: A Brain-Specific Study
SO PLOS ONE
AB Predicting the transcription start sites (TSSs) of microRNAs (miRNAs) is important for understanding how these small RNA molecules, known to regulate translation and stability of protein-coding genes, are regulated themselves. Previous approaches are primarily based on genetic features, trained on TSSs of protein-coding genes, and have low prediction accuracy. Recently, a support vector machine based technique has been proposed for miRNA TSS prediction that uses known miRNA TSS for training the classifier along with a set of existing and novel CpG island based features. Current progress in epigenetics research has provided genomewide and tissue-specific reports about various phenotypic traits. We hypothesize that incorporating epigenetic characteristics into statistical models may lead to better prediction of primary transcripts of human miRNAs. In this paper, we have tested our hypothesis on brain-specific miRNAs by using epigenetic as well as genetic features to predict the primary transcripts. For this, we have used a sophisticated feature selection technique and a robust classification model. Our prediction model achieves an accuracy of more than 80% and establishes the potential of epigenetic analysis for in silico prediction of TSSs.

AB Limited memory resource has always been deemed as the major bottleneck of the program performance, not excepting for dynamic binary translation (DBT) [1] system. However, traditional methods seldom enable this issue mentioned to be solved better due to that a fix cache size routinely assigned for codes without considering the program behavior on the fly. Though some prediction methods implemented via LRU [2] histograms can achieve better performance in Operating System, unlike pages in memory, blocks in DBT have unfixed sizes each other, making the prediction imprecise.
   In this paper, we present a new replace policy named DCC (Dynamic Code Cache) based on working set [3] for bounded code cache, which would dynamically change the size of the code cache and clear the cache according to the information of working set detected. It would sacrifice a small part of the performance to save the space, especially when many great or complicated applications are running on the same physical machine, and the performance might be better under this condition. For evaluating, we test this strategy on a DBT system named Crossbit [4]. We get around 30% space saved up with about 12% running time sacrificed.

AB For the participation of GIRSA at the GeoCLEF 2007 task, two innovative features were introduced to the geographic information retrieval (GIR) system: identification and normalization of location indicators, i.e. text segments from which a geographic scope can be inferred, and the application of techniques from question answering. In an extension of a previously performed experiment, the latter approach was combined with an approach using semantic networks for geographic retrieval. When using the topic title and description, the best performance was achieved by the combination of approaches (0.196 mean average precision, MAP); adding location names from the narrative part increased MAP to 0.258. Results indicate that 1) employing normalized location indicators improves MAP significantly and increases the number of relevant documents found; 2) additional location names from the narrative increase MAP and recall, and 3) the semantic network approach has a high initial precision and even adds some relevant documents which were previously not found. For the bilingual experiments, English queries were translated into German by the Promt machine translation web service. Performance for these experiments is generally lower. The baseline experiment (0.114 MAP) is clearly outperformed, achieving the best performance for a setup using title, description, and narrative (0.209 MAP).

TI Circular ultrasound compounding by designed matrix weighting
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING
AB Spatial compounding is an imaging technique that aims to improve image contrast by combining partially decorrelated images acquired at different angles or positions. In conventional spatial compounding, data sets are combined with equal weighting. Here, we describe an alternative method of reconstruction using algorithms which weight the data based on a "quality" matrix. The quality matrix is derived from beamforming characteristics. For each data set, the reliability of the data is assumed to vary spatially. By compounding the data based on the quality matrix, a complete image is formed. Here, we describe the construction of a rotational translation stage and tissue-mimicking phantoms that are used in conjunction with a commercial medical ultrasound machine to test our reconstruction algorithms. The new algorithms were found to increase the contrast-to-speckle ratio of simulated cysts and tumors by 61% from raw data, and to significantly increase edge definition of small embedded targets. The new method shows promise as a computationally efficient method of improving contrast and resolution in ultrasound images. The method should be particularly useful in breast imaging, where images from multiple angles can be acquired without interference from bone or air.

AB There is a common misconception that the automobile industry is slow to adapt new technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), into the manufacturing sector. In reality, many of the earliest adaptations of AI were in the automotive sector where such diverse technologies as expert systems, neural networks, genetic algorithms, and fuzzy logic were among the first to be used. In this paper we will present an overview of how AI and knowledge-based technologies are currently being applied at Ford Motor Company within the manufacturing arena. Some of the applications that will be described include an AI-based approach for vehicle assembly process planning, an application of AI for ergonomics analysis and a system that utilizes machine translation to translate assembly build instructions for Ford assembly plants that do not use English as their primary language. We will also discuss how specific technologies, such as natural language processing, controlled languages, and ontologies, can be used to effectively deal with different types of knowledge, both structured and unstructured, that are prevalent in the manufacturing environment. The automobile industry is among the most competitive in the entire world, and the use of advanced technologies, is essential in the ongoing struggle to prosper in the global marketplace.

The PARS/Dutch family of MT systems is based on the rule-based Lingvistica's Dutch morphological-syntactic analyzer and synthesizer dealing with vowel and consonant alterations in Dutch words, as well as Dutch syntactic analysis and synthesis. Besides, a German analyzer and synthesizer have been developed, and a similar French one is being constructed. Representative Dutch and German grammatical dictionaries have been created, comprising Dutch and German words and their complete morphological descriptions: class and subclass characteristics, alteration features, and morphological declension/conjugation paradigms. The PARS/H dictionary editor provides simple dictionary updating. Numerous specialist dictionaries are being and have been created. The user interface integrates PARS/H with MS Word and MS Internet Explorer, fully preserving the corresponding formats. Integrating with MS Excel and many other applications is under way.

AB Timeline summarization methods analyze timestamped, topic-specific news article collections to select the key dates representing the event flow and to extract the most relevant per-date content. Existing approaches are all tailored to a single language. Hence, they are unable to combine topic-related content available in different languages. Enriching news timelines with multilingual content is particularly useful for (i) summarizing complex events, whose main facets are covered differently by media sources from different countries, and (ii) generating news timelines in low-resource languages, for which there is a lack of news content in the target language.
   This paper presents three alternative approaches to address cross-lingual timeline summarization. They combine state-of-the-art extractive summarization methods with machine translation steps at different stages of the timeline generation process. The paper also proposes novel Rouge-based evaluation metrics customized for cross-lingual timeline summarization with a twofold aim: (i) quantifying the ability of the cross-lingual process to enhance available content extraction in the target language and (ii) estimating summarizer effectiveness in conveying additional content from other languages. A new multilingual timeline benchmark dataset has been generated to allow a thorough analysis of the factors that mainly influence summarization performance.

AB Innovations in neural architectures have fostered significant breakthroughs in language modeling and computer vision. Unfortunately, novel architectures often result in challenging hyper-parameter choices and training instability if the network parameters are not properly initialized. A number of architecture-specific initialization schemes have been proposed, but these schemes are not always portable to new architectures. This paper presents GradInit, an automated and architecture agnostic method for initializing neural networks. GradInit is based on a simple heuristic; the norm of each network layer is adjusted so that a single step of SGD or Adam with prescribed hyperparameters results in the smallest possible loss value. This adjustment is done by introducing a scalar multiplier variable in front of each parameter block, and then optimizing these variables using a simple numerical scheme. GradInit accelerates the convergence and test performance of many convolutional architectures, both with or without skip connections, and even without normalization layers. It also improves the stability of the original Transformer architecture for machine translation, enabling training it without learning rate warmup using either Adam or SGD under a wide range of learning rates and momentum coefficients. Code is available at https://github.com/zhuchen03/gradinit.

AB Recent emerged quantization technique (i.e., using low bit-width fixed-point data instead of high bit-width floating-point data) has been applied to inference of deep neural networks for fast and efficient execution. However, directly applying quantization in training can cause significant accuracy loss, thus remaining an open challenge. In this paper; we propose a novel training approach, which applies a layer-wise precision-adaptive quantization in deep neural networks. The new training approach leverages our key insight that the degradation of training accuracy is attributed to the dramatic change of data distribution. Therefore, by keeping the data distribution stable through a layer-wise precision-adaptive quantization, we are able to directly train deep neural networks using low bit-width fixed-point data and achieve guaranteed accuracy, without changing hyper parameters. Experimental results on a wide variety of network architectures (e.g., convolution and recurrent networks) and applications (e.g., image classification, object detection, segmentation and machine translation) show that the proposed approach can train these neural networks with negligible accuracy losses (-1.40%similar to 1.3%, 0.02% on average), and speed up training by 252% on a state-of-the-art Intel CPU.

AB Aiming at the problems of decoupling and analysis of optical flow vectors with various motion states confronted in the pose estimation process of autonomous vehicles (AVs) using optical flow, the optical flow motion field model (OFMFM) is derived and the decoupled optical flow motion filed model (DOFMFM) is analysed as the vehicle poses change independently in six degrees of freedom. According to the DOFMFM, a simulation algorithm is designed for the vehicle platform, and the completely decoupled simulation results arc presented. The DOFMFM is applied to quantify and verify the simulation results. Two real scenes of translation and rotation from the KITTI dataset arc utilized for the flow-decoupled experiments. The consistency among model analysis, simulation process, real data and comparison results is verified. The results show that the proposed decoupled model analysis, simulation algorithm, simulation and real results together with comparison analysis can not only be applied in the error analysis and algorithm test of pose estimation, but also provide a reference or instruction for the improvement in the understanding of optical flow motion imaging and the research on the optical flow based applications on an AV platform.

AB Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) based end-to-end speech recognition system usually need to incorporate an external language model by using WFST-based decoding in order to achieve promising results. This is more essential to Mandarin speech recognition since it owns a special phenomenon, namely homophone, which causes a lot of substitution errors. The linguistic information introduced by language model is somehow helpful to distinguish these substitution errors. In this work, we propose a transformer based spelling correction model to automatically correct errors, especially the substitution errors, made by CTC-based Mandarin speech recognition system. Specifically, we investigate to use the recognition results generated by CTC-based systems as input and the ground-truth transcriptions as output to train a transformer with encoder-decoder architecture, which is much similar to machine translation. Experimental results in a 20,000 hours Mandarin speech recognition task show that the proposed spelling correction model can achieve a CER of 3.41%, which results in 22.9% and 53.2% relative improvement compared to the baseline CTC-based systems decoded with and without language model, respectively.

The powerful package can automatically complete the following five procedures: (1) sample feature extraction, (2) optimal parameter selection, (3) model training, (4) cross validation, and (5) evaluating prediction quality. All the work a user needs to do is to input a benchmark dataset along with the query biological sequences concerned. Based on the benchmark dataset, Pse-Analysis will automatically construct an ideal predictor, followed by yielding the predicted results for the submitted query samples. All the aforementioned tedious jobs can be automatically done by the computer. Moreover, the multiprocessing technique was adopted to enhance computational speed by about 6 folds. The Pse-Analysis Python package is freely accessible to the public at http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/Pse-Analysis/, and can be directly run on Windows, Linux, and Unix.

AB Ontology is an explicit specification of conceptualization. It defines the terms with specified relationships between them and can be interpreted by both humans and computers. In general, there are scare semantic resources for Arabic language especially in Arabic ontologies. These semantic resources are very essential components in both Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing applications like search engines, question answering, machine translation, etc. In recent years, many researchers are interested in building Arabic sematic resources, which are then can be exploited by others to build Arabic sematic applications. Recently, a proposed ontological model for "Time Nouns" vocabulary in the Holly Quran was introduced. To share towards building an integrated and unified ontology for Arabic language, in this paper, we are proposing an ontology-based model for Arabic language vocabulary associated with "Place Nouns" in the Holy Quran. This ontology is represented by the Web Ontology Language (OWL), which is the standard language for the semantic web. The ontology will be useful in the knowledge of the Islamic learning, linguistics researches, and Semantic Web applications.

AB Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) are key components in modern packaging automation systems. But their success has led to the presence of a broad range of brands and models, each one with its own and unique features, but also with its own environment for software development. This situation has some major drawbacks: it is very difficult to upgrade an installation by changing the PLC, maintenance costs rise with the multiplicity of PLC brands in a given factory, and production parameters must be changed when the production is changed to a machine with a different PLC.
   In this paper, a first step is presented to address such a situation: instead of developing the same program from scratch for each different PLC brand, a unique program is stored using the PLCopen XML standard. When the program must be ported to a given PLC, an automatic tool, the postprocessor, generates the final code that has to be downloaded to the target PLC. In this paper the PLC tool adapter is presented and an example is shown for three of the major PLC brands present in the packaging industry such as Siemens, Schneider Electric and ABB.

AB The similarity of the AMBER force field's energy functional form with that of the CHARMM force field, gives the potential for direct translation of common bonding and nonbonding terms, along with their parameters, present in CHARMM topology and parameter files, with the intent of evaluation within the AMBER software; specifically the SANDER and PMEMD dynamics engines. To this extent, we have created a tool, CHAMBER, which can take a CHARMM protein structure file (PSF), coordinate file (COR) and associated forcefield files, and convert these to an AMBER topology file (prmtop) and associated coordinate file (inpcrd). CHAMBER opens a conversion route which enables the simulation of CHARMM parameterized models using AMBER's PMEMD engine; thus providing improved serial efficiency as well as parallel efficiency over large numbers of CPUs. Significant effort has been expended in ensuring a true representation of the CHARMM force field in AMBER providing energies and forces that are the same to the limits of machine precision. This software will be released in the upcoming version 1.3 of the free AMBERTools suite. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J Quantum Chem 109: 3767-3772, 2009

TI Multilevel Training of Binary Morphological Operators
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB The design of binary morphological operators that are translation-invariant and locally defined by a finite neighborhood window corresponds to the problem of designing Boolean functions. As in any supervised classification problem, morphological operators designed from a training sample also suffer from overfitting. Large neighborhood tends to lead to performance degradation of the designed operator. This work proposes a multilevel design approach to deal with the issue of designing large neighborhood-based operators. The main idea is inspired by stacked generalization (a multilevel classifier design approach) and consists of, at each training level, combining the outcomes of the previous level operators. The final operator is a multilevel operator that ultimately depends on a larger neighborhood than of the individual operators that have been combined. Experimental results show that two-level operators obtained by combining operators designed on subwindows of a large window consistently outperform the single-level operators designed on the full window. They also show that iterating two-level operators is an effective multilevel approach to obtain better results.

TI A modular DNA signal translator for the controlled release of a protein
   by an aptamer
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Owing to the intimate linkage of sequence and structure in nucleic acids, DNA is an extremely attractive molecule for the development of molecular devices, in particular when a combination of information processing and chemomechanical tasks is desired. Many of the previously demonstrated devices are driven by hybridization between DNA 'effector' strands and specific recognition sequences on the device. For applications it is of great interest to link several of such molecular devices together within artificial reaction cascades. Often it will not be possible to choose DNA sequences freely, e.g. when functional nucleic acids such as aptamers are used. In such cases translation of an arbitrary 'input' sequence into a desired effector sequence may be required. Here we demonstrate a molecular 'translator' for information encoded in DNA and show how it can be used to control the release of a protein by an aptamer using an arbitrarily chosen DNA input strand. The function of the translator is based on branch migration and the action of the endonuclease FokI. The modular design of the translator facilitates the adaptation of the device to various input or output sequences.

TI Annotated Corpus with Negation and Speculation in Arabic Review Domain:
   NSAR
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB Negation and speculation detection are critical for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as sentiment analysis, information retrieval, and machine translation. This paper presents the first Arabic corpus in the review domain annotated with negation and speculation. The Negation and Speculation Arabic Review (NSAR) corpus consists of 3K randomly selected review sentences from three well-known and benchmarked Arabic corpora. It contains reviews from different categories, including books, hotels, restaurants, and other products written in various Arabic dialects. The negation and speculation keywords have been annotated along with their linguistic scope based on the annotation guidelines reviewed by an expert linguist. The inter-annotator agreement between two independent annotators, Arabic native speakers, is measured using the Cohen's Kappa coefficients with values of 95 and 80 for negation and speculation, respectively. Furthermore, 29% of this corpus includes at least one negation instance, while only 4% of this corpus contains speculative content. Therefore, the Arabic reviews focus more on negation structures rather than speculation. This corpus will be available for the Arabic research community to handle these critical phenomena(1).

TI Word-Based Bantu Language Identification using Naive Bayes

CT IST-Africa Conference
CY MAY 16-20, 2022
CL ELECTR NETWORK
SP IST Africa
AB Language identification of text has become increasingly important as large quantities of text are processed or filtered automatically. It is one of the preprocessing steps in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as information retrieval and machine translation. Few studies have worked on Bantu Languages in automatic language identification. Language identification is a challenge in Bantu languages because of lack of data and in addition to that, languages which are written similarly like Setswana and Sesotho are also challenging. In this paper, we present a word-based Naive Bayes classifier to identify words of Sesotho and Setswana language. The classifier was trained with words from both Setswana and Sesotho in a supervised manner. Adjectives, pronouns, adverbs and enumeratives are also included. The classifier shows that the two languages can be individually identified as it gives an accuracy of 71.4%. Despite that when we increase the data to double the number of words, the model increased performance to 78%. We also report that the classifier fails with homographs. The performance could be improved by using more data. Additionally, the syllable identification and sentence identification could be implemented along with word-based classifier.

TI AI musculoskeletal clinical applications: how can AI increase my
   day-to-day efficiency?
SO SKELETAL RADIOLOGY
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to bring greater efficiency in radiology by performing tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence, also at a much faster rate than human performance. In recent years, milestone deep learning models with unprecedented low error rates and high computational efficiency have shown remarkable performance for lesion detection, classification, and segmentation tasks. However, the growing field of AI has significant implications for radiology that are not limited to visual tasks. These are essential applications for optimizing imaging workflows and improving noninterpretive tasks. This article offers an overview of the recent literature on AI, focusing on the musculoskeletal imaging chain, including initial patient scheduling, optimized protocoling, magnetic resonance imaging reconstruction, image enhancement, medical image-to-image translation, and AI-aided image interpretation. The substantial developments of advanced algorithms, the emergence of massive quantities of medical data, and the interest of researchers and clinicians reveal the potential for the growing applications of AI to augment the day-to-day efficiency of musculoskeletal radiologists.

TI A new model for coreference resolution based on knowledge representation
   and multi-criteria ranking
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
AB Coreference resolution is critical for improving the performance of all text-based systems including information extraction, document summarization, machine translation, and question-answering. Most of coreference resolution solutions rely on using knowledge resources like lexical knowledge, syntactic knowledge, world knowledge and semantic knowledge. This paper presents a new knowledge-based coreference resolution model using neural network architecture. It uses XLNet embeddings as input and does not rely on any syntactic or dependency parsers. For more efficient span representation and mention detection, we used entity-level information. Mentions were extracted from the text with an unhand engineered mention detector, and the features were extracted from a deep neural network. We also propose a nonlinear multi-criteria ranking model to rank the candidate antecedents. This model simultaneously determines the total score of alternatives and the weight of the features in order to speed up the process of ranking alternatives. Compared to the state-of-the-art models, the simulation results showed significant improvements on the English CoNLL-2012 shared task (+6.4 F1). Moreover, we achieved 96.1% F1 score on the n2c2 medical dataset.

TI A Curvature and Density-based Generative Representation of Shapes
SO COMPUTER GRAPHICS FORUM
AB This paper introduces a generative model for 3D surfaces based on a representation of shapes with mean curvature and metric, which are invariant under rigid transformation. Hence, compared with existing 3D machine learning frameworks, our model substantially reduces the influence of translation and rotation. In addition, the local structure of shapes will be more precisely captured, since the curvature is explicitly encoded in our model. Specifically, every surface is first conformally mapped to a canonical domain, such as a unit disk or a unit sphere. Then, it is represented by two functions: the mean curvature half-density and the vertex density, over this canonical domain. Assuming that input shapes follow a certain distribution in a latent space, we use the variational autoencoder to learn the latent space representation. After the learning, we can generate variations of shapes by randomly sampling the distribution in the latent space. Surfaces with triangular meshes can be reconstructed from the generated data by applying isotropic remeshing and spin transformation, which is given by Dirac equation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on datasets of man-made and biological shapes and compare the results with other methods.

TI Media Education - Epifenomen of Digitalization
SO VOPROSY FILOSOFII
AB Modern education can no longer be imagined without media that strongly decouple the forms generated by the Guttenberg era. Media education today is an epiphenomenon of digital technologies and it should be analyzed also from this point of view. The article deals with the dual nature of media education, media education of teachers and education of pupils and students by teachers with the help of new media. Two myths are represented: the first one about the effectiveness of distance learning, which is dispelled by an indication of its low efficiency, and the ease and accessibility of information leads to the fact that, in general, the student, navigating through various sites, resources, image archives, etc., spends in total more time than comprehending the information received. The second myth concerns the translation of classical education from teacher to student, from older to younger. Today, paternalistic relationships are changing to partnerships. Teachers in the field of information and communication technologies are often teenagers, young people who teach the older generation to use digital technologies. The question is raised about the effectiveness of training programs in which computer game strategies are embedded. The role of training systems and simulators in education is emphasized.

AB Deep neural networks (DNNs) have seen tremendous industrial successes in various applications, including image recognition, machine translation, audio processing, etc. However, they require massive amounts of computations and take a lot of time to process. This quickly becomes a problem in mobile and handheld devices where real-time multimedia applications such as face detection, disaster management, and CCTV require lightweight, fast, and effective computing solutions. The objective of this project is to utilize specialized devices such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) in a heterogeneous computing environment to accelerate the deep learning computations with the constraints of power efficiency. We investigate an efficient DNN implementation and make use of FPGA for fully-connected layer and GPU for floating-point operations. This requires the deep neural network architecture to be implemented in a model parallelism system where the DNN model is broken down and processed in a distributed fashion. The proposed heterogeneous framework idea is implemented using an Nvidia TX2 GPU and a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA. Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework can achieve faster computation and much lower power consumption.

AB Tracking timber in the sawmill environment from the raw material (logs) to the end product (boards) provides various benefits including efficient process control, the optimization of sawing, and the prediction of end-product quality. In practice, the tracking of timber through the sawmilling process requires a methodology for tracing the source of materials after each production step. The tracing is especially difficult through the actual sawing step where a method is needed for identifying from which log each board comes from. In this paper, we propose an automatic method for board identification (board-to-log matching) using the existing sensors in sawmills and multimodal encoder-decoder networks. The method utilizes point clouds from laser scans of log surfaces and grayscale images of boards. First, log surface heightmaps are generated from the point clouds. Then both the heightmaps and board images are converted into "barcode" images using convolutional encoder-decoder networks. Finally, the "barcode" images are utilized to find matching logs for the boards. In the experimental part of the work, different encoder-decoder architectures were evaluated and the effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated using challenging data collected from a real sawmill.

TI Brain Computer Interfaces in Rehabilitation Medicine
SO PM&R
AB One innovation currently influencing physical medicine and rehabilitation is brainecomputer interface (BCI) technology. BCI systems used for motor control record neural activity associated with thoughts, perceptions, and motor intent; decode brain signals into commands for output devices; and perform the user's intended action through an output device. BCI systems used for sensory augmentation transduce environmental stimuli into neural signals interpretable by the central nervous system. Both types of systems have potential for reducing disability by facilitating a user's interaction with the environment. Investigational BCI systems are being used in the rehabilitation setting both as neuroprostheses to replace lost function and as potential plasticity-enhancing therapy tools aimed at accelerating neurorecovery. Populations benefitting from motor and somatosensory BCI systems include those with spinal cord injury, motor neuron disease, limb amputation, and stroke. This article discusses the basic components of BCI for rehabilitation, including recording systems and locations, signal processing and translation algorithms, and external devices controlled through BCI commands. An overview of applications in motor and sensory restoration is provided, along with ethical questions and user perspectives regarding BCI technology.

TI The Mathematics of Superoscillations
SO MEMOIRS OF THE AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY
AB In the past 50 years, quantum physicists have discovered, and experimentally demonstrated, a phenomenon which they termed superoscillations. Aharonov and his collaborators showed that superoscillations naturally arise when dealing with weak values, a notion that provides a fundamentally different way to regard measurements in quantum physics. From a mathematical point of view, superoscillating functions are a superposition of small Fourier components with a bounded Fourier spectrum, which result, when appropriately summed, in a shift that can be arbitrarily large, and well outside the spectrum. Purpose of this work is twofold: on one hand we provide a self-contained survey of the existing literature, in order to offer a systematic mathematical approach to superoscillations; on the other hand, we obtain some new and unexpected results, by showing that superoscillating sequences can be seen of as solutions to a large class of convolution equations and can therefore be treated within the theory of Analytically Uniform spaces. In particular, we will also discuss the persistence of the superoscillatory behavior when superoscillating sequences are taken as initial values of the Schr " odinger equation and other equations.

TI Nano/micromotors for security/defense applications. A review
SO NANOSCALE
AB The new capabilities of man-made micro/nanomotors open up considerable opportunities for diverse security and defense applications. This review highlights new micromotor-based strategies for enhanced security monitoring and detoxification of chemical and biological warfare agents (CBWA). The movement of receptor-functionalized nanomotors offers great potential for sensing and isolating target bio-threats from complex samples. New mobile reactive materials based on zeolite or activated carbon offer considerable promise for the accelerated removal of chemical warfare agents. A wide range of proof-of-concept motor-based approaches, including the detection and destruction of anthrax spores, 'on-off' nerve-agent detection or effective neutralization of chemical warfare agents have thus been demonstrated. The propulsion of micromotors and their corresponding bubble tails impart significant mixing that greatly accelerates such detoxification processes. These nanomotors will thus empower sensing and destruction where stirring large quantities of decontaminating reagents and controlled mechanical agitation are impossible or undesired. New technological breakthroughs and greater sophistication of micro/nanoscale machines will lead to rapid translation of the micromotor research activity into practical defense applications, addressing the escalating threat of CBWA.

AB This paper presents a method for recognizing hand configurations of the Brazilian sign language (LIBRAS) using 3D meshes and 2D projections of the hand. Five actors performing 61 different hand configurations of the LIBRAS language were recorded twice, and the videos were manually segmented to extract one frame with a frontal and one with a lateral view of the hand. For each frame pair, a 3D mesh of the hand was constructed using the Shape from Silhouette method, and the rotation, translation and scale invariant Spherical Harmonics method was used to extract features for classification. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved a correct classification of Rank1 = 86.06% and Rank3 = 96.83% on a database composed of 610 meshes. SVM classification was also performed on a database composed of 610 image pairs using 2D horizontal and vertical projections as features, resulting in Rank1 = 88.69% and Rank3 = 98.36%. Results encourage the use of 3D meshes as opposed to videos or images, given that their direct, real time acquisition is becoming possible due to devices like LeapMotion (R) or high resolution depth cameras.

SO ADVANCED HEALTHCARE MATERIALS
AB Mobile micro- and nano-motors (MNMs) emerge as revolutionary platforms for biomedical applications, including drug delivery, biosensing, non-invasive surgery, and cancer therapy. While for applications in biomedical fields and practical clinical translation, the interactions of these untethered tiny machines with the immune system is an essential issue to be considered. This review highlights the recent approaches of surpassing immune barriers to prevent foreign motors from triggering immune responses. In addition to trials focusing on the function preservation of MNMs, examples of versatile MNMs working with the immune components (immune molecules, immune cells and the whole system) to achieve cancer immunotherapy, immunoassay, and detoxification are outlined. The immune interference part provides researchers an idea about what is the limit presented by the immune components. The coworking part suggests ways to bypass or even utilize the limit. With interdisciplinary cooperation of nanoengineering, materials science, and immunology field, the rationally designed functional MNMs are expected to provide novel opportunities for the biomedical field.

AB While deep learning is a powerful tool for natural language processing (NLP) problems, successful solutions to these problems rely heavily on large amounts of annotated samples. However, manually annotating data is expensive and time-consuming Active Learning (AL) strategies reduce the need for huge volumes of labeled data by iteratively selecting a small number of examples for manual annotation based on their estimated utility in training the given model. In this paper, we argue that since AL strategies choose examples independently, they may potentially select similar examples, all of which may not contribute significantly to the learning process. Our proposed approach, Active(2) Learning (A(2)L), actively adapts to the deep learning model being trained to eliminate such redundant examples chosen by an AL strategy. We show that A(2)L, is widely applicable by using it in conjunction with several different AL strategies and NLP tasks. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed approach is further able to reduce the data requirements of state-of-the-art AL strate- gies by approximate to 3 - 25% on an absolute scale on multiple NLP tasks while achieving the same performance with virtually no additional computation overhead.

TI Synthesizing Systems Biology Knowledge from Omics Using Genome-Scale
   Models
SO PROTEOMICS
AB Omic technologies have enabled the complete readout of the molecular state of a cell at different biological scales. In principle, the combination of multiple omic data types can provide an integrated view of the entire biological system. This integration requires appropriate models in a systems biology approach. Here, genome-scale models (GEMs) are focused upon as one computational systems biology approach for interpreting and integrating multi-omic data. GEMs convert the reactions (related to metabolism, transcription, and translation) that occur in an organism to a mathematical formulation that can be modeled using optimization principles. A variety of genome-scale modeling methods used to interpret multiple omic data types, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and meta-omics are reviewed. The ability to interpret omics in the context of biological systems has yielded important findings for human health, environmental biotechnology, bioenergy, and metabolic engineering. The authors find that concurrent with advancements in omic technologies, genome-scale modeling methods are also expanding to enable better interpretation of omic data. Therefore, continued synthesis of valuable knowledge, through the integration of omic data with GEMs, are expected.

TI An adversarial learning approach for oil spill detection from SAR images

AB Oil spills, caused by accidents or by ships cleaning their tanks, represent big threats for maritime and coastal ecosystems health. A very effective detection of oil spills can be performed using satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems, operating regardless of cloud coverage and sunlight and capable of discriminating oil from regular sea surface. However, discriminating between real oil spills and look-alikes (such as natural oils and seepages, often occurring in upwelling sea areas), although well performed by expert SAR image interpreters, poses a great challenge for automatic processes. In addition, a visual check performed by human operators on a great number of images would be too expensive. Therefore, many solutions for automatic detection have been tried in the last few years, using probabilistic models and, more recently, machine learning. This work presents an innovative solution based on image-to-image translation using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained with an adversarial loss function. The proposed approach has been tested, with very promising results, using Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1 SAR data over the Mediterranean Sea and some areas of the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea.

TI Instanton rate constant calculations using interpolated potential energy
   surfaces in nonredundant, rotationally and translationally invariant
   coordinates
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY
AB A trivial flaw in the utilization of artificial neural networks in interpolating chemical potential energy surfaces (PES) whose descriptors are Cartesian coordinates is their dependence on simple translations and rotations of the molecule under consideration. A different set of descriptors can be chosen to circumvent this problem, internuclear distances, inverse internuclear distances or z-matrix coordinates are three such descriptors. The objective is to use an interpolated PES in instanton rate constant calculations, hence information on the energy, gradient, and Hessian is required at coordinates in the vicinity of the tunneling path. Instanton theory relies on smoothly fitted Hessians, therefore we use energy, gradients, and Hessians in the training procedure. A major challenge is presented in the proper back-transformation of the output gradients and Hessians from internal coordinates to Cartesian coordinates. We perform comparisons between our method, a previous approach and on-the-fly rate constant calcuations on the hydrogen abstraction from methanol and on the hydrogen addition to isocyanic acid.

AB Natural Language Processing has a strong need for large scale quality speech, sign and text resources. The problem in developing countries in African and globally, is the lack of such resources. Significant progress has been made by research groups in South Africa under the coordination Language Resource Management Agency, to collect language resources for the 11 official languages of South Africa. Existing limitations are that resources have been collected manually, in a unidirectional manner that only benefits research institutions and not the wider community that needs them the most and the data is statically pre-packaged and not dynamic. In this paper we detail the design and initial implementations of a ubiquitous language resource management system. The system is aimed at supporting manual collection, crowdsourcing and distribution of language resources and to provide a dynamic resource management system that allows submission, acquisition and quality auditing of languages resources based on user specifications as opposed to pre-packaged data formats. We present initial implementations of the server side and mobile application clients and outline future developments and system integration.

TI A method for solving all joint reactions of 3R2T parallel mechanisms
   with complicated structures and multiple redundant constraints
SO MECHANISM AND MACHINE THEORY
AB Joint reaction solution of a mechanism is an important basis of its strength check, fatigue analysis and friction analysis. This paper presents a general method for solving all joint reactions of three-rotation and two-translation (3R2T) parallel mechanisms with complicated structures and multiple redundant constraints. First, joint reaction expressions with unknown intensities of limb wrenches are derived based on screw theory. Then, the statically indeterminate problem of the class of mechanisms is presented through solving the static equilibrium equation of the moving platform. Third, the statically indeterminate problem of 3R2T parallel mechanisms is dealt with by establishing the deformation compatibility equation and stiffness models of limbs along constraint wrenches. Finally, all joint reactions are determined by substituting the solved wrench intensities into their expressions. Comparisons show the computational results obtained from the proposed method can match well with those obtained from finite element analysis (FEA) models. The proposed method can reveal clearly internal statics relations of a 3R2T mechanism with redundant constraints. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Inspection of printed circuit board (PCB) has been a crucial process in the electronic manufacturing industry to guarantee product quality & reliability, cut manufacturing cost and to increase production. The PCB inspection involves detection of defects in the PCB and classification of those defects in order to identify the roots of defects. In this paper, all 14 types of defects are detected and are classified in all possible classes using referential inspection approach. The proposed algorithm is mainly divided into five stages: Image registration, Preprocessing, Image segmentation, Defect detection and Defect classification. The algorithm is able to perform inspection even when captured test image is rotated, scaled and translated with respect to template image which makes the algorithm rotation, scale and translation in-variant. The novelty of the algorithm lies in its robustness to analyze a defect in its different possible appearance and severity. In addition to this, algorithm takes only 2.528 s to inspect a PCB image. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is verified by conducting experiments on the different PCB images and it shows that the proposed afgorithm is suitable for automatic visual inspection of PCBs.

TI Sentence Similarity Computational Model Based on Information Content
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB Sentence similarity computation is an increasingly important task in applications of natural language processing such as information retrieval, machine translation, text summarization and so on. From the viewpoint of information theory, the essential attribute of natural language is that the carrier of information and the capacity of information can be measured by information content which is already successfully used for word similarity computation in simple ways. Existing sentence similarity methods don't emphasize the information contained by the sentence, and the complicated models they employ often need using empirical parameters or training parameters. This paper presents a fully unsupervised computational model of sentence semantic similarity. It is also a simply and straightforward model that neither needs any empirical parameter nor rely on other NLP tools. The method can obtain state-of-the-art experimental results which show that sentence similarity evaluated by the model is closer to human judgment than multiple competing baselines. The paper also tests the proposed model on the influence of external corpus, the performance of various sizes of the semantic net, and the relationship between efficiency and accuracy.

TI DIALOGUE ACT RECOGNITION APPROACHES
SO COMPUTING AND INFORMATICS
AB This paper deals with automatic dialogue act (DA) recognition. Dialogue acts are sentence-level units that represent states of a dialogue, such as questions, statements, hesitations, etc. The knowledge of dialogue act realizations in a discourse or dialogue is part of the speech understanding and dialogue analysis process. It is of great importance for many applications: dialogue systems, speech recognition, automatic machine translation, etc. The main goal of this paper is to study the existing works about DA recognition and to discuss their respective advantages and drawbacks. A major concern in the DA recognition domain is that, although a few DA annotation schemes seem now to emerge as standards, most of the time, these DA tag-sets have to be adapted to the specificities of a given application, which prevents the deployment of standardized DA databases and evaluation procedures. The focus of this review is put on the various kinds of information that can be used to recognize DAs, such as prosody, lexical, etc., and on the types of models proposed so far to capture this information. Combining these information sources tends to appear nowadays as a prerequisite to recognize DAs.

TI Neural Photometry-Guided Visual Attribute Transfer
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS
AB We present a deep learning-based method for propagating spatially-varying visual material attributes (e.g., texture maps or image stylizations) to larger samples of the same or similar materials. For training, we leverage images of the material taken under multiple illuminations and a dedicated data augmentation policy, making the transfer robust to novel illumination conditions and affine deformations. Our model relies on a supervised image-to-image translation framework and is agnostic to the transferred domain; we showcase a semantic segmentation, a normal map, and a stylization. Following an image analogies approach, the method only requires the training data to contain the same visual structures as the input guidance. Our approach works at interactive rates, making it suitable for material edit applications. We thoroughly evaluate our learning methodology in a controlled setup providing quantitative measures of performance. Last, we demonstrate that training the model on a single material is enough to generalize to materials of the same type without the need for massive datasets.

AB High inter-equipment variability and expensive examination costs of brain imaging remain key challenges in leveraging the heterogeneous scans effectively. Despite rapid growth in image-to-image translation with deep learning models, the target brain data may not always be achievable due to the specific attributes of brain imaging. In this paper, we present a novel generalized brain image synthesis method, powered by our transferable convolutional sparse coding networks, to address the lack of interpretable cross-modal medical image representation learning. The proposed approach masters the ability to imitate the machine-like anatomically meaningful imaging by translating features directly under a series of mathematical processings, leading to the reduced domain discrepancy while enhancing model transferability. Specifically, we first embed the globally normalized features into a domain discrepancy metric to learn the domain-invariant representations, then optimally preserve domain-specific geometrical property to reflect the intrinsic graph structures, and further penalize their subspace mismatching to reduce the generalization error. The overall framework is cast in a minimax setting, and the extensive experiments show that the proposed method yields state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets.

TI CHARM: An Improved Method for Chinese Precoding and Character-Level
   Embedding
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The numerical transformation of text is a key step in natural language processing tasks, among which the word embedding model is the most representative. However, the word embedding model is insufficient in representing unregistered and low-frequency words, and the character-level embedding model makes up for it. Most Chinese character-level models focus on the independent use of Chinese character features such as strokes, radicals, and pinyin, or the shallow correlations between some features, while the inherent correlations among different features such as pronunciation, glyph, stroke order, and word frequency are not fully utilized. Through the statistical analyses of various features of Chinese characters, this paper proposes a precoding method based on Character Helix Alternative Representation Model (CHARM), which can realize the reversible mapping of Chinese characters or words to English-like sequences, and the advantage of this method is verified in three tasks: text classification, named entity recognition and machine translation. Experimental results on several test sets show that the model performs well, and can be a replacement character-level corpus for the original Chinese text.

TI Electrophysiological and transcriptomic correlates of neuropathic pain
   in human dorsal root ganglion neurons
SO BRAIN
AB Neuropathic pain encompasses a diverse array of clinical entities affecting 7-10% of the population, which is challenging to adequately treat. Several promising therapeutics derived from molecular discoveries in animal models of neuropathic pain have failed to translate following unsuccessful clinical trials suggesting the possibility of important cellular-level and molecular differences between animals and humans. Establishing the extent of potential differences between laboratory animals and humans, through direct study of human tissues and/or cells, is likely important in facilitating translation of preclinical discoveries to meaningful treatments. Patch-clamp electrophysiology and RNA-sequencing was performed on dorsal root ganglia taken from patients with variable presence of radicular/neuropathic pain. Findings establish that spontaneous action potential generation in dorsal root ganglion neurons is associated with radicular/neuropathic pain and radiographic nerve root compression. Transcriptome analysis suggests presence of sex-specific differences and reveals gene modules and signalling pathways in immune response and neuronal plasticity related to radicular/neuropathic pain that may suggest therapeutic avenues and that has the potential to predict neuropathic pain in future cohorts.

TI An efficient graph kernel method for non-coding RNA functional
   prediction
SO BIOINFORMATICS
AB Motivation: The importance of RNA protein-coding gene regulation is by now well appreciated. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are known to regulate gene expression at practically every stage, ranging from chromatin packaging to mRNA translation. However the functional characterization of specific instances remains a challenging task in genome scale settings. For this reason, automatic annotation approaches are of interest. Existing computational methods are either efficient but non-accurate or they offer increased precision, but present scalability problems.
   Results: In this article, we present a predictive system based on kernel methods, a type of machine learning algorithm grounded in statistical learning theory. We employ a flexible graph encoding to preserve multiple structural hypotheses and exploit recent advances in representation and model induction to scale to large data volumes. Experimental results on tens of thousands of ncRNA sequences available from the Rfam database indicate that we can not only improve upon state-of-the- art predictors, but also achieve speedups of several orders of magnitude.

AB In this paper, we propose two methods to measure the semantic similarity for multi-lingual and short texts by using Wikipedia. In recent years, people around the world have been continuously generating information about their local area in their own languages on social networking services. Measuring the similarity between the texts is challenging because they are often short and written in various languages. Our methods solve this problem by incorporating inter-language links of Wikipedia into extended naive Bayes (ENB), a probabilistic method of semantic similarity measurements for short texts. The proposed methods represent a multi-lingual short text as a vector of the English version of Wikipedia articles (entities). We conducted an experiment on clustering of tweets written in four languages (English, Spanish, Japanese and Arabic). From the experimental results, we confirmed that our methods outperformed cross-lingual explicit semantic analysis (CL-ESA), which is a method to measure the similarity between texts written in two different languages. Moreover, our methods were competitive with ENB applied to texts that have been translated into English using Google Translate. Our methods enabled similarity measurements for multi-lingual short texts without the cost of machine translations.

SO CUADERNOS EUROPEOS DE DEUSTO
AB The presence of a language in the digital domain is crucial for its survival, as online communication and digital language resources have become the standard in the last decades and will gain more importance in the coming years. In order to develop advanced systems that are considered the basics for an efficient digital communication (e.g. machine translation systems, text-to-speech and speech-to-text converters and digital assistants), it is necessary to digitalise linguistic resources and create tools. In the case of Basque, scholars have studied the creation of digital linguistic resources and the tools that allow the development of those systems for the last forty years. In this paper, we present an overview of the natural language processing and language technology resources developed for Basque, their impact in the process of making Basque a "digital language" and the applications and challenges in multilingual communication. More precisely, we present the wellknown products for Basque, the basic tools and the resources that are behind the products we use every day. Likewise, we would like that this survey serves as a guide for other minority languages that are making their way to digitalisation.

The adaptability of image fusion by multiscale transform (MST) is weak because of the fixed fusion rule. Meanwhile, the image fusion algorithm by supervised learning is hard to realize for lack of large labeled data. Therefore, we propose a unified framework for infrared and visible-image fusion via MST and feature learning. The reasonable fusion rule is designed by learning the attention response via training a novel attention architecture built-in the attention-guided generative adversarial network, which does not need the fused result as the ground truth. The experiment results demonstrate the validity of feature learning and the superiority of the proposed algorithm against other state-of-the-art methods in image fusion task. And the proposed method is one of the effective ways to promote the development of deep learning in the field of insufficient labeled data.

TI Effective Deep Learning Models for Automatic Diacritization of Arabic
   Text
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB While building a text-to-speech system for the Arabic language, we found that the system synthesized speeches with many pronunciation errors. The primary source of these errors is the lack of diacritics in modern standard Arabic writing. These diacritics are small strokes that appear above or below each letter to provide pronunciation and grammatical information. We propose three deep learning models to recover Arabic text diacritics based on our work in a text-to-speech synthesis system using deep learning. The first model is a baseline model used to test how a simple deep learning model performs on the corpora. The second model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture, which resembles our text-to-speech synthesis model with many modifications to suit this problem. The last model is based on the encoder part of the text-to-speech model, which achieves state-of-the-art performances in both word error rate and diacritic error rate metrics. These models will benefit a wide range of natural language processing applications such as text-to-speech, part-of-speech tagging, and machine translation.

TI Convolution-deconvolution word embedding: An end-to-end multi-prototype
   fusion embedding method for natural language processing
SO INFORMATION FUSION
AB Existing unsupervised word embedding methods have been proved to be effective to capture latent semantic information on various tasks of Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, existing word representation methods are incapable of tackling both the polysemous-unaware and task-unaware problems that are common phenomena in NLP tasks. In this work, we present a novel Convolution-Deconvolution Word Embedding (CDWE), an endto-end multi-prototype fusion embedding that fuses context-specific information and task-specific information. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to extend deconvolution (e.g. convolution transpose), which has been widely used in computer vision, to word embedding generation. We empirically demonstrate the efficiency and generalization ability of CDWE by applying it to two representative tasks in NLP: text classification and machine translation. The models of CDWE significantly outperform the baselines and achieve state-of-the-art results on both tasks. To validate the efficiency of CDWE further, we demonstrate how CDWE solves the polysemous-unaware and task-unaware problems via analyzing the Text Deconvolution Saliency, which is an existing strategy for evaluating the outputs of deconvolution.

AB A new and inexpensive concept for MMW imaging is presented in this study. The new concept is based on a glow discharge detector (GDD) row and a commercially inexpensive contact image sensor (CIS). The GDD was found to be a sensitive MMW radiation sensor and was used as a pixel in MMW focal plan arrays (FPA). The up-conversion detection method is based on detection of changes in luminous intensity of the GDD pixel due to the interaction with MMW radiation. A row of 44 GDD pixels were attached to a commercial CIS forming a MMW row sensor (MRS). The CIS samples the GDD row emitted light using a 1728 photo sensor array, then converts the analog data to digital data using a standard ADC board. In order to construct a full 2D MMW image of an object, the MRS is laid on top of a computerized X \Y translation stage similar to the mechanism of scanners and copy machines. A digital lock-in amplifier software algorithm is used to improve the sensitivity and SNR of the MRS signals. The entire system will be controlled using LabVIEW software.

TI Binocular Stereo Vision Three-Dimensional Reconstruction Algorithm Based
   on ICP and SFM
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB Currently, the commonly used multi-angle fusion three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction algorithm mainly includes the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm and the structure from motion (SFM) algorithm. Aiming at the shortcomings of the above algorithms, we propose a multi-angle fusion 3D reconstruction algorithm with binocular stereo based on ICP and SFM. Firstly, the n groups of photos arc taken around the target with binocular cameras by using the SFM algorithm. Then, we manually select the matching feature points of target in each group of binocular images, and calculate the 3D coordinate of matching feature points to generate the n groups of 3D point cloud. Subsequently, the rotation matrix and translation vector within the n groups of 3D point cloud arc calculated and optimized by ICP algorithm. Finally, the n groups of 3D point arc fused, and the 3D geometry of target is recovered by Delaunay triangle. The experimental results show that, the proposed algorithm takes advantages of the binocular cameras, overcomes the disadvantages of ICP and SFM algorithm, and has good vision effect for 3D reconstruction of target.

AB Background: Automated bug localization in large amounts of source files for bug reports is a crucial task in software engineering. However, the different representations of bug reports and source files limited the accuracy of the existing bug localization techniques. Aims: We propose a novel deep learning-based model to improve the accuracy of bug localization for bug reports by expressing them in character and analyzing them with a language model. Method: The proposed model is composed of two main parts: character-level convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) language model. Both bug reports and source files are expressed in a character level and then input into a CNN, whose output is given to an RNN encoder-decoder architecture. Results: The results of preliminary experiments show that the proposed model achieves comparable or even higher accuracy than the existing machine translation-based bug localization technique. Conclusion: The proposed model is capable of automatically localizing buggy files for bug reports and achieves better accuracy by analyzing them in character level where both bug reports and source code can be expressed.

TI Introduction to the Special Issue on Cross-Language Algorithms and
   Applications
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
AB With the increasingly global nature of our everyday interactions, the need for multilingual technologies to support efficient and effective information access and communication cannot be overemphasized. Computational modeling of language has been the focus of Natural Language Processing, a subdiscipline of Artificial Intelligence. One of the current challenges for this discipline is to design methodologies and algorithms that are cross language in order to create multilingual technologies rapidly. The goal of this JAIR special issue on Cross-Language Algorithms and Applications (CLAA) is to present leading research in this area, with emphasis on developing unifying themes that could lead to the development of the science of multi- and cross-lingualism. In this introduction, we provide the reader with the motivation for this special issue and summarize the contributions of the papers that have been included. The selected papers cover a broad range of cross-lingual technologies including machine translation, domain and language adaptation for sentiment analysis, cross-language lexical resources, dependency parsing, information retrieval and knowledge representation. We anticipate that this special issue will serve as an invaluable resource for researchers interested in topics of cross-lingual natural language processing.

TI A novel tissue-specific alternatively spliced form of the A-to-I RNA
   editing enzyme ADAR2
SO RNA BIOLOGY
AB ADAR2, a member of the adenosine deaminase family of proteins, is the enzyme that edits the Q/R site in the GluR-B transcript, an important physiological A-to-I editing event. ADAR2 pre-mRNA undergoes a number of known alternative splicing events, affecting its function. Here we describe a novel alternatively spliced exon, located within intron 7 of the human gene, which we term "exon 7a". This alternatively spliced exon is highly conserved in the mammalian ADAR2 gene. It has stop codons in all three frames and is down regulated by NMD. We show that the level of exon 7a inclusion differs between different human tissues, with the highest levels of inclusion in skeletal muscle, heart and testis. In the brain, where the level of editing is known to be high, the level of exon 7a inclusion is low. The new alternative form was also found in supraspliceosomes, which constitute the nuclear pre-mRNA processing machine. The high conservation of the novel ADAR2 alternative exon in mammals indicates a physiological importance for this exon.

TI miRNAMap: genomic maps of microRNA genes and their target genes in
   mammalian genomes
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Recent work has demonstrated that microRNAs ( miRNAs) are involved in critical biological processes by suppressing the translation of coding genes. This work develops an integrated database, miRNAMap, to store the known miRNA genes, the putative miRNA genes, the known miRNA targets and the putative miRNA targets. The known miRNA genes in four mammalian genomes such as human, mouse, rat and dog are obtained from miRBase, and experimentally validated miRNA targets are identified in a survey of the literature. Putative miRNA precursors were identified by RNAz, which is a non-coding RNA prediction tool based oncomparative sequence analysis. The mature miRNA of the putative miRNA genes is accurately determined using a machine learning approach, mmiRNA. Then, miRanda was applied to predict the miRNA targets within the conserved regions in 3'-UTR of the genes in the four mammalian genomes. The miRNAMap also provides the expression profiles of the known miRNAs, cross-species comparisons, gene annotations and cross-links to other biological databases. Both textual and graphical web interface are provided to facilitate the retrieval of data from the miRNAMap. The database is freely available at http://mirnamap.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/.

TI Ribosome-mediated biosynthesis of pyridazinone oligomers in vitro
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The ribosome is a macromolecular machine that catalyzes the sequence-defined polymerization of L-alpha-amino acids into polypeptides. The catalysis of peptide bond formation between amino acid substrates is based on entropy trapping, wherein the adjacency of transfer RNA (tRNA)-coupled acyl bonds in the P-site and the alpha-amino groups in the A-site aligns the substrates for coupling. The plasticity of this catalytic mechanism has been observed in both remnants of the evolution of the genetic code and modern efforts to reprogram the genetic code (e.g., ribosomal incorporation of non-canonical amino acids, ribosomal ester formation). However, the limits of ribosome-mediated polymerization are underexplored. Here, rather than peptide bonds, we demonstrate ribosome-mediated polymerization of pyridazinone bonds via a cyclocondensation reaction between activated gamma-keto and alpha-hydrazino ester monomers. In addition, we demonstrate the ribosome-catalyzed synthesis of peptide-hybrid oligomers composed of multiple sequence-defined alternating pyridazinone linkages. Our results highlight the plasticity of the ribosome's ancient bond-formation mechanism, expand the range of non-canonical polymeric backbones that can be synthesized by the ribosome, and open the door to new applications in synthetic biology.

SO INSIGHTS INTO IMAGING
AB Objectives Radiomic models present an avenue to improve oesophageal adenocarcinoma assessment through quantitative medical image analysis. However, model selection is complicated by the abundance of available predictors and the uncertainty of their relevance and reproducibility. This analysis reviews recent research to facilitate precedent-based model selection for prospective validation studies. Methods This analysis reviews research on 18F-FDG PET/CT, PET/MRI and CT radiomics in oesophageal adenocarcinoma between 2016 and 2021. Model design, testing and reporting are evaluated according to the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) score and Radiomics Quality Score (RQS). Key results and limitations are analysed to identify opportunities for future research in the area. Results Radiomic models of stage and therapeutic response demonstrated discriminative capacity, though clinical applications require greater sensitivity. Although radiomic models predict survival within institutions, generalisability is limited. Few radiomic features have been recommended independently by multiple studies. Conclusions Future research must prioritise prospective validation of previously proposed models to further clinical translation.

AB Domains such as energy management rely heavily on dashboards and other related interfaces to manage the infrastructure and resources. The users of this domain use dashboards to manage the data and extensively perform periodic analysis to save energy and cost. Creating multiple dashboards for visualization of data is not user-friendly from a design perspective. This motivates the need of a single interface through which users can do data exploration, visualization and summarizing. Combining this with features such as anomaly detection can identify various issues and assist in day to day monitoring of an energy management center.
   In this paper, we present ROC (Resource Optimization Center) Bot, a novel data exploration tool with a natural language interface. ROC Bot leverages recent advances in deep models to make query understanding more robust in the following ways: First, ROC Bot uses a deep model to translate natural language statements to SQL, making the translation process more robust to paraphrasing and other linguistic variations. Second, to support the users in automatically summarizing data, ROC Bot provides a machine learning model that helps in writing natural looking summaries in any given tabular data.

AB Sequence to sequence models attempt to capture the correlation between all the words in the input and output sequences. While this is quite useful for machine translation where the correlation among the words is indeed quite strong, it becomes problematic for conversation modelling where the correlation is often at a much abstract level. In contrast, humans tend to focus on the essential concepts discussed in the conversation context and generate responses accordingly. In this paper, we attempt to mimic this response generating mechanism by learning the essential concepts in the context and response in an unsupervised manner. The proposed model, referred to as Mask & Focus maps the input context to a sequence of concepts which are then used to generate the response concepts. Together, the context and the response concepts generate the final response. In order to learn context concepts from the training data automatically, we mask words in the input and observe the effect of masking on response generation. We train our model to learn those response concepts that have high mutual information with respect to the context concepts, thereby guiding the model to focus on the context concepts. Mask & Focus achieves significant improvement over the existing baselines in several established metrics for dialogues.

AB Multiple studies have probed representations emerging in neural networks trained for end-to-end NLP tasks and examined what word-level linguistic information may be encoded in the representations. In classical probing, a classifier is trained on the representations to extract the target linguistic information. However, there is a threat of the classifier simply memorizing the linguistic labels for individual words, instead of extracting the linguistic abstractions from the representations, thus reporting false positive results. While considerable efforts have been made to minimize the memorization problem, the task of actually measuring the amount of memorization happening in the classifier has been understudied so far. In our work, we propose a simple general method for measuring the memorization effect, based on a symmetric selection of comparable sets of test words seen versus unseen in training. Our method can be used to explicitly quantify the amount of memorization happening in a probing setup, so that an adequate setup can be chosen and the results of the probing can be interpreted with a reliability estimate. We exemplify this by showcasing our method on a case study of probing for part of speech in a trained neural machine translation encoder.

AB Tour routes designning is a non-trival step for the tourists who want to take an excursion journey in someplace which he or she is not familiar with. For most tourists this problem represents an excruciating challenge due to such unfamiliarity. Few existing works focus on using other tourists' experiences in the city to recommend a personalized route for the new comers. To take full advantage of tourists' historical routes in route recommendation, we propose LearningTour, a model recommending routes by learning how other tourists travel in the city before. Giving that the tourist's route is actually a special variance of time sequence, we treat such route as a special language and thus treat such recommendation process as a unique translation process. Therefore we use a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model to proceed such learning and do the recommendation job. This model comprises a encoder and a decoder. The encoder encodes users' interest to the context vector and the decoder decodes the vector to the generated route. Finally, we implemented our model on several real datasets and demonstrate its effeciency.

AB statistical N-grams language models (LMs) have shown to be very effective in natural language processing (NLP), particularly in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation. In fact, the successful impact of LMs promote to introduce efficient techniques as well as different types models in various linguistic applications. The LMs mainly include two types that are grammars and statistical language models that is also called N-grams. The main difference between grammars and statistical language models is that the statistical language models are based on the estimation of probabilities for words sequences while the grammars usually do not have probabilities. Despite there are many toolkits that are used to create LMs, however, this work employs two well-known language modeling toolkits with focus on the Arabic text. The implementing toolkits include the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)-Cambridge Language Modeling Toolkit and the Cambridge University Hidden Markov Model Toolkit (HTK) language modeling toolkits. For clarification, we used a small Arabic text corpus to compute the N-grams for 1-gram, 2-gram, and 3-gram. In addition, this paper demonstrates the intermediate steps that are needed to generate the ARPA-format LMs using both toolkits.

AB Recent studies have determined that the learned token embeddings of large-scale neural language models are degenerated to be anisotropic with a narrow-cone shape. This phenomenon, called the representation degeneration problem, facilitates an increase in the overall similarity between token embeddings that negatively affect the performance of the models. Although the existing methods that address the degeneration problem based on observations of the phenomenon triggered by the problem improves the performance of the text generation, the training dynamics of token embeddings behind the degeneration problem are still not explored. In this study, we analyze the training dynamics of the token embeddings focusing on rare token embedding. We demonstrate that the specific part of the gradient for rare token embeddings is the key cause of the degeneration problem for all tokens during training stage. Based on the analysis, we propose a novel method called, adaptive gradient gating (AGG). AGG addresses the degeneration problem by gating the specific part of the gradient for rare token embeddings. Experimental results from language modeling, word similarity, and machine translation tasks quantitatively and qualitatively verify the effectiveness of AGG.

AB Recent years have witnessed various types of generative models for natural language generation (NLG), especially RNNs or transformer based sequence-to-sequence models, as well as variational autoencoder (VAE) and generative adversarial network (GAN) based models. However, flow-based generative models, which achieve strong performance in image generation due to their invertibility and exact density estimation properties, have been less explored for NLG. In this paper, we propose a flow-based language generation model by adapting previous flow generative models to language generation via continuous input embeddings, adapted affine coupling structures, and a novel architecture for autoregressive text generation. We also apply our framework to Sequence-to-Sequence generation, including text- and video-based Question Generation (QG) and Neural Machine Translation (NMT), and data augmentation for Question Answering (QA). We use our language flow model to provide extra input features for QG and NMT, which achieves improvements over the strong QG baselines on SQuAD and TVQA and NMT baseline on WMT16. We also augment QA data with new context by injecting noise to the latent features of the language flow and show this augmentation leads to a large performance improvement from strong baselines on SQuAD and TVQA.

AB Despite its importance to experimental design, statistical power (the probability that, given a real effect, an experiment will reject the null hypothesis) has largely been ignored by the NLP community. Underpowered experiments make it more difficult to discern the difference between statistical noise and meaningful model improvements, and increase the chances of exaggerated findings. By meta-analyzing a set of existing NLP papers and datasets, we characterize typical power for a variety of settings and conclude that underpowered experiments are common in the NLP literature. In particular, for several tasks in the popular GLUE benchmark, small test sets mean that most attempted comparisons to state of the art models will not be adequately powered. Similarly, based on reasonable assumptions, we find that the most typical experimental design for human rating studies will be underpowered to detect small model differences, of the sort that are frequently studied. For machine translation, we find that typical test sets of 2000 sentences have approximately 75% power to detect differences of I BLEU point. To improve the situation going forward, we give an overview of best practices for power analysis in NLP and release a series of notebooks to assist with future power analyses.(1)

SO PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATION THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB This study analyses the impact of TAPs on effort in monolingual post-editing tasks involving two machine-translated texts from English into Brazilian Portuguese. The analysis focuses on indicators of temporal effort (task execution time, text production time, total pause time, and pause count), technical effort (numbers of insertions, deletions, navigation and return keystrokes, copy/cut-and-paste keystrokes, and mouse operations, as well as the total number of keystrokes and mouse operations), and cognitive effort (average fixation duration, fixation count, total gaze time, average pupil size, and duration of the longest fixation). Results from 43 participants indicate that temporal, technical and cognitive aspects of effort are significantly influenced by verbalization, i.e., the TAP condition, on the basis of 13 indicators: all four indicators of temporal effort, four out of seven indicators of technical effort (numbers of insertions, deletions, and mouse operations, and the total number of keystrokes and mouse operations), and all five indicators of cognitive effort. The results also point out that the impact of TAPs on post-editing effort does not depend on participants' translation experience.

TI Genome wide analysis of 3 ' UTR sequence elements and proteins
   regulating mRNA stability during maternal-to-zygotic transition in
   zebrafish
SO GENOME RESEARCH
AB Posttranscriptional regulation plays a crucial role in shaping gene expression. During the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT), thousands of maternal transcripts are regulated. However, how different cis-elements and trans-factors are integrated to determine mRNA stability remains poorly understood. Here, we show that most transcripts are under combinatorial regulation by multiple decay pathways during zebrafish MZT. By using a massively parallel reporter assay, we identified cis-regulatory sequences in the 3' UTR, including U-rich motifs that are associated with increased mRNA stability. In contrast, miR-430 target sequences, UAUUUAUU AU-rich elements (ARE), CCUC, and CUGC elements emerged as destabilizing motifs, with miR-430 and AREs causing mRNA deadenylation upon genome activation. We identified trans-factors by profiling RNA-protein interactions and found that poly(U)-binding proteins are preferentially associated with 3' UTR sequences and stabilizing motifs. We show that this activity is antagonized by C-rich motifs and correlated with protein binding. Finally, we integrated these regulatory motifs into a machine learning model that predicts reporter mRNA stability in vivo.

AB With the ongoing growth in number of digital articles in a wider set of languages and the expanding use of different languages, we need annotation methods that enable browsing multi-lingual corpora. Multilingual probabilistic topic models have recently emerged as a group of semi-supervised machine learning models that can be used to perform thematic explorations on collections of texts in multiple languages. However, these approaches require theme-aligned training data to create a language-independent space. This constraint limits the amount of scenarios that this technique can offer solutions to train and makes it difficult to scale up to situations where a huge collection of multi-lingual documents are required during the training phase. This paper presents an unsupervised document similarity algorithm that does not require parallel or comparable corpora, or any other type of translation resource. The algorithm annotates topics automatically created from documents in a single language with cross-lingual labels and describes documents by hierarchies of multi-lingual concepts from independently-trained models. Experiments performed on the English, Spanish and French editions of JCR-Acquis corpora reveal promising results on classifying and sorting documents by similar content.

TI Combining the Attention Network and Semantic Representation for Chinese
   Verb Metaphor Identification
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Metaphor is the central issue of language and thinking. Metaphor identification plays a significant preliminary role in the field of machine translation, reading comprehension, and automatic summarization, making it a focus of natural language processing. Recently, research into Chinese verb metaphor identification has become a widespread concern. The main problem is that the usage of semantic resources is relatively simple, and there is a lack of deep semantic support. Therefore, this paper proposes a word representation method suitable for metaphor classification tasks, which combines the traditional word vector with structural information from the Synonym Thesaurus, so that the word vector can contain the abstraction degree of the word in the metaphor. On this basis, we propose a verb metaphor attention network based on subject-predicate and verb-object relationships, which gives full consideration to the global syntactic information when we perform LSTM encoding and calculate the weight of each word. At the same time, it can facilitate the understanding of literalness and non-literalness. The experimental results show that the identification effect improves on the existing results, indicating that word representation combining semantic resources and attention network can improve the verb metaphor identification performance.

TI Integrated approach for human action recognition using edge spatial
   distribution, direction pixel and R-transform
SO ADVANCED ROBOTICS
AB In this article, a simple yet proficient approach for the recognition of human action and Activity is presented. This method is based on the integration of translation and rotation of the human body. The proposed framework undergoes three major steps: (i) the shape of the human action/activity is represented through the computation of average energy images using edge spatial distribution of gradients along with the directional variation of the pixel values, (ii) the orientation-based rotational information of the human action is computed through R-transform and (iii) a descriptor is developed by the fusion of translational features with rotational features. The fusion of features possesses the advantages exhibited by both local and global features of the silhouette and thus provides the discriminating feature representation for human activity recognition. The performance of descriptor is evaluated through a hybrid approach of support vector machine and the nearest neighbour classifiers on standard data set. The proposed method has shown superior results in terms of recognition accuracy in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.

TI Two-Word Collocation Extraction Using Monolingual Word Alignment Method
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Statistical bilingual word alignment has been well studied in the field of machine translation. This article adapts the bilingual word alignment algorithm into a monolingual scenario to extract collocations from monolingual corpus, based on the fact that the words in a collocation tend to co-occur in similar contexts as in bilingual word alignment. First, the monolingual corpus is replicated to generate a parallel corpus, in which each sentence pair consists of two identical sentences. Next, the monolingual word alignment algorithm is employed to align potentially collocated words. Finally, the aligned word pairs are ranked according to the alignment scores and candidates with higher scores are extracted as collocations. We conducted experiments on Chinese and English corpora respectively. Compared to previous approaches that use association measures to extract collocations from co-occurrence word pairs within a given window, our method achieves higher precision and recall. According to human evaluation, our method achieves precisions of 62% on a Chinese corpus and 64% on an English corpus. In particular, we can extract collocations with longer spans, achieving a higher precision of 83% on the long-span (> 6 words) Chinese collocations.

SO APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB The availability of a robust and reliable continuous culture apparatus that eliminates wall growth problems would lead to many applications in the microbial field, including allowing genetically engineered strains to recover high fitness, improving biodegradation strains, and predicting likely antibiotic resistance mechanisms. We describe the design and implementation of a novel automated continuous culture machine that can be used both in time-dependent mode (similar to a chemostat) and turbidostat modes, in which wall growth is circumvented through the use of a long, variably divisible tube of growth medium. This tube can be restricted with clamps to create a mobile growth chamber region in which static portions of the tube and the associated medium are replaced together at equal rates. To functionally test the device as a tool for re-adaptation of engineered strains, we evolved a strain carrying a highly deleterious deletion of Elongation Factor P, a gene involved in translation. In 200 generations over 2 weeks of dilution cycles, the evolved strain improved in generation time by a factor of three, with no contaminations and easy manipulation.

AB Misinformation has become a major concern in recent last years given its spread across our information sources. In the past years, many NLP tasks have been introduced in this area, with some systems reaching good results on English language datasets. Existing AI based approaches for fighting misinformation in literature suggest automatic stance detection as an integral first step to success. Our paper aims at utilizing this progress made for English to transfers that knowledge into other languages, which is a non-trivial task due to the domain gap between English and the target languages. We propose a black-box non-intrusive method that utilizes techniques from Domain Adaptation to reduce the domain gap, without requiring any human expertise in the target language, by leveraging low-quality data in both a supervised and unsupervised manner. This allows us to rapidly achieve similar results for stance detection for the Zulu language, the target language in this work, as are found for English. We also provide a stance detection dataset in the Zulu language. Our experimental results show that by leveraging English datasets and machine translation we can increase performances on both English data along with other languages.

TI Learning Bilingual Word Embedding Mappings with Similar Words in Related
   Languages Using GAN
SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Cross-lingual word embeddings display words from different languages in the same vector space. They provide reasoning about semantics, compare the meaning of words across languages and word meaning in multilingual contexts, necessary to bilingual lexicon induction, machine translation, and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper proposes an efficient approach to team bilingual transform mapping between monolingual word embeddings in language pairs. We choose ten different languages from three different language families and downloaded their last update Wikipedia dumps' Then, with some pre-processing steps and using word2vec, we produce word embeddings for them. We select seven language pairs from chosen languages. Since the selected languages are relative, they have thousands of identical words with similar meanings. With these identical dictation words and word embedding models of each language, we create training, validation and, test sets for the language pairs. We then use a generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn the transform mapping between word embeddings of source and target languages. The average accuracy of our proposed method in all language pairs is 71.34%. The highest accuracy is achieved for the Turkish-Azerbaijani language pair with the accuracy 78.32%., which is noticeably higher than prior methods.

However, there are only several works that address facial landmark detection in thermal images. The main challenge is the limited number of annotated datasets. In this work, we present a thermal face dataset with annotated face bounding boxes and facial landmarks. The dataset contains 2,556 thermal images of 142 individuals, where each thermal image is paired with the corresponding visual image. To the best of our knowledge, our dataset is the largest in terms of the number of individuals. In addition, our dataset can be employed for tasks such as thermal-to-visual image translation, thermal-visual face recognition, and others. We trained two models for the facial landmark detection task to show the efficacy of our dataset. The first model is a classic machine learning model based on an ensemble of regression trees. The second model is a deep learning model based on the U-net architecture. The dataset, annotations, source code, and pre-trained models are publicly available to advance research in thermal face analysis.

TI A Survey on Deep Learning for Named Entity Recognition
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
AB Named entity recognition (NER) is the task to identify mentions of rigid designators from text belonging to predefined semantic types such as person, location, organization etc. NER always serves as the foundation for many natural language applications such as question answering, text summarization, and machine translation. Early NER systems got a huge success in achieving good performance with the cost of human engineering in designing domain-specific features and rules. In recent years, deep learning, empowered by continuous real-valued vector representations and semantic composition through nonlinear processing, has been employed in NER systems, yielding stat-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review on existing deep learning techniques for NER. We first introduce NER resources, including tagged NER corpora and off-the-shelf NER tools. Then, we systematically categorize existing works based on a taxonomy along three axes: distributed representations for input, context encoder, and tag decoder. Next, we survey the most representative methods for recent applied techniques of deep learning in new NER problem settings and applications. Finally, we present readers with the challenges faced by NER systems and outline future directions in this area.

AB Adaptive gradient methods such as RMSPROP and ADAM use exponential moving estimate of the squared gradient to compute adaptive step sizes, achieving better convergence than SGD in face of noisy objectives. However, ADAM can have undesirable convergence behaviors due to unstable or extreme adaptive learning rates. Methods such as AMSGRAD and ADABOUND have been proposed to stabilize the adaptive learning rates of ADAM in the later stage of training, but they do not outperform ADAM in some practical tasks such as training Transformers [27]. In this paper, we propose an adaptive learning rate principle, in which the running mean of squared gradient in ADAM is replaced by a weighted mean, with weights chosen to maximize the estimated variance of each coordinate. This results in a faster adaptation to the local gradient variance, which leads to more desirable empirical convergence behaviors than ADAM. We prove the proposed algorithm converges under mild assumptions for nonconvex stochastic optimization problems, and demonstrate the improved efficacy of our adaptive averaging approach on machine translation, natural language understanding and large-batch pretraining of BERT.

AB Quite surprisingly, exact maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding of neural language generators frequently leads to low-quality results (Stahlberg and Byrne, 2019). Rather, most state-of-the-art results on language generation tasks are attained using beam search despite its overwhelmingly high search error rate. This implies that the MAP objective alone does not express the properties we desire in text, which merits the question: if beam search is the answer, what was the question? We frame beam search as the exact solution to a different decoding objective in order to gain insights into why high probability under a model alone may not indicate adequacy. We find that beam search enforces uniform information density in text, a property motivated by cognitive science. We suggest a set of decoding objectives that explicitly enforce this property and find that exact decoding with these objectives alleviates the problems encountered when decoding poorly calibrated language generation models. Additionally, we analyze the text produced using various decoding strategies and see that, in our neural machine translation experiments, the extent to which this property is adhered to strongly correlates with BLEU. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/rycolab/uid-decoding.

AB We tackle the task of environmental event classification by drawing inspiration from the transformer neural network architecture used in machine translation. We modify this attention-based feedforward structure in such a way that allows the resulting model to use audio as well as video to compute sound event predictions.
   We perform extensive experiments with these adapted transformers on an audiovisual data set, obtained by appending relevant visual information to an existing large-scale weakly labeled audio collection. The employed multi-label data contains clip-level annotation indicating the presence or absence of 17 classes of environmental sounds, and does not include temporal information.
   We show that the proposed modified transformers strongly improve upon previously introduced models and in fact achieve state-of-the-art results. We also make a compelling case for devoting more attention to research in multimodal audiovisual classification by proving the usefulness of visual information for the task at hand, namely audio event recognition.
   In addition, we visualize internal attention patterns of the audiovisual transformers and in doing so demonstrate their potential for performing multimodal synchronization.

TI Arabic text preprocessing for the natural language processing
   applications
SO ARAB GULF JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH
AB A new approach for preprocessing vowelized and unvowelized Arabic texts in order to prepare them for Natural Language Processing (NLP) purposes is described. The developed apprach is rule-based and made up of four phases: text tokenization, word light stemming, words' morphological analysis, and text annotation. The first phase preprocesses the input text in order to isolate the words and represent them in a formal way. The second phase applies a light stemmer in order to extract the stem of each word by eliminating the prefixes and suffixes. The third phase is a rule-based morphological analyzer that determines the root and the morphological pattern for each extracted stem. The last phase produces an annotated text where each word is tagged with its morphological attributes. The preprocessor presented in this paper is capable of dealing with vowelized and unvowelized words, and provides the input words along with relevant linguistics information needed by different applications. It is designed to be used with different NLP applications such as machine translation, text summarization; text correction, information retrieval, and automatic vowelization of Arabic text.

TI The plot machine as an annihilator of sense ("House of Leaves" by Mark
   Z. Danielewski)
SO SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
AB The paper is devoted to the role of the plot in the literature in the second degree. "The literature in the second degree" is the term of G. Genette. It means that the content of the literary text is directed to the literature itself but not to the reality. Like that, the immanent nature of the literary text includes in its structure such potential elements as intertext, paratext, hypertext, metatext and archetext. The hero of the literature of the second degree becomes not a personage, but the language. In this case, the plot loses the independent nature and turns into the plot machine. The text turns into the commentary of the other text, but not into the fragment of the reality. As a result, a common sense disappears from the text. This tendency originated in the first part of the 20th century in the literature of the modernism, for instance in the novel "Gift" by V. Nabokov or in the tale "Garden of diverging tracks" by J. Borges. Later, in the literature of postmodernism, the text loses the signs of structure order and submits to the principles of a rhizome. The paper deals with the novel "House of Leaves" by Mark Z. Danielewski. On the basis of the novel, the method of divergence of six languages (semiotic codes) inaugurates. The first code is connected with the history of the Navidson family, which has found itself in the house-transformer constantly changing the spatial coordinates. The second code appears in consequence of the intersemiotic translation of the narration to the code of movies. The third language is connected with the transformation of movies into scraps of sheets, written by different people after blind Zampano's dictation. The fourth code is the metalanguage of the commentary to these scraps and virtual film. The fifth code belongs to the reader of these scraps -Johnny Truant, who becomes the lunatic in the process of the reading. At last, the sixth code discovers pure semiotic basis. It consists of the diverse of prints, emptiness, photo, insertions, etc. Thanks to the decentralization of these codes, the specific game, which leads to the annihilation of common sense and stereotype language, arises.

TI TimeLine Depiction: an approach to graphical notation for supporting

SO INNOVATIONS IN SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
AB The finite-state verification techniques such as model checking allow for automated checking whether system model described with automata satisfy temporal properties, or not. The temporal properties should be typically specified in temporal logic formulae, which is a difficult task for programmers who aren't verification experts. Therefore, there is a few of research to propose description languages with which non-experts can accurately express temporal requirements on system's behaviors and the methods transforming them automatically into temporal property specification of particular model checker. We analyzed various researches aimed at the construction of property specifications, that is, machine translation from natural language to temporal logical formula, property specification pattern and graphical scenarios for specifying property, and so on. Based on the analysis, in this paper, we present a visual language called TimeLineDepic, which is a user-friendly graphical notation for temporal property description and whose expressive power is same as other languages. And we propose a method to transform TimeLineDepic to buchi automata (never claim) and insert it in promela-based model for model checker SPIN.

SO WORLD PATENT INFORMATION
AB Digitalization is a strong driver in society, business, and science. Patent management, especially the search for and analysis of patents, is also being shaped by digitalization advances. Unlike prior studies - which mainly focus on the purposes and methods used for patent search and analysis -, this review focuses on the underlying digitalization trends that have become mainstream in the landscape of providers' patent information databases and interrogation tools. By analyzing seven public and 20 commercial providers, a total of 15 different digitalization trends are outlined. Public providers specifically focus on trends for patent search, e.g. machine translation, while commercial providers rather focus on more sophisticated trends for patent analysis, e.g. predictive analytics. All of the 15 identified trends point toward four digitalization domains that were discerned by means of a hybrid coding approach, namely cloud computer technology, data management, data analytics, and artificial intelligence. Conclusively, tensions that are caused by the progress of these trends are discussed, e.g. the seamless transition from search to analysis versus less explainability.

TI Topology-Sensitive Neural Architecture Search for Language Modeling
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Recently Neural Architecture Search has drawn interest from researchers because of its ability to learn neural network architectures from data automatically. The differentiable methods are widely used because they can obtain better architectures with less computational resources. However, the method is with a mismatch between training and inference. In training process, we minimize the loss on the expected output of an ensemble of models, whereas we infer a single model at test time. In this paper we present a topology-sensitive approach to neural architecture search. Unlike previous work, we do not resort to the search strategy that works in a different scope of architecture topologies with inference. Instead, the topology of a neural network is explicitly modeled in the training/search process. We experiment with our method on the PTB and WikiText language modeling tasks. On the PTB dataset, it outperforms several strong baselines. Also, the newly-found architecture shows good transferability to named entity recognition and machine translation tasks. In particular, experimental results show our method outperforms the strong baseline by a BLEU score of 0.6 on IWSLT15 English-Vietnamese task and a BLEU score of 0.9 on WMT14 English-German task.

TI Biplane Fluoroscopic-Guided Percutaneous Thoracic Instrumentation: A
   Technical Note
SO CUREUS
AB Biplane fluoroscopy in a hybrid operating room (OR) is commonly used for neuroendovascular and hybrid open/endovascular cases. The image quality is far superior to most C-arm fluoroscopy machines in the regular OR. This advantage can be particularly useful for upper and mid-thoracic percutaneous screw placement because the C-arm visualization in the regular OR is suboptimal due to shoulders absorbing the majority of the photons on lateral fluoroscopy. A 31-year-old man was ejected following a motor vehicle accident and sustained a T7 burst fracture with anterior translation on T8 and spinal cord transection. Following stabilization in the intensive care unit, the patient was taken to the biplane hybrid OR for percutaneous pedicle screw fixation. The patient had percutaneous instrumentation and fixation of T5-T10, and sequential reducers were also used to re-align T7 and T8. The use of biplane fluoroscopy enhanced safety and visualization. The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication. We believe this is an unrealized and underutilized function of a biplane hybrid OR that bears further investigation and study.

AB Antonymy is one of the fundamental relations shaping the organization of the semantic lexicon. Therefore, automatic detection of antonymy can be leveraged to make contributions to different NLP tasks, such as Machine Translation, Sentiment Analysis, and Information Retrieval. Currently, most prior studies just focus on discriminating between antonyms and synonyms. However, not only synonymy but other semantic relations, such as hypernymy, co-hyponyms, which also get high similarities thereby making it hard to discriminate. Therefore, it is necessary to make a thorough research on identifying antonyms from a wide variety of other semantic relations. In this paper, we aim to identify Vietnamese antonyms pairs according to the vector semantics approach. Specifically, we build up specialized word embedding models by incorporating lexical-semantic resource and distributional information. In addition, we propose specialized Vietnamese features and utilize mutual information between words in order to integrate with word embedding vectors. This aims to generate more meaningful feature vectors for supervised classifiers solving antonym detection problems. Furthermore, we construct three reliable Vietnamese testing datasets consisting of AntSyn1000, AntHyp1000, and AntMix1000, for this task. Experimental results conducted on the datasets demonstrated that our model performs effectively.

AB Mixture of Softmaxes (MoS) has been shown to be effective at addressing the expressiveness limitation of Softmax-based models. Despite the known advantage, MoS is practically sealed by its large consumption of memory and computational time due to the need of computing multiple Softmaxes. In this work, we set out to unleash the power of MoS in practical applications by investigating improved word coding schemes, which could effectively reduce the vocabulary size and hence relieve the memory and computation burden. We show both BPE and our proposed Hybrid-LightRNN lead to improved encoding mechanisms that can halve the time and memory consumption of MoS without performance losses. With MoS, we achieve an improvement of 1.5 BLEU scores on IWSLT 2014 German-to-English corpus and an improvement of 0.76 CIDEr score on image captioning. Moreover, on the larger WMT 2014 machine translation dataset, our MoS-boosted Transformer yields 29.6 BLEU score for English-to-German and 42.1 BLEU score for English-to-French, outperforming the single-Softmax Transformer by 0.9 and 0.4 BLEU scores respectively and achieving the state-of-the-art result on WMT 2014 English-to-German task.

TI A Novel Rule-Based Root Extraction Algorithm for Arabic Language
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB Non-vocalized Arabic words are ambiguous words, because non-vocalized words may have different meanings. Therefore, these words may have more than one root. Many Arabic root extraction algorithms have been conducted to extract the roots of non-vocalized Arabic words. However, most of them return only one root and produce lower accuracy than reported when they are tested on different datasets. Arabic root extraction algorithm is an urgent need for applications like information retrieval systems, indexing, text mining, text classification, data compression, spell checking, text summarization, question answering systems and machine translation. In this work, a new rule-based Arabic root extraction algorithm is developed and focuses to overcome the limitation of previous works. The proposed algorithm is compared to the algorithm of Khoja, which is a well-known Arabic root extraction algorithm that produces high accuracy. The testing process was conducted on the corpus of Thalji, which is mainly built to test and compare Arabic roots extraction algorithms. It contains 720,000 word-root pairs from 12000 roots, 430 prefixes, 320 suffixes, and 4320 patterns. The experimental result shows that the algorithm of Khoja achieved 63%, meanwhile the proposed algorithm achieved 94% of accuracy.

TI A GF miniature resource grammar for Tswana: modelling the proper verb
SO LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
AB The Grammatical Framework (GF) not only offers state of the art grammar-based machine translation support between an increasing number of languages through its so-called Resource Grammar Library, but is also fast becoming a de facto framework for developing multilingual controlled natural languages (CNLs). For a natural language to share maximally in the opportunities that GF-based multilingual CNL support presents, it has to have a GF resource grammar. Tswana, an agglutinating Bantu language, spoken in Southern Africa as one of the eleven official languages of South Africa, does not yet have such a grammar. This article reports on the development of a so-called miniature resource grammar, a first step towards a full resource grammar for Tswana. The focus is on the modelling of the Tswana proper verb as it occurs in simple sentences. The ( proper) verb is the morphologically most complex word category in Tswana, and therefore constitutes a notable contribution towards the development of a GF resource grammar for Tswana. The computational model is discussed in some detail, implemented and tested on a systematically constructed treebank.

The UNL system consists of two main components, namely, EnConverter (used for converting the text from a source language to UNL) and DeConverter (used for converting the text from UNL to a target language). This paper discusses the framework for designing the EnConverter for Punjabi language with a special focus on generation of UNL attributes and relations from Punjabi source text. It also describes the working of Punjabi Shallow Parser used for the processing of the input sentence, which performs the tasks of Tokenizer, Morph-analyzer, Part-of-Speech Tagger and Chunker. This paper also considers the seven phases used in the process of EnConversion of input Punjabi text to UNL representation. The paper highlights the EnConversion analysis rules used for the EnConverter and indicates its usage in the generation of UNL expressions. This paper also covers the results of implementation of Punjabi EnConverter and its evaluation on sample UNL sentences available at Spanish Language Server. The accuracy of the developed system has also been presented in this paper.

   This paper presents the Cibyl programming environment which allows existing code written in C and other languages supported by GCC to be recompiled into Java bytecode and run with close to native Java performance on J2ME devices. Cibyl translates compiled MIPS binaries into Java bytecode. In contrast to other approaches, Cibyl supports the full C language, is based on unmodified standard tools, and does not rely on source code conversion. To achieve good performance, Cibyl employs extensions to the MIPS architecture to support low-overhead calls to native Java functionality and use knowledge of the MIPS ABI to avoid computing unused values and transfer unnecessary registers. An evaluation on multiple virtual machines shows that Cibyl achieves performance similar to native Java, with results ranging from a slowdown of around to a speedup of over 9 depending on the JVM and the benchmark.

TI Image-Based Displacement Monitoring When Considering Translational and
   Rotational Camera Motions
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
AB A new method to filter the effect of camera motions through background templates is proposed in this manuscript. Moreover, the effect of template sizes and brightness on the accuracy of monitored displacement was analyzed and compared. Several experiments were performed on a Multipurpose Testing System (MTS) machine using different frequencies and amplitudes to verify the method. All six camera motions (three translations and three rotations) were considered in this study, and the proposed method successfully filtered the effect of these motions. The results showed that filtering the camera vibrations significantly improved the displacement-monitoring accuracy from 53.0 to 97.0%. Adopting scale factors for every frame and different position in each frame also helped to improve the accuracy of the monitored displacement from 97.0 to 99.0%. It is impossible to obtain correct nature frequency of the structure before filtering the camera vibrations because there is more than one peak from the camera vibrations or the environment in the FFT result. With the developed filtering method, the target motions' frequencies were successfully identified.

TI BUILDING CROATIAN MEDICAL DICTIONARY FROM MEDICAL CORPUS
SO RASPRAVE
AB The overall objective of this project is to define linguistic models at the lexical and syntactic levels that appear in the health domain, depending on the type of corpus. In the first phase of the project, the texts forming the medical corpus A McdCorA (2,232 pharmaceutical instructions for medicaments available in Croatia) were prepared. The terminology found in this corpus was analyzed and the semantic subdomains (anatomy, condition, microorganism, chemistry, etc.) within the medical domain were defined and added to the dictionary entries. These dictionary resources were used as the foundation for the second phase in which NooJ morphological grammars were built allowing annotation of medical terminology in the corpus. Said grammars were built to allow for recognizing Latinisms, as well as Latin expressions written with Croatian case endings, not only Croatian words. Prepared resources are made available to a broader scientific community via Sketch Engine for further research in the field of medicine enabling additional research and development of algorithms for, among others, medical documents classification, medical texts' information retrieval or machine translation of medical documentation, taking into account quality and reliability as well as terminology variability.

AB Neural attention based sequence to sequence (seq2seq) network models have achieved remarkable performance on NLP tasks such as image caption generation, paraphrase generation, and machine translation. The underlying framework for these models is usually a deep neural architecture comprising of multi-layer encoder-decoder sub-networks. The performance of the decoding sub-network is greatly affected by how well it extracts the relevant source-side contextual information. Conventional approaches only consider the outputs of the last encoding layer when computing the source contexts via a neural attention mechanism. Due to the nature of information flow across the time-steps within each encoder layer as well flow from layer to layer, there is no guarantee that the necessary information required to build the source context is stored in the final encoding layer. These approaches also do not fully capture the structural composition of natural language. To address these limitations, this paper presents several new strategies to generating the contextual feature vector jointly across all the encoding layers. The proposed strategies consistently outperform the conventional approaches to performing the neural attention computation on the task of paraphrase generation.

TI Sparse Approximation of a Kernel Mean
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB Kernel means are frequently used to represent probability distributions in machine learning problems. In particular, the well known kernel density estimator and the kernel mean embedding both have the form of a kernel mean. Unfortunately, kernel means face scalability issues. A single point evaluation of the kernel density estimator, for example, requires a computation time linear in the training sample size. To address this challenge, we present a method to efficiently construct a sparse approximation of a kernel mean. We do so by first establishing an incoherence-based bound on the approximation error. We then observe that, for any kernel with constant norm (which includes all translation invariant kernels), the bound can be efficiently minimized by solving the k-center problem. The outcome is a linear time construction of a sparse kernel mean, which also lends itself naturally to an automatic sparsity selection scheme. We demonstrate the computational gains of our method by looking at several benchmark datasets, as well as three applications involving kernel means: Euclidean embedding of distributions, class proportion estimation, and clustering using the mean-shift algorithm.

AB Modern robotics applications that involve human-robot interaction require robots to be able to communicate with humans seamlessly and effectively. Natural language provides a flexible and efficient medium through which robots can exchange information with their human partners. Significant advancements have been made in developing robots capable of interpreting free-form instructions, but less attention has been devoted to endowing robots with the ability to generate natural language. We propose a model that enables robots to generate natural language instructions that allow humans to navigate a priori unknown environments. We first decide which information to share with the user according to their preferences, using a policy trained from human demonstrations via inverse reinforcement learning. We then "translate" this information into a natural language instruction using a neural sequence-to-sequence model that learns to generate free-form instructions from natural language corpora. We evaluate our method on a benchmark route instruction dataset and achieve a BLEU score of 72.18% compared to human-generated reference instructions. We additionally conduct navigation experiments with human participants demonstrating that our method generates instructions that people follow as accurately and easily as those produced by humans.

TI 'FRENCH' CYBERNETICS
SO FRENCH STUDIES
AB Norbert Wiener's Cybernetics was one of the most influential scientific books of the twentieth century. This article looks at the early French reception of cybernetics, using texts by Pierre de Latil, Georges-Theodule Guilbaud, and Albert Ducrocq to explore how its themes and ideas were mediated to a French audience. First, it shows how a process of `domestication' took place, in which cybernetics was resituated within a wider French-European history of science, and in which the translation of some of its key terms('control', `feedback') resulted in a relatively more disseminated lexical field in the French language. The article then examines the representation of technology in the three texts, showing how their extensive work of definition, classification, and explanation of machine culture could be said to constitute a distinctively `French' mediation of cybernetics, in many ways more systematic than that of Wiener's founding texts. While from the point of view of the history of ideas the informational-theoretical strand of cybernetics can be seen to feed directly into structuralism, it is argued that its operational strand, involving the mediation of a new technical culture, made an equally important contribution to subsequent thinking and debate about science and technology in post-war France.

TI A relation extraction method of Chinese named entities based on location
   and semantic features
SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE
AB Named entity relations are a foundation of semantic networks, ontology and the semantic Web, and are widely used in information retrieval and machine translation, as well as automatic question and answering systems. In named entity relations, relational feature selection and extraction are two key issues. The location features possess excellent computability and operability, while the semantic features have strong intelligibility and reality. Currently, relation extraction of Chinese named entities mainly adopts the Vector Space Model (VSM), a traditional semantic computing or the classification method, and these three methods use either the location features or the semantic features alone, resulting in unsatisfactory extraction. A relation extraction method of Chinese named entities called LaSE is proposed to combine the information gain of the positions of words and semantic computing based on HowNet. LaSE is scalable, semi-supervised and domain independent. Extensive experiments show that LaSE is superior, with an F-score of 0.879, which is at least 0.113 better than existing extraction methods that use either the location features or the semantic features alone.

AB Complex wavelet structural similarity (CW-SSIM) index has been proposed as a powerful image similarity metric that is robust to translation, scaling and rotation of images, but how to employ it in image classification applications has not been deeply investigated. In this paper, we incorporate CW-SSIM as a kernel function into a random forest learning algorithm. This leads to a novel image classification approach that does not require a feature extraction or dimension reduction stage at the front end. We use hand-written digit recognition as an example to demonstrate our algorithm. We compare the performance of the proposed approach with random forest learning based on other kernels, including the widely adopted Gaussian and the inner product kernels. Empirical evidences show that the proposed method is superior in its classification power. We also compared our proposed approach with the direct random forest method without kernel and the popular kernel-learning method support vector machine. Our test results based on both simulated and realworld data suggest that the proposed approach works superior to traditional methods without the feature selection procedure.

AB Programs employed for purposes of safety related control must be formally safety licensed, which constitutes a very difficult and hitherto not satisfactorily solved problem. Striving for utmost simplicity and easy comprehensibility of verification methods, the programming methods cause/effect tables and function block diagrams based on verified libraries are assigned to the upper two Safety Integrity Levels SIL 4 and SIL 3, resp., as they are the only ones so far allowing to verify highly safety critical automation software in trustworthy, easy and economic ways. For each of the two SILs a dedicated, low complexity execution platform is presented supporting the corresponding programming method architecturally. Their hardware is fault detecting or supervised by a fail safe logic, resp., to initiate emergency shut-downs in case of malfunctions. By design, there is no semantic gap between the programming and machine execution levels, enabling the safety licensing of application software by extremely simple, but rigorous methods, viz., diverse back translation and inspection. Operating in strictly periodic fashion, the controllers exhibit fully predictable real time behaviour.

AB Although transistor scaling keeps following Moore's law, and more area is available for designers, the clock frequency and ILP rate do not present the same level of growth anymore. This way, new architectural alternatives are necessary. Reconfigurable fabric appears to be one emerging possibility: besides exploiting the parallelism among instructions, it can also accelerate sequences of data dependent ones. However, coarse grain reconfiguration wide spread usage is still withhold by the need of special tools and compilers, which clearly do not sustain the reuse of legacy code without any modification. Based on all these facts, this work proposes a new Binary Translation algorithm, implemented in hardware and working in parallel to the processor, responsible for transforming sequences of instructions at run-time to be executed on a dynamic coarse-grain reconfigurable array, tightly coupled to a traditional RISC machine. Therefore, we can take advantage of using pure combinational logic to optimize even control-flow oriented code in a totally transparent process, without any modification in the source or binary codes. Using the Simplescalar Toolset together with the embedded benchmark suite MIBench, we show performance improvements and area evaluation when comparing against traditional superscalar architectures.

AB We describe an application of color-based pattern matching, where a real-time vision system needs to detect and exactly localize textile patterns woven into carpet flooring material. These patterns are distributed on a large web in a periodic fashion. The task to be solved is recognition of these patterns by matching them with stored prototypes, computing the exact location and use this information to guide a cutting machine to produce perfect replica of desired tiles. The pattern matching part is challenging because of the presence of distortion, scaling, and rotation of the 2D patterns, and rather high demands on the localization accuracy. Also, the task needs to be solved under real-time constraints. We describe the building blocks used in our system. These arc color-based segmentation of the patterns to achieve 2D representation in a graph-like manner, followed by graph-based matching. This block solved the graph-isomorphism problem in real-time tolerating distortions, additions, deletions, rotation, translation, and scale variations between the trained and tested versions of the patterns. We demonstrate the concept showing example images and matching results.

AB Although deep learning models perform remarkably well across a range of tasks such as language translation and object recognition, it remains unclear what high-level logic, if any, they follow. Understanding this logic may lead to more transparency, better model design, and faster experimentation. Recent machine learning research has leveraged statistical methods to identify hidden units that behave (e.g., activate) similarly to human understandable logic, but those analyses require considerable manual effort. Our insight is that many of those studies follow a common analysis pattern, which we term Deep Neural Inspection. There is opportunity to provide a declarative abstraction to easily express, execute, and optimize them.
   This paper describes DeepBase, a system to inspect neural network behaviors through a unified interface. We model logic with user-provided hypothesis functions that annotate the data with high-level labels (e.g., part-of-speech tags, image captions). DeepBase lets users quickly identify individual or groups of units that have strong statistical dependencies with desired hypotheses. We discuss how DeepBase can express existing analyses, propose a set of simple and effective optimizations to speed up a standard Python implementation by up to 72x, and reproduce recent studies from the NLP literature.

TI DROIT: Dynamic Alternation of Dual-Level Tainting for Malware Analysis
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Taint analysis for Android malware has received much attention in recent research. Existing taint techniques operate either at Java object level or at deeper instruction level. Object-level tracking is suitable for malware written in Java byte-code, but not for native ones. Instruction-level tracking captures the finest data flow. However, it leads to obscure semantic reconstruction and low performance. In this paper, we present DROIT, a taint tracker which dynamically alternates between object-level and instruction-level tracking on demands. DROIT tracks data flow at Java object level in general. When its Dalvik VM exits the byte-code execution, DROIT automatically switches to instruction-level tracking, and vice versa. The trigger-based DROIT can alternate between the two levels in an efficient manner, and can provide dual-level whole image of the data flow, rather than fragments. Tracking at the dual levels also eases the semantic reconstruction significantly. The experiment with Android information-stealing trojans showed that DROIT can handle Java-based malware, those composed in native code, and those alternating between the two levels (e.g., DroidKungFu), respectively.

SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF

AB The dynamic nature of biomolecules leads to significant challenges when characterizing the structural properties associated with function. While X-ray crystallography and imaging techniques (such as cryo-electron microscopy) can reveal the structural details of stable molecular complexes, strategies must be developed to characterize configurations that exhibit only marginal stability (such as intermediates) or configurations that do not correspond to minima on the energy landscape (such as transition-state ensembles). Here, we present a methodology (MDfit) that utilizes molecular dynamics simulations to generate configurations of excited states that are consistent with available biophysical and biochemical measurements. To demonstrate the approach, we present a sequence of configurations that are suggested to be associated with transfer RNA (tRNA) movement through the ribosome (translocation). The models were constructed by combining information from X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and biochemical data. These models provide a structural framework for translocation that may be further investigated experimentally and theoretically to determine the precise energetic character of each configuration and the transition dynamics between them.

AB Telugu is an Indian language spoken by more than 50 million people in the country. Language is very rich in literature, and it requires advancements in computational approaches. Applications like machine translation, Speech recognition, speech synthesis and Information retrieval need a powerful morphological generator to give morphological forms of nouns and verbs. The existing Telugu morphological analyzer (TMA) is rule based. The performance of it is further improved by our novel approach which provides a system that gives information about possible decompositions of the word inflected by many morphemes. Using these possible decompositions the root word could be extracted for those words which were unrecognized by rule based morphological analyzer. The experiment is conducted on Telugu text corpus from CHL Mysore and the improvement in the performance is checked by the rule based morphological analyzer developed by LTRC group, HIT and HCU,Hyderabad In this present work we present an unsupervised stemmer for improving the performance of Telugu rule based morph analyzer. The observed increase in performance of rule based is from 77% to 84.2% for words which are in hundreds. It can still be improved if the corpus is increased.

AB The ultimate goal of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology is to provide communication and control capacities to people with severe motor disabilities. BCI research at the Wadsworth Center focuses primarily on noninvasive, electroencephalography (EEG)-based BCI methods. We have shown that people, including those with severe motor disabilities, can learn to use sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs) to move a cursor rapidly and accurately in one or two dimensions. We have also improved P300-based BCI operation. We are now translating this laboratory-proven BCI technology into a system that can be used by severely disabled people in their homes with minimal ongoing technical oversight. To accomplish this, we have: improved our general-purpose BCI software (BCI2000); improved online adaptation and feature translation for SMR-based BCI operation; improved the accuracy and bandwidth of P300-based BCI operation; reduced the complexity of system hardware and software and begun to evaluate home system use in appropriate users. These developments have resulted in prototype systems for every day use in people's homes.

SO MOLECULAR MACHINES AND MOTORS
SE Structure and Bonding
AB Molecular motors of various kind (linear, rotary) are very common in biology where they play an essential role. However, the number of synthetic molecular ensembles whose dynamic behavior is reminiscent of biological motors is presently very limited. In order for an object to be regarded as a motor, several basic requirements have to be fulfilled. Even without trying to apply a strict thermodynamic definition, the system will have to convert a certain type of energy into another form of energy, while undergoing some kind of continuous motion. Threaded or interlocked rings are ideally suited to the construction of fully artificial molecular motors. If a ring is threaded onto a rod, it can either rotate around the axle or undergo a translation movement. Similarly, in catenanes, a ring can glide at will within another ring. Several examples of such compounds have been elaborated and studied in recent years, using threaded and interlocked molecules either based on acceptor-donor and hydrogen-bonded complexes or on transition metal complexes.

AB Array intensive computations are characterized by processing of large arrays stored in external memory in multiple loops. Synthesizing these computations onto FPGAs involves automatic translation of the behavioural description into state machines controlled by a clock such that the execution time of the program as a whole is the minimum and area requirement does not exceed a predefined limit. The synthesis algorithm also needs to efficiently sequence the array accesses taking into account memory access requirements such as pipelining.
   In this paper we present two algorithms each with a specific emphasis to handle this synthesis problem. Our heuristic algorithm generates good solutions in a very short time (less than a second), while our Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) based algorithm can generate optimal solution given sufficient time. Both try to minimize execution time and area. Our algorithms not only look at individual loops to exploit parallelism but also consider them together while deciding the clock. The overall execution time is minimized and not just the number of cycles or the cycle time. They also efficiently synthesize memory access to fully exploit the memory pipelining. We compare these two algorithms in terms of their relative strengths.

TI Force: A messenger of axon outgrowth
SO SEMINARS IN CELL & DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB The axon is a sophisticated macromolecular machine composed of interrelated parts that transmit signals like spur gears transfer motion between parallel shafts. The growth cone is a fine sensor that integrates mechanical and chemical cues and transduces these signals through the generation of a traction force that pushes the tip and pulls the axon shaft forward. The axon shaft, in turn, senses this pulling force and transduces this signal in an orchestrated response, coordinating cytoskeleton remodeling and intercalated mass addition to sustain and support the advancing of the tip. Extensive research suggests that the direct application of active force is per se a powerful inducer of axon growth, potentially bypassing the contribution of the growth cone. This review provides a critical perspective on current knowledge of how the force is a messenger of axon growth and its mode of action for controlling navigation, including aspects that remain unclear. It also focuses on novel approaches and tools designed to mechanically manipulate axons, and discusses their implications in terms of potential novel therapies for re-wiring the nervous system.

AB From early ages, we learn to naturally grasp objects from our trial-and-error interaction with the environment. We end up excelling at manipulating objects, such that grabbing a pan by its handle is all but unconscious. However, performing the same task from a machine's perspective is particularly challenging, as it requires an in-depth understanding of object manipulation. We could approximate such an understanding by capturing the hand-object contact resulting from human grasps, i.e., contact maps. This has already been done using cumbersome capture systems, and not on a large scale. In this work, we simplify and accelerate such a process by generating contact maps from our interaction with household objects in photorealistic virtual reality environments. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to generate contact maps at scale from our interaction in a virtual scenario. We train an image-to-image translation method to predict grasp regions on objects, demonstrating the usefulness of our generated contact maps. We provide all the necessary tools, code, and dataset to foster applications where hand-object understanding is necessary.

TI Influence of installation error of grating interferometer on
   high-precision displacement measurement
SO OPTICAL ENGINEERING
AB We investigated a high-precision grating interferometer displacement measurement system that can be applied to high-end immersion lithography machines and explained its composition and measurement algorithm. By analyzing the optical path variation caused by the installation error of the grating interferometer, we calculated the influence of the installation error on the displacement measurement. A displacement measurement model of a grating interferometer using three read heads was established, and the influence of the model coefficients on the displacement measurement model was analyzed. The simulation results show that, under the condition that the error of the measurement model in the X direction and the Y direction is <0.1 nm, the translation error of the read head should be within +/- 100 mu m, and the relative rotation deviation between the two read heads or two gratings placed along the diagonal should be within +/- 50 mu rad. The methods and results of studying the influence of grating interferometer installation error on the displacement measurement provide a theoretical basis for the application of a grating interferometer displacement measurement system in immersive high-end lithography scanners.

TI Single-cell RNA cap and tail sequencing (scRCAT-seq) reveals
   subtype-specific isoforms differing in transcript demarcation
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The differences in transcription start sites (TSS) and transcription end sites (TES) among gene isoforms can affect the stability, localization, and translation efficiency of mRNA. Gene isoforms allow a single gene diverse functions across different cell types, and isoform dynamics allow different functions over time. However, methods to efficiently identify and quantify RNA isoforms genome-wide in single cells are still lacking. Here, we introduce single cell RNA Cap And Tail sequencing (scRCAT-seq), a method to demarcate the boundaries of isoforms based on short-read sequencing, with higher efficiency and lower cost than existing long-read sequencing methods. In conjunction with machine learning algorithms, scRCAT-seq demarcates RNA transcripts with unprecedented accuracy. We identified hundreds of previously uncharacterized transcripts and thousands of alternative transcripts for known genes, revealed cell-type specific isoforms for various cell types across different species, and generated a cell atlas of isoform dynamics during the development of retinal cones. Most single-cell RNA sequencing methods have limited ability to profile the transcriptome at isoform resolution. Here the authors develop scRCAT-seq to characterize the 5 '- and 3 ' -ends of transcripts in single cells, and identify cell-type specific alternative transcript isoforms.

TI IOTA: Interlinking of heterogeneous multilingual open fiscal DaTA
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB Open budget data are among the most frequently published datasets of the open data ecosystem, intended to improve public administrations and government transparency. Unfortunately, the prospects of analysis across different open budget data remain limited due to schematic and linguistic differences. Budget and spending datasets are published together with descriptive classifications. Various public administrations typically publish the classifications and concepts in their regional languages. These classifications can be exploited to perform a more in-depth analysis, such as comparing similar items across different, cross-lingual datasets. However, in order to enable such analysis, a mapping across the multilingual classifications of datasets is required. In this paper, we present the framework for Interlinking of Heterogeneous Multilingual Open Fiscal DaTA (IOTA). IOTA makes use of machine translation followed by string similarities to map concepts across different datasets. To the best of our knowledge, IOTA is the first framework to offer scalable implementation of string similarity using distributed computing. The results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed multilingual matching, the scalability of the proposed framework, and an in-depth comparison of string similarity measures.

TI Cross-lingual semantic annotation of biomedical literature: experiments
   in Spanish and English
SO BIOINFORMATICS
AB Motivation: Biomedical literature is one of the most relevant sources of information for knowledge mining in the field of Bioinformatics. In spite of English being the most widely addressed language in the field; in recent years, there has been a growing interest from the natural language processing community in dealing with languages other than English. However, the availability of language resources and tools for appropriate treatment of non-English texts is lacking behind. Our research is concerned with the semantic annotation of biomedical texts in the Spanish language, which can be considered an under-resourced language where biomedical text processing is concerned. Results: We have carried out experiments to assess the effectiveness of several methods for the automatic annotation of biomedical texts in Spanish. One approach is based on the linguistic analysis of Spanish texts and their annotation using an information retrieval and concept disambiguation approach. A second method takes advantage of a Spanish-English machine translation process to annotate English documents and transfer annotations back to Spanish. A third method takes advantage of the combination of both procedures. Our evaluation shows that a combined system has competitive advantages over the two individual procedures.

AB Automated reasoning and theorem proving have recently become major challenges for machine learning. In other domains, representations that are able to abstract over unimportant transformations, such as abstraction over translations and rotations in vision, are becoming more common. Standard methods of embedding mathematical formulas for learning theorem proving are however yet unable to handle many important transformations. In particular, embedding previously unseen labels, that often arise in definitional encodings and in Skolemization, has been very weak so far. Similar problems appear when transferring knowledge between known symbols.
   We propose a novel encoding of formulas that extends existing graph neural network models. This encoding represents symbols only by nodes in the graph, without giving the network any knowledge of the original labels. We provide additional links between such nodes that allow the network to recover the meaning and therefore correctly embed such nodes irrespective of the given labels. We test the proposed encoding in an automated theorem prover based on the tableaux connection calculus, and show that it improves on the best characterizations used so far. The encoding is further evaluated on the premise selection task and a newly introduced symbol guessing task, and shown to correctly predict 65% of the symbol names.

TI Arabic sentiment analysis: studies, resources, and tools
SO SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING
AB To determine whether a document or a sentence expresses a positive or negative sentiment, three main approaches are commonly used: the lexicon-based approach, corpus-based approach, and a hybrid approach. The study of sentiment analysis in English has the highest number of sentiment analysis studies, while research is more limited for other languages, including Arabic and its dialects. Lexicon based approaches need annotated sentiment lexicons (containing the valence and intensity of its terms and expressions). Corpus-based sentiment analysis requires annotated sentences. One of the significant problems related to the treatment of Arabic and its dialects is the lack of these resources. We present in this survey the most recent resources and advances that have been done for Arabic sentiment analysis. This survey presents recent work (where the majority of these works are between 2015 and 2019). These works are classified by category (survey work or contribution work). For contribution work, we focus on the construction of sentiment lexicon and corpus. We also describe emergent trends related to Arabic sentiment analysis, principally associated with the use of deep learning techniques.

TI Simulation of Subjective Closed Captioning Quality Assessment Using
   Prediction Models
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEMANTIC COMPUTING
AB As a primary user group, Deaf or Hard of Hearing (D/HOH) audiences use Closed Captioning (CC) service to enjoy the TV programs with audio by reading text. However, the D/HOH communities are not completely satisfied with the quality of CC even though the government regulators entail certain rules in the CC quality factors. The measure of the CC quality is often interpreted as an accuracy on translation and regulators use the empirical models to assess. The need of a subjective quality scale comes from the gap in between current empirical assessment models and the audience perceived quality. It is possible to fill the gap by including the subjective assessment by D/HOH audiences. This research proposes a design of an automatic quality assessment system for CC which can predict the D/HOH audience subjective ratings. A simulated rater is implemented based on literature and the CC quality factor representative value extraction algorithm is developed. Three prediction models are trained with a set of CC quality values and corresponding rating scores, then they are compared to find the feasible prediction model.

AB Inspired by the recent successes of attention based encoder-decoder (AED) approach on image captioning, machine translation, we present an AED model as an end-to-end recognition system for recognizing Japanese historical documents. The recognition system has two main modules: a dense convolution neural network for extracting features, and a Long Shor Term Memory (LSTM) decoder integrating with attention model for generating target text. We can train the model end-to-end. The model requires only input text line images and corresponding output characters. Therefore, we don't need annotations for characters and save a lot of time for making annotations. We also present a method to generate artificial text lines to solve the imbalance problem of the current annotated database. The results of experiments on the annotated and artificial databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the text line generation. Our recognition system achieved Character Error Rate of 23.76% and 22.52% by training with and without artificial text lines, respectively. Moreover, our recognition system outperforms the CNN-LSTM system, which achieved the state-of-art results in other document recognition tasks.

TI A Cloud Server Oriented FPGA Accelerator for LSTM Recurrent Neural
   Network
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) is the most widely used recurrent neural network architecture. It plays an important role in a number of research areas, such as language modeling, machine translation and image captioning. However, owing to its recurrent nature, general-purpose processors like CPUs and GPGPUs can achieve limited parallelism while consuming high power energy. FPGA accelerators can outperform general-purpose processors with flexibility, energy-efficiency and more delicate optimization capabilities for the recurrent based algorithms. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a cloud-oriented FPGA accelerator for LSTM. Different from most of previous works designed for embedded systems, our FPGA accelerator transfers data sequences from and to the host server through PCIe and performs multiple time series predictions in parallel. We optimize both the on-chip computation and the communication between the host server and the FPGA board. We perform experiments to evaluate the overall performance as well as the computation and the PCIe communication efforts. The results show that the performance of our implementation is better than the CPU-based and other hardware-based implementations.

A memory access instruction consists of an address generation operation calculating the location where the data item resides in memory and the data access operation that loads/stores a value from/to that location. We propose to decouple these two operations into separate machine instructions to reduce energy usage. By associating the data translation lookaside buffer (DTLB) access and level-one data cache (L1 DC) tag check with an address generation instruction, only a single data array in a set-associative L1 DC needs to be accessed during a load instruction when the result of the tag check is known at that point. In addition, many DTLB accesses and L1 DC tag checks are avoided by memoizing the DTLB way and L1 DC way with the register that holds the memory address to be dereferenced. Finally, we are able to often coalesce an ALU operation with a load or store data access using our technique to reduce the number of instructions executed.

AB Deep learning, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in particular have shown superior accuracy in a large variety of tasks including machine translation, language understanding, and movie frames generation. However, these deep learning approaches are very expensive in terms of computation. In most cases, Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) are in used for large scale implementations. Meanwhile, energy efficient RNN approaches are proposed for deploying solutions on special purpose hardware including Field Programming Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and mobile platforms. In this paper, we propose an effective quantization approach for Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) techniques including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Convolutional Long Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM). We have implemented different quantization methods including Binary Connect {-1, 1}, Ternary Connect {-1, 0, 1}, and Quaternary Connect {-1, -0.5, 0.5, 1}. These proposed approaches are evaluated on different datasets for sentiment analysis on IMDB and video frame predictions on the moving MNIST dataset. The experimental results are compared against the full precision versions of the LSTM, GRU, and ConvLSTM. They show promising results for both sentiment analysis and video frame prediction.

AB The paper presents the Public Multilingual Knowledge Management Infrastructure (PMKI) action launched by the European Commission (EC) to promote the Digital Single Market in the European Union (EU). PMKI aims to share maintainable and sustainable Language Resources making them interoperable in order to support language technology industry, and public administrations, with multilingual tools able to improve cross border accessibility of digital services. The paper focuses on the main feature (interoperability) that represents the specificity of PMKI platform distinguishing it from other existing frameworks. In particular it aims to create a set of tools and facilities, based on Semantic Web technologies, to establish semantic interoperability between multilingual lexicons. Such task requires to harmonize in general multilingual language resources using standardised representation with respect to a defined core data model under an adequate architecture. A comparative study among the main data models for representing lexicons and recommendations for the PMKI service was required as well. Moreover, synergies with other programs of the EU institutions, as far as systems interoperability and Machine Translation (MT) solutions, are foreseen. For instance some interactions are foreseen between PMKI and MT service provided by the EC but also with other NLP applications.

TI A fast render algorithm of virtual and real motion blur consistence in
   augmented reality
SO OPTIK
AB Motion is a common phenomenon in the real world so the consistence of virtual and real motion is one of hot focuses in augmented reality system. This paper mainly analyzes virtual and real motion blur consistence in augmented reality system, and mainly do improvement in two aspects, one is how to get the motion blur parameters, the other is how to render motion blur. From the available literature it can be seen that, most achieved methods to get motion blur parameters are based on machine vision. But this paper first acquires the motion trajectory by magnetic tracking, and then gets motion blur parameters. Considering the available literature on motion blur rendering methods, they mainly contain convolution and accumulator caching and so on. Due to rotation translation compound motion blur, this paper does rendering in advance based on improved mathematical model, and then render virtual object through looking up table in augmented reality system. Experimental results show that the new virtual and real motion blur consistence render algorithm has low time complexity and achieve the desired effect in simulation environment and real scenes.

AB Developing a complete and well specified natural language processing (NLP) models for any language with limited electronic resources is always a challenging and demanding task. Morphological Analyzer and Generator (MAG) is an indispensable tool used extensively in natural language processing applications such as Machine Translation (MT), spell checker, Information Retrieval (IR), lexicography etc. A Morphological Analyser describes the root word and its various morphemes ordering structure of the word form in use. While a Morphological Generator processes the given root word and its morpheme structure to derive the required word form. This paper presents the development of a Morphological Analyzer and Generator for an agglutinative Dravidian language called Tulu. Even though such a Morphological Analyzer and Generator tool is mandatory for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks but is not yet available for Tulu language. The proposed rule based Morphological Analyzer and Generator system is implemented using AT & T Open FST (Finite state transducer). From the experiment it is observed that, the performance of the proposed system is encouraging and can be substantially improved by increasing the number of rules.

AB Recently the sentiment classification problem interests the researchers over the world, but most sentiment corpora are in English, which limits the research progress on sentiment classification in other languages. Cross-lingual sentiment classification aims to use annotated sentiment corpora in one language (e. g. English) as training data, to predict the sentiment polarity of the data in another language (e. g. Chinese). In this paper, we design a bi-view non-negative matrix tri-factorization (BNMTF) model for the cross-lingual sentiment classification problem. We employ machine translation service so that both training and test data is able to have two representation, one in source language and the other in target language. Our BNMTF model is derived from the non-negative matrix tri-factorization models in both languages in order to make more accurate prediction. Our BNMTF model has three main advantages: (1) combining the information from two views (2) incorporating the lexical knowledge and training document label knowledge (3) adding information from test documents. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our BNMTF model, which can outperform other baseline approaches to cross-lingual sentiment classification.

TI Physical and functional interactions among RNase E, polynucleotide
   phosphorylase and the cold-shock protein, CsdA: evidence for a 'cold
   shock degradosome'
SO MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY
AB Escherichia coli contains at least five ATP-dependent DEAD-box RNA helicases which may play important roles in macromolecular metabolism, especially in translation and mRNA decay. Here we demonstrate that one member of this family, CsdA, whose expression is induced by cold shock, interacts physically and functionally with RNase E. Three independent approaches show that after a shift of cultures to 15degreesC, CsdA co-purifies with RNase E and other components of the RNA degradosome. Moreover, functional assays using reconstituted minimal degradosomes prepared from purified components in vitro show that CsdA can fully replace the resident RNA helicase of the RNA degradosome, RhlB. In addition, under these conditions, CsdA displays RNA-dependent ATPase activity. Taken together, our data are consistent with a model in which CsdA accumulates during the early stages of cold acclimatization and subsequently assembles into degradosomes with RNase E synthesized in cold-adapted cultures. These findings show that the RNA degradosome is a flexible macromolecular machine capable of adapting to altered environmental conditions.

TI Dynamics of spreader motion in a gantry crane
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF
   MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
AB This paper illustrates the steps necessary to model the dynamics of a model rubber-tyred gantry (RTG) crane as used in container-handling operations. Various modelling criteria are discussed with the emphasis placed on the importance of non-linear coupling between the chosen system coordinates. The machine is treated as three rigid bodies, these being the gantry itself, the trolley (which is constrained to lateral motion across the top beam) and the spreader. Tyre deformations and structural deflections are not considered in this work.
   The paper culminates in three non-linear ordinary differential equations, which are then solved numerically for a variety of different cases. An important feature of this work is that the dynamic simulations include complicated gantry motions, not currently designed for, such as combined translations and simultaneous rotations. Such motions are more commonly encountered in mobile robots. However, RTG design needs to move in this general direction in the future if significant and potential performance gains are actually to be realized in practise. The paper concludes with suggestions for implementation of the dynamic model within a fuzzy logic control system.

TI A massively parallel reporter assay reveals focused and broadly encoded
   RNA localization signals in neurons
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Asymmetric subcellular mRNA localization allows spatial regulation of gene expression and functional compartmentalization. In neurons, localization of specific mRNAs to neurites is essential for cellular functioning. However, it is largely unknown how transcript sorting works in a sequence-specific manner. Here, we combined subcellular transcriptomics and massively parallel reporter assays and tested similar to 50 000 sequences for their ability to localize to neurites. Mapping the localization potential of >300 genes revealed two ways neurite targeting can be achieved: focused localization motifs and broadly encoded localization potential. We characterized the interplay between RNA stability and localization and identified motifs able to bias localization towards neurite or soma as well as the trans-acting factors required for their action. Based on our data, we devised machine learning models that were able to predict the localization behavior of novel reporter sequences. Testing this predictor on native mRNA sequencing data showed good agreement between predicted and observed localization potential, suggesting that the rules uncovered by our MPRA also apply to the localization of native full-length transcripts.

TI Acceleration Gait Measures as Proxies for Motor Skill of Walking: A
   Narrative Review
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING
AB In adults 65 years or older, falls or other neuromotor dysfunctions are often framed as walking-related declines in motor skill; the frequent occurrence of such decline in walking-related motor skill motivates the need for an improved understanding of the motor skill of walking. Simple gait measurements, such as speed, do not provide adequate information about the quality of the body motion's translation during walking. Gait measures from accelerometers can enrich measurements of walking and motor performance. This review article will categorize the aspects of the motor skill of walking and review how trunk-acceleration gait measures during walking can be mapped to motor skill aspects, satisfying a clinical need to understand how well accelerometer measures assess gait. We will clarify how to leverage more complicated acceleration measures to make accurate motor skill decline predictions, thus furthering fall research in older adults.

TI Neural Speech Decoding During Audition, Imagination and Production
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Interpretation of neural signals to a form that is as intelligible as speech facilitates the development of communication mediums for the otherwise speech/motor-impaired individuals. Speech perception, production, and imagination often constitute phases of human communication. The primary goal of this article is to analyze the similarity between these three phases by studying electroencephalogram(EEG) patterns across these modalities, in order to establish their usefulness for brain computer interfaces. Neural decoding of speech using such non-invasive techniques necessitates the optimal choice of signal analysis and translation protocols. By employing selection-by-exclusion based temporal modeling algorithms, we discover fundamental syllable-like units that reveal similar set of signal signatures across all the three phases. Significantly higher than chance accuracies are recorded for single trial multi-unit EEG classification using machine learning approaches over three datasets across 30 subjects. Repeatability and subject independence tests performed at every step of the analysis further strengthens the findings and holds promise for translating brain signals to speech non-invasively.

TI Optimization of ClpXP activity and protein synthesis in an E-coli
   extract-based cell-free expression system
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Protein degradation is a fundamental process in all living cells and is essential to remove both damaged proteins and intact proteins that are no longer needed by the cell. We are interested in creating synthetic genetic circuits that function in a cell-free expression system. This will require not only an efficient protein expression platform but also a robust protein degradation system in cell extract. Therefore, we purified and tested the activity of E. coli ClpXP protease in cell-free transcription-translation (TX-TL) systems that used E. coli S30 cell extract. Surprisingly, our studies showed that purified ClpXP added to the TX-TL system has very low proteolytic activity. The low activity of ClpXP was correlated with the rapid consumption of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in cell extract. We improved the activity of ClpXP in cell extract by adding exogenous ATP and an energy regeneration system. We then established conditions for both protein synthesis, and protein degradation by ClpXP to occur simultaneously in the TX-TL systems. The optimized conditions for ClpXP activity will be useful for creating tunable synthetic genetic circuits and in vitro synthetic biology.

TI Bisector-Based Tracking of In Plane Subpixel Translations and Rotations
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB We present a method for distance measuring planar displacements and rotations with image processing methods. The method is based on tracking the intersection of two non-parallel straight segments extracted from a scene. This kind of target can be easily identified in civil structures or in industrial elements or machines. Therefore, our method is suitable for measuring the displacement in some parts of structures and therefore for determining their stress state. We have evaluated the accuracy of our proposal through a computational simulation and validated the method through two lab experiments. We obtained a theoretical mean subpixel accuracy of 0.03 px for the position and 0.02 degrees for the orientation, whereas the practical accuracies were 0.1 px and 0.04 degrees, respectively. One presented lab application deals with the tracking of an object attached to a rotation stage motor in order to characterize the dynamic of the stage, and another application is addressed to the noncontact assessment of the bending and torsional process of a steel beam subjected to load. The method is simple, easy to implement, and widely applicable.

AB Verification tasks have non-elementary complexity for properties of linear traces specified in first-order logic, and thus various limited logical languages are employed. In this paper we consider two restricted specification logics, linear temporal logic (LTL) and two-variable first-order logic (FO2). LTL is more expressive, but FO2 is often more succinct, and hence it is not clear which should be easier to verify. In this paper we take a comprehensive look at the issue, giving a comparison of verification problems for FO2, LTL, and the subset of LTL expressively equivalent to FO2, unary temporal logic (UTL). We give two logic-to-automata translations which can be used to give upper bounds for FO2 and UTL; we apply these to get new bounds for both non-deterministic systems (hierarchical and recursive state machines, games) and for probabilistic systems (Markov chains, recursive Markov chains, and Markov decision processes). We couple this with lower-bound arguments for FO2 and UTL. Our results give both a unified approach to understanding the behavior of FO2 and UTL, along with a nearly comprehensive picture of the complexity of verification for these logics.

AB This work describes a methodology to extract symbolic rules from trained neural networks. In our approach, patterns on the network are codified using formulas on a Lukasiewicz logic. For this we take advantage of the fact that every connective in this multi-valued logic can be evaluated by a neuron in an artificial network having, by activation function the identity truncated to zero and one. This fact simplifies symbolic rule extraction and allows the easy injection of formulas into a network architecture. We trained this type of neural network using a back-propagation algorithm based on Levenderg-Marquardt algorithm, where in each learning iteration, we restricted the knowledge dissemination in the network structure. This makes the descriptive power of produced neural networks similar to the descriptive power of Lukasiewicz logic language, minimizing the information loss on the translation between connectionist and symbolic structures. To avoid redundance on the generated network, the method simplifies them in a pruning phase, using the "Optimal Brain Surgeon" algorithm. We tested this method on the task of finding the formula used on the generation of a given truth table. For real data tests, we selected the Mushrooms data set, available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

AB We describe the design, implementation, and use of a machine-certified framework for correct compilation and execution of programs in garbage-collected languages. Our framework extends Leroy's Coq-certified Compcert compiler and Cminor intermediate language. We add: (i) a new intermediate language, GCminor, that includes primitives for allocating memory in a garbage-collected heap and for specifying GC roots; (ii) a precise, low-level specification for a Cminor library for garbage collection; and (iii) a proven semantics-preserving translation from GCminor to Cminor plus the GC library. GCminor neatly encapsulates the interface between mutator and collector code, while remaining simple and flexible enough to be used with a wide variety of source languages and collector styles. Front ends targeting GCminor can be implemented using any compiler technology and any desired degree of verification, including full semantics preservation, type preservation, or informal trust.
   As an example application of our framework, we describe a compiler for Haskell that translates the Glasgow Haskell Compiler's Core intermediate language to GCminor. To support a simple but useful memory safety argument for this compiler, the front end uses a novel combination of type preservation and runtime checks, which is of independent interest.

AB Hyperspectral images have traditionally been analyzed by pixel based methods. Invariant methods that consider surface and shape geometry have not been used with these images. However, there is a need for such methods due to the spectral and spatial variability present in these images. In this paper, we develop a method for classifying these images invariant to translation and rotation. The method is based on developing shape descriptors using spherical harmonics. These orthogonal functions have been widely used as a powerful tool for 3D shape recognition and are better suited for hyperspectral images due to its inherent dimensionality. A spherical function defined on the surface of a shape extracts rotation invariant features. In this case, the hyperspectral image is converted to spherical coordinates, decomposed as a sum of its harmonics and then converted to Cartesian coordinates. A classifier is trained with spherical harmonic descriptors computed from training samples. Support vector machines and Maximum Likelihood are considered for classification. The method is tested with hyperspectral image from AISA, AVIRIS and HYDICE sensors. The results show that the descriptors are effective in improving the accuracy of classification.

AB Arabic is the official language of hundreds of millions of people in twenty Middle East and northern African countries, and is the religious language of all Muslims of various ethnicities around the world. Surprisingly little has been done in the field of computerised language and lexical resources. It is therefore motivating to develop an Arabic (WordNet) lexical resource that discovers the richness of Arabic as described in Elkateb (2005). This paper describes our approach towards building a lexical resource in Standard Arabic. ArabicWordNet (AWN) will be based on the design and contents of the universally accepted Princeton WordNet (PWN) and will be mappable straightforwardly onto PWN 2.0 and EuroWordNet (EWN), enabling translation on the lexical level to English and dozens of other languages. Several tools specific to this task will be developed. AWN will be a linguistic resource with a deep formal semantic foundation. Besides the standard wordnet representation of senses, word meanings are defined with a machine understandable semantics in first order logic. The basis for this semantics is the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO) and its associated domain ontologies. We will greatly extend the ontology and its set of mappings to provide formal terms and definitions equivalent to each synset.

TI Comparison of text preprocessing methods
SO NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING
AB Text preprocessing is not only an essential step to prepare the corpus for modeling but also a key area that directly affects the natural language processing (NLP) application results. For instance, precise tokenization increases the accuracy of part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and retaining multiword expressions improves reasoning and machine translation. The text corpus needs to be appropriately preprocessed before it is ready to serve as the input to computer models. The preprocessing requirements depend on both the nature of the corpus and the NLP application itself, that is, what researchers would like to achieve from analyzing the data. Conventional text preprocessing practices generally suffice, but there exist situations where the text preprocessing needs to be customized for better analysis results. Hence, we discuss the pros and cons of several common text preprocessing methods: removing formatting, tokenization, text normalization, handling punctuation, removing stopwords, stemming and lemmatization, n-gramming, and identifying multiword expressions. Then, we provide examples of text datasets which require special preprocessing and how previous researchers handled the challenge. We expect this article to be a starting guideline on how to select and fine-tune text preprocessing methods.

TI RALR: Random Amplify Learning Rates for Training Neural Networks
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB It has been shown that the learning rate is one of the most critical hyper-parameters for the overall performance of deep neural networks. In this paper, we propose a new method for setting the global learning rate, named random amplify learning rates (RALR), to improve the performance of any optimizer in training deep neural networks. Instead of monotonically decreasing the learning rate, we expect to escape saddle points or local minima by amplifying the learning rate between reasonable boundary values based on a given probability. Training with RALR rather than conventionally decreasing the learning rate achieves further improvement on networks' performance without extra consumption. Remarkably, the RALR is complementary with state-of-the-art data augmentation and regularization methods. Besides, we empirically study its performance on image classification tasks, fine-grained classification tasks, object detection tasks, and machine translation tasks. Experiments demonstrate that RALR can bring a notable improvement while preventing overfitting when training deep neural networks. For example, the classification accuracy of ResNet-110 trained on the CIFAR-100 dataset using RALR achieves a 1.34% gain compared with ResNet-110 trained traditionally.

TI Implementation of Automatic Mesh Rules Generation by Word Features
   Relationship (AMRG-WFR) for Word Sense Disambiguation for Marathi
   Language
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEXT-GENERATION COMPUTING
AB One common feature of natural languages is a single word having the different meanings. Detecting the correct sense of the word in the given context is known as word sense disambiguation. In Natural language processing WSD is always a challenging and difficult task. The accuracy of many systems like information retrieval, machine translation text summarization depends upon the module used to identify the correct sense of the word. In this paper we proposed an automatic mesh rule generation technique by word feature relationship for the task of word sense disambiguation for Marathi language. Marathi is one the most popular and morphologically rich language in India. We conducted all the experiments on the benchmark WordNet dataset developed at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay). The proposed algorithm contains three sections.In the first section supervised learning technique is used to create training data set. Mesh rules of object were created in second section and in last section the correct sense of ambiguous word matched with the given context. Results show that the proposed method has superior performance as compared with already developed approaches.

AB Recent works in side-channel analysis have been fully relying on training classification models to recover sensitive information from traces. However, the knowledge of an attacker or an evaluator is not taken into account and poorly captured by solely training a classifier on signals. This paper proposes to inject prior information in preprocessing and classification in order to increase the performance of side-channel attacks (SCA). First we propose to use the Wavelet Scattering Transform, recently proposed by Mallat, for mapping traces into a time-frequency space which is stable under small translation and diffeomorphism. That way, we address the issues of desynchronization and deformation generally present in signals for SCA. The second part of our paper extends the canonical attacks over byte and Hamming weight by introducing a more general attack. Classifiers are trained on different labelings of the sensitive variable and combined by minimizing a cross-entropy criterion so as to find the best labeling strategy. With these two key ideas, we successfully increase the performance of Template Attacks on artificially desynchronized traces and signals from a jitter-protected implementation.

AB The task of knowledge base population (KBP) aims to discover facts about entities from texts and expand a knowledge base with these facts. Previous studies shape end-to-end KBP as a machine translation task, which is required to convert unordered fact into a sequence according to a pre-specified order. However, the facts stated in a sentence are unordered in essence. In this paper, we formulate end-to-end KBP as a direct set generation problem, avoiding considering the order of multiple facts. To solve the set generation problem, we propose networks featured by transformers with nonautoregressive parallel decoding. Unlike previous approaches that use an autoregressive decoder to generate facts one by one, the proposed networks can directly output the final set of facts in one shot. Furthermore, to train the networks, we also design a set-based loss that forces unique predictions via bipartite matching. Compared with cross-entropy loss that highly penalizes small shifts in fact order, the proposed bipartite matching loss is invariant to any permutation of predictions. Benefiting from getting rid of the burden of predicting the order of multiple facts, our proposed networks achieve state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on two benchmark datasets.

AB Mental disorders affect large numbers of people worldwide. Computer-aided therapies have been designed and successfully applied in the context of mental health, including solutions based on artificial intelligence (AI). Application of AI in mental disorder therapies frequently has the form of dialogue systems. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a therapeutic chatbot capable of having a conversation in Polish. The initial work was focused on literature review and choosing the software framework for the dialogue system. As a next step, we have prepared a dataset of emotionally grounded dialogue turns in Polish, by applying machine translation to an existing resource for English. The resulting dataset was used for training an emotion recognition model which will be incorporated into the dialogue system. Next, the chatbot will be exposed to a group of test users, and its language understanding capabilities will be further developed. In future, the system will be equipped with a speech interface to also enable verbal communication. We plan to conduct experiments with the help of therapists and patients, followed by thorough analyses of their interactions with the chatbot.

AB In community question answering (CQA), duplicate questions are questions that were previously created and answered but occur again. These questions produce noises in the CQA websites which impede users to find answers efficiently. Programming CQA (PCQA), a branch of CQA that holds questions related to programming, also suffers from this problem. Existing works on duplicate detection in PCQA websites framed the task as a supervised learning task on the question pairs, and relied on a number of extracted features of the question pairs. But they extracted only textual features and did not consider the source code in the questions, which are linguistically very different to natural languages. Our work focuses on developing novel features for PCQA duplicate detection. We leverage continuous word vectors from the deep learning literature, probabilistic models in information retrieval and association pairs mined from duplicate questions using machine translation. We provide extensive empirical analysis on the performance of these features and their various combinations using a range of learning models. Our work could be helpful for both research works and practical applications that require extracting features from texts that are not all natural languages.

Lower-resolution structures have been determined for a number of flexible filamentous plant viruses using fiber diffraction and cryo-electron microscopy. Virions of filamentous viruses have numerous mechanical functions, including cell entry, viral disassembly, viral assembly, and cell exit. The plant viruses, which infect multicellular organisms, also use virions or virion-like assemblies for transport within the host. Plant viruses are generally self-assembling; filamentous bacteriophage assembly is combined with secretion from the host cell, using a complex molecular machine. Tobamoviruses and other plant viruses disassemble concomitantly with translation, by various mechanisms and involving various viral and host assemblies. Plant virus movement within the host also makes use of a variety of viral proteins and modified host assemblies.

AB This review article offers a detailed analysis of Lisa Block de Behar's Borges: The Passion of an Endless Quotation (2003), an innovative and erudite study that bridges the passions of the semiotician and the literary critic. The Uruguayan scholar offers illuminating insights into Borges' oeuvre and takes a new step in delineating similarities between specific questions of semiotics and his imagination. Inspired by her perceptive observation that Borges has offered a new dimension in the use of quotations by demonstrating the impossibility of not quoting, I analyze his story 'A Weary's Man Utopia,' which enters into an implicit dialogue with such classical texts as Thomas More's Utopia, H. G. Wells' The Time Machine and Henry James' The Sense of the Past to comment on the notion of language as a system of quotes. Furthering Block de Behar's insight into the creative process of Borges as writer, in the course of which he uses his earlier written texts to fashion new works, I discuss Borges' creative version of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass to suggest that Borges' translations are also informed by his own fiction and poetry.

AB Generation of versatile periodic 3d structures with sub-micron precision on material surfaces is demonstrated. The technique is based on a novel beam splitting scheme applying separate diffractive elements. The incoming beam is split into multiple beams whose phase relations are controlled with almost arbitrary precision by only changing the distance between the diffractive elements. Combining this technique with a reflective imaging system, temporal and spatial overlap of all beams with interferometric precision is automatically obtained. The periodic 3d structures are generated through multi-beam interference in the overlapping region of the beams. The shape of the resulting pattern depends on the phase relationship of the interfering beams and can be strongly altered by simple translation of only one diffractive element.
   We demonstrate the capability of the method for femtosecond laser treatment of solids. Using sub picosecond laser pulses at 248 nm, sub-micron features with different shapes are ablated on the surface of polyimide samples. The size of the achieved structures is well below I micron, in special cases even reaching the 100 nm limit.

TI Compensation for nucleotide bias in a genome by representation as a
   discrete channel with noise
SO BIOINFORMATICS
AB Motivation: Calculation of the information content of motifs in genomes highly biased in nucleotide composition is likely to lead to overestimates of the amount of useful information in the motif. Calculating relative information can compensate for biases, however the resulting information content is the amount seen by an observer and not by a macromolecule binding to the motif. The latter is needed to calculate the discriminatory power of the motif and to compare motifs between species.
   Results: By treating a biased genome as a discrete channel with noise, in accordance with Shannon Information Theory, we were able to remove both 'Distortion' and 'Noise' from the motif and recover a more instructive biological 'signal.' A Java application, LogoPaint, was developed to remove nucleotide bias distortion and triplet frequency noise from motifs, calculate information content and present the motif as a logo. We demonstrate how this technique can 'unmask' motifs in the translation initiation regions of bacteria that are obscured by strong sequence biases.
   Availability: LogoPaint is available to all users from the authors as an executable JAR file. Source code is available by arrangement.

TI Low-Altitude Sea Surface Infrared Object Detection Based on Unsupervised
   Domain Adaptation
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB A low-altitude sea surface infrared object detection method based on unsupervised domain adaptation is proposed. First, the source domain images are translated into target domain images by image translation network, and the labels are shared. Second, the gradient reversal layer is used in YOLOv5s object detection network to optimize the inter-domain adaptability of feature extraction. In addition, the maximum mean discrepancy loss is used to further narrow the feature distribution of different infrared detector images extracted from the network. Finally, AdamW asynchronous update optimization algorithm is adopted to further improve the training stability and detection accuracy. The proposed method is tested on low-altitude sea surface infrared ships and unmanned aerial vehicles collected by different infrared detectors. Experimental results show that compared with the traditional supervised learning method, the proposed method effectively reduces the cost of manual labeling, and detection accuracy of source domain and target domain are improved by 6.56 and 2.62 percentage points respectively, which effectively improves the generalization ability of the object detection model between different infrared detectors.

AB Natural Language Processing (NLP) represents the task of automatic handling of natural human language by machines. There is a large spectrum of possible NLP applications which aid in automating tasks like text translation amongst languages, retrieving and summarizing data from very huge and complex repositories, spam email filtering, identifying fake news in digital media, finding political opinions, views and sentiments of people on various government policies, providing effective medical assistance based on past history records of patients etc. Gujarati language is an Indian language with more than sixty million users worldwide. At present, many efforts are laid for developing NLP applications and resources for Indian languages. This survey gives a taxonomy and comprehensive report regarding component and resource development for Gujarati NLP systems. Also, few prominent tools available in open domain are tested, and their posterior analysis is presented. Possible measures to handle the issues in resource and component development of Gujarati NLP system are also discussed. This report might be useful for industry, researchers and academicians to have a clear picture of the research gaps, challenges and opportunities in Gujarati NLP systems.

TI Deep learning approach to text analysis for human emotion detection from
   big data
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB Emotional recognition has arisen as an essential field of study that can expose a variety of valuable inputs. Emotion can be articulated in several means that can be seen, like speech and facial expressions, written text, and gestures. Emotion recognition in a text document is fundamentally a content-based classification issue, including notions from natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning fields. Hence, in this study, deep learning assisted semantic text analysis (DLSTA) has been proposed for human emotion detection using big data. Emotion detection from textual sources can be done utilizing notions of Natural Language Processing. Word embeddings are extensively utilized for several NLP tasks, like machine translation, sentiment analysis, and question answering. NLP techniques improve the performance of learning-based methods by incorporating the semantic and syntactic features of the text. The numerical outcomes demonstrate that the suggested method achieves an expressively superior quality of human emotion detection rate of 97.22% and the classification accuracy rate of 98.02% with different state-of-the-art methods and can be enhanced by other emotional word embeddings.

AB An increasing number of monitoring systems have been developed in smart cities to ensure that a city's real-time operations satisfy safety and performance requirements. However, many existing city requirements are written in English with missing, inaccurate, or ambiguous information. There is a high demand for assisting city policy makers in converting human-specified requirements to machine-understandable formal specifications for monitoring systems. To tackle this limitation, we build CitySpec, the first intelligent assistant system for requirement specification in smart cities. To create CitySpec, we first collect over 1,500 real-world city requirements across different domains from over 100 cities and extract city-specific knowledge to generate a dataset of city vocabulary with 3,061 words. We also build a translation model and enhance it through requirement synthesis and develop a novel online learning framework with validation under uncertainty. The evaluation results on real-world city requirements show that CitySpec increases the sentence-level accuracy of requirement specification from 59.02% to 86.64%, and has strong adaptability to a new city and a new domain (e.g., Fl score for requirements in Seattle increases from 77.6% to 93.75% with online learning).

AB Nowadays, software development is accelerated through the reuse of code snippets found online in question-answering platforms and software repositories. In order to be efficient, this process requires forming an appropriate query and identifying the most suitable code snippet, which can sometimes be challenging and particularly time-consuming. Over the last years, several code recommendation systems have been developed to offer a solution to this problem. Nevertheless, most of them recommend API calls or sequences instead of reusable code snippets. Furthermore, they do not employ architectures advanced enough to exploit the semantics of natural language and code in order to form the optimal query from the question posed. To overcome these issues, we propose CodeTransformer, a code recommendation system that provides useful, reusable code snippets extracted from open-source GitHub repositories. By employing a neural network architecture that comprises advanced attention mechanisms, our system effectively understands and models natural language queries and code snippets in a joint vector space. Upon evaluating CodeTransformer quantitatively against a similar system and qualitatively using a dataset from Stack Overflow, we conclude that our approach can recommend useful and reusable snippets to developers.

AB The operational complexity and dynamicity of clouds highlight the importance of automated solutions for explaining the root cause of security incidents. Most existing works rely on human analysts to interpret provenance graphs for root causes of security incidents. However, navigating and understanding a large and complex cloud-scale provenance graph can be very challenging for human analysts. Without such an understanding, cloud providers cannot effectively address the underlying security issues causing the incidents, such as vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. In this paper, we propose VinciDecoder, an automated approach for generating natural language forensic reports based on provenance graphs. Our main observation is that the way nodes and edges compose a path in provenance graphs is similar to how words compose a sentence in natural languages. Therefore, VinciDecoder leverages a novel combination of provenance analysis, natural language translation, and machine-learning techniques to generate forensic reports. We implement VinciDecoder on an OpenStack cloud testbed, and evaluate its performance based on real-world attacks. Our user study and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating high-quality reports (e.g., up to 0.68 BLEU score for precision).

AB Lyrics generation has been a very popular application of natural language generation. Previous works mainly focused on generating lyrics based on a couple of attributes or keywords, rendering very limited control over the content of the lyrics. In this paper, we demonstrate the QiuNiu, a Chinese lyrics generation system which is conditioned on passage-level text rather than a few attributes or keywords. By using the passage-level text as input, the content of generated lyrics is expected to reflect the nuances of users' needs. The QiuNiu system supports various forms of passage-level input, such as short stories, essays, poetry. The training of it is conducted under the framework of unsupervised machine translation, due to the lack of aligned passage-level text-to-lyrics corpus. We initialize the parameters of QiuNiu with a custom pretrained Chinese GPT-2 model and adopt a two-step process to fine-tune the model for better alignment between passage-level text and lyrics. Additionally, a postprocess module is used to filter and rerank the generated lyrics to select the ones of highest quality. The demo video of the system is available at https://youtu.be/OCQNzahqWgM.

AB Recently, deep learning techniques have been developed for source code summarization. Most existing studies have simply adopted natural language processing techniques, because source code summarization can be considered as machine translation tasks from source code into descriptions. However, source code and its description are very different, not only in the languages of writing, but also in the purpose of writing. There is a large semantic gap between source codes in programming languages and their descriptions in natural languages. To respond to the semantic gap, we propose a two-phase model that consists of a keyword predictor and a description generator. The keyword predictor captures the natural language keywords semantically associated with the source code, and the generator generates a description by referring to the natural language keywords provided by the predictor. Using such keywords as scaffolding, we can effectively reduce the semantic gap and generate more accurate descriptions of source codes. To evaluate the proposed method, we use datasets collected from GitHub and StackOverflow. We perform various experiments with these datasets. Our methods show outstanding performance compared with baselines that include state-of-the-art methods, which concludes that keyword prediction is very helpful to the generation of accurate descriptions.

AB Code comment generation aims to translate existing source code into natural language explanations. It provides an easy-to-understand description for developers who are unfamiliar with the functionality of source code. Existing approaches to code comment generation focus on summarizing multiple lines of code with a short text, but often cannot effectively explain a single line of code. In this paper, we propose an asynchronous learning model, which learns the code semantics and generates a fine-grained natural language explanation for each line of code. Different from a coarse-grained code comment generation, this fine-grained explanation can help developers better understand the functionality line-by-line. The proposed model adopts a type-aware sketch-based sequence-to-sequence learning method to generate natural language explanations for source code. This method incorporates the type of source code and the mask mechanism with the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network via encoding and decoding phases. We empirically compare the proposed model with state-of-the-art approaches on real data sets of source code and description in Python. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can outperform existing approaches on commonly used metrics for neural machine translation.

AB RFID is an increasingly ubiquitous technology widely adopted in both the industry and our daily life nowadays. But when it comes to eavesdropping, people usually pay attention to devices like cameras and mobile phones, instead of small-volume and battery-free RFID tags. This work shows the possibility of using prevalence RFIDs to capture and recognize the acoustic signals. To be specific, we attach an RFID tag on an object, which is located in the vicinity of the sound source. Our key innovation lies in the translation between the vibrations induced when the sound wave hits the object surface and the fluctuations in the tag's RF signals. Although the inherent sampling rate of commercial RFID devices is deficient, and the vibrations are very subtle, we still extract characteristic features from imperfect measurements by taking advantage of state-of-the-art machine learning and signal processing algorithms. We have implemented our system with commercial RFID and loudspeaker equipment and evaluated it intensively in our lab environment. Experimental results show that the average success rate in detecting single tone sounds can reach as high as 93.10%. We believe our work would raise the attention of RFID in the concern of surveillance and security.

AB Oil spills, caused by accidents or by ships cleaning their tanks, represent big threats for maritime and coastal ecosystems health. A very effective detection of oil spills can be performed using satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems, operating regardless of cloud coverage and sunlight and capable of discriminating oil from regular sea surface. However, discriminating between real oil spills and lookalikes (such as natural oils and seepages, often occurring in upwelling sea areas), although well performed by expert SAR image interpreters, poses a great challenge for automatic processes. In addition, a visual check performed by human operators on a great number of images would be too expensive. Therefore, many solutions for automatic detection have been tried in the last few years, using probabilistic models and, more recently, machine learning. This work presents an innovative solution based on imageto-image translation using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained with an adversarial loss function. The proposed approach has been tested, with very promising results, using Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1 SAR data over the Mediterranean Sea and some areas of the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea.

TI Skeleton-Based Human Action Recognition via Screw Matrices
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS
AB With the recent advent of low-cost acquisition depth cameras, extracting 3D body skeleton has become relatively easier, which significantly lighten many difficulties in 2D videos including occlusions, shadows and background extraction, etc. Directly perceived features, for example points, lines and planes, can be easily extracted from 3D videos such that we can employ rigid motions to represent skeletal motions in a geometric way. We apply screw matrices, acquired by using rotations and translations in 3D space, to model single and multi-body rigid motion. Since screw matrices are members of the special Euclidean group SE(3), an action can be represented as a point on a Lie group, which is a differentiable manifold. Using Lie-algebraic properties of screw algebra, isomorphic to se(3), the classical algorithms of machine learning in vector space can be expanded to manifold space. We evaluate our approached on three public 3D action datasets: MSR Action3D dataset, UCF Kinect dataset and Florence3D-Action Dataset. The experimental results show that our approaches either match or exceed state-of-the-art skeleton-based human action recognition approaches.

AB Visual content description has been attracting broad research attention in multimedia community because it deeply uncovers intrinsic semantic facet of visual data. Most existing approaches formulate visual captioning as machine translation task (i.e., from vision to language) via a top-down paradigm with global attention, which ignores to distinguish visual and non-visual parts during word generation. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive attention strategy for visual captioning, which can selectively attend to salient visual content based on linguistic knowledge. Specifically, we design a key control unit, termed visual gate, to adaptively decide "when" and "what" the language generator attend to during the word generation process. We map all the preceding outputs of language generator into a latent space to derive the representation of sentence structures, which assists the "visual gate" to choose appropriate attention timing. Meanwhile, we employ a bottom-up workflow to learn a pool of semantic attributes for serving as the propositional attention resources. We evaluate the proposed approach on two commonly-used benchmarks, i.e., MSCOCO and MSVD. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach compared to several state-of-the-art methods.

AB Sign language is important since it provides a way for us to the deaf culture and more opportunities to communicate with those who are deaf or hard of hearing. Since sign language chiefly uses body languages to convey meaning, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) techniques can be used to recognize them for some sign language translation applications. In this paper, we show for the first time that Wi-Fi signals can be used to recognize sign language. The key intuition is that different hand and arm motions introduce different multi-path distortions in Wi-Fi signals and generate different unique patterns in the time-series of Channel State Information (CSI). More specifically, we propose a Wi-Fi signal-based sign language recognition system called WiSign. Different from existing Wi-Fi signal-based human activity recognition systems, WiSign uses 3 Wi-Fi devices to improve the recognition performance. We implemented the WiSign using a TP-Link TL-WR1043ND Wi-Fi router and two Lenovo X100e laptops. The evaluation results show that our system can achieve a mean prediction accuracy of 93.8% and mean false positive of 1.55%.

TI Annotation of sentence structure
SO LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
AB The focus of this article is on the creation of a collection of sentences manually annotated with respect to their sentence structure. We show that the concept of linear segments-linguistically motivated units, which may be easily detected automatically-serves as a good basis for the identification of clauses in Czech. The segment annotation captures such relationships as subordination, coordination, apposition and parenthesis; based on segmentation charts, individual clauses forming a complex sentence are identified. The annotation of a sentence structure enriches a dependency-based framework with explicit syntactic information on relations among complex units like clauses. We have gathered a collection of 3,444 sentences from the Prague Dependency Treebank, which were annotated with respect to their sentence structure (these sentences comprise 10,746 segments forming 6,341 clauses). The main purpose of the project is to gain a development data-promising results for Czech NLP tools (as a dependency parser or a machine translation system for related languages) that adopt an idea of clause segmentation have been already reported. The collection of sentences with annotated sentence structure provides the possibility of further improvement of such tools.

TI Distract and Divert: How World Leaders Use Social Media During
   Contentious Politics
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRESS-POLITICS
AB How do leaders communicate during domestic crises? We provide the first global analysis of world leader communication on social media during social unrest. We develop a theory of leaders' digital communication strategies, building on the diversionary theory of foreign policy, as well as research on the role of democratic institutions in explaining elite responsiveness. To test our theory, we construct a new dataset that characterizes leader communication through social media posts published by any head of state or government on Twitter or Facebook, employing a combination of automated translation and supervised machine learning methods. Our findings show that leaders increase their social media activity and shift the topic from domestic to foreign policy issues during moments of social unrest, which is consistent with a conscious strategy to divert public attention when their position could be at risk. These effects are larger in democracies and in particular in the run-up to elections, which we attribute to incentives created by democratic institutions. Our results demonstrate how social media provide meaningful comparative insight into leaders' political behavior in the digital age.

AB Chemical process optimization and control often require satisfaction of constraints for safe operation. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been shown to be a powerful control technique that can handle nonlinear stochastic optimal control problems. Despite this promise, RL has yet to see significant translation to industrial practice due to its inability to satisfy state constraints. This work aims to address this challenge. We propose an "oracle"-assisted constrained Q-learning algorithm that guarantees the satisfaction of joint chance constraints with high probability, which is required for safety critical tasks. To that end, constraint tightening (backoffs) are introduced, which are adjusted using Broyden's method, hence making the backoffs self-tuned. This results in a general methodology that can be integrated into approximate dynamic programming-based algorithms to guarantee constraint satisfaction with high probability. Finally, a case study is presented to compare the performance of the proposed approach with that of model predictive control (MPC). The superior performance of the proposed algorithm, in terms of constraint handling, signifies a step toward the use of RL in real world optimization and control of systems, where constraints are critical in ensuring safety.

TI Inexpensive Near-Infrared Fluorimeters: Enabling Translation of
   nIR-Based Assays to the Field
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The practical impact of analytical probes that transduce in the near-infrared (nIR) has been dampened by the lack of cost-effective and portable nIR fluorimeters. Herein, we demonstrate straightforward designs for an inexpensive microplate reader and a portable fluorimeter. These instruments require minimally complex machining and fabrication and operate with an open-source programming language (Python). Complete wiring diagrams, assembly diagrams, and scripts are provided. To demonstrate the utility of these two instruments, we performed high-throughput and field-side measurements of soil samples to evaluate the effect of soil management strategies on extracellular proteolytic, cellulolytic, and lignin-modifying activities. This was accomplished with fluorescent enzyme probes that utilized uniquely sensitive transducers exclusive to the nIR spectrum, single-walled carbon nanotubes. We also used the portable fluorimeter to evaluate spatial variations of proteolytic activity within individual field plots, while minimizing the effects of soil storage and handling. These demonstrations indicate the utility of these fluorimeters for translating analytical probes that operate in the nIR beyond the laboratory and into actual use.

AB Reducing the numerical precision of weights and activations of deep neural networks have proven to be a stunningly efficient way of deploying deep networks on edge devices with limited resources. With the advent of the Transformer model, several quantization techniques have been proposed to reduce the computation and model size. However, these existing quantization techniques use fixed bit-width assignments, which result in a significant degradation in the accuracy of the model. We present in this work an efficient Transformer based on our novel multi-layer quantization technique, which reduces the precision of data based on the characteristics of weights and activations in each layer of the Transformer architecture while at the same time preserving the model's structure. The WMT2014 DE-EN and WMT2014 FR-EN datasets are used to evaluate. The results show that our efficient Transformer achieves 4x compression with improved accuracy and an overall reduction in the training time overhead. By comparing with existing state-of-the-art techniques, we further proved that with a minimum of 3-bit and a maximum of 8-bit quantization, comparable state-of-the-art BLEU scores can be obtained.

TI Techniques Used for Registration and Reconditioning of Infrared Images
   of the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) Divertor
SO JOURNAL OF FUSION ENERGY
AB The heat flux loaded on the divertor is an important issue in tokamaks. At present, the heat flux on the divertor is calculated from the divertor surface temperature measured by the infrared (IR) camera. However, the movement of the field of view and the geometrical distortion are present in the IR images. Small movements occur with machine shaking during normal discharges, while large ones often arise at disruptions or the rapid variations in the magnetic field. As a result, it is difficult to obtain the real temperature evolution on the specified divertor surface from the IR images. In this paper, the scale invariant feature transform descriptors andK-means clustering have been applied for vibration correction on the IR videos in EAST. The projective transformation is used to correct the geometrical distortion in the IR images. The experimental results show that the proposed methods are efficient in compensating for image translations brought about by vibrations and for perspective distortions in the images, thereby allowing assignment of the IR emission-derived surface temperatures to the correct locations on the divertor surface.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS
AB Coreference resolution is one of the most critical issues in various applications of natural language processing, such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, suinmarization, etc. In the process of coreference resolution, in this paper, a fully connected neural network approach has been adopted to enhance the performance of 'feature extraction Whilst also facihlating the mention pair classification process for coreference resolution in the Persian language. For tins purpose, first, we focus on the feature extraction phase by fusing some handcrafted features, word enlbedding features and. semantic features. Then, a fully connected deep neural network is utilized to determine the probability of the validity of the mention pairs. After that, the numeric output of the last layer of the utilized neural network is considered as the feature vector of the valid mention pairs. Finally, the coreference mention pairs are specified by utilizing a hierarchical accumulative clustering method. Tie proposed method's evaluation on the Uppsala dataset demonstrates a meaningful impro,,TMent, as indicated by the F-score 61.51%, in comparison to state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB Zamboanga Chabacano (ZC) is the most vibrant variety of Philippine Creole Spanish, with over 400,000 native speakers in the Philippines (as of 2010). Following its introduction as a subject and a medium of instruction in the public schools of Zamboanga City from Grade 1 to 3 in 2012, an official orthography for this variety - the so-called "Zamboanga Chavacano Orthography" - has been approved in 2014. Its complexity, however, is a barrier to most speakers, since it does not necessarily reflect the particular phonetic evolution in ZC, but favours etymology instead. The distance between the correct spelling and the different spelling variations is often so great that delivering acceptable performance with the current de facto spell checking technologies may be challenging. The goals of this research is to propose i) a spelling error taxonomy for ZC, formalised as an ontology and ii) an adaptive spell checking approach using Character-Based Statistical Machine Translation to correct spelling errors in ZC. Our results show that this approach is suitable for the goals mentioned and that it could be combined with other current spell checking technologies to achieve even higher performance.

AB Adversarial examples - perturbations to the input of a model that elicit large changes in the output - have been shown to be an effective way of assessing the robustness of sequenceto-sequence (seq2seq) models. However, these perturbations only indicate weaknesses in the model if they do not change the input so significantly that it legitimately results in changes in the expected output. This fact has largely been ignored in the evaluations of the growing body of related literature. Using the example of untargeted attacks on machine translation (MT), we propose a new evaluation framework for adversarial attacks on seq2seq models that takes the semantic equivalence of the pre- and post-perturbation input into account. Using this framework, we demonstrate that existing methods may not preserve meaning in general, breaking the aforementioned assumption that source side perturbations should not result in changes in the expected output. We further use this framework to demonstrate that adding additional constraints on attacks allows for adversarial perturbations that are more meaningpreserving, but nonetheless largely change the output sequence. Finally, we show that performing untargeted adversarial training with meaning-preserving attacks is beneficial to the model in terms of adversarial robustness, without hurting test performance.

TI Defect Detection in Electronic Surfaces Using Template-Based Fourier
   Image Reconstruction
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPONENTS PACKAGING AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB For defect detection in nonperiodical pattern images, such as printed circuit boards or integrated circuit dies found in the electronic industry, template matching could be the only applicable method to tackle the problem. The traditional template matching techniques work in the spatial domain and rely on the local pixel information. They are sensitive to geometric and lighting changes, and random product variations. The currently available Fourier-based methods mainly work for plain and periodical texture surfaces. In this paper, we propose a global Fourier image reconstruction method to detect and localize small defects in nonperiodical pattern images. It is based on the comparison of the whole Fourier spectra between the template and the inspection image. It retains only the frequency components associated with the local spatial anomaly. The inverse Fourier transform is then applied to reconstruct the test image, where the local anomaly will be restored and the common pattern will be removed as a uniform surface. The proposed method is invariant to translation and illumination, and can detect subtle defects as small as 1-pixel wide in a wide variety of nonperiodical patterns found in the electronic industry.

AB Currently, the topic of natural language processing, morphological analysis, is a new emerging topics in the world. The main idea of morphological analysis may allow the identification of the literal origin of two words either root or seed and achieve the comparison to the original word. This paper describes a new idea related to standard miniaturization approach for Arabic morphological analysis. This approach based on regular noun morphological automaton technique (RNMT). The proposed algorithm focuses on a morphological regular abstractive noun (singular masculine) with length 3, 4 and 5 letters, which in turn, produce a special type of morphological miniaturization that is based on the concept of world analysis and restructure according to morphine scales. This aspect contribute to develop the Arabic morphological miniaturization, by developing the standardization aspect. It can be exploited by NLP applications like syntactic and semantic analysis, information retrieval, machine translation and orthographical correction. The result reveals that the proposed algorithm is anew attempt in Arabic language) Morphological analysis) and it is perfectly work on research sample, however, doesn't recognize between the enter words if it noun or verb.

AB With the recent popularity of animated GIFs on social media, there is need for ways to index them with rich meta-data. To advance research on animated GIF understanding, we collected a new dataset, Tumblr GIF (TGIF), with 100K animated GIFs from Tumblr and 120K natural language descriptions obtained via crowdsourcing. The motivation for this work is to develop a testbed for image sequence description systems, where the task is to generate natural language descriptions for animated GIFs or video clips. To ensure a high quality dataset, we developed a series of novel quality controls to validate free-form text input from crowdworkers. We show that there is unambiguous association between visual content and natural language descriptions in our dataset, making it an ideal benchmark for the visual content captioning task. We perform extensive statistical analyses to compare our dataset to existing image and video description datasets. Next, we provide baseline results on the animated GIF description task, using three representative techniques: nearest neighbor, statistical machine translation, and recurrent neural networks. Finally, we show that models fine-tuned from our animated GIF description dataset can be helpful for automatic movie description.

AB The aim of the present study is to uncover one of the fundamental aspects of the synthesis of Czech linguistic history. We attempt to do so by providing a scholarly biography and analysis of the intellectual heritage of the prominent Czech linguist, Vladimir Smilauer, whose death we commemorate this year. Methodologically, the study is based on the conceptual framework of Giddens' structuration theory of the acting subject in history, Jan Korensky's notions of the individual philosophical conception of language perception, and the principle of the importance of primary source research. Moreover, the study presents views on the evolution of Smilauer's scientific approach to syntax in the context of the influence of 'psychologizing syntax' from the beginning of the 20th century, the teachings of the Prague Linguistic Circle, the rise of quantitative linguistic approaches, post-war syntactic studies, especially in relation to the dependency description of Czech syntax, and machine translation theories. Based on the aforementioned concepts and combined with considerations of Smilauer's understanding of language culture, we aim to define his status in the evolution of 20th-century Czech linguistics.

TI Automatic Pavement Crack Detection Using Texture and Shape Descriptors
SO IETE TECHNICAL REVIEW
AB Pavement distress detection and analysis is the most important part of automated pavement -inspection -systems. Due to the circumstances such as complex texture, uneven illumination, and nonuniform -background, pavement distress detection is not a simply edge detection process. Over the past 30 years, lots of methods were proposed to detect pavement distresses, especially cracks. In this letter, a novel automatic pavement crack detection approach based on texture analysis and shape descriptors is proposed. Pavement surface is seen as a texture surface, and distresses are defined as inhomogeneities occurring in the texture surface. Six texture features and two translation-invariant shape descriptors were used here as discriminate features against irregular texture and uneven illumination. By using a SVM classifier, all sub-images are classified as crack or non-crack. Final results were obtained after post-processing, which includes segmentation, fake-crack eliminating, and crack-measuring methods. Compared with a traditional edge detector such as a Canny operator, experimental results demonstrated that all cracks are correctly detected by the proposed method, even in a strong texture background or in the surface with uneven illumination.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA
AB In this paper we report on our experiments on aligning names and faces as found in images and captions of online news websites. Developing accurate technologies for linking names and faces is valuable when retrieving or mining information from multimedia collections. We perform exhaustive and systematic experiments exploiting the (a) symmetry between the visual and textual modalities. This leads to different schemes for assigning names to the faces, assigning faces to the names, and establishing name-face link pairs. On top of that, we investigate generic approaches to the use of textual and visual structural information to predict the presence of the corresponding entity in the other modality. The proposed methods are completely unsupervised and are inspired by methods for aligning phrases and words in texts of different languages developed for constructing dictionaries for machine translation. The results are competitive with state-of-the-art performance on the "Labeled Faces in the Wild" dataset in terms of recall values, now reported on the complete dataset, include excellent precision values, and show the value of text and image analysis for identifying the probability of being pictured or named in the alignment process.

SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF
   MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
AB This paper presents an optimal design of a compliant mechanism with circular notch flexure hinges as well as a performance evaluation of a two-axes ultra-precision stage using the compliant mechanism. The compliant mechanism consists of two double-symmetric four-link mechanisms for two translational motions. As the circular notch flexure hinge can produce rotation as well as axial translation via its deformation, the double symmetric four-link mechanism can translate along one direction in a small range. In the optimal design, a composite global design index based on Min-Max principle is applied for the design of the compliant mechanism with circular notch flexure hinges owing to its simplicity and compactness. The designed compliant mechanism, piezoelectric elements for actuation, and capacitance-type displacement sensors for position measurement are assembled into an ultra-precision stage. The experimental results show that the stage implemented by the compliant mechanism will be applicable to two-axes ultra-precision positioning systems such as the fine positioning table of coarse-fine positioning systems, ultra-precision machining centres, wafer stages, and scanners for atomic force microscopy (AFM).

TI Eukaryotic ribosomal proteins lacking a eubacterial counterpart:
   important players in ribosomal function
SO MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY
AB The ribosome is a macromolecular machine responsible for protein synthesis in all organisms. Despite the enormous progress in studies on the structure and function of prokaryotic ribosomes, the respective molecular details of the mechanism by which the eukaryotic ribosome and associated factors construct a polypeptide accurately and rapidly still remain largely unexplored. Eukaryotic ribosomes possess more RNA and a higher number of proteins than eubacterial ribosomes. As the tertiary structure and basic function of the ribosomes are conserved, what is the contribution of these additional elements? Elucidation of the role of these components should provide clues to the mechanisms of translation in eukaryotes and help unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the differences between eukaryotic and eubacterial ribosomes. This article focuses on a class of eukaryotic ribosomal proteins that do not have a eubacterial homologue. These proteins play substantial roles in ribosomal structure and function, and in mRNA binding and nascent peptide folding. The role of these proteins in human diseases and viral expression, as well as their potential use as targets for antiviral agents is discussed.

SO DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS
AB Data mining is being touted as having potential for discovering information that will contribute toward resolving business problems or creating business opportunities. However, before this potential can be realized, one needs to be able to relate the strategic objectives of a business to the use of the data mining technology. In this paper we focus on one aspect of that requirement, the translation of managerial goals into parameters of the algorithm being used to analyze the data. The first step in the process is to define a mapping from managerial goals to the performance measures of the algorithm. We then propose and apply an experimental approach using a classification algorithm, Probabilistic Inductive Learning, to develop a mapping between the performance measures and the parameters of the algorithm The experimental results are analyzed and guidelines are given for setting the bias of the algorithm to meet managerial goals. We conclude by recommending that an experimental analysis similar to what we proposed be conducted for all data mining algorithms and provided along with documentation as an aid to the user.

TI Columns Occurrences Graph to Improve Column Prediction in Deep Learning
   Nlidb
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDB) has been a research topic for a decade. Significant data collections are available in the form of databases. To utilize them for research purposes, a system that can translate a natural language query into a structured one can make a huge difference. Efforts toward such systems have been made with pipelining methods for more than a decade. Natural language processing techniques integrated with data science methods are researched as pipelining NLIDB systems. With significant advancements in machine learning and natural language processing, NLIDB with deep learning has emerged as a new research trend in this area. Deep learning has shown potential for rapid growth and improvement in text-to-SQL tasks. In deep learning NLIDB, closing the semantic gap in predicting users' intended columns has arisen as one of the critical and fundamental problems in this research field. Contributions toward this issue have consisted of preprocessed feature inputs and encoding schema elements afore of and more impactful to the targeted model. Various significant work contributed towards this problem notwithstanding, this has been shown to be one of the critical issues for the task of developing NLIDB. Working towards closing the semantic gap between user intention and predicted columns, we present an approach for deep learning text-to-SQL tasks that includes previous columns' occurrences scores as an additional input feature. Overall exact match accuracy can also be improved by emphasizing the improvement of columns' prediction accuracy, which depends significantly on column prediction itself. For this purpose, we extract the query fragments from previous queries' data and obtain the columns' occurrences and co-occurrences scores. Column occurrences and co-occurrences scores are processed as input features for the encoder-decoder-based text to the SQL model. These scores contribute, as a factor, the probability of having already used columns and tables together in the query history. We experimented with our approach on the currently popular text-to-SQL dataset Spider. Spider is a complex data set containing multiple databases. This dataset includes query-question pairs along with schema information. We compared our exact match accuracy performance with a base model using their test and training data splits. It outperformed the base model's accuracy, and accuracy was further boosted in experiments with the pretrained language model BERT.

TI Natiolectal Variation in Dutch Morphosyntax: A Large-Scale, Data-Driven
   Perspective
SO JOURNAL OF GERMANIC LINGUISTICS
AB In this article, we report a large-scale corpus study aimed at tackling the (controversial) question to what extent the European national varieties of Dutch, that is, Belgian and Netherlandic Dutch, exhibit morpho-syntactic differences. Instead of relying on a manual selection of cases of morphosyntactic variation, we first marshal large bilingual parallel corpora and machine translation software to identify semiautomatically, in an extensively data-driven fashion, loci of variation from various "corners " of Dutch grammar. We then gauge the distribution of con-structional alternatives in a nationally as well as stylistically stratified corpus for a representative selection of twenty alternation patterns. We find that natiolectal variation in the grammar of Dutch is far more prevalent than often assumed, especially in less edited text types, and that it shows up in inflection phenomena, lexically conditioned syntactic variation, and pure word order permutations. Another key finding is that many cases of synchronic probabilistic asymmetries reflect a diachronic difference between the two varieties: Netherlandic Dutch often tends to be ahead in cases of ongoing grammatical change, with Belgian Dutch holding on somewhat longer to obsolescent features of the grammar.

TI A Survey of Knowledge-enhanced Text Generation
SO ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS
AB The goal of text-to-text generation is to make machines express like a human in many applications such as conversation, summarization, and translation. It is one of the most important yet challenging tasks in natural language processing (NLP). Various neural encoder-decoder models have been proposed to achieve the goal by learning to map input text to output text. However, the input text alone often provides limited knowledge to generate the desired output, so the performance of text generation is still far from satisfaction in many real-world scenarios. To address this issue, researchers have considered incorporating (i) internal knowledge embedded in the input text and (ii) external knowledge from outside sources such as knowledge base and knowledge graph into the text generation system. This research topic is known as knowledge-enhanced text generation. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of the research on this topic over the past five years. The main content includes two parts: (i) general methods and architectures for integrating knowledge into text generation; (ii) specific techniques and applications according to different forms of knowledge data. This survey can have broad audiences, researchers and practitioners, in academia and industry.

TI Single-cell Ribo-seq reveals cell cycle-dependent translational pausing
SO NATURE
AB Single-cell sequencing methods have enabled in-depth analysis of the diversity of cell types and cell states in a wide range of organisms. These tools focus predominantly on sequencing the genomes(1), epigenomes(2) and transcriptomes(3) of single cells. However, despite recent progress in detecting proteins by mass spectrometry with single-cell resolution', it remains a major challenge to measure translation in individual cells. Here, building on existing protocols(5-7), we have substantially increased the sensitivity of these assaysto enable ribosome profiling in single cells. Integrated with a machine learning approach, this technology achieves single-codon resolution. We validate this method by demonstrating that limitation for a particular amino acid causes ribosome pausing at a subset of the codons encoding the amino acid. Of note, this pausing is only observed in a sub-population of cells correlating to its cell cycle state. We further expand on this phenomenon in non-limiting conditions and detect pronounced GAA pausing during mitosis. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of this technique to rare primary enteroendocrine cells. This technology provides a first step towards determining the contribution of the translational process to the remarkable diversity between seemingly identical cells.

TI RNNFast: An Accelerator for Recurrent Neural Networks Using Domain-Wall
   Memory
SO ACM JOURNAL ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS
AB Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are an important class of neural networks designed to retain and incorporate context into current decisions. RNNs are particularly well suited for machine learning problems in which context is important, such as speech recognition and language translation.
   This work presents RNNFast, a hardware accelerator for RNNs that leverages an emerging class of nonvolatile memory called domain-wall memory (DWM). We show that DWM is very well suited for RNN acceleration due to its very high density and low read/write energy. At the same time, the sequential nature of input/weight processing of RNNs mitigates one of the downsides of DWM, which is the linear (rather than constant) data access time.
   RNNFast is very efficient and highly scalable, with flexible mapping of logical neurons to RNN hardware blocks. The basic hardware primitive, the RNN processing element (PE), includes custom DWM-based multiplication, sigmoid and tanh units for high density and low energy. The accelerator is designed to minimize data movement by closely interleaving DWM storage and computation. We compare our design with a state-of-the-art GPGPU and find 21.8x higher performance with 70x lower energy.

AB Disaggregated data centers propose a modular architecture where memory and compute resources are utilized in a finer granularity, aiming for a better optimized capacity and power consumption. In contrast to a classic compute node in a data center, memory is not required to be co-located with the processor, disaggregation can enhance hardware elasticity, improve virtual machine (VM) migration, and reduce the total cost of ownership (TCO), when compared to current data center solutions.
   This paper presents an evaluation of a disaggregated memory system prototype implemented on two modern FPGA SoC boards; one as a compute node and the second one as memory node. Using the PARSEC and Splash2x benchmark suites, we characterize our disaggregated prototype running on a remote memory node. In order to understand the design trade-offs, we utilize data collected from AXI Performance Monitors and break down the executions into three principal stages: (i) disaggregated memory address translation, (ii) network and (iii) memory access. This helps us to better evaluate the trade-offs of our prototype and to give better insight towards the next generation of disaggregated data centers.

AB Sign language is different from spoken language that emphasizes both the audio and verbal aspects. There are two sign languages applicable in Indonesia, namely Indonesian Signal System (SIBI) and Indonesian Sign Language (BISINDO). SIBI converts spoken Indonesian language into sign language and follows the Indonesian spoken language's grammatical structure complete with prefix and suffix. In contrast to SIBI, BISINDO translates one word from the Indonesian spoken language in accordance with its context followed by an expression showing the ongoing events. We choose BISINDO rather than SIBI in line with the deaf people's suggestions and requests out there to make BISINDO as an official Indonesian sign language to replace SIBI. This research aims to develop a translator model of BISINDO through computer vision technology such as Microsoft Kinect XBox and machine translation using Hidden-Markov Model (HMM) with optimal number of hidden states. We utilize skeleton data from Kinect sensor for feature extraction. There are four kinds of skeleton features used in this study consisting of the movement of the shoulders, upper arms, forearms, and hands. The experiment results by using this methodology successfully recognize the gesture of BISINDO with an accuracy is around 60%.

TI Finite Blocklength and Moderate Deviation Analysis of Hypothesis Testing
   of Correlated Quantum States and Application to Classical-Quantum
   Channels With Memory
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Martingale concentration inequalities constitute a powerful mathematical tool in the analysis of problems in a wide variety of fields ranging from probability and statistics to information theory and machine learning. Here, we apply techniques borrowed from this field to quantum hypothesis testing, which is the problem of discriminating quantum states belonging to two different sequences, {rho(n)}(n) and {sigma(n)}(n). We obtain achievability bounds on the finite blocklength type II Stein- and Hoeffding errors which, for i.i.d. states, are in general tighter than the corresponding bounds obtained by Audenaert, Mosonyi, and Verstraete. We also derive finite blocklength bounds and moderate deviation results for pairs of sequences of correlated states satisfying a (non-homogeneous) factorization property. Examples of such sequences include Gibbs states of spin chains with translation-invariant finite range interaction, as well as finitely correlated quantum states. We apply our results to find bounds on the capacity of a certain class of classical-quantum channels with memory, which satisfy a so-called channel factorization property-both in the finite blocklength and moderate deviation regimes.

AB As medical imaging datasets grow, we are approaching the era of big data for radiologic decision support systems. This requires renewed efforts in dataset curation and labeling. We propose a methodology for weak labeling of medical images for attributes such as anatomy and disease that relies on image to sentence transformation. The methodology consists of three models, a convolutional neural network that is trained on a coarse classification task and acts as an image feature generator, a language model to map sentences to a fixed length space, and a multi-layer perceptron that acts as a function approximator to map images to the sentence space. The transform model is trained on matched image-sentence pairs on a dataset of echocardiography studies. For a given image, labels are extracted from the closest sentences to the output of the image-sentence transform. We show that the resulting solution has an 78.2% accuracy in labeling Doppler images with aortic stenosis. We also show that the retrieved sentences are consistent with the true sentences in terms of meaning with an average BLEU score of 0.34, matching the current highly performing machine translation solutions.

AB We present an approach for automatically generating provably correct abstractions from C source code that are useful for practical implementation verification. The abstractions are easier for a human verification engineer to reason about than the implementation and increase the productivity of interactive code proof. We guarantee soundness by automatically generating proofs that the abstractions are correct.
   In particular, we show two key abstractions that are critical for verifying systems-level C code: automatically turning potentially overflowing machine-word arithmetic into ideal integers, and transforming low-level C pointer reasoning into separate abstract heaps. Previous work carrying out such transformations has either done so using unverified translations, or required significant proof engineering effort.
   We implement these abstractions in an existing proof-producing specification transformation framework named AutoCorres, developed in Isabelle/HOL, and demonstrate its effectiveness in a number of case studies. We show scalability on multiple OS microkernels, and we show how our changes to AutoCorres improve productivity for total correctness by porting an existing high-level verification of the Schorr-Waite algorithm to a low-level C implementation with minimal effort.

AB There are billions of lines of sequential code inside nowadays software which do not benefit from the parallelism available in modern multicore architectures. Transforming legacy sequential code into a parallel version of the same programs is a complex and cumbersome task. Trying to perform such transformation automatically and without the intervention of a developer has been a striking research objective for a long time. This work proposes an elegant way of achieving such a goal. By targeting a task-based runtime which manages execution using a task dependency graph, we developed a translator for sequential JAVA code which generates a highly parallel version of the same program. The translation process interprets the AST nodes for signatures such as read-write access, execution-flow modifications, among others and generates a set of dependencies between executable tasks. This process has been applied to well known problems, such as the recursive Fibonacci and FFT algorithms, resulting in versions capable of maximizing resource usage. For the case of two CPU bounded applications we were able to obtain 10.97x and 9.0x speedup on a 12 core machine.

TI Parsing Morphologically Rich Languages: Introduction to the Special
   Issue
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Parsing is a key task in natural language processing. It involves predicting, for each natural language sentence, an abstract representation of the grammatical entities in the sentence and the relations between these entities. This representation provides an interface to compositional semantics and to the notions of "who did what to whom." The last two decades have seen great advances in parsing English, leading to major leaps also in the performance of applications that use parsers as part of their backbone, such as systems for information extraction, sentiment analysis, text summarization, and machine translation. Attempts to replicate the success of parsing English for other languages have often yielded unsatisfactory results. In particular, parsing languages with complex word structure and flexible word order has been shown to require non-trivial adaptation. This special issue reports on methods that successfully address the challenges involved in parsing a range of morphologically rich languages (MRLs). This introduction characterizes MRLs, describes the challenges in parsing MRLs, and outlines the contributions of the articles in the special issue. These contributions present up-to-date research efforts that address parsing in varied, cross-lingual settings. They show that parsing MRLs addresses challenges that transcend particular representational and algorithmic choices.

TI Developing infrared spectroscopic detection for stratifying brain tumour
   patients: glioblastoma multiforme vs. lymphoma
SO ANALYST
AB Over a third of brain tumour patients visit their general practitioner more than five times prior to diagnosis in the UK, leading to 62% of patients being diagnosed as emergency presentations. Unfortunately, symptoms are non-specific to brain tumours, and the majority of these patients complain of headaches on multiple occasions before being referred to a neurologist. As there are currently no methods in place for the early detection of brain cancer, the affected patients' average life expectancy is reduced by 20 years. These statistics indicate that the current pathway is ineffective, and there is a vast need for a rapid diagnostic test. Attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy is sensitive to the hallmarks of cancer, as it analyses the full range of macromolecular classes. The combination of serum spectroscopy and advanced data analysis has previously been shown to rapidly and objectively distinguish brain tumour severity. Recently, a novel high-throughput ATR accessory has been developed, which could be cost-effective to the National Health Service in the UK, and valuable for clinical translation. In this study, 765 blood serum samples have been collected from healthy controls and patients diagnosed with various types of brain cancer, contributing to one of the largest spectroscopic studies to date. Three robust machine learning techniques - random forest, partial least squares-discriminant analysis and support vector machine - have all provided promising results. The novel high-throughput technology has been validated by separating brain cancer and non-cancer with balanced accuracies of 90% which is comparable to the traditional fixed diamond crystal methodology. Furthermore, the differentiation of brain tumour type could be useful for neurologists, as some are difficult to distinguish through medical imaging alone. For example, the highly aggressive glioblastoma multiforme and primary cerebral lymphoma can appear similar on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, thus are often misdiagnosed. Here, we report the ability of infrared spectroscopy to distinguish between glioblastoma and lymphoma patients, at a sensitivity and specificity of 90.1% and 86.3%, respectively. A reliable serum diagnostic test could avoid the need for surgery and speed up time to definitive chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

TI The role of non-English-language science in informing national
   biodiversity assessments
SO NATURE SUSTAINABILITY
AB Consulting the best available evidence is key to successful conservation decision-making. While much scientific evidence on conservation continues to be published in non-English languages, a poor understanding of how non-English-language science contributes to conservation decision-making is causing global assessments and studies to practically ignore non-English-language literature. By investigating the use of scientific literature in biodiversity assessment reports across 37 countries/territories, we have uncovered the established role of non-English-language literature as a major source of information locally. On average, non-English-language literature constituted 65% of the references cited, and these were recognized as relevant knowledge sources by 75% of report authors. This means that by ignoring non-English-language science, international assessments may overlook important information on local and/or regional biodiversity. Furthermore, a quarter of the authors acknowledged the struggles of understanding English-language literature. This points to the need to aid the use of English-language literature in domestic decision-making, for example, by providing non-English-language abstracts or improving and/or implementing machine translation. (This abstract is also avaialble in 21 other languages in Supplementary Data 4).

   sequence natural vector
SO COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY
AB Protein-protein non-interactions and interactions are distinguished and predicted by gene sequence using single nucleotide and contiguous nucleotides combined with machine learning models.
   Predicting protein-protein interaction and non-interaction are two important different aspects of multi-body structure predictions, which provide vital information about protein function. Some computational methods have recently been developed to complement experimental methods, but still cannot effectively detect real non-interacting protein pairs. We proposed a gene sequence-based method, named NVDT (Natural Vector combine with Dinucleotide and Triplet nucleotide), for the prediction of interaction and non-interaction. For protein-protein non-interactions (PPNIs), the proposed method obtained accuracies of 86.23% for Homo sapiens and 85.34% for Mus musculus, and it performed well on three types of non-interaction networks. For protein-protein interactions (PPIs), we obtained accuracies of 99.20, 94.94, 98.56, 95.41, and 94.83% for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Helicobacter pylori, Homo sapiens, and Mus musculus, respectively. Furthermore, NVDT outperformed established sequence-based methods and demonstrated high prediction results for cross-species interactions. NVDT is expected to be an effective approach for predicting PPIs and PPNIs.

AB System virtualization is a fundamental technology that enables many important applications. However, existing virtualization techniques suffer from a critical limitation due to their limited exploitation of host SIMD hardware resources, especially when a guest application does not have inherently fine-grained data-level parallelism. To bridge this utilization gap and unleash the full potential of host SIMD resources, this paper proposes an effective and unconventional SIMD exploitation technique. The proposed exploitation takes advantage of ample host SIMD registers and powerful host SIMD instructions to generate more efficient host binary code for guest applications even without any fine-grained data-level parallelism. It also mitigates the shortage of general-purpose registers on the host platform, as well as improves the efficiency of accessing guest registers. We have implemented the exploitation in an extensively-used virtualization platform, QEMU. Experimental results on a comprehensive list of benchmarks from PARSEC, SPEC-CPU2017, and Google Octane JavaScript benchmark suite show that an average of 2.2X performance speedup can be achieved for AArch64 binaries on an x86-64 host machine. We believe the proposed technique will provide a new perspective for our community to rethink the exploitation of SIMD hardware resources.

TI Adversarial Regularization as Stackelberg Game: An Unrolled Optimization

AB Adversarial regularization has been shown to improve the generalization performance of deep learning models in various natural language processing tasks. Existing works usually formulate the method as a zero-sum game, which is solved by alternating gradient descent/ascent algorithms. Such a formulation treats the adversarial and the defending players equally, which is undesirable because only the defending player contributes to the generalization performance. To address this issue, we propose Stackelberg Adversarial Regularization (SALT), which formulates adversarial regularization as a Stackelberg game. This formulation induces a competition between a leader and a follower, where the follower generates perturbations, and the leader trains the model subject to the perturbations. Different from conventional approaches, in SALT, the leader is in an advantageous position. When the leader moves, it recognizes the strategy of the follower and takes the anticipated follower's outcomes into consideration. Such a leader's advantage enables us to improve the model fitting to the unperturbed data. The leader's strategic information is captured by the Stackelberg gradient, which is obtained using an unrolling algorithm. Our experimental results on a set of machine translation and natural language understanding tasks show that SALT outperforms existing adversarial regularization baselines across all tasks. Our code is publicly available.

AB Crafting adversarial examples has become an important technique to evaluate the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, most existing works focus on attacking the image classification problem since its input space is continuous and output space is finite. In this paper. we study the much more challenging problem of crafting adversarial examples for sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, whose inputs are discrete text strings and outputs have an almost infinite number of possibilities. To address the challenges caused by the discrete input space. we propose a projected gradient method combined with group lasso and gradient regularization. To handle the almost infinite output space, we design some novel loss functions to conduct non-overlapping attack and targeted keyword attack. We apply our algorithm to machine translation and text summarization tasks, and verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm: by changing less than 3 words, we can make seq2seq model to produce desired outputs with high success rates. We also use an external sentiment classifier to verify the property of preserving semantic meanings for our generated adversarial examples. On the other hand, we recognize that, compared with the well-evaluated CNN-based classifiers, seq2seq models are intrinsically more robust to adversarial attacks.

AB During the past several years, a large amount of troll accounts has emerged with efforts to manipulate public opinion on social network sites. They are often involved in spreading misinformation, fake news, and propaganda with the intent of distracting and sowing discord. This paper aims to detect troll tweets in both English and Russian assuming that the tweets are generated by some "troll farm." We reduce this task to the authorship verification problem of determining whether a single tweet is authored by a "troll farm" account or not. We evaluate a supervised classification approach with monolingual, cross-lingual, and bilingual training scenarios, using several machine learning algorithms, including deep learning. The best results are attained by the bilingual learning, showing the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.875 and 0.828, for tweet classification in English and Russian test sets, respectively. It is noteworthy that these results are obtained using only raw text features, which do not require manual feature engineering efforts. In this paper, we introduce a resource of English and Russian troll tweets containing original tweets and translation from English to Russian, Russian to English. It is available for academic purposes.

AB Recent advances in neural sequence-to-sequence models have led to promising results for several language generation-based tasks, including dialogue response generation, summarization, and machine translation. However, these models are known to have several problems, especially in the context of chit-chat based dialogue systems: they tend to generate short and dull responses that are often too generic. Furthermore, these models do not ground conversational responses on knowledge and facts, resulting in turns that are not accurate, informative and engaging for the users. In this paper, we propose and experiment with a series of response generation models that aim to serve in the general scenario where in addition to the dialogue context, relevant unstructured external knowledge in the form of text is also assumed to be available for models to harness. Our proposed approach extends pointer-generator networks (See et al., 2017) by allowing the decoder to hierarchically attend and copy from external knowledge in addition to the dialogue context. We empirically show the effectiveness of the proposed model compared to several baselines including (Ghazvininejad et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018) through both automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluation on CONVAI2 dataset.

TI Ryoan: A Distributed Sandbox for Untrusted Computation on Secret Data
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER SYSTEMS
AB Users of modern data-processing services such as tax preparation or genomic screening are forced to trust them with data that the users wish to keep secret. Ryoan1 protects secret data while it is processed by services that the data owner does not trust. Accomplishing this goal in a distributed setting is difficult, because the user has no control over the service providers or the computational platform. Confining code to prevent it from leaking secrets is notoriously difficult, but Ryoan benefits from new hardware and a request-oriented data model.
   Ryoan provides a distributed sandbox, leveraging hardware enclaves (e. g., Intel's software guard extensions (SGX) [40]) to protect sandbox instances from potentially malicious computing platforms. The protected sandbox instances confine untrusted data-processing modules to prevent leakage of the user's input data. Ryoan is designed for a request-oriented data model, where confined modules only process input once and do not persist state about the input. We present the design and prototype implementation of Ryoan and evaluate it on a series of challenging problems including email filtering, health analysis, image processing and machine translation.

TI Deep Learning in Data-Driven Pavement Image Analysis and Automated
   Distress Detection: A Review
SO DATA
AB Deep learning, more specifically deep convolutional neural networks, is fast becoming a popular choice for computer vision-based automated pavement distress detection. While pavement image analysis has been extensively researched over the past three decades or so, recent ground-breaking achievements of deep learning algorithms in the areas of machine translation, speech recognition, and computer vision has sparked interest in the application of deep learning to automated detection of distresses in pavement images. This paper provides a narrative review of recently published studies in this field, highlighting the current achievements and challenges. A comparison of the deep learning software frameworks, network architecture, hyper-parameters employed by each study, and crack detection performance is provided, which is expected to provide a good foundation for driving further research on this important topic in the context of smart pavement or asset management systems. The review concludes with potential avenues for future research; especially in the application of deep learning to not only detect, but also characterize the type, extent, and severity of distresses from 2D and 3D pavement images.

AB Mobile robots path planning is a central problem in every situation where human intervention is not desired or not possible to accept: full automated industrial warehouses or general stocking areas and every domestic application that involves a mobile robot and special cases where environment is prohibited for human accessing like toxic wastes and bombs defusing [1]. Currently, neural networks are applied to problems related to mobile robot navigation. However, they are not as popular as in applications like image processing, speech recognition or machine translation, where they are commercially relevant. In this paper we propose a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network as an online search agent to tackle the problem of mobile robots path planning in unknown environments, meaning that the agent relies only on local map awareness realized with a LRF sensor and relative information between robot and goal position. Specifically, a final structure of LSTM network is analyzed and its performance is compared with the A* algorithm, a widely known method that follows the best-first search approach. Subsequently, an analysis of the method developed on a real robot is described.

AB There is an increasing demand for multilingual sentiment analysis, and most work on sentiment lexicons is still carried out based on English lexicons like WordNet. In addition, many of the non-English sentiment lexicons that do exist have been compiled by (machine) translation from English resources, thereby arguably obscuring possible language-specific characteristics of sentiment-loaded vocabulary. In this paper we describe the creation of a gold standard for the sentiment annotation of Swedish terms as a first step towards the creation of a full-fledged sentiment lexicon for Swedish - i.e., a lexicon containing information about prior sentiment (also called polarity) values of lexical items (words or disambiguated word senses), along a scale negative-positive. We create a gold standard for sentiment annotation of Swedish terms, using the freely available SALDO lexicon and the Gigaword corpus. For this purpose, we employ a multi-stage approach combining corpus-based frequency sampling and two stages of human annotation: direct score annotation followed by Best-Worst Scaling. In addition to obtaining a gold standard, we analyze the data from our process and we draw conclusions about the optimal sentiment model.

AB The shell language is widely used for various system administration tasks on UNIX machines, as for instance as part of the installation process of software packages in FOSS distributions. Our mid-term goal is to analyze these scripts as part of an ongoing effort to use formal methods for the quality assurance of software distributions, to prove their correctness, or to pinpoint bugs. However, the syntax and semantics of POSIX shell are particularly treacherous.
   We propose a new language called CoLiS which, on the one hand, has well-defined static semantics and avoids some of the pitfalls of the shell, and, on the other hand, is close enough to the shell to be the target of an automated translation of the scripts in our corpus. The language has been designed so that it will be possible to compile automatically a large number of shell scripts into the CoLiS language.
   We formally define its syntax and semantics in Why3, define an interpreter for the language in the WhyML programming language, and present an automated proof in the Why3 proof environment of soundness and completeness of our interpreter with respect to the formal semantics.

AB The Abstractive summarization aims to generate a shorter version of the document covering all the salient points in a compact and coherent fashion. On the other hand, query-based summarization highlights those points that are relevant in the context of a given query. The encode-attend-decode paradigm has achieved notable success in machine translation, extractive summarization, dialog systems, etc. But it suffers from the drawback of generation of repeated phrases. In this work we propose a model for the query-based summarization task based on the encode-attend-decode paradigm with two key additions (i) a query attention model (in addition to document attention model) which learns to focus on different portions of the query at different time steps (instead of using a static representation for the query) and (ii) a new diversity based attention model which aims to alleviate the problem of repeating phrases in the summary. In order to enable the testing of this model we introduce a new query-based summarization dataset building on debatepedia. Our experiments show that with these two additions the proposed model clearly outperforms vanilla encode-attend-decode models with a gain of 28% (absolute) in ROUGE-L scores.

TI Using complex networks for text classification: Discriminating
   informative and imaginative documents
SO EPL
AB Statistical methods have been widely employed in recent years to grasp many language properties. The application of such techniques have allowed an improvement of several linguistic applications, such as machine translation and document classification. In the latter, many approaches have emphasised the semantical content of texts, as is the case of bag-of-word language models. These approaches have certainly yielded reasonable performance. However, some potential features such as the structural organization of texts have been used only in a few studies. In this context, we probe how features derived from textual structure analysis can be effectively employed in a classification task. More specifically, we performed a supervised classification aiming at discriminating informative from imaginative documents. Using a networked model that describes the local topological/dynamical properties of function words, we achieved an accuracy rate of up to 95%, which is much higher than similar networked approaches. A systematic analysis of feature relevance revealed that symmetry and accessibility measurements are among the most prominent network measurements. Our results suggest that these measurements could be used in related language applications, as they play a complementary role in characterising texts. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2016

TI The INA complex facilitates assembly of the peripheral stalk of the
   mitochondrial F1Fo-ATP synthase
SO EMBO JOURNAL
AB Mitochondrial F1Fo-ATP synthase generates the bulk of cellular ATP. This molecular machine assembles from nuclear- and mitochondria-encoded subunits. Whereas chaperones for formation of the matrix-exposed hexameric F-1-ATPase core domain have been identified, insight into how the nuclear-encoded F-1-domain assembles with the membrane-embedded F-o-region is lacking. Here we identified the INA complex (INAC) in the inner membrane of mitochondria as an assembly factor involved in this process. Ina22 and Ina17 are INAC constituents that physically associate with the F-1-module and peripheral stalk, but not with the assembled F1Fo-ATP synthase. Our analyses show that loss of Ina22 and Ina17 specifically impairs formation of the peripheral stalk that connects the catalytic F-1-module to the membrane embedded F-o-domain. We conclude that INAC represents a matrix-exposed inner membrane protein complex that facilitates peripheral stalk assembly and thus promotes a key step in the biogenesis of mitochondrial F1Fo-ATP synthase.

AB Rapid growth of visual data processing and analysis applications, such as content based image retrieval, augmented reality, automated inspection and defect detection, medical image understanding, and remote sensing has made the problem of developing accurate and efficient image representation and classification methods one of the key research areas. This research proposes new higher-level perceptual shape features for image representation which are based on Gestalt principles of human vision. The concept of n-gram is adapted from text analysis as a grouping mechanism for coding global shape content of an image. The proposed perceptual shape features are translation, rotation, and scale invariant. Local shape features and n-gram grouping scheme are integrated together to create new Perceptual Shape Vocabulary (PSV). Different image representations based on PSVs with and without n-gram scheme are applied to image classification task using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The experimental evaluation results indicate that n-gram-based perceptual shape features can efficiently represent global shape information of an image, and augment the accuracy of image representation by low-level image features such as SIFT descriptors.

TI Towards an integrated graph-based semantics for UML
SO SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS MODELING
AB This paper shows how a central part of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) can be integrated into a single visual semantic model. It discusses UML models composed of class, object, state, sequence and collaboration diagrams and presents an integrated semantics of these models. As formal basis the theoretically well-founded area of graph transformation is employed which supports a visual and rule-based transformation of UML model states. For the translation of a UML model into a graph transformation system the operations in class diagrams and the transitions in state diagrams are associated with graph transformation rules that are then combined into one system in order to obtain a single coherent semantic description. Operation calls in sequence and collaboration diagrams can be associated with applications of graph transformation rules in the constructed graph transformation system so that valid sequence and collaboration diagrams correspond to derivations, i.e., to sequences of graph transformation rule applications. The main aim of this paper is to provide a formal framework that supports visual simulation of integrated UML specifications in which system states and state changes are modeled in a straightforward way.

AB Named Entity Recognition (NER) has an important role in almost all Natural Language Processing (NLP) application areas including information retrieval, machine translation, question-answering system, automatic summarization etc. This paper reports about the development of a statistical Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based NER system. The system is initially developed for Bengali using a tagged Bengali news corpus, developed from the archive of a leading Bengali newspaper available in the web. The system is trained with a training corpus of 150,000 wordforms, initially tagged with a HMM based part of speech (POS) tagger. Evaluation results of the 10-fold cross validation test yield an average Recall, Precision and F-Score values of 90.2%, 79.48% and 84.5%, respectively. This HMM based NER system is then trained and tested on the Hindi data to show its effectiveness towards the language independent abilities. Experimental results of the 10-fold cross validation test has demonstrated the average Recall, Precision and F-Score values of 82.5%, 74.6% and 78.35%, respectively with 27,151 Hindi wordforms.

AB Detecting and countering potential terrorist threats requires a synergistic conjunction of intelligent technologies. The paper describes an Intelligent Universal Situation Awareness (USA) System and in particular discusses a natural language front-end interface that is designed to reduce the impedance mismatch between the human and the machine. The effective translation of natural language semantics is critically dependent on an accelerated capability for learning. Hence, a conversational natural language is mapped onto a set of procedures, which effect directed mining and linking operations on a relational database. These procedures are written in a very high-level extensible language (VHLL), which serves to facilitate knowledge expression and maintenance operations. The VHLL is underpinned by expert compiler technology. Objects for directed mining and linking are invoked as rule consequents in a blackboard architecture. Using information hiding, objects can be visually displayed in the form of a tree to facilitate acquisition and maintenance operations. Finally, projected and restricted database views can be analyzed by a distinct high-level knowledge base to generate natural language reports. Most importantly, these reports provide the analyst with immediate feedback, which serves to catalyze the generation of subsequent queries.

TI High-magnification moire interferometer for crack tip analysis of steels
SO EXPERIMENTAL MECHANICS
AB A high-magnification moire interferometer, particularly suitable for near-tip field analysis in cracked materials, is described. It has a submillimeter field of view, a high-resolution image sensor (1.4 million pixels), X-Y-Z translation stage and an optical fiber light delivery system. These features enable the microscope head to observe the crack tip while the specimen is loaded in a standard tensile test machine. Automated fringe pattern analysis, using temporal phase shifting and spatial phase unwrapping, enables the x or y displacement component to be measured and the corresponding in-plane strain component computed. The displacement accuracy is better than 40 nm, and the effective strain gage dimension is similar to 25 mu m. Furthermore, the interferometer has a built-in white light microscope that allows the observation of the specimen granular microstructure in exact registration with the displacement field. The interferometer has hence been employed to investigate the near-tip fields of a precracked stainless steel specimen under load. The influence of the grain boundaries on the measured displacement fields was relatively minor. The near-tip strain field shows a significant asymmetrical behavior despite pure mode I loading conditions.

TI Circ-LocNet: A Computational Framework for Circular RNA Sub-Cellular
   Localization Prediction
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Circular ribonucleic acids (circRNAs) are novel non-coding RNAs that emanate from alternative splicing of precursor mRNA in reversed order across exons. Despite the abundant presence of circRNAs in human genes and their involvement in diverse physiological processes, the functionality of most circRNAs remains a mystery. Like other non-coding RNAs, sub-cellular localization knowledge of circRNAs has the aptitude to demystify the influence of circRNAs on protein synthesis, degradation, destination, their association with different diseases, and potential for drug development. To date, wet experimental approaches are being used to detect sub-cellular locations of circular RNAs. These approaches help to elucidate the role of circRNAs as protein scaffolds, RNA-binding protein (RBP) sponges, micro-RNA (miRNA) sponges, parental gene expression modifiers, alternative splicing regulators, and transcription regulators. To complement wet-lab experiments, considering the progress made by machine learning approaches for the determination of sub-cellular localization of other non-coding RNAs, the paper in hand develops a computational framework, Circ-LocNet, to precisely detect circRNA sub-cellular localization. Circ-LocNet performs comprehensive extrinsic evaluation of 7 residue frequency-based, residue order and frequency-based, and physio-chemical property-based sequence descriptors using the five most widely used machine learning classifiers. Further, it explores the performance impact of K-order sequence descriptor fusion where it ensembles similar as well dissimilar genres of statistical representation learning approaches to reap the combined benefits. Considering the diversity of statistical representation learning schemes, it assesses the performance of second-order, third-order, and going all the way up to seventh-order sequence descriptor fusion. A comprehensive empirical evaluation of Circ-LocNet over a newly developed benchmark dataset using different settings reveals that standalone residue frequency-based sequence descriptors and tree-based classifiers are more suitable to predict sub-cellular localization of circular RNAs. Further, K-order heterogeneous sequence descriptors fusion in combination with tree-based classifiers most accurately predict sub-cellular localization of circular RNAs. We anticipate this study will act as a rich baseline and push the development of robust computational methodologies for the accurate sub-cellular localization determination of novel circRNAs.

TI Creating a list of word alignments from parallel Russian simplification
   data
SO FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB This work describes the development of a list of monolingual word alignments taken from parallel Russian simplification data. This word lists can be used in such lexical simplification tasks as rule-based simplification applications and lexically constrained decoding for neural machine translation models. Moreover, they constitute a valuable source of information for developing educational materials for teaching Russian as a second/foreign language. In this work, a word list was compiled automatically and post-edited by human experts. The resulting list contains 1409 word pairs in which each "complex" word has an equivalent "simpler" (shorter, more frequent, modern, international) synonym. We studied the contents of the word list by comparing the frequencies of the words in the pairs and their levels in the special CEFR-graded vocabulary lists for learners of Russian as a foreign language. The evaluation demonstrated that lexical simplification by means of single-word synonym replacement does not occur often in the adapted texts. The resulting list also illustrates the peculiarities of the lexical simplification task for L2 learners, such as the choice of a less frequent but international word.

TI Prot2Prot: a deep learning model for rapid, photorealistic
   macromolecular visualization
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-AIDED MOLECULAR DESIGN
AB Molecular visualization is a cornerstone of structural biology, providing insights into the form and function of biomolecules that are difficult to achieve any other way. Scientific analysis, publication, education, and outreach often benefit from photorealistic molecular depictions rendered using advanced computer-graphics programs such as Maya, 3ds Max, and Blender. However, setting up molecular scenes in these programs is laborious even for expert users, and rendering often requires substantial time and computer resources. We have created a deep-learning model called Prot2Prot that quickly imitates photorealistic visualization styles, given a much simpler, easy-to-generate molecular representation. The resulting images are often indistinguishable from images rendered using industry-standard 3D graphics programs, but they can be created in a fraction of the time, even when running in a web browser. To the best of our knowledge, Prot2Prot is the first example of image-to-image translation applied to macromolecular visualization. Prot2Prot is available free of charge, released under the terms of the Apache License, Version 2.0. Users can access a Prot2Prot-powered web app without registration at http://durrantlab.com/prot2prot.

TI XG-ac4C: identification of N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) in mRNA using
   eXtreme gradient boosting with electron-ion interaction pseudopotentials
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) is a post-transcriptional modification in mRNA which plays a major role in the stability and regulation of mRNA translation. The working mechanism of ac4C modification in mRNA is still unclear and traditional laboratory experiments are time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, we propose an XG-ac4C machine learning model based on the eXtreme Gradient Boost classifier for the identification of ac4C sites. The XG-ac4C model uses a combination of electron-ion interaction pseudopotentials and electron-ion interaction pseudopotentials of trinucleotide of the nucleotides in ac4C sites. Moreover, Shapley additive explanations and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations are applied to understand the importance of features and their contribution to the final prediction outcome. The obtained results demonstrate that XG-ac4C outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. In more detail, the proposed model improves the area under the precision-recall curve by 9.4% and 9.6% in cross-validation and independent tests, respectively. Finally, a user-friendly web server based on the proposed model for ac4C site identification is made freely available at http://nsclbio.jbnu.ac.kr/tools/xgac4c/.

AB Structured Query Language (SQL) remains a standard language used in Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMSs), and has found applications in healthcare (patient registries), businesses (inventories, trend analysis), military, and education, etc. Although, SQL statements are English-like, the process of writing SQL queries is often problematic for non-technical end-users. To address this problem, a tool called Narrations-2-SQL is developed to allow an end-user to specify a query in natural language. Narrations-2-SQL is a desktop application that uses a Jumping Finite Automaton (JFA) - a type of Finite Machine for translating natural language descriptions into SQL queries, execute the queries, and provide a feedback to a user. An experimental evaluation was performed on 204 crowdsourced queries in natural language from the XNorthwind DB. Our results show an accuracy of 88%. To get the users' perceptions of this study, we carried out a survey on 167 end-users. Majority of the participants found Narrations-2-SQL to be very helpful, and agreed that it could be useful in industry. If implemented on a large scale, the tool may be helpful to many end-users in different domains.

AB The quality of e-Commerce services largely depends on the accessibility of product content as well as its completeness and correctness. Nowadays, many sellers target cross-country and cross-lingual markets via active or passive cross-border trade, fostering the desire for seamless user experiences. While machine translation (MT) is very helpful for crossing language barriers, automatically matching existing items for sale (e.g. the smartphone in front of me) to the same product (all smartphones of the same brand/type/colour/condition) can be challenging, especially because the seller's description can often be erroneous or incomplete. This task we refer to as item alignment in multilingual e-commerce catalogues. To facilitate this task, we develop a pipeline of tools for item classification based on cross-lingual text similarity, exploiting recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with and without pre-trained word-embeddings. Furthermore, we combine our language agnostic RNN classifiers with an in-domain MT system to further reduce the linguistic and stylistic differences between the investigated data, aiming to boost our performance. The quality of the methods as well as their training speed is compared on an in-domain data set for English-German products.

SO LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
AB Automatically recognized terminology is widely used for various domain-specific texts processing tasks, such as machine translation, information retrieval or ontology construction. However, there is still no agreement on which methods are best suited for particular settings and, moreover, there is no reliable comparison of already developed methods. We believe that one of the main reasons is the lack of state-of-the-art method implementations, which are usually non-trivial to recreate-mostly, in terms of software engineering efforts. In order to address these issues, we present ATR4S, an open-source software written in Scala that comprises 13 state-of-the-art methods for automatic terminology recognition (ATR) and implements the whole pipeline from text document preprocessing, to term candidates collection, term candidate scoring, and finally, term candidate ranking. It is highly scalable, modular and configurable tool with support of automatic caching. We also compare 13 state-of-the-art methods on 7 open datasets by average precision and processing time. Experimental comparison reveals that no single method demonstrates best average precision for all datasets and that other available tools for ATR do not contain the best methods.

AB Statistical language models (LMs) have been applied in several software engineering applications. However, they have issues in dealing with ambiguities in the names of program and API elements (classes and method calls). In this paper, inspired by the success of Deep Neural Network (DNN) in natural language processing, we present Dnn4C, a DNN language model that complements the local context of lexical code elements with both syntactic and type contexts. We designed a context-incorporating method to use with syntactic and type annotations for source code in order to learn to distinguish the lexical tokens in different syntactic and type contexts. Our empirical evaluation on code completion for real-world projects shows that Dnn4C relatively improves 11.6%, 16.3%, 27.1%, and 44.7% top-1 accuracy over the state-of-the-art language models for source code used with the same features: RNN LM, DNN LM, SLAMC, and n-gram LM, respectively. For another application, we showed that Dnn4C helps improve accuracy over n-gram LM in migrating source code from Java to C# with a machine translation model.

TI Assisting non-expert speakers of under-resourced languages in assigning
   stems and inflectional paradigms to new word entries of morphological
   dictionaries
SO LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
AB This paper presents a new method with which to assist individuals with no background in linguistics to create monolingual dictionaries such as those used by the morphological analysers of many natural language processing applications. The involvement of non-expert users is especially critical for under-resourced languages which either lack or cannot afford the recruitment of a skilled workforce. Adding a word to a morphological dictionary usually requires identifying its stem along with the inflection paradigm that can be used in order to generate all the word forms of the new entry. Our method works under the assumption that the average speakers of a language can successfully answer the polar question "is x a valid form of the word w to be inserted?", where x represents tentative alternative (inflected) forms of the new word w. The experiments show that with a small number of polar questions the correct stem and paradigm can be obtained from non-experts with high success rates. We study the impact of different heuristic and probabilistic approaches on the actual number of questions.

A robot cell, which often involves one or more robots and accessory equipment, can be regarded as part of the larger theme of cellular manufacturing. The objective that most interests manufacturers is the investment return rate. It is largely determined by the productivity of robotic cell, and the leading time of robotic production system. Therefore, a fast and efficient method to design a robotic cell layout with the maximum throughput for a given task is undeniably a worthy research topic. This paper attempts to discuss the challenges and key technologies in the robotic cell layout optimal design. The proper selection of configuration for task, manual operation skill learning and translation, collaborative design tool-chain, optimization in cell layout and operation scheduling, optimal end-of-arm tooling design, and human-robot collaboration are included in this discussion with existing or on-going problem-solving key technologies.

TI Possible Random Mechanism in Crystallization Evidenced in Proteins from
   Plasmodium falciparum
SO CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN
AB Protein crystallization is a process with considerably indescribable difficulties because many known and un-known factors contribute to the process to varying degrees, which are generally defined as amino acid attributes related to physicochemical properties. However, one might wonder whether randomness plays a role in crystallization. Following this, two questions are (i) can we find out the role of randomness in the crystallization process, and (ii) does more randomness or less randomness in a protein make it easily crystallized? In this study, we used logistic regression and neural network with each of 535 amino acid attributes including randomness attributes to fit the successful rate of crystallization of 118 proteins from Plasmodium falciparum; then we developed a predictive model for checking the role of random attributes in predicting protein crystallization, and we compared crystallized proteins with noncrystallized proteins in terms of random amino acid attributes. The results provide three pieces of clear evidence that randomness plays a role in protein crystallization and a protein that has more randomness is more easily crystallized.

TI Periodized Resistance Training With and Without Functional Training
   Improves Functional Capacity, Balance, and Strength in Parkinson's
   Disease
SO JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH
AB Strand, KL, Cherup, NP, Totillo, MC, Castillo, DC, Gabor, NJ, and Signorile, JF. Periodized resistance training with and without functional training improves functional capacity, balance, and strength in Parkinson's disease. J Strength Cond Res 35(6): 1611-1619, 2021-Periodized progressive resistance training (PRT) is a common method used to improve strength in persons with Parkinson's disease (PD). Many researchers advocate the addition of functional training to optimize translation to activities of daily living; however, machine-based PRT, using both force and velocity training components, may elicit similar benefits. Thirty-five persons with PD (Hoehn and Yahr I-III) were randomized into a strength, power, and hypertrophy (SPH; n = 17) or strength, power, and functional (SP + Func; n = 18) group, training 3 times weekly for 12 weeks. Both groups performed machine-based strength and power training on days 1 and 2 each week, respectively; whereas, on day 3, SPH group performed machine-based hypertrophy training and SP + Func group performed functional training. Functional performance was tested using the timed up and go, 30-second sit-to-stand (30-s STS), gallon-jug shelf-transfer, and seated medicine ball throw (SMBT) tests. Balance (Mini-BESTest), strength, motor symptoms (UPDRS-III), quality of life, and freezing of gait (FOG) were also assessed. Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed a main effect for time (p <= 0.05) with significant improvements for the sample in the 30-s STS (p = 0.002), SMBT (p = 0.003), Mini-BESTest (p < 0.001), upper-body strength (p = 0.002) and lower-body strength (p < 0.001). A significant group x time interaction was seen for FOG, with SP + Func alone showing improvement (p = 0.04). Furthermore, the SPH group produced a clinically important difference for the UPDRS-III (mean difference = 4.39, p = 0.18). We conclude that both exercise strategies can be equally effective at improving functional capacity, balance, and muscular strength in individuals with PD. In addition, FOG and motor symptoms may be targeted through SP + Func and SPH, respectively. The results provide options for individualized exercise prescriptions.

TI Multi-Stage Harmonization for Robust AI across Breast MR Databases
SO CANCERS
AB Simple Summary:& nbsp;Batch harmonization of radiomic features extracted from magnetic resonance images of breast lesions from two databases was applied to an artificial intelligence/machine learning classification workflow. Training and independent test sets from the two databases, as well as the combination of them, were used in pre-harmonization and post-harmonization forms to investigate the generalizability of performance in the task of distinguishing between malignant and benign lesions. Most training and independent test scenarios were statistically equivalent, demonstrating that batch harmonization with feature selection harmonization can potentially develop generalizable classification models.<br>Radiomic features extracted from medical images may demonstrate a batch effect when cases come from different sources. We investigated classification performance using training and independent test sets drawn from two sources using both pre-harmonization and post-harmonization features. In this retrospective study, a database of thirty-two radiomic features, extracted from DCE-MR images of breast lesions after fuzzy c-means segmentation, was collected. There were 944 unique lesions in Database A (208 benign lesions, 736 cancers) and 1986 unique lesions in Database B (481 benign lesions, 1505 cancers). The lesions from each database were divided by year of image acquisition into training and independent test sets, separately by database and in combination. ComBat batch harmonization was conducted on the combined training set to minimize the batch effect on eligible features by database. The empirical Bayes estimates from the feature harmonization were applied to the eligible features of the combined independent test set. The training sets (A, B, and combined) were then used in training linear discriminant analysis classifiers after stepwise feature selection. The classifiers were then run on the A, B, and combined independent test sets. Classification performance was compared using pre-harmonization features to post-harmonization features, including their corresponding feature selection, evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as the figure of merit. Four out of five training and independent test scenarios demonstrated statistically equivalent classification performance when compared pre- and post-harmonization. These results demonstrate that translation of machine learning techniques with batch data harmonization can potentially yield generalizable models that maintain classification performance.

AB Part design and process parameters directly influence the spatiotemporal distribution of temperature and associated heat transfer in parts made using additive manufacturing (AM) processes. The temporal evolution of temperature in AM parts is termed herein as thermal profile or thermal history. The thermal profile of the part, in turn, governs the formation of defects, such as porosity and shape distortion. Accordingly, the goal of this work is to understand the effect of the process parameters and the geometry on the thermal profile in AM parts. As a step towards this goal, the objectives of this work are two-fold: (1) to develop and apply a finite element-based framework that captures the transient thermal phenomena in the fused filament fabrication (FFF) additive manufacturing of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) parts, and (2) validate the model derived thermal profiles with experimental in-process measurements of the temperature trends obtained under different feed rate settings (viz., the translation velocity, also called scan speed or deposition speed, of the extruder on the FFF machine). In the specific context of FFF, this foray is the critical first-step towards understanding how and why the thermal profile directly affects the degree of bonding between adjacent roads (linear track of deposited material), which in turn determines the strength of the part, as well as, propensity to form defects, such as delamination. From the experimental validation perspective, we instrumented a Hyrel Hydra FFF machine with three non contact infrared temperature sensors (thermocouples) located near the nozzle (extruder) of the machine. These sensors measure the surface temperature of a road as it is deposited. Test parts are printed under three different settings of feed rate, and subsequently, the temperature profiles acquired from the infrared thermocouples are juxtaposed against the model-derived temperature profiles. Comparison of the experimental and model-derived thermal profiles confirms a high-degree of correlation therein, with maximum absolute error less than 10%. This work thus presents one of the first efforts in validation of thermal profiles in FFF via in-process sensing. In our future work, we will focus on predicting defects, such as delamination and inter-road porosity based on the thermal profile.

TI Machine Learning Predicts the 3D Outcomes of Adolescent Idiopathic
   Scoliosis Surgery Using Patient-Surgeon Specific Parameters
SO SPINE
AB Study Design. Retrospective descriptive, multicenter study. Objective. The aim of this study was to predict the three-dimensional (3D) radiographic outcomes of the spinal surgery in a cohort of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) as a function preoperative spinal parameters and surgeon modifiable factors. Summary of Background Data. Current guidelines for posterior spinal fusion surgery (PSF) in AIS patients are based on two-dimensional classification of the spinal curves. Despite the high success rate, the prediction of the 3D spinal alignment at the follow-ups remains inconclusive. A data-driven surgical decision-making method that determines the combination of the surgical procedures and preoperative patient specific parameters that leads to a specific 3D global spinal alignment outcomes at the follow-ups can lessen the burden of surgical planning and improve patient satisfaction by setting expectations prior to surgery. Methods. A dataset of 371 AIS patients who underwent a PSF with two-year follow-up were included. Demographics, 2D radiographic spinal and pelvic measurements, clinical measurements of the trunk shape, and the surgical procedures were collected prospectively. A previously developed classification of the preoperative global 3D spinal alignment was used as an additional predictor. The 3D spinal alignment (vertebral positions and rotations) at two-year follow-up was used as the predicted outcome. An ensemble learner was used to predict the 3D spinal alignment at two-year follow-up as a function of the preoperative parameters with and without considering the surgeon modifiable factors. Results. The preoperative and surgical factors predicted three clusters of 3D surgical outcomes with an accuracy of 75%. The prediction accuracy decreased to 64% when only preoperative factors, without the surgical factors, were used in the model. Predictor importance analysis determined that preoperative distal junctional kyphosis, pelvic sagittal parameters, end-instrumented vertebra (EIV) angulation and translation, and the preoperative 3D clusters are the most important patient-specific predictors of the outcomes. Three surgical factors, upper and lower instrumented vertebrae, and the operating surgeon, were important surgical predictors. The role of surgeon in achieving a certain outcome clusters for specific ranges of preoperative T10-L2 kyphosis, EIV angulation and translation, thoracic and lumbar flexibilities, and patient's height was significant. Conclusion. Both preoperative patient-specific and surgeon modifiable parameters predicted the 3D global spinal alignment at two-year post PSF. Surgeon was determined as a predictor of the outcomes despite including 20 factors in the analysis that described the surgical moves. Methods to quantify the differences between the implemented surgeon modifiable factors are essential to improve outcome prediction in AIS spinal surgery.

TI On the classification of simple and complex biological images using
   Krawtchouk moments and Generalized pseudo-Zernike moments: a case study
   with fly wing images and breast cancer mammograms
SO PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB In image analysis, orthogonal moments are useful mathematical transformations for creating new features from digital images. Moreover, orthogonal moment invariants produce image features that are resistant to translation, rotation, and scaling operations. Here, we show the result of a case study in biological image analysis to help researchers judge the potential efficacy of image features derived from orthogonal moments in a machine learning context. In taxonomic classification of forensically important flies from the Sarcophagidae and the Calliphoridae family (n = 74), we found the GUIDE random forests model was able to completely classify samples from 15 different species correctly based on Krawtchouk moment invariant features generated from fly wing images, with zero out-of-bag error probability. For the more challenging problem of classifying breast masses based solely on digital mammograms from the CBIS-DDSM database (n = 1,151), we found that image features generated from the Generalized pseudo-Zernike moments and the Krawtchouk moments only enabled the GUIDE kernel model to achieve modest classification performance. However, using the predicted probability of malignancy from GUIDE as a feature together with five expert features resulted in a reasonably good model that has mean sensitivity of 85%, mean specificity of 61%, and mean accuracy of 70%. We conclude that orthogonal moments have high potential as informative image features in taxonomic classification problems where the patterns of biological variations are not overly complex. For more complicated and heterogeneous patterns of biological variations such as those present in medical images, relying on orthogonal moments alone to reach strong classification performance is unrealistic, but integrating prediction result using them with carefully selected expert features may still produce reasonably good prediction models.

TI Examining new-generation transdermal alcohol biosensor performance
   across laboratory and field contexts
SO ALCOHOL-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH
AB BackgroundWrist-worn transdermal alcohol sensors have the potential to change how alcohol consumption is measured. However, hardware and data analytic challenges associated with transdermal sensor data have kept these devices from widespread use. Given recent technological and analytic advances, this study provides an updated account of the performance of a new-generation wrist-worn transdermal sensor in both laboratory and field settings. MethodsThis work leverages machine learning models to convert transdermal alcohol concentration data into estimates of Breath Alcohol Concentration (BrAC) in a large-scale laboratory sample (N = 256, study 1) and a pilot field sample (N = 27, study 2). Specifically, in both studies, the accuracy of the translation is evaluated by comparing BAC estimates yielded by BACtrack Skyn to real-time breathalyzer measurements collected in the laboratory and in the field. ResultsThe newest version of the Skyn device demonstrates a substantially lower error rate than older hand-assembled prototypes (0% to 7% vs. 29% to 53%, respectively). On average, real-time estimates of BrAC yielded by these transdermal sensors are within 0.007 of true BAC readings in the laboratory context and within 0.019 of true BrAC readings in the field. In both contexts, the distance between true and estimated BrAC was larger when only alcohol episodes were examined (laboratory = 0.017; field = 0.041). Finally, results of power-law-curve projections indicate that, given their accuracy, transdermal BrAC estimates in real-world contexts have the potential to improve markedly (>25%) with adequately sized datasets for model training. ConclusionFindings from this study indicate that the latest version of the transdermal wrist sensor holds promise for the accurate assessment of alcohol consumption in field contexts. A great deal of additional work is needed to provide a full picture of the utility of these devices, including research with large participant samples in field contexts.

TI High-performance neuroprosthetic control by an individual with
   tetraplegia
SO LANCET
AB Background Paralysis or amputation of an arm results in the loss of the ability to orient the hand and grasp, manipulate, and carry objects, functions that are essential for activities of daily living. Brain-machine interfaces could provide a solution to restoring many of these lost functions. We therefore tested whether an individual with tetraplegia could rapidly achieve neurological control of a high-performance prosthetic limb using this type of an interface.
   Methods We implanted two 96-channel intracortical microelectrodes in the motor cortex of a 52-year-old individual with tetraplegia. Brain-machine-interface training was done for 13 weeks with the goal of controlling an anthropomorphic prosthetic limb with seven degrees of freedom (three-dimensional translation, three-dimensional orientation, one-dimensional grasping). The participant's ability to control the prosthetic limb was assessed with clinical measures of upper limb function. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01364480.
   Findings The participant was able to move the prosthetic limb freely in the three-dimensional workspace on the second day of training. After 13 weeks, robust seven-dimensional movements were performed routinely. Mean success rate on target-based reaching tasks was 91.6% (SD 4.4) versus median chance level 6.2% (95% CI 2.0-15.3). Improvements were seen in completion time (decreased from a mean of 148 s [SD 60] to 112 s [6]) and path efficiency (increased from 0.30 [0.04] to 0.38 [0.02]). The participant was also able to use the prosthetic limb to do skilful and coordinated reach and grasp movements that resulted in clinically significant gains in tests of upper limb function. No adverse events were reported.
   Interpretation With continued development of neuroprosthetic limbs, individuals with long-term paralysis could recover the natural and intuitive command signals for hand placement, orientation, and reaching, allowing them to perform activities of daily living.

AB Image-based scene 3D reconstruction is one of the key tasks for many machine vision applications such as scene understanding, object pose estimation, autonomous navigation. A set of reliable and accurate methods for multi-view scene 3D reconstruction has been developed last decades. But a significant drawback of such 3D reconstruction technique is the need for acquiring a large number of images in the processed sequence to obtain an acceptable 3D scene representation.
   Recently modern convolutional neural network (CNN) models achieve the best quality for object recognition, image segmentation, image translation and some other challenging computer vision problems. The paper proposes a convolutional neural network architecture and a technique for training data preparation which provide a prediction of voxel model of a 3D scene with several objects.
   For CNN training and evaluation a special dataset was collected and annotated. It contains image sequences of several scenes and corresponding depth images and 3D models of these scenes. The image sequence serves as the primary data used for further scene 3D reconstruction by SfM technique. Structure from Motion processing results in surface 3D models of all objects in the scene and camera positions and orientation for every image in a sequence. Then surface 3D model is transformed into voxel 3D model and segmented into separate objects.
   Conditional generative adversarial network architecture was developed for 3D reconstruction by single image. Its generative part translates an input color image into an output voxel model. The discriminative part distinguishes the correct output (close to real voxel model) from false output (wrong output voxel model). Both parts are trained simultaneously on the prepared dataset.
   Evaluation on the testing part of the prepared dataset has demonstrated the ability of prediction 3D models of previously unobserved complex scenes containing several objects. The proposed neural network architecture provides high generalization ability and improved resolution of predicted voxel 3D models.

TI A zero-watermark scheme with geometrical invariants using SVM and PSO
   against geometrical attacks for image protection
SO JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
AB This paper proposes a zero-watermark scheme with geometrical invariants using support vector machine (SVM) classifier against geometrical attacks for image authentication. Here geometrical attacks merely address rotation, scale, and translation (RST) operations on images. The proposed scheme is called the SVM-based zero-watermark (SZW) scheme hereafter. The SZW method makes no changes to original images while embedding the owner signature of images so as to achieve high transparency. Moreover, in order to promote the robustness to RST operations, it integrates the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) with the log-polar mapping (LPM) for finding out RST invariants of images. The SZW method then generates the secret key for a host image via performing a logical operation exclusive disjunction, an exclusive- or (XOR) operation, on the original watermark and a set of the characteristics of the RST invariants of the host image. Subsequently, a trained SVM (TSVM) is regarded as a mapping so that it can memorize the relationships between the set of characteristics of RST invariants and the secret key. During the watermark-extraction process of the SZW method, the TSVM is first fed with the set of characteristics of RST invariants of the watermarked image to get the estimated secret key. The SZW method then extracts the estimated watermark by performing the XOR operation on the set of characteristics of RST invariants and the estimated secret key. Consequently, the SZW method requires no original image while retrieving watermarks. In the paper, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is also employed to search for a set of nearly optimal parameters of the SVM. Finally, the experimental results show that, in average, the SZW method outperforms other existing methods against RST attacks under consideration here. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Wavelength selection-based nonlinear calibration for transcutaneous
   blood glucose sensing using Raman spectroscopy
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS
AB While Raman spectroscopy provides a powerful tool for noninvasive and real time diagnostics of biological samples, its translation to the clinical setting has been impeded by the lack of robustness of spectroscopic calibration models and the size and cumbersome nature of conventional laboratory Raman systems. Linear multivariate calibration models employing full spectrum analysis are often misled by spurious correlations, such as system drift and covariations among constituents. In addition, such calibration schemes are prone to overfitting, especially in the presence of external interferences that may create nonlinearities in the spectra-concentration relationship. To address both of these issues we incorporate residue error plot-based wavelength selection and nonlinear support vector regression (SVR). Wavelength selection is used to eliminate uninformative regions of the spectrum, while SVR is used to model the curved effects such as those created by tissue turbidity and temperature fluctuations. Using glucose detection in tissue phantoms as a representative example, we show that even a substantial reduction in the number of wavelengths analyzed using SVR lead to calibration models of equivalent prediction accuracy as linear full spectrum analysis. Further, with clinical datasets obtained from human subject studies, we also demonstrate the prospective applicability of the selected wavelength subsets without sacrificing prediction accuracy, which has extensive implications for calibration maintenance and transfer. Additionally, such wavelength selection could substantially reduce the collection time of serial Raman acquisition systems. Given the reduced footprint of serial Raman systems in relation to conventional dispersive Raman spectrometers, we anticipate that the incorporation of wavelength selection in such hardware designs will enhance the possibility of miniaturized clinical systems for disease diagnosis in the near future.

TI A Heterogeneous Sensing Suite for Multisymptom Quantification of
   Parkinson's Disease
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING
AB Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease affecting millions worldwide. Bespoke subject-specific treatment (medication or deep brain stimulation (DBS)) is critical for management, yet depends on precise assessment cardinal PD symptoms - bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor. Clinician diagnosis is the basis of treatment, yet it allows only a cross-sectional assessment of symptoms which can vary on an hourly basis and is liable to inter- and intra-rater subjectivity across human examiners. Automated symptomatic assessment has attracted significant interest to optimise treatment regimens between clinician visits, however, no wearable has the capacity to simultaneously assess all three cardinal symptoms. Challenges in the measurement of rigidity, mapping muscle activity out-of-clinic and sensor fusion have inhibited translation. In this study, we address all through a novel wearable sensor system and machine learning algorithms. The sensor system is composed of a force-sensor, three inertial measurement units (IMUs) and four custom mechanomyography (MMG) sensors. The system was tested in its capacity to predict Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores based on quantitative assessment of bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor in PD patients. 23 PD patients were tested with the sensor system in parallel with exams conducted by treating clinicians and 10 healthy subjects were recruited as a comparison control group. Results prove the system accurately predicts UPDRS scores for all symptoms (85.4% match on average with physician assessment) and discriminates between healthy subjects and PD patients (96.6% on average). MMG features can also be used for remote monitoring of severity and fluctuations in PD symptoms out-of-clinic. This closed-loop feedback system enables individually tailored and regularly updated treatment, facilitating better outcomes for a very large patient population.

TI Neural activity modulations and motor recovery following
   brain-exoskeleton interface mediated stroke rehabilitation
SO NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL
AB Brain-machine interfaces (BMI) based on scalp EEG have the potential to promote cortical plasticity following stroke, which has been shown to improve motor recovery outcomes. However, the efficacy of BMI enabled robotic training for upper-limb recovery is seldom quantified using clinical, EEG-based, and kinematics-based metrics. Further, a movement related neural correlate that can predict the extent of motor recovery still remains elusive, which impedes the clinical translation of BMI-based stroke rehabilitation.
   To address above knowledge gaps, 10 chronic stroke individuals with stable baseline clinical scores were recruited to participate in 12 therapy sessions involving a BMI enabled powered exoskeleton for elbow training. On average, 132 +/- 22 repetitions were performed per participant, per session. BMI accuracy across all sessions and subjects was 79 +/- 18% with a false positives rate of 23 +/- 20%.
   Post-training clinical assessments found that FMA for upper extremity and ARAT scores significantly improved over baseline by 3.92 +/- 3.73 and 5.35 +/- 4.62 points, respectively. Also, 80% participants (7 with moderate-mild impairment, 1 with severe impairment) achieved minimal clinically important difference (MCID: FMA-UE >5.2 or ARAT >5.7) during the course of the study. Kinematic measures indicate that, on average, participants' movements became faster and smoother. Moreover, modulations in movement related cortical potentials, an EEG-based neural correlate measured contralateral to the impaired arm, were significantly correlated with ARAT scores (rho = 0.72, p < 0.05) and marginally correlated with FMA-UE (rho = 0.63, p = 0.051). This suggests higher activation of ipsi-lesional hemisphere post-intervention or inhibition of competing contra-lesional hemisphere, which may be evidence of neuroplasticity and cortical reorganization following BMI mediated rehabilitation therapy.

TI On the Characteristics of Symbolic Execution in the Problem of Assessing
   the Quality of Obfuscating Transformations
SO AUTOMATIC CONTROL AND COMPUTER SCIENCES
AB Obfuscation is used to protect programs from analysis and reverse engineering. There are theoretically effective and resistant obfuscation methods, however, most of them are not implemented in practice yet. The main issues are the large overhead for the execution of obfuscated code and the limitation of application only to a specific class of programs. On the other hand, a large number of obfuscation methods have been developed that are applied in practice. The existing approaches to the assessment of such obfuscation methods are based mainly on the static characteristics of programs. Therefore, the comprehensive (taking into account the dynamic characteristics of programs) justification of their effectiveness and resistance is a relevant task. It seems that such a justification can be made using machine learning methods based on feature vectors that describe both static and dynamic characteristics of programs. In this paper, it is proposed to build such a vector on the basis of characteristics of two compared programs: the original and obfuscated, original and deobfuscated, obfuscated and deobfuscated. In order to obtain the dynamic characteristics of the program, a scheme based on a symbolic execution is constructed and presented in this paper. The choice of the symbolic execution is justified by the fact that such characteristics can describe the difficulty of comprehension of the program in dynamic analysis. This paper proposes two implementations of the scheme: extended and simplified. The extended scheme is closer to the process of analyzing a program by an analyst, since it includes the steps of disassembly and translation into intermediate code, while in the simplified scheme these steps are excluded. In order to identify the characteristics of symbolic execution that are suitable for assessing the effectiveness and resistance of obfuscation based on machine learning methods, experiments with the developed schemes were carried out. Based on the obtained results, a set of suitable characteristics is determined.

TI Multimodal Co-learning: Challenges, applications with datasets, recent
   advances and future directions
SO INFORMATION FUSION
AB Multimodal deep learning systems that employ multiple modalities like text, image, audio, video, etc., are showing better performance than individual modalities (i.e., unimodal) systems. Multimodal machine learning involves multiple aspects: representation, translation, alignment, fusion, and co-learning. In the current state of multimodal machine learning, the assumptions are that all modalities are present, aligned, and noiseless during training and testing time. However, in real-world tasks, typically, it is observed that one or more modalities are missing, noisy, lacking annotated data, have unreliable labels, and are scarce in training or testing, and or both. This challenge is addressed by a learning paradigm called multimodal co-learning. The modeling of a (resourcepoor) modality is aided by exploiting knowledge from another (resource-rich) modality using the transfer of knowledge between modalities, including their representations and predictive models. Co-learning being an emerging area, there are no dedicated reviews explicitly focusing on all challenges addressed by co-learning. To that end, in this work, we provide a comprehensive survey on the emerging area of multimodal co-learning that has not been explored in its entirety yet. We review implementations that overcome one or more co-learning challenges without explicitly considering them as co-learning challenges. We present the comprehensive taxonomy of multimodal co-learning based on the challenges addressed by co-learning and associated implementations. The various techniques, including the latest ones, are reviewed along with some applications and datasets. Additionally, we review techniques that appear to be similar to multimodal colearning and are being used primarily in unimodal or multi-view learning. The distinction between them is documented. Our final goal is to discuss challenges and perspectives and the important ideas and directions for future work that we hope will benefit for the entire research community focusing on this exciting domain.

TI Enhancing narrative clinical guidance with computer-readable artifacts:
   Authoring FHIR implementation guides based on WHO recommendations
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS
AB Introduction: Narrative clinical guidelines often contain assumptions, knowledge gaps, and ambiguities that make translation into an electronic computable format difficult. This can lead to divergence in electronic implementations, reducing the usefulness of collected data outside of that implementation setting. This work set out to evolve guidelines-based data dictionaries by mapping to HL7 Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and semantic terminology, thus progressing toward machine-readable guidelines that define the minimum data set required to support family planning and sexually transmitted infections. Material and methods: The data dictionaries were first structured to facilitate mapping to FHIR and semantic terminologies, including ICD-10, SNOMED-CT, LOINC, and RxNorm. FHIR resources and codes were assigned to data dictionary terms. The data dictionary and mappings were used as inputs for a newly developed tool to generate FHIR implementation guides. Results: Implementation guides for core data requirements for family planning and sexually transmitted infections were created. These implementation guides display data dictionary content as FHIR resources and semantic terminology codes. Challenges included the use of a two-dimensional spreadsheet to facilitate mapping, the need to create FHIR profiles and resource extensions, and applying FHIR to a data dictionary that was created with a user interface in mind. Conclusions: Authoring FHIR implementation guides is a complex and evolving practice, and there are limited examples for this groundbreaking work. Moving toward machine-readable guidelines by mapping to FHIR and semantic terminologies requires a thorough understanding of the context and use of terminology, an applied information model, and other strategies for optimizing the creation and long-term management of implementation guides. Next steps for this work include validation and, eventually, real-world application. The process for creating the data dictionary and for generating implementation guides should also be improved to prepare for this expanding work.

TI Human versus machine editing of electronic prescription directions
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION
AB Background: Pharmacy staff are responsible for editing poor-quality and difficult-to-read electronic prescription (e-prescription) directions. Machine translation (MT) models are capable of translating free text from 1 sequence into another. However, the quality of MTs of e-prescriptions into pharmacy label directions is unknown.
   Objective: To determine the types and frequencies of e-prescription direction component errors made by an MT model, pharmacy staff, and prescribers.
   Methods: A prospective evaluation was conducted on a random sample of 300 patient directions in a test set of e-prescriptions from a mail-order pharmacy. Each row included directions produced by (1) prescribers on e-prescriptions, (2) pharmacy staff on prescription labels, and (3) an open neural MT model. Annotators labeled direction sets for missing direction components, use of abbreviations and medical jargon, and incorrect information (e.g., changing the number of tablets to be taken). The longest common subsequence (LCS) compared the amount of pharmacy staff editing with and without MT.
   Results: Out of 279 direction sets labeled, the MT model directions contained no quality issues in 196 (70.3%) samples compared with 187 (67.0%) and 83 (29.8%) samples for pharmacy staff directions and prescriber directions, respectively. The MT model directions contained more incorrect components (n = 23). Median LCS was greater without MT (30.0 vs. 18.5, P < 0.01, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), indicating more editing was needed.
   Conclusion: MT could be used to improve the quality of e-prescription directions; however, MT makes high-risk mistakes such as incorrectly predicting the tapering regimen for prednisone. The use of semiautomated MT, where pharmacy staff can review model predictions to detect and resolve quality issues, should be considered to improve safety and decrease total work time compared with current practice. MT has strengths and weaknesses for improving the editing process of the patient directions compared with pharmacy staff alone.

AB The study presents the word translation into vectors of real numbers (word embeddings), one of the most important topics in natural language processing. Word2vec is the latest techniques developed by Tomas Mikolov to study high quality vectors. The majority of studies on clustering the word vectors were made in English. Dmitry Chaplinsky has already counted and published vectors for the Ukrainian language by using LexVec, Word2vec and GloVe techniques, obtained from fiction, newswire and ubercorpus texts, for VESUM dictionary and other related NLP tools for the Ukrainian language. There was no research done on the vectors by using Word2vec technique to create Ukrainian corpus, obtained from Wikipedia dump as the main source. The collection contains more than two hundred and sixty one million words. The dictionary of words (unique words) obtained from the corpus is more than seven hundred and nine thousand. The research using machine technology Word2vec is of great practical importance to computerise many areas of linguistic analysis. The open-source Python programming language was used to obtain word vectors with Word2vec techniques and to calculate the cosine proximity of the vectors. In order to do machine learning with Word2vec techniques on Python, a resource containing open source licensed software libraries called "Gensim" was used. Calculations regarding the cosine affinities of the obtained vectors were made using "Gensim" libraries. The research examining the clustering of the word vectors obtained from the Ukrainian corpus was made considering the two sub-branches of linguistics, semantics and morphology (language morphology). Firstly, it was investigated how accurately the vectors are obtained from the Ukrainian corpus and how the words represent the cluster they belong to. Secondly, it was investigated how word vectors are clustered and associated respectively to the morphological features of the suffixes of the Ukrainian language.

TI Assessment of Alcohol Use in the Natural Environment
SO ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH
AB The current article critically reviews 3 methodological options for assessing drinking episodes in the natural environment. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) typically involves using mobile devices to collect self-report data from participants in daily life. This technique is now widely used in alcohol research, but investigators have implemented diverse assessment strategies. This article focuses on "high-resolution" EMA protocols that oversample experiences and behaviors within individual drinking episodes. A number of approaches have been used to accomplish this, including using signaled follow-ups tied to drinking initiation, asking participants to log entries before and after individual drinks or drinking episodes, and delivering frequent signaled assessments during periods of the day when alcohol use is most common. Transdermal alcohol sensors (TAS) are devices that are worn continuously and are capable of detecting alcohol eliminated through the skin. These methods are appealing because they do not rely upon drinkers' self-report. Studies using TAS have been appearing with greater frequency over the past several years. New methods are making the use of TAS more tractable by permitting back-translation of transdermal alcohol concentration data to more familiar estimates of blood alcohol concentration or breath alcohol concentration. However, the current generation of devices can have problems with missing data and tend to be relatively insensitive to low-level drinking. An emerging area of research investigates the possibility of using mobile device data and machine learning to passively detect the user's drinking, with promising early findings. EMA, TAS, and sensor-based approaches are all valid, and tend to produce convergent information when used in conjunction with one another. Each has a unique profile of advantages, disadvantages, and threats to validity. Therefore, the nature of the underlying research question must dictate the method(s) investigators select.

TI Unveiling relevant non-motor Parkinson's disease severity symptoms using
   a machine learning approach
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE
AB Objective: Is it possible to predict the severity staging of a Parkinson's disease (PD) patient using scores of non-motor symptoms? This is the kickoff question for a machine learning approach to classify two widely known PD severity indexes using individual tests from a broad set of non-motor PD clinical scales only.
   Methods: The Hoehn & Yahr index and clinical impression of severity index are global measures of PD severity. They constitute the labels to be assigned in two supervised classification problems using only non-motor symptom tests as predictor variables. Such predictors come from a wide range of PD symptoms, such as cognitive impairment, psychiatric complications, autonomic dysfunction or sleep disturbance. The classification was coupled with a feature subset selection task using an advanced evolutionary algorithm, namely an estimation of distribution algorithm.
   Results: Results show how five different classification paradigms using a wrapper feature selection scheme are capable of predicting each of the class variables with estimated accuracy in the range of 72-92%. In addition, classification into the main three severity categories (Mild, moderate and severe) was split into dichotomic problems where binary classifiers perform better and select different subsets of non-motor symptoms. The number of jointly selected symptoms throughout the whole process was low, suggesting a link between the selected non-motor symptoms and the general severity of the disease.
   Conclusion: Quantitative results are discussed from a medical point of view, reflecting a clear translation to the clinical manifestations of PD. Moreover, results include a brief panel of non-motor symptoms that could help clinical practitioners to identify patients who are at different stages of the disease from a limited set of symptoms, such as hallucinations, fainting, inability to control body sphincters or believing in unlikely facts.

AB Honeypot has been an invaluable tool for the detection and analysis of network-based attacks by either human intruders or automated malware in the wild. The insights obtained by deploying honeypots, especially high-interaction ones, largely rely on the monitoring capability on the honeypots. In practice, based on the location of sensors, honeypots can be monitored either internally or externally. Being deployed inside the monitored honeypots, internal sensors are able to provide a semantic-rich view on various aspects of system dynamics (e.g., system calls). However, their very internal existence makes them visible, tangible, and even subvertible to attackers after break-ins. From another perspective, existing external honeypot sensors (e.g., network sniffers) could be made invisible to the monitored honeypot. However, they are not able to capture any internal system events such as system calls executed.
   It is desirable to have a honeypot monitoring system that is invisible, tamper-resistant and yet is capable of recording and understanding the honeypot's system internal events such as system calls. In this paper, we present a virtualization-based system called VMscope which allows us to view the system internal events of virtual machine (VM)-based honeypots from outside the honeypots. Particularly, by observing and interpreting VM-internal system call events at the virtual machine monitor (VMM) layer, VMscope is able to provide the same deep inspection capability as that of traditional inside-the-honeypot monitoring tools (e.g., Sebek) while still obtaining similar tamper-resistance and invisibility as other external monitoring tools. We have built a proof-of-concept prototype by leveraging and extending one key virtualization technique called binary translation. Our experiments with real-world honeypots show that VMscope is robust against advanced countermeasures that can defeat existing internally-deployed honeypot monitors, and it only incurs moderate run-time overhead.

TI Word Sense Clustering and Clusterability
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Word sense disambiguation and the related field of automated word sense induction traditionally assume that the occurrences of a lemma can be partitioned into senses. But this seems to be a much easier task for some lemmas than others. Our work builds on recent work that proposes describing word meaning in a graded fashion rather than through a strict partition into senses; in this article we argue that not all lemmas may need the more complex graded analysis, depending on their partitionability. Although there is plenty of evidence from previous studies and from the linguistics literature that there is a spectrum of partitionability of word meanings, this is the first attempt to measure the phenomenon and to couple the machine learning literature on clusterability with word usage data used in computational linguistics.
   We propose to operationalize partitionability as clusterability, a measure of how easy the occurrences of a lemma are to cluster. We test two ways of measuring clusterability: (1) existing measures from the machine learning literature that aim to measure the goodness of optimal k-means clusterings, and (2) the idea that if a lemma is more clusterable, two clusterings based on two different "views" of the same data points will be more congruent. The two views that we use are two different sets of manually constructed lexical substitutes for the target lemma, on the one hand monolingual paraphrases, and on the other hand translations. We apply automatic clustering to the manual annotations. We use manual annotations because we want the representations of the instances that we cluster to be as informative and "clean" as possible. We show that when we control for polysemy, our measures of clusterability tend to correlate with partitionability, in particular some of the type-(1) clusterability measures, and that these measures outperform a baseline that relies on the amount of overlap in a soft clustering.

TI The materiality of things? Bruno Latour, Charles Peguy and the history
   of science
SO HISTORY OF THE HUMAN SCIENCES
AB This article sheds new light on Bruno Latour's sociology of science and technology by looking at his early study of the French writer, philosopher and editor Charles Peguy (1873-1914). In the early 1970s, Latour engaged in a comparative study of Peguy's Clio and the four gospels of the New Testament. His 1973 contribution to a Peguy colloquium (published in 1977) offers rich insights into his interest in questions of time, history, tradition and translation. Inspired by Gilles Deleuze's philosophy of difference, Latour reads Clio as spelling out and illustrating the following argument: 'Repetition is a machine to produce differences with identity'. However, in contrast to Deleuze's work (together with Felix Guattari) on the materiality of machines, or assemblages [agencements], Latour emphasizes the semiotic aspects of the repetition/difference process. As in Peguy, the main model for this process is the Roman Catholic tradition of religious events. The article argues that it is this reading of Peguy and Latour's early interest in biblical exegesis that inspired much of Latour's later work. In Laboratory Life (Latour and Woolgar, 1979) and The Pasteurization of France (1988) in particular, problems of exegesis and tradition provide important stimuli for the analysis of scientific texts. In this context, Latour gradually transforms the question of tradition into the problem of reference. In a first step, he shifts the event that is transmitted and translated from the temporal dimension (i.e. the past) to the spatial (i.e. from one part of the laboratory to another). It is only in a second step that Latour resituates scientific events in time. As facts they are 'constructed' but nevertheless 'irreducible'. They result, according to Latour, from the tradition of the future. As a consequence, the Latourian approach to science distances itself from the materialism of Deleuze and other innovative theoreticians.

TI Classification of Image and Text Data Using Deep Learning-Based LSTM
   Model
SO TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL
AB The advent of social networking and the internet has resulted in a huge shift in how consumers express their loyalty and where firms acquire a reputation. Customers and businesses frequently leave comments, and entrepreneurs do the same. These write-ups may be useful to those with the ability to analyse them. However, analysing textual content without the use of computers and the associated tools is time-consuming and difficult. The goal of Sentiment Analysis (SA) is to discover client feedback, points of view, or complaints that describe the product in a more negative or optimistic light. You can expect this to be a result based on this data if you merely read and assess feedback or examine ratings. There was a time when only the use of standard techniques, such as linear regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM), was effective for the task of automatically discovering knowledge from written explanations, but the older approaches have now been mostly replaced by deep neural networks, and deep learning has gotten the job done. Convolution and compressing RNNs are useful for tasks like machine translation, caption creation, and language modelling, however they suffer from gradient disappearance or explosion issues with large words. This research uses a deep learning RNN for movie review sentiment prediction that is quite comparable to Long Short-Term Memory networks. A LSTM model was well suited for modelling long sequential data. Generally, sentence vectorization approaches are used to overcome the inconsistency of sentence form. We made an attempt to look into the effect of hyper parameters like dropout of layers, activation functions and we also tested the model with different neural network settings and showed results that have been presented in the various ways to take the data into account. IMDB is the official movie database which serves as the basis for all of the experimental studies in the proposed model.

TI Human versus machine editing of electronic prescription directions
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION
AB Background: Pharmacy staff are responsible for editing poor-quality and difficult-to-read electronic prescription (e-prescription) directions. Machine translation (MT) models are capable of translating free text from 1 sequence into another. However, the quality of MTs of eprescriptions into pharmacy label directions is unknown. Objective: To determine the types and frequencies of e-prescription direction component errors made by an MT model, pharmacy staff, and prescribers. Methods: A prospective evaluation was conducted on a random sample of 300 patient directions in a test set of e-prescriptions from a mail-order pharmacy. Each row included directions produced by (1) prescribers on e-prescriptions, (2) pharmacy staff on prescription labels, and (3) an open neural MT model. Annotators labeled direction sets for missing direction components, use of abbreviations and medical jargon, and incorrect information (e.g., changing the number of tablets to be taken). The longest common subsequence (LCS) compared the amount of pharmacy staff editing with and without MT. Results: Out of 279 direction sets labeled, the MT model directions contained no quality issues in 196 (70.3%) samples compared with 187 (67.0%) and 83 (29.8%) samples for pharmacy staff directions and prescriber directions, respectively. The MT model directions contained more incorrect components (n 1/4 23). Median LCS was greater without MT (30.0 vs. 18.5, P < 0.01, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), indicating more editing was needed. Conclusion: MT could be used to improve the quality of e-prescription directions; however, MT makes high-risk mistakes such as incorrectly predicting the tapering regimen for prednisone. The use of semiautomated MT, where pharmacy staff can review model predictions to detect and resolve quality issues, should be considered to improve safety and decrease total work time compared with current practice. MT has strengths and weaknesses for improving the editing process of the patient directions compared with pharmacy staff alone.

TI CycleStyleGAN-Based Knowledge Transfer for a Machining Digital Twin
SO FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Digitalisation of manufacturing is a crucial component of the Industry 4.0 transformation. The digital twin is an important tool for enabling real-time digital access to precise information about physical systems and for supporting process optimisation via the translation of the associated big data into actionable insights. Although a variety of frameworks and conceptual models addressing the requirements and advantages of digital twins has been suggested in the academic literature, their implementation has received less attention. The work presented in this paper aims to make a proposition that considers the novel challenges introduced for data analysis in the presence of heterogeneous and dynamic cyber-physical systems in Industry 4.0. The proposed approach defines a digital twin simulation tool that captures the dynamics of a machining vibration signal from a source model and adapts them to a given target environment. This constitutes a flexible approach to knowledge extraction from the existing manufacturing simulation models, as information from both physics-based and data-driven solutions can be elicited this way. Therefore, an opportunity to reuse the costly established systems is made available to the manufacturing businesses, and the paper presents a process optimisation framework for such use case. The proposed approach is implemented as a domain adaptation algorithm based on the generative adversarial network model. The novel CycleStyleGAN architecture extends the CycleGAN model with a style-based signal encoding. The implemented model is validated in an experimental scenario that aims to replicate a real-world manufacturing knowledge transfer problem. The experiment shows that the transferred information enables the reduction of the required target domain data by one order of magnitude.

TI An integrated framework for finite-element modeling of mitral valve
   biomechanics from medical images: Application to MitralClip intervention
   planning
SO MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS
AB Treatment of mitral valve (MV) diseases requires comprehensive clinical evaluation and therapy personalization to optimize outcomes. Finite-element models (FEMs) of MV physiology have been proposed to study the biomechanical impact of MV repair, but their translation into the clinics remains challenging. As a step towards this goal, we present an integrated framework for finite-element modeling of the MV closure based on patient-specific anatomies and boundary conditions. Starting from temporal medical images, we estimate a comprehensive model of the MV apparatus dynamics, including papillary tips, using a machine-learning approach. A detailed model of the open MV at end-diastole is then computed, which is finally closed according to a FEM of MV biomechanics. The motion of the mitral annulus and papillary tips are constrained from the image data for increased accuracy. A sensitivity analysis of our system shows that chordae rest length and boundary conditions have a significant influence upon the simulation results. We quantitatively test the generalization of our framework on 25 consecutive patients. Comparisons between the simulated closed valve and ground truth show encouraging results (average point-to-mesh distance: 1.49 +/- 0.62 mm) but also the need for personalization of tissue properties, as illustrated in three patients. Finally, the predictive power of our model is tested on one patient who underwent MitralClip by comparing the simulated intervention with the real outcome in terms of MV closure, yielding promising prediction. By providing an integrated way to perform MV simulation, our framework may constitute a surrogate tool for model validation and therapy planning. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Soil Moisture Estimation Using Sentinel-1/-2 Imagery Coupled With
   CycleGAN for Time-Series Gap Filing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
AB Fast soil moisture content (SMC) mapping is necessary to support water resource management and to understand crop growth, quality, and yield. Therefore, earth observation (EO) plays a key role due to its ability of almost real-time monitoring of large areas at a low cost. This study aimed to explore the possibility of taking advantage of freely available Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) EO data for the simultaneous prediction of SMC with cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN) for time-series gap filling. The proposed methodology, first, learns latent low-dimensional representation of the satellite images, then learns a simple machine learning (ML) model on top of these representations. To evaluate the methodology, a series of vineyards, located in South Australia & x2019;s Eden valley are chosen. Specifically, we presented an efficient framework for extracting latent features from S1 and S2 imagery. We showed how one could use S1 to S2 feature translation based on CycleGAN using S1 and S2 time series when there are missing images acquired over an area of interest. The resulting data in our study is then used to fill gaps in time-series data. We used the resulting latent representations to predict SMC with various ML tools. In the experiments, CycleGAN and the autoencoders were trained with data randomly chosen around the site of interest, so we could augment the existing dataset. The best performance was demonstrated with random forest (RF) algorithm, whereas linear regression model demonstrated significant overfitting. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms the compared state-of-the-art methods if there are missing optical and synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images.

TI Identification of long non-coding transcripts with feature selection: a
   comparative study
SO BMC BIOINFORMATICS
AB Background: The unveiling of long non-coding RNAs as important gene regulators in many biological contexts has increased the demand for efficient and robust computational methods to identify novel long non-coding RNAs from transcripts assembled with high throughput RNA-seq data. Several classes of sequence-based features have been proposed to distinguish between coding and non-coding transcripts. Among them, open reading frame, conservation scores, nucleotide arrangements, and RNA secondary structure have been used with success in literature to recognize intergenic long non-coding RNAs, a particular subclass of non-coding RNAs.
   Results: In this paper we perform a systematic assessment of a wide collection of features extracted from sequence data. We use most of the features proposed in the literature, and we include, as a novel set of features, the occurrence of repeats contained in transposable elements. The aim is to detect signatures (groups of features) able to distinguish long non-coding transcripts from other classes, both protein-coding and non-coding. We evaluate different feature selection algorithms, test for signature stability, and evaluate the prediction ability of a signature with a machine learning algorithm. The study reveals different signatures in human, mouse, and zebrafish, highlighting that some features are shared among species, while others tend to be species-specific. Compared to coding potential tools and similar supervised approaches, including novel signatures, such as those identified here, in a machine learning algorithm improves the prediction performance, in terms of area under precision and recall curve, by 1 to 24%, depending on the species and on the signature.
   Conclusions: Understanding which features are best suited for the prediction of long non-coding RNAs allows for the development of more effective automatic annotation pipelines especially relevant for poorly annotated genomes, such as zebrafish. We provide a web tool that recognizes novel long non-coding RNAs with the obtained signatures from fasta and gtf formats.

AB Machine learning techniques have proven effective in ophthalmology. Clinicians use optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) retinal images for the diagnosis and monitoring of retinal conditions such as diabetic retinopathy. The optical microangiography (OMAG) algorithm used to construct OCTA images requires multiple structural OCT acquisitions per location. We created a system to extrapolate microvasculature from single acquisitions with the aim of lowering the resource costs to obtain improved functional imaging. This model can be used to enhance existing OCT datasets where one might not be able to easily acquire new OCTA images.
   We used a paired, unsupervised deep learning approach through implementation of a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) for inferring detailed retinal capillary flow maps from standard OCT images. Our cGAN architecture is based on the pix2pix image-to-image translation framework, which uses a modified U-Net for the generator and a PatchGAN for the discriminator. OCTA images generated by the OMAG algorithm applied to cross-sections captured in-vivo, non-invasively from sedated rats were used as the ground truth. A collection of 63 rat eye data sets (50 for training, 13 for testing), each with a sequence of 512 paired cross-sections, was provided for this project. Cross-sections were augmented with random jitter and rotations to provide the neural networks with a richer training set. The trained system generates en face blood flow maps of comparable quality to those generated from OMAG. Applying k-folds cross-validation (k=5), a mean Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of 0.723 was obtained for sum en face and 0.609 for max normalized en face. SSIM has a range from -1.0 to +1.0, inclusive, whereby +1.0 indicates two identical images. Additionally, we compared the cGAN model to a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network trained on the same data.

TI Towards a knowledge-based model for the computer aided design process
SO CONCURRENT ENGINEERING-RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
AB We propose in this paper a model for an elementary activity of the computer aided design (CAD) process, taking into account the specificity of the utilization of a computer: its capability to manipulate a relatively high volume of data and to explore alternatives quickly and systematically. The CAD activity is defined according to a given expertise domain (functionality, assembly, manufacturing, etc.) which is examined with respect to two inter-related subtasks: knowledge processing and data processing. Knowledge processing manipulates the knowledge model which represents an expert's point of view on the domain. Four things determine the knowledge model: a typology of combinable elements, a typology of possible relations between elements, an expert rule base for the creation of problem models (translation of problem data in elements and relations), and a set of criteria to evaluate the quality of solutions. Data processing manipulates the computational model which represents the computing point of view of the domain. We use the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) model as the computational model. The relationship between subtasks is clone according to the manner in which the knowledge model is translated in to the computational model.
   The proposed model of the CAD process allows an adaptive man-machine task sharing by allocating the user interaction to the knowledge model while the computer interacts with the computational model. An example from the assembly planning domain illustrates the model.
   Once the different CAD activities are determined, they can be combined to form a CAD process. The activities are coordinated by exchanging partial solutions (which can be done during knowledge processing and/or data processing), rules and evaluation criteria (during knowledge processing). Such kinds of CAD processes can also be used to define recursively the CAD activity of higher levels of abstraction.

TI Repurposing Approved Drugs as Inhibitors of K(v)7.1 and Na(v)1.8 to
   Treat Pitt Hopkins Syndrome
SO PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH
AB PurposePitt Hopkins Syndrome (PTHS) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations of a specific gene, transcription factor 4 (TCF4), located on chromosome 18. PTHS results in individuals that have moderate to severe intellectual disability, with most exhibiting psychomotor delay. PTHS also exhibits features of autistic spectrum disorders, which are characterized by the impaired ability to communicate and socialize. PTHS is comorbid with a higher prevalence of epileptic seizures which can be present from birth or which commonly develop in childhood. Attenuated or absent TCF4 expression results in increased translation of peripheral ion channels K(v)7.1 and Na(v)1.8 which triggers an increase in after-hyperpolarization and altered firing properties.MethodsWe now describe a high throughput screen (HTS) of 1280 approved drugs and machine learning models developed from this data. The ion channels were expressed in either CHO (K(V)7.1) or HEK293 (Na(v)1.8) cells and the HTS used either Rb-86(+) efflux (K(V)7.1) or a FLIPR assay (Na(v)1.8).ResultsThe HTS delivered 55 inhibitors of K(v)7.1 (4.2% hit rate) and 93 inhibitors of Na(v)1.8 (7.2% hit rate) at a screening concentration of 10 mu M. These datasets also enabled us to generate and validate Bayesian machine learning models for these ion channels. We also describe a structure activity relationship for several dihydropyridine compounds as inhibitors of Na(v)1.8.ConclusionsThis work could lead to the potential repurposing of nicardipine or other dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists as potential treatments for PTHS acting via Na(v)1.8, as there are currently no approved treatments for this rare disorder.

TI Acceleration of Deep Neural Network Training with Resistive Cross-Point
   Devices: Design Considerations
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
AB In recent years, deep neural networks (DNN) have demonstrated significant business impact in large scale analysis and classification tasks such as speech recognition, visual object detection, pattern extraction, etc. Training of large DNNs, however, is universally considered as time consuming and computationally intensive task that demands datacenter-scale computational resources recruited for many days. Here we propose a concept of resistive processing unit (RPU) devices that can potentially accelerate DNN training by orders of magnitude while using much less power. The proposed RPU device can store and update the weight values locally thus minimizing data movement during training and allowing to fully exploit the locality and the parallelism of the training algorithm. We evaluate the effect of various RPU device features/non-idealities and system parameters on performance in order to derive the device and system level specifications for implementation of an accelerator chip for DNN training in a realistic CMOS-compatible technology. For large DNNs with about 1 billion weights this massively parallel RPU architecture can achieve acceleration factors of 30, 000x compared to state-of-the-art microprocessors while providing power efficiency of 84, 000 GigaOps/s/W. Problems that currently require days of training on a datacenter-size cluster with thousands of machines can be addressed within hours on a single RPU accelerator. A system consisting of a cluster of RPU accelerators will be able to tackle Big Data problems with trillions of parameters that is impossible to address today like, for example, natural speech recognition and translation between all world languages, real-time analytics on large streams of business and scientific data, integration, and analysis of multimodal sensory data flows from a massive number of IoT (Internet of Things) sensors.

TI Morphological Skip-Gram: Replacing FastText characters n-gram with
   morphological knowledge
SO INTELIGENCIA ARTIFICIAL-IBEROAMERICAL JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Natural language processing systems have attracted much interest of the industry. This branch of study is composed of some applications such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, question and answer, and others. Word embeddings (i.e., continuous word representations) are an essential module for those applications generally used as word representation to machine learning models. Some popular methods to train word embeddings are GloVe and Word2Vec. They achieve good word representations, despite limitations: both ignore morphological information of the words and consider only one representation vector for each word. This approach implies the word embeddings does not consider different word contexts properly and are unaware of its inner structure. To mitigate this problem, the other word embeddings method FastText represents each word as a bag of characters n-grams. Hence, a continuous vector describes each n-gram, and the final word representation is the sum of its characters n-grams vectors. Nevertheless, the use of all n-grams character of a word is a poor approach since some n-grams have no semantic relation with their words and increase the amount of potentially useless information. This approach also increase the training phase time. In this work, we propose a new method for training word embeddings, and its goal is to replace the FastText bag of character n-grams for a bag of word morphemes through the morphological analysis of the word. Thus, words with similar context and morphemes are represented by vectors close to each other. To evaluate our new approach, we performed intrinsic evaluations considering 15 different tasks, and the results show a competitive performance compared to FastText. Moreover, the proposed model is 40% faster than FastText in the training phase. We also outperform the baseline approaches in extrinsic evaluations through Hate speech detection and NER tasks using different scenarios.

TI Nondestructive Detection of Targeted Microbubbles Using Dual-Mode Data
   and Deep Learning for Real-Time Ultrasound Molecular Imaging
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING
AB Ultrasound molecular imaging (UMI) is enabled by targeted microbubbles (MBs), which are highly reflective ultrasound contrast agents that bind to specific biomarkers. Distinguishing between adherent MBs and background signals can be challenging in vivo. The preferred preclinical technique is differential targeted enhancement (DTE), wherein a strong acoustic pulse is used to destroy MBs to verify their locations. However, DTE intrinsically cannot be used for real-time imaging and may cause undesirable bioeffects. In this work, we propose a simple 4-layer convolutional neural network to nondestructively detect adherent MB signatures. We investigated several types of input data to the network: "anatomy-mode" (fundamental frequency), "contrast-mode" (pulse-inversion harmonic frequency), or both, i.e., "dual-mode", using IQ channel signals, the channel sum, or the channel sum magnitude. Training and evaluation were performed on in vivo mouse tumor data and microvessel phantoms. The dual-mode channel signals yielded optimal performance, achieving a soft Dice coefficient of 0.45 and AUC of 0.91 in two test images. In a volumetric acquisition, the network best detected a breast cancer tumor, resulting in a generalized contrast-to-noise ratio (GCNR) of 0.93 and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic (KSS) of 0.86, outperforming both regular contrast mode imaging (GCNR = 0.76, KSS = 0.53) and DTE imaging (GCNR = 0.81, KSS = 0.62). Further development of the methodology is necessary to distinguish free from adherent MBs. These results demonstrate that neural networks can be trained to detect targeted MBs with DTE-like quality using nondestructive dual-mode data, and can be used to facilitate the safe and real-time translation of UMI to clinical applications.

TI Blood Transcriptomic Comparison of Individuals With and Without Autism
   Spectrum Disorder: A Combined-Samples Mega-Analysis
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART B-NEUROPSYCHIATRIC GENETICS
AB Blood-based microarray studies comparing individuals affected with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typically developing individuals help characterize differences in circulating immune cell functions and offer potential biomarker signal. We sought to combine the subject-level data from previously published studies by mega-analysis to increase the statistical power. We identified studies that compared ex vivo blood or lymphocytes from ASD-affected individuals and unrelated comparison subjects using Affymetrix or Illumina array platforms. Raw microarray data and clinical meta-data were obtained from seven studies, totaling 626 affected and 447 comparison subjects. Microarray data were processed using uniform methods. Covariate-controlled mixed-effect linear models were used to identify gene transcripts and co-expression network modules that were significantly associated with diagnostic status. Permutation-based gene-set analysis was used to identify functionally related sets of genes that were over-and under-expressed among ASD samples. Our results were consistent with diminished interferon-, EGF-, PDGF-, PI3K-AKT-mTOR-, and RAS-MAPK-signaling cascades, and increased ribosomal translation and NK-cell related activity in ASD. We explored evidence for sex-differences in the ASD-related transcriptomic signature. We also demonstrated that machine-learning classifiers using blood transcriptome data perform with moderate accuracy when data are combined across studies. Comparing our results with those from blood-based studies of protein biomarkers (e.g., cytokines and trophic factors), we propose that ASD may feature decoupling between certain circulating signaling proteins (higher in ASD samples) and the transcriptional cascades which they typically elicit within circulating immune cells (lower in ASD samples). These findings provide insight into ASD-related transcriptional differences in circulating immune cells. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Conditional Generative Adversarial Network Approach for Autism
   Prediction
SO COMPUTER SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) requires a precise diagnosis in order to be managed and rehabilitated. Non-invasive neuroimaging methods are disease markers that can be used to help diagnose ASD. The majority of available techniques in the literature use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to detect ASD with a small dataset, resulting in high accuracy but low generality. Traditional supervised machine learning classification algorithms such as support vector machines function well with unstructured and semi structured data such as text, images, and videos, but their performance and robustness are restricted by the size of the accompanying training data. Deep learning on the other hand creates an artificial neural network that can learn and make intelligent judgments on its own by layering algorithms. It takes use of plentiful low-cost computing and many approaches are focused with very big datasets that are concerned with creating far larger and more sophisticated neural networks. Generative modelling, also known as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), is an unsupervised deep learning task that entails automatically discovering and learning regularities or patterns in input data in order for the model to generate or output new examples that could have been drawn from the original dataset. GANs are an exciting and rapidly changing field that delivers on the promise of generative models in terms of their ability to generate realistic examples across a range of problem domains, most notably in image-to-image translation tasks and hasn't been explored much for Autism spectrum disorder prediction in the past. In this paper, we present a novel conditional generative adversarial network, or cGAN for short, which is a form of GAN that uses a generator model to conditionally generate images. In terms of prediction and accuracy, they outperform the standard GAN. The proposed model is 74% more accurate than the traditional methods and takes only around 10 min for training even with a huge dataset.

AB Smartphones have started to be used as self reporting tools for mental health state as they accompany individuals during their days and can therefore gather temporally. ne grained data. However, the analysis of self reported mood data offers challenges related to non-homogeneity of mood assessment among individuals due to the complexity of the feeling and the reporting scales, as well as the noise and sparseness of the reports when collected in the wild. In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end ML model inspired by video frame prediction and machine translation, that forecasts future sequences of mood from previous self-reported moods collected in the real world using mobile devices. Contrary to traditional time series forecasting algorithms, our multi-task encoder-decoder recurrent neural network learns patterns from different users, allowing and improving the prediction for users with limited number of self-reports. Unlike traditional feature-based machine learning algorithms, the encoder-decoder architecture enables to forecast a sequence of future moods rather than one single step. Meanwhile, multi-task learning exploits some unique characteristics of the data (mood is bi-dimensional), achieving better results than when training single-task networks or other classifiers.
   Our experiments using a real-world dataset of 33, 000 user-weeks revealed that (i) 3 weeks of sparsely reported mood is the optimal number to accurately forecast mood, (ii) multi-task learning models both dimensions of mood - valence and arousal-with higher accuracy than separate or traditional ML models, and (iii) mood variability, personality traits and day of the week play a key role in the performance of our model. We believe this work provides psychologists and developers of future mobile mental health applications with a ready-to-use and effective tool for early diagnosis of mental health issues at scale.

AB This paper examines the problem of broadband vibration control of nonrigid systems employing periodic structures with tunable parameters. It investigates this by using a semi-two-dimensional model that applies a dual-beam periodic structure with transverse branches as a parameter-tunable isolator. Conventional study of vibration control problems, including the problem of vibration control by periodic structures, usually reduces systems to equivalent single- or multi-mount models with only a unidirectional translation at a mounting point. This assumption of decoupling leads to the erroneous prediction of vibratory power transmission when designing an isolator for a nonrigid system. Such a periodic structure involves the coupling of vibrations between different mounting points and different directions of motion and is therefore a reasonable simulation of the real-life problem. However, its application as a periodic isolator has not been proposed previously. The configuration of shape memory alloy (SMA) branches and non-SMA dual beams is proposed in order that this structure can effectively exploit the advantages of SMA materials, namely their significantly varying Young's moduli which can be tuned to adjust and widen the stop bands, and can prevent the associated limitation of hysteresis. Equations are derived governing the vibration transmitted through any number of periodic mounts between nonrigid machines and foundations. Based on the derived results, two methodologies are developed to determine the proper Young's moduli of the SMA branches and minimize the transmitted power. The numerical results demonstrate that the adaptive SMA branches at the proper temperatures are able to attenuate broadband vibration by adjusting the locations and broadening the widths of stop bands. With the application of a semi-two-dimensional periodic structure to broadband vibration isolation, this paper provides an approach and supporting methodologies for broadband vibration control using periodic structures.

TI Experimental evaluation of the impact of physical beam misalignment on
   the performance of an underwater wireless optical communication network
   utilizing machine learning
SO OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Underwater wireless optical communication systems have garnered significant interest due to advantages in speed and security over radio-frequency and acoustic underwater transmission. One example utilizes Laguerre- Gaussian beams carrying orbital angular momentum to increase bit transfer rate by spatially multiplexing information into an alphabet of symbols, sized 2N, where N is the number of bits encoded in each symbol. This system uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to demultiplex the information, which has been shown to be capable of high levels of accuracy even in turbid environments or in the presence of significant optical turbulence. However, it has been observed that CNNs struggle when shown images affected by physical environmental effects (different levels of turbulence, optical magnification, beam misalignment) that were not present in the training set. In this paper we further investigate physical beam misalignment under two experimental conditions, quiescent and strong optical turbulence. Physical beam misalignment is defined as a translation of the beam at the receiver. Our optically turbulent environment is characterized using the scintillation of a Gaussian beam, and is estimated to have a refractive index structure constant value of similar to 10-11 m-2/3. We use two alphabet sizes, of 16 and 256 symbols, and demonstrate classification of received images in a combination of scenarios with adequate success (>90% accuracy) when training and testing under the same conditions, and using a pre-trained CNN, AlexNet. However, when training and testing under physically misaligned conditions, we demonstrate an issue with impractical rates of classification, at 5%-50%. Our investigation provides CNN classification at significantly higher levels of complexity than previously seen, both in terms of experimental turbulence strength and number of classifiable symbols (alphabet size), and clearly demonstrates the importance of carefully designed experiments to aid the machine learning training process for communication systems.

SO RADIOTHERAPY AND ONCOLOGY
AB Purpose: Providing the confidence level (Uncertainty) of prediction results and guiding patient-specific quality assurance (pQA) can enhance the safety of AI (Artificial intelligence)-based automatic pQA models. However, even state-of-the-art automatic pQA models can only predict the gamma passing rate (GPR) and cannot quantify the prediction uncertainty, limiting the safe clinical translation of these models. This study aims to develop an uncertainty-guided man-machine integrated pQA (UgMi-pQA) method to address this issue. Methods: An uncertainty-aware dual-task deep learning (UDDL) model, combined with an interwoven training method and Monte Carlo dropout approximation Bayesian inference, to enable simultaneous output of the predicted GPR and corresponding total prediction uncertainty to guide pQA. 1541 pairs of field fluences and GPRs collected from 165 glioma, 50 lung (conventional fractionation), and 20 liver cases were separated for the UDDL model training, validation, calibration, and test in a ratio of 7:1:1:1, respectively. Furthermore, 413 pairs of fluences and GPRs collected from 12 breast, 10 cervix, 9 esophagus, 8 tongue, and 12 lung SBRT cases were gathered for the out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. Results: Clinical accuracy of 100.0% was reached with only 61.7% of the workload. Samples with substantial prediction errors and failed samples with low label GPR (<95%) could be successfully screened out. The capability ranges of two different models were both successfully identified with the prediction uncertainty significantly larger for OOD samples than for in-distribution samples (p < 0.01). Conclusion: This study presents the first work on uncertainty quantification for deep learning automatic pQA tasks. The UgMi-pQA method can balance the efficiency and safety of the automatic pQA models and promote their clinical application. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A Comprehensive Review on 3D Object Detection and 6D Pose Estimation
   With Deep Learning
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Nowadays, computer vision with 3D (dimension) object detection and 6D (degree of freedom) pose assumptions are widely discussed and studied in the field. In the 3D object detection process, classifications are centered on the object's size, position, and direction. And in 6D pose assumptions, networks emphasize 3D translation and rotation vectors. Successful application of these strategies can have a huge impact on various machine learning-based applications, including the autonomous vehicles, the robotics industry, and the augmented reality sector. Although extensive work has been done on 3D object detection with a pose assumption from RGB images, the challenges have not been fully resolved. Our analysis provides a comprehensive review of the proposed contemporary techniques for complete 3D object detection and the recovery of 6D pose assumptions of an object. In this review research paper, we have discussed several proposed sophisticated methods in 3D object detection and 6D pose estimation, including some popular data sets, evaluation matrix, and proposed method challenges. Most importantly, this study makes an effort to offer some possible future directions in 3D object detection and 6D pose estimation. We accept the autonomous vehicle as the sample case for this detailed review. Finally, this review provides a complete overview of the latest in-depth learning-based research studies related to 3D object detection and 6D pose estimation systems and points out a comparison between some popular frameworks. To be more concise, we propose a detailed summary of the state-of-the-art techniques of modern deep learning-based object detection and pose estimation models.

TI New risk model is able to identify patients with a low risk of
   progression in systemic sclerosis
SO RMD OPEN
AB Objectives To develop a prediction model to guide annual assessment of systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients tailored in accordance to disease activity. Methods A machine learning approach was used to develop a model that can identify patients without disease progression. SSc patients included in the prospective Leiden SSc cohort and fulfilling the ACR/EULAR 2013 criteria were included. Disease progression was defined as progression in >= 1 organ system, and/or start of immunosuppression or death. Using elastic-net-regularisation, and including 90 independent clinical variables (100% complete), we trained the model on 75% and validated it on 25% of the patients, optimising on negative predictive value (NPV) to minimise the likelihood of missing progression. Probability cutoffs were identified for low and high risk for disease progression by expert assessment. Results Of the 492 SSc patients (follow-up range: 2-10 years), disease progression during follow-up was observed in 52% (median time 4.9 years). Performance of the model in the test set showed an AUC-ROC of 0.66. Probability score cutoffs were defined: low risk for disease progression (<0.197, NPV:1.0; 29% of patients), intermediate risk (0.197-0.223, NPV:0.82; 27%) and high risk (>0.223, NPV:0.78; 44%). The relevant variables for the model were: previous use of cyclophosphamide or corticosteroids, start with immunosuppressive drugs, previous gastrointestinal progression, previous cardiovascular event, pulmonary arterial hypertension, modified Rodnan Skin Score, creatine kinase and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide. Conclusion Our machine-learning-assisted model for progression enabled us to classify 29% of SSc patients as 'low risk'. In this group, annual assessment programmes could be less extensive than indicated by international guidelines.

CY SEP 10-12, 2008
CL Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC
AB Identifying the correct sense of a word in context is crucial for many tasks in natural language processing (machine translation is an example). State-of-the art methods for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) build models using hand-crafted features that usually capturing shallow linguistic information. Complex background knowledge, such as semantic relationships, are typically either not used, or used in specialised manner, due to the limitations of the feature-based modelling techniques used. On the other hand, empirical results from the use of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) systems have repeatedly shown that they can use diverse sources of background knowledge when constructing models. In this paper, we investigate whether this ability of ILP systems could be used to improve the predictive accuracy of models for WSD. Specifically, we examine the use of a general-purpose ILP system as a method to construct a set of features using semantic, syntactic and lexical information. This feature-set is then used by a common modelling technique in the field (a support vector machine) to construct a classifier for predicting the sense of a word. In our investigation we examine one-shot and incremental approaches to feature-set construction applied to monolingual and bilingual WSD tasks. The monolingual tasks use 32 verbs and 85 verbs and nouns (in English) from the SENSEVAL-3 and SemEval-2007 benchmarks; while the bilingual WSD task consists of 7 highly ambiguous verbs in translating from English to Portuguese. The results are encouraging: the ILP-assisted models show substantial improvements over those that simply use shallow features. In addition, incremental feature-set construction appears to identify smaller and better sets of features. Taken together, the results suggest that the use of ILP with diverse sources of background knowledge provide a way for making substantial progress in the field of WSD.

TI Factors influencing classification of frequency following responses to
   speech and music stimuli
SO HEARING RESEARCH
AB Successful mapping of meaningful labels to sound input requires accurate representation of that sound's acoustic variances in time and spectrum. For some individuals, such as children or those with hearing loss, having an objective measure of the integrity of this representation could be useful. Classification is a promising machine learning approach which can be used to objectively predict a stimulus label from the brain response. This approach has been previously used with auditory evoked potentials (AEP) such as the frequency following response (FFR), but a number of key issues remain unresolved before classification can be translated into clinical practice. Specifically, past efforts at FFR classification have used data from a given subject for both training and testing the classifier. It is also unclear which components of the FFR elicit optimal classification accuracy. To address these issues, we recorded FFRs from 13 adults with normal hearing in response to speech and music stimuli. We compared labeling accuracy of two cross-validation classification approaches using FFR data: (1) a more traditional method combining subject data in both the training and testing set, and (2) a "leave-one-out" approach, in which subject data is classified based on a model built exclusively from the data of other individuals. We also examined classification accuracy on decomposed and time-segmented FFRs. Our results indicate that the accuracy of leave-one-subject-out cross validation approaches that obtained in the more conventional cross-validation classifications while allowing a subject's results to be analysed with respect to normative data pooled from a separate population. In addition, we demonstrate that classification accuracy is highest when the entire FFR is used to train the classifier. Taken together, these efforts contribute key steps toward translation of classification-based machine learning approaches into clinical practice. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Thesis deals with the development of corpus tools which allow building corpus of religious and historical texts. It is foreseen that the corpus has the features of data ingestion, text data preprocessing, statistics calculation, qualitative and quantitative text analysis. All these features are customizable. With Big Data approach is meant that corpus tools are treated as the data platform and the corpus itself is treated as a combination of data lake and data warehouse solutions. There have been suggested the ways for resolving algorithmic, methodological and architectural problems which arise while building corpus tool. The effectiveness of natural language processing and natural language understanding methods, libraries and tools on the example of building historical and religious texts' corpora have been checked. There have been created the workflows which comprise data extraction from sources, data transformation, data enrichment and loading into corpus storage with proper qualitative and quantitative characteristics. Data extraction approaches which are common for ingestion into data lake were used. Transformations and enrichments were realized by means of natural language processing and natural language understanding techniques. Calculation of statistical characteristics was done by means of machine learning techniques. Finding keywords and relations between them became possible thanks to the employment of latent semantic analysis, terms and N-gram frequencies, term frequency-inverse document frequencies. Computation complexity and number of information noise were reduced by singular value decomposition. The influence of singular value decomposition parameters on the text processing accuracy has been analyzed. The results of corpus-based computational experiment for religious text concept analysis have been shown. The architectural approaches to building corpus-based data platform and the usage of software tools, frameworks and specific libraries have been suggested.

TI Cross-lingual training of summarization systems using annotated corpora
   in a foreign language
SO INFORMATION RETRIEVAL
AB The increasing trend of cross-border globalization and acculturation requires text summarization techniques to work equally well for multiple languages. However, only some of the automated summarization methods can be defined as "language-independent," i.e., not based on any language-specific knowledge. Such methods can be used for multilingual summarization, defined in Mani (Automatic summarization. Natural language processing. John Benjamins Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 2001) as "processing several languages, with a summary in the same language as input", but, their performance is usually unsatisfactory due to the exclusion of language-specific knowledge. Moreover, supervised machine learning approaches need training corpora in multiple languages that are usually unavailable for rare languages, and their creation is a very expensive and labor-intensive process. In this article, we describe cross-lingual methods for training an extractive single-document text summarizer called MUSE (MUltilingual Sentence Extractor)-a supervised approach, based on the linear optimization of a rich set of sentence ranking measures using a Genetic Algorithm. We evaluated MUSE's performance on documents in three different languages: English, Hebrew, and Arabic using several training scenarios. The summarization quality was measured using ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 Recall metrics. The results of the extensive comparative analysis showed that the performance of MUSE was better than that of the best known multilingual approach (TextRank) in all three languages. Moreover, our experimental results suggest that using the same sentence ranking model across languages results in a reasonable summarization quality, while saving considerable annotation efforts for the end-user. On the other hand, using parallel corpora generated by machine translation tools may improve the performance of a MUSE model trained on a foreign language. Comparative evaluation of an alternative optimization technique-Multiple Linear Regression-justifies the use of a Genetic Algorithm.

TI Modular Label-Free Electrochemical Biosensor Loading Nature-Inspired
   Peptide toward the Widespread Use of COVID-19 Antibody Tests
SO ACS NANO
AB Limitations of the recognition elements in terms of synthesis, cost, availability, and stability have impaired the translation of biosensors into practical use. Inspired by nature to mimic the molecular recognition of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein antibody (AbS) by the S protein binding site, we synthesized the peptide sequence of Asn-Asn-Ala-Thr-Asn-COOH (abbreviated as PEP2003) to create COVID-19 screen-ing label-free (LF) biosensors based on a carbon electrode, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and electrochemical impedance spec-troscopy. The PEP2003 is easily obtained by chemical synthesis, and it can be adsorbed on electrodes while maintaining its ability for AbS recognition, further leading to a sensitivity 3.4-fold higher than the full-length S protein, which is in agreement with the increase in the target-to-receptor size ratio. Peptide-loaded LF devices based on noncovalent immobilization were developed by affording fast and simple analyses, along with a modular functionalization. From studies by molecular docking, the peptide-AbS binding was found to be driven by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Moreover, the peptide is not amenable to denaturation, thus addressing the trade-off between scalability, cost, and robustness. The biosensor preserves 95.1% of the initial signal for 20 days when stored dry at 4 degrees C. With the aid of two simple equations fitted by machine learning (ML), the method was able to make the COVID-19 screening of 39 biological samples into healthy and infected groups with 100.0% accuracy. By taking advantage of peptide-related merits combined with advances in surface chemistry and ML-aided accuracy, this platform is promising to bring COVID-19 biosensors into mainstream use toward straightforward, fast, and accurate analyses at the point of care, with social and economic impacts being achieved.

TI Screening Lung Diseases Using Cascaded Feature Generation and Selection
   Strategies
SO HEALTHCARE
AB The global pandemic COVID-19 is still a cause of a health emergency in several parts of the world. Apart from standard testing techniques to identify positive cases, auxiliary tools based on artificial intelligence can help with the identification and containment of the disease. The need for the development of alternative smart diagnostic tools to combat the COVID-19 pandemic has become more urgent. In this study, a smart auxiliary framework based on machine learning (ML) is proposed; it can help medical practitioners in the identification of COVID-19-affected patients, among others with pneumonia and healthy individuals, and can help in monitoring the status of COVID-19 cases using X-ray images. We investigated the application of transfer-learning (TL) networks and various feature-selection techniques for improving the classification accuracy of ML classifiers. Three different TL networks were tested to generate relevant features from images; these TL networks include AlexNet, ResNet101, and SqueezeNet. The generated relevant features were further refined by applying feature-selection methods that include iterative neighborhood component analysis (iNCA), iterative chi-square (iChi2), and iterative maximum relevance-minimum redundancy (iMRMR). Finally, classification was performed using convolutional neural network (CNN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Moreover, the study exploited stationary wavelet (SW) transform to handle the overfitting problem by decomposing each image in the training set up to three levels. Furthermore, it enhanced the dataset, using various operations as data-augmentation techniques, including random rotation, translation, and shear operations. The analysis revealed that the combination of AlexNet, ResNet101, SqueezeNet, iChi2, and SVM was very effective in the classification of X-ray images, producing a classification accuracy of 99.2%. Similarly, AlexNet, ResNet101, and SqueezeNet, along with iChi2 and the proposed CNN network, yielded 99.0% accuracy. The results showed that the cascaded feature generator and selection strategies significantly affected the performance accuracy of the classifier.

TI Predicting gastrointestinal drug effects using contextualized metabolic
   models
SO PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
AB Gastrointestinal side effects are among the most common classes of adverse reactions associated with orally absorbed drugs. These effects decrease patient compliance with the treatment and induce undesirable physiological effects. The prediction of drug action on the gut wall based on in vitro data solely can improve the safety of marketed drugs and first-in-human trials of new chemical entities. We used publicly available data of drug-induced gene expression changes to build drug-specific small intestine epithelial cell metabolic models. The combination of measured in vitro gene expression and in silico predicted metabolic rates in the gut wall was used as features for a multilabel support vector machine to predict the occurrence of side effects. We showed that combining local gut wall-specific metabolism with gene expression performs better than gene expression alone, which indicates the role of small intestine metabolism in the development of adverse reactions. Furthermore, we reclassified FDA-labeled drugs with respect to their genetic and metabolic profiles to show hidden similarities between seemingly different drugs. The linkage of xenobiotics to their transcriptomic and metabolic profiles could take pharmacology far beyond the usual indication-based classifications.
   Author summary The gut wall is the first barrier that encounters orally absorbed drugs, and it substantially modulates the bioavailability of drugs and supports several classes of side effects. We developed context-specific metabolic models of the enterocyte constrained by drug-induced gene expression and trained a machine learning classifier using metabolic reaction rates as features to predict the occurrence of side effects. Additionally, we clustered the compounds based on their metabolic and transcriptomic features to find similarities between their physiological effects. Our work provides a better understanding of the compound physiological effects solely using in vitro data, which can further improve the translation of new chemical entities to clinical trials.

TI Prediction of Protein Ubiquitination Sites in Arabidopsis thaliana
SO CURRENT BIOINFORMATICS
AB Background: As one of the most important reversible protein post-translation modification types, ubiquitination plays a significant role in the regulation of many biological processes, such as cell division, signal transduction, apoptosis and immune response. Protein ubiquitination usually occurs when ubiquitin molecule is attached to a lysine on a target protein, which is also known as "lysine ubiquitination".
   Objective: In order to investigate the molecular mechanisms of ubiquitination-related biological processes, the crucial first step is the identification of ubiquitination sites. However, conventional experimental methods in detecting ubiquitination sites are often time-consuming and a large number of ubiquitination sites remain unidentified. In this study, a ubiquitination site prediction method for Arabidopsis thaliana was developed using a Support Vector Machine (SVM).
   Methods: We collected 3009 experimentally validated ubiquitination sites on 1607 proteins in A. thaliana to construct the training set. Three feature encoding schemes were used to characterize the sequence patterns around ubiquitination sites, including AAC, Binary and CKSAAP. The maximum Relevance and Minimum Redundancy (mRMR) feature selection method was employed to reduce the dimensionality of input features. Five-fold cross-validation and independent tests were used to evaluate the performance of the established models.
   Results: As a result, the combination of AAC and CKSAAP encoding schemes yielded the best performance with the accuracy and AUC of 81.35% and 0.868 in the independent test. We also generated an online predictor termed as AraUbiSite, which is freely accessible at: http://systbio.cau.edu.en/araubisite.
   Conclusion: We developed a well-performed prediction tool for large-scale ubiquitination site identification in A. thaliana. It is hoped that the current work will speed up the process of identification of ubiquitination sites in A. thaliana and help to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms of ubiquitination in plants.

AB High voltage rotating machines are supposed to be optimized not only in terms of performance but -among others also with respect to space and material utilization. When designing machines there has been considerable effort made to reduce the overall size of generators particularly in the axial direction. The winding is one of the more demanding parts of the generator but the end winding is an obvious place where axial space could be saved. For an optimized design, the distance between adjacent insulated bars or coils is a very important factor. Inadequate end winding spacing can lead to corona activity between adjacent coils or bars. Exact prediction of the needed space is difficult as prediction is dependent upon several contributing factors. Dielectric properties of the insulation material, location of the bracing system, imperfection of insulation surface as well as of the corona inception and extinction voltage in the air gap between insulated electrodes are important factors to understand for an optimized end winding design.
   In this paper the results of experimental investigations on air for various electrode configurations are presented. Metallic electrodes were covered with standard insulation material which is used in generators. The corona inception and extinction voltages as well as the partial discharge rate and the amplitude were measured for different electrode configurations. Additionally, the corona discharges were monitored with a special UV camera. The distance and the pressure of the air were varied in a wide range.
   The main purpose of this study was to optimize and simplify the spacing requirements of the end winding design. Therefore the corona inception and extinction voltage in the air gap between insulated electrodes as a function of distance and pressure was measured. Subsequent to that, the translation between the classical Paschen's Law for breakdown and the corona inception and extinction voltage in the air gap between insulated electrodes was investigated.

TI Organic bioelectronics for electronic-to-chemical translation in
   modulation of neuronal signaling and machine-to-brain interfacing
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENERAL SUBJECTS
AB Background: A major challenge when creating interfaces for the nervous system is to translate between the signal carriers of the nervous system (ions and neurotransmitters) and those of conventional electronics (electrons).
   Scope of review: Organic conjugated polymers represent a unique class of materials that utilizes both electrons and ions as charge carriers. Based on these materials, we have established a series of novel communication interfaces between electronic components and biological systems. The organic electronic ion pump (OEIP) presented in this review is made of the polymer-polyelectrolyte system poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). The OEIP translates electronic signals into electrophoretic migration of ions and neurotransmitters. Major conclusions: We demonstrate how spatio-temporally controlled delivery of ions and neurotransmitters can be used to modulate intracellular Ca2+ signaling in neuronal cells in the absence of convective disturbances. The electronic control of delivery enables strict control of dynamic parameters, such as amplitude and frequency of Ca2+ responses, and can be used to generate temporal patterns mimicking naturally occurring Ca2+ oscillations. To enable further control of the ionic signals we developed the electrophoretic chemical transistor, an analog of the traditional transistor used to amplify and/or switch electronic signals. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the OEIP in a new "machine-to-brain" interface by modulating brainstem responses in vivo.
   General significance: This review highlights the potential of communication interfaces based on conjugated polymers in generating complex, high-resolution, signal patterns to control cell physiology. We foresee widespread applications for these devices in biomedical research and in future medical devices within multiple therapeutic areas.

TI CNN-PFVS: Integrating Neural Network and Finite Volume Models to
   Accelerate Flow Simulation on Pore Space Images
SO TRANSPORT IN POROUS MEDIA
AB Direct numerical simulations of flow on micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) images are extensively used in many disciplines of science and engineering. Recently, we have developed a pore-scale finite volume solver (PFVS) to directly solve for flow on micro-CT images and predict permeability of digital cores. The solver assigns a local conductivity to each voxel based on geometrical and topological constraints. The local conductivity term in PFVS is conventionally calculated by an iterative local scanning algorithm, where the number of iterations depends on the size of the largest flow channel. This can increase the computation time of PFVS significantly if the largest flow channel is reasonably large. In this paper, we apply convolutional neural networks (CNN) to predict local conductivity for each voxel, thus bypassing the iterative algorithm while also preserving the mass conservation in the system by still solving for flow using conventional methods. The network is trained to convert segmented binary images of rocks into a numerical map required for flow simulation by the use of paired image-to-image translation using a ResNet-Style architecture. Comparison of the generated and original coefficient maps shows that the average error is within 1% over the 3D pore geometries used in this study. Then, we compare the absolute permeability results obtained from the original PFVS and the CNN-PFVS and the errors are within 20% with the average of 13.8%. Machine learning improves the computation time significantly especially on the images with large domain size and flow channels. On the samples tested, the speedup factor is 10 times using CNN compared to iterative calculations.

AB Often Abbe errors are the most important uncertainty sources in dimensional metrology applications aiming for measurement uncertainties of only a few nanometres. Abbe errors are caused by the angle deviations of relative translations between measurement object and sensing device-either in moving object or moving sensing device configuration-and the offset between the measurement axes of the machine and the measurement point of the structure localization device or the displacement sensor under investigation. The angle deviations of the motion stage can usually be determined, e. g. by an electronic autocollimator with sufficient accuracy. Unfortunately, in many cases, the Abbe offset cannot be estimated with sufficient accuracy or varies over the measurement range. In order to reduce the influence of the Abbe error many length measuring machines are equipped with control loops to reduce the angle deviations. However, in order to specify the uncertainty contribution of the residual Abbe errors, the Abbe offsets are still required. In these cases, in principle, an in situ determination of the Abbe errors is possible by the following method. First the measurement is conducted in the common way. Then two further measurements are performed during which one angle, consecutively the yaw and the pitch angle, is scanned by the angle actuators and measured by the angle sensors of the control loop. The differences of these two measurements from the first should reflect the influence of the Abbe errors and the dependence of the length measurement results on the angles can be determined. This predication was tested during the measurements of a high resolution encoder with the Nanometer Comparator. Contrary to the classical perception, the observed dependence of the Abbe error on the angle variation applied was nonlinear. However, using a polynomial of third order it is possible to correct the artificially introduced Abbe errors of up to 20 nm almost down to the noise level.

TI Evaluation of stromal cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment
   enable prediction of treatment sensitivity and prognosis in colon cancer
SO COMPUTATIONAL AND STRUCTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Current clinical factors for screening candidates that might benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in colon cancer are inadequate. Tumor microenvironment, especially the stromal components, has the potential to determine treatment response. However, clinical translation of the tumor-associated stromal characterization into a practical biomarker for helping treatment decision has not been established. Using machine learning, we established a novel 31-gene signature, called stromal cell infiltration intensity score (SIIS), to distinguish patients characterized by the enrichment of abundant stromal cells in five colon cancer datasets from GEO (N = 990). Patients with high-SIIS were at higher risk for recurrence and mortality, and could not benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy due to their intrinsic drug resistance; however, the opposite was reported for patients with low-SIIS. The role of SIIS in detection of patients with high stromal cell infiltration and reduced drug efficiency was consistently validated in the TCGA-COAD cohort (N = 382), Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center cohort (N = 30), and could also be observed in TCGA pan-cancer settings (N = 4898) and four independent immunotherapy cohorts (N = 467). Based on multi-omics data analysis and the CRISPR library screen, we reported that lack of gene mutation, hypomethylation in ADCY4 promoter region, activation of WNT-PCP pathway and SIAH2-GPX3 axis were potential mechanisms responsible for the chemoresistance of patients within high-SIIS group. Our findings demonstrated that SIIS provide an important reference for those making treatment decisions for such special patients.

TI Design of New Word Retrieval Algorithm for Chinese-English Bilingual
   Parallel Corpus
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB Natural language processing is an important direction in the field of computer science and artificial intelligence. It can realize various theories and methods of effective communication between humans and computers using natural language. Machine learning is a branch of natural language processing research, which is based on a large-scale English-Chinese database. Due to the relatively poor alignment corpus of English and Chinese bilingual sentences containing unknown words, machine translation is unprofessional and unbalanced, which is the problem studied in this paper. The purpose of this paper is to design and implement a length-based system for sentence alignment between English and Chinese bilingual texts. The research content of this paper is mainly divided into the following parts. First, the evaluation function of bilingual sentence alignment is designed, and on this basis, the bilingual sentence alignment algorithm based on the length and the optimal sentence pair sequence search algorithm is designed. In this paper, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) is selected as an English-Chinese bilingual candidate website and English-Chinese bilingual web pages are downloaded. After analyzing the downloaded pages, nontext content such as page tags is removed, and bilingual text information is stored so as to establish an English-Chinese bilingual corpus based on segment alignment and retain English-Chinese bilingual keywords in the web pages. Second, extract the dictionary from the software StarDict, analyze the original dictionary format, and turn it into a custom dictionary format, which is convenient and better to use the double-sentence sentence alignment system, which is conducive to expanding the number of dictionaries and increasing the professionalism of vocabulary. Finally, we extract the stems of English words from the established corpus to simplify , the complexity of English word processing, reduce the noise caused by the conversion of word parts of speech, and improve the operation efficiency. A bilingual sentence alignment system based on length is implemented. Finally, the system parameters are adjusted for comparative experiments to test the system performance.

TI Transmission Quality Classification with Use of Fusion of Neural Network
   and Genetic Algorithm in Pay&Require Multi-Agent Managed Network
SO SENSORS
AB Modern computer systems practically cannot function without a computer network. New concepts of data transmission are emerging, e.g., programmable networks. However, the development of computer networks entails the need for development in one more aspect, i.e., the quality of the data transmission through the network. The data transmission quality can be described using parameters, i.e., delay, bandwidth, packet loss ratio and jitter. On the basis of the obtained values, specialists are able to state how measured parameters impact on the overall quality of the provided service. Unfortunately, for a non-expert user, understanding of these parameters can be too complex. Hence, the problem of translation of the parameters describing the transmission quality appears understandable to the user. This article presents the concept of using Machine Learning (ML) to solve the above-mentioned problem, i.e., a dynamic classification of the measured parameters describing the transmission quality in a certain scale. Thanks to this approach, describing the quality will become less complex and more understandable for the user. To date, some studies have been conducted. Therefore, it was decided to use different approaches, i.e., fusion of a neural network (NN) and a genetic algorithm (GA). GA's were choosen for the selection of weights replacing the classic gradient descent algorithm. For learning purposes, 100 samples were obtained, each of which was described by four features and the label, which describes the quality. In the reasearch carried out so far, single classifiers and ensemble learning have been used. The current result compared to the previous ones is better. A relatively high quality of the classification was obtained when we have used 10-fold stratified cross-validation, i.e., SEN = 95% (overall accuracy). The incorrect classification was 5/100, which is a better result compared to previous studies.

AB Recently, the vast use of social media and the high availability of internet access have produced a considerably different textual data from the formal and standard data on the Web. This includes various Arabic dialectal languages, which are the native spoken languages of Arabic speakers. The presence of textual Arabic dialectal languages on the Web has brought many new opportunities as well as challenges for machine learning and Arabic language processing. The identification of this type of informal data has its crucial effect on several applications such as sentiment analysis and machine translation. However, the standard NLP tools developed for traditional data fall short due to nature of dialectal textual data. Deep learning tools have proven to be very effective in processing social Media dialectal text. In this paper, we consider a variety of deep learning models for the automatic classification of Arabic dialectal text. We use a free large manually-annotated dataset known as Arabic Online Commentary (AOC), which includes several Dialectal Arabic (DA) along with the Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), [3]. We consider the most frequent dialects in the dataset. Namely, the Egyptian (EGP), Levantine (LEV), and Gulf including Iraqi - (GLF). Four different deep neural network models have been implemented to examine the Arabic dialectal classification problem for each pair of the 3 dialects (binary classification experiments) as well as one ternary-classification experiment including all dialects together. The results show a varying but promising performance of the models for each pair of dialects. Furthermore, a closer examination on the manually-annotated AOC dataset has been carried out and hence, we conclude that there is a serious demand for a thorough refinement and review of the AOC annotated sentences as it is an important benchmark dataset in the field.

TI Scaling of HIS in a global context: Same, same, but different
SO INFORMATION AND ORGANIZATION
AB Scaling of information systems is a field of research with growing importance. This paper presents the story of scaling of an artifact (called District Health Information Software DHIS) and associated principles and practices around a health information system that has taken place over 15 years, both within And between multiple developing countries. Through the lens of the story of the artifact over its trajectory of development and implementation in multiple contexts and time, we develop insights that challenge traditional thinking around scaling. Scaling is not about constant gains and expansion, as is often assumed, but involves a dichotomy of losses and gains, associated with each step or translation in its process of movement. We draw upon Latour's insights on circulating references to analyze this dichotomy of loss and gains, conceptualizing the process as circulating translations. We contribute to the technology transfer literature in arguing that the process of transfer is not about a "parachuting" from point A to B, or a "design from nowhere" but something which occurs in a series of small steps, where with each step new socio-technical configurations are created which not only shape subsequent steps, but also redefine the content of the artifact. In this way, we are in line with findings from the social studies of technology, but differ in that our artifact of study - software - is more "virtually immaterial" than machines which had been primarily earlier objects of study. This property of software, coupled with growth of web-based and mobile infrastructure, allows relative ease of circulation across contexts, where it gets redefined and embedded at the same time at the interconnected levels of the global and local. We conceptualize this process of global scaling as being "same, same, but different". We discuss both the characteristics of this process of global scaling, and the channels and mechanisms through which it takes place. Four overlapping conditions that shape this process include the software itself, the infrastructure, institutional practices, and ideas - these form the basis for a general framework to understand global scaling of health information systems. Empirically, the story of DHIS is told from its birth in the mid-nineties in South Africa developed on a Microsoft platform to its transformation to a web-based platform, built using Java based open-source frameworks, and now moving through multiple countries. We focus on these dynamics primarily within three countries namely India, Sierra Leone and Kenya. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A Multicenter, Scan-Rescan, Human and Machine Learning CMR Study to Test
   Generalizability and Precision in Imaging Biomarker Analysis
SO CIRCULATION-CARDIOVASCULAR IMAGING
AB BACKGROUND: Automated analysis of cardiac structure and function using machine learning (ML) has great potential, but is currently hindered by poor generalizability. Comparison is traditionally against clinicians as a reference, ignoring inherent human inter- and intraobserver error, and ensuring that ML cannot demonstrate superiority. Measuring precision (scan:rescan reproducibility) addresses this. We compared precision of ML and humans using a multicenter, multi-disease, scan:rescan cardiovascular magnetic resonance data set.
   METHODS: One hundred ten patients (5 disease categories, 5 institutions, 2 scanner manufacturers, and 2 field strengths) underwent scan:rescan cardiovascular magnetic resonance (96% within one week). After identification of the most precise human technique, left ventricular chamber volumes, mass, and ejection fraction were measured by an expert, a trained junior clinician, and a fully automated convolutional neural network trained on 599 independent multicenter disease cases. Scan:rescan coefficient of variation and 1000 bootstrapped 95% CIs were calculated and compared using mixed linear effects models.
   RESULTS: Clinicians can be confident in detecting a 9% change in left ventricular ejection fraction, with greater than half of coefficient of variation attributable to intraobserver variation. Expert, trained junior, and automated scan:rescan precision were similar (for left ventricular ejection fraction, coefficient of variation 6.1 [5.2%-7.1%], P=0.2581; 8.3 [5.6%-10.3%], P=0.3653; 8.8 [6.1%-11.1%], P=0.8620). Automated analysis was 186x faster than humans (0.07 versus 13 minutes).
   CONCLUSIONS: Automated ML analysis is faster with similar precision to the most precise human techniques, even when challenged with real-world scan:rescan data. Assessment of multicenter, multi-vendor, multi-field strength scan:rescan data (available at www.thevolumesresource.com) permits a generalizable assessment of ML precision and may facilitate direct translation of ML to clinical practice.

TI An ATF4-Signal-Modulating Machine Other Than GADD34 Acts in ATF4-to-CHOP
   Signaling to Block CHOP Expression in ER-Stress-Related Autophagy
SO JOURNAL OF CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Cells respond to ER-stress via ER-stress sensors, leading to the UPR and subsequent apoptosis; however, occasionally, they activate autophagy without subsequent apoptosis in response to ER-stress. We previously showed that the induction of apoptosis by ER-stress was related to the presence or absence of CHOP expression; nevertheless, how ATF4 expression is elicited without downstream CHOP expression is unknown. We studied the role of GADD34 on the induction of autophagy and/or apoptosis by NaF- or tunicamycin-induced ER-stress in HepG2 cells transfected with GADD34 siRNA. Although NaF and tunicamycin both induced PERK activation followed by eIF2 phosphorylation and ATF4 expression, CHOP expression was only induced by tunicamycin. Concomitant with the signaling change, autophagy was activated both by NaF and tunicamycin, and apoptosis was induced only by tunicamycin. After 4h, GADD34 mRNA expression was also increased by NaF and tunicamycin. Suppression of GADD34 by GADD34 siRNA increased ATF4 expression in both NaF- and tunicamycin-treated cells. The GADD34 siRNA increased CHOP expression, which corresponded to increased ATF4 in tunicamycin-treated cells; however, the increased ATF4 did not induce CHOP expression in NaF-treated cells. In concert with signal changes, siRNA treatment additively increased the autophagic activity of both NaF- and tunicamycin-treated cells; however, apoptosis was produced and accelerated only for tunicamycin-treated cells. These findings indicate that GADD34 expression induced by ER-stress delays CHOP expression and retards apoptotic cell death, and that an ATF4-signal-modulating machine other than GADD34 acts on ATF4-to-CHOP signaling to block ATF4-induced CHOP expression in ER-stress related autophagy.

TI AIWIN-a fast and jigless inspection technique for machined parts
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB Precision inspection of manufactured components having multiple complex surfaces and variable tolerance definition is an involved, complex and time-consuming function. In routine practice, a jig is used to present the part in a known reference frame to carry out the inspection process. Jigs involve both time and cost in their development, manufacture and use. This paper describes 'as is where is inspection' (AIWIN), a new automated inspection technique that accelerates the inspection process by carrying out a fast registration procedure and establishing a quick correspondence between the part to inspect and its CAD geometry. The main challenge in doing away with a jig is that the inspection reference frame could be far removed from the CAD frame. Traditional techniques based on iterative closest point (ICP) or Newton methods require either a large number of iterations for convergence or fail in such a situation. A two-step coarse registration process is proposed to provide a good initial guess for a modified ICP algorithm developed earlier (Ravishankar et al., Int J Adv Manuf Technol 46(1-4):227-236, 2010). The first step uses a calibrated sphere for local hard registration and fixing the translation error. This transformation locates the centre for the sphere in the CAD frame. In the second step, the inverse transformation (involving pure rotation about multiple axes) required to align the inspection points measured on the manufactured part with the CAD point dataset of the model is determined and enforced. This completes the coarse registration enabling fast convergence of the modified ICP algorithm. The new technique has been implemented on complex freeform machined components and the inspection results clearly show that the process is precise and reliable with rapid convergence.

TI Category-learning attention mechanism for short text filtering
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
AB In machine translation, the attention mechanism highlights relevant words according to the distances between the source and target vectors dynamically. However, its ability to optimize text classification is limited because this mechanism only calculates weights inside the same text. There is an uneven dis-tribution of words between ham (not spam) and spam categories, and this category-level feature has not previously been utilized in the attention mechanism for filtering short texts. In addition, short text filter-ing is uniquely challenging due to the length, sparsity and informal writing of texts, as well as a need for rapid processing. We propose a novel category-level attention mechanism called "category-learning attention," which highlights words intensely distributed in the same category by dynamically calculating a category differentiation matrix for each short text. The category-learning attention mechanism is extended to the category-learning scaled-dot-product attention and the category-learning multi-head attention (CL-MHA) mechanisms. The CL-MHA mechanism is then applied to a bidirectional gate recur-rent unit (Bi-GRU) model for performance evaluation by using the SMS spam collection dataset hosted at the University of California, Irvine. Performance metrics including the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score demonstrate that the CL-MHA mechanism significantly improves the performance of Bi-GRU for short text filtering with an accuracy of 99.35%, higher than any previously reported machine learning models. In addition, experiments conducted on three datasets -a Chinese SMS spam dataset, a bench-mark movie review dataset, and a benchmark customer review dataset -further validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The proposed CL-MHA Bi-GRU model has an accuracy of 99.46% when evaluated on the Chinese SMS spam dataset.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Effects of initial graft tension on knee stability after anterior
   cruciate ligament reconstruction using hamstring tendons: A cadaver
   study
SO ARTHROSCOPY-THE JOURNAL OF ARTHROSCOPIC AND RELATED SURGERY
AB Purpose: Tension degradation within hamstring grafts and anterior knee laxity were analyzed in a cadaveric anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction model undergoing cyclic motion. It was hypothesized that suture fixation of a hamstring graft would lose tension during cycling initially and then stabilize, and that anterior knee laxity would increase as tension was lost. Hamstring grafts fixed under 3 different loads were evaluated to determine how initial graft tension affected knee laxity after cyclic motion. Type of Study: Cadaveric biomechanical analysis. Methods: Eighteen pairs of fresh-frozen hamstring tendons were tested on 2 cadaveric knees undergoing ACL reconstruction. The hamstring pairs were separated equally and randomly into one of 3 tension groups: 68 N (15 lb), 45 N (10 lb), and 23 N (5 lb). The loads were applied to the graft at 30degrees of flexion, and the grafts were secured to the tibia with a suture and post technique. The knee was then cycled 1,000 times using an Instron machine (Instron, Canton, MA) through a range of motion between 0degrees to 90degrees. Constant monitoring and recording of graft tension was performed. A KT-1000 (Medmetrics, San Diego, CA) was performed (1) on the intact knee, (2) after ACL excision, (3) after ACL reconstruction and initial graft fixation, and (4) at the completion of the 1,000 cycles. An analysis of variance test was used to evaluate data. Results: The tension within the grafts after 1,000 cycles decreased to 34.5 N (7.6 lb), 16.8 N (3.7 lb), and 15.4 N (3.4 lb) from the preloads of 68, 45, and 23 N, respectively (P < .05 in all cases). This represented an average decrease of 50.2% of the initial tension after 1,000 cycles. Manual-maximum KT testing of the intact knees was 5.8 &PLUSMN; 0.3 mm, and after ACL excision was 13.2 &PLUSMN; 0.9 mm. KT testing revealed 6.0 &PLUSMN; 0.9 rum, 8.1 &PLUSMN; 1.9 mm, and 8.9 &PLUSMN; 1.1 mm of anterior translation after fixation in the tension groups of 68, 45, and 23 N, respectively. After 1,000 cycles, the translation increased to 7.8 &PLUSMN; 1.0 mm, 10.5 &PLUSMN; 1.9 mm, and 10.3 &PLUSMN; 1.5 mm, respectively. Conclusions: This study showed that initial graft tension decreases with cyclic loading, resulting in increased knee laxity. To restore anterior translation to within,3 mm of the native ACL condition after cyclic loading, approximately 68 N of initial tension is required using this fixation technique.

TI Toward the Multilingual Semantic Web: Multilingual Ontology Matching and
   Assessment
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The amount of multilingual data on the Web proliferates; therefore, developing ontologies in various natural languages is attracting considerable attention. In order to achieve semantic interoperability for the multilingual Web, cross-lingual ontology matching techniques are highly required. This paper proposes a Multilingual Ontology Matching (MoMatch) approach for matching ontologies in different natural languages. MoMatch uses machine translation and various string similarity techniques to identify correspondences across different ontologies. Furthermore, we propose a Quality Assessment Suite for Ontologies (QASO) that comprises 14 metrics, out of which seven metrics are used to assess the quality of the matching process and seven metrics are used to evaluate the quality of the ontology. We present an in-depth comparison of different string similarity techniques across various languages to get the most effective similarity measure(s) between multilingual terms. To illustrate the applicability of our approach and how it can be used in different domains, we present two use cases. MoMatch has been implemented using Scala and Apache Spark under an open-source license. We have compared our results with the results from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI 2020). MoMatch has achieved significantly high precision, recall, and F-measure compared to five state-of-the-art matching approaches.

TI Computational tools to study RNA-protein complexes
SO FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR BIOSCIENCES
AB RNA is the key player in many cellular processes such as signal transduction, replication, transport, cell division, transcription, and translation. These diverse functions are accomplished through interactions of RNA with proteins. However, protein-RNA interactions are still poorly derstood in contrast to protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. This knowledge gap can be attributed to the limited availability of protein-RNA structures along with the experimental difficulties in studying these complexes. Recent progress in computational resources has expanded the number of tools available for studying protein-RNA interactions at various molecular levels. These include tools for predicting interacting residues from primary sequences, modelling of protein-RNA complexes, predicting hotspots in these complexes and insights into derstanding in the dynamics of their interactions. Each of these tools has its strengths and limitations, which makes it significant to select an optimal approach for the question of interest. Here we present a mini review of computational tools to study different aspects of protein-RNA interactions, with focus on overall application, development of the field and the future perspectives.

TI Computational methods for characterizing and learning from heterogeneous
   cell signaling data
SO CURRENT OPINION IN SYSTEMS BIOLOGY
AB Heterogeneity in cell signaling pathways is increasingly appreciated as a fundamental feature of cell biology and a driver of clinically relevant disease phenotypes. Understanding the causes of heterogeneity, the cellular mechanisms used to control heterogeneity, and the downstream effects of heterogeneity in single cells are all key obstacles for manipulating cellular populations and treating disease. Recent advances in genetic engineering, including multiplexed fluorescent reporters, have provided unprecedented measurements of signaling heterogeneity, but these vast data sets are often difficult to interpret, necessitating the use of computational techniques to extract meaning from the data. Here, we review recent advances in computational methods for extracting meaning from these novel data streams. In particular, we evaluate how machine learning methods related to dimensionality reduction and classification can identify structure in complex, dynamic data sets, simplifying interpretation. We also discuss how mechanistic models can be merged with heterogeneous data to understand the underlying differences between cells in a population. These methods are still being developed, but the work reviewed here offers useful applications of specific analysis techniques that could enable the translation of single-cell signaling data to actionable biological understanding.

TI Nuclear medicine radiomics in precision medicine: why we can't do
   without artificial intelligence
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
AB In recent years, radiomics, defined as the extraction of large amounts of quantitative features from medical images, has gained emerging interest. Radiomics consists of the extraction of handcrafted features combined with sophisticated statistical methods or machine learning algorithms for modelling, or deep learning algorithms that both learn features from raw data and perform modelling. These features have the potential to serve as non-invasive biomarkers for tumor characterization, prognostic stratification and response prediction. thereby contributing to precision medicine. However, especially in nuclear medicine, variable results are obtained when using radiomics for these purposes. Individual studies show promising results, but due to small numbers of patients per study and little standardization, it is difficult to compare and validate results on other datasets. This review describes the radiomic pipeline, its applications and the increasing role of artificial intelligence within the field. Furthermore, the challenges that need to be overcome to achieve clinical translation are discussed, so that, eventually, radiomics, combined with clinical data and other biomarkers, can contribute to precision medicine, by providing the right treatment to the right patient, with the right dose. at the right time.

TI Pose Estimation of Curved Objects Based on Binocular Vision and Vectors
   of the Tangent Plane
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB This work addresses the challenge of obtaining world coordinates when estimating the pose of curved objects through monocular vision. An efficient method for estimating the pose of curved objects is proposed herein. The proposed method combines binocular vision with the cooperative target. A point cloud of the target object in various poses is generated using a binocular camera in order to rapidly extract the world coordinates of the corner points of the target. Unlike the traditional point-cloud registration pose-estimation methods, the mean value of the corresponding point coordinate difference is used to represent the translation vector in the proposed method. The normal vector of the tangent plane comprising the target corner points is used to form a matrix of the target coordinates in different poses; thus, the rotation matrix is derived. The proposed method not only ensures the accuracy and stability of the pose estimation results but also improves the efficiency of the algorithm significantly. The experimental results show that the efficiency of the proposed method is 98.24% and 97.589' higher than those of the ICP algorithm and NDT algorithm, respectively. The proposed method to estimate the pose of curved objects has various practical applications that arc reviewed in this work.

AB A relation tuple consists of two entities and the relation between them, and often such tuples are found in unstructured text. There may be multiple relation tuples present in a text and they may share one or both entities among them. Extracting such relation tuples from a sentence is a difficult task and sharing of entities or overlapping entities among the tuples makes it more challenging. Most prior work adopted a pipeline approach where entities were identified first followed by finding the relations among them, thus missing the interaction among the relation tuples in a sentence. In this paper, we propose two approaches to use encoder-decoder architecture for jointly extracting entities and relations. In the first approach, we propose a representation scheme for relation tuples which enables the decoder to generate one word at a time like machine translation models and still finds all the tuples present in a sentence with full entity names of different length and with overlapping entities. Next, we propose a pointer network-based decoding approach where an entire tuple is generated at every time step. Experiments on the publicly available New York Times corpus show that our proposed approaches outperform previous work and achieve significantly higher F1 scores.

TI The Quick Exposure Check (QEC) - Inter-rater reliability in total score
   and individual items
SO APPLIED ERGONOMICS
AB The development of musculoskeletal disorders has been linked to various risk factors in the work environment including lifting heavy loads, machine and materials handling, work postures, repetitive work, work with handheld vibrating tools, and work stress. The Quick Exposure Check (QEC) was designed to assess exposure to work-related musculoskeletal risk factors affecting the back, shoulder/arm, wrist/hand, and neck. We investigated the inter-rater reliability of the summary scores and individual items of the QEC by comparing two simultaneous assessments of 51 work tasks, performed by 14 different workers. The work tasks were mainly "light" to "moderately heavy". For total scores, the level of disagreement for shoulder/arm had a Relative Position of 0.13 (95% CI: 0.02; 0.23) and no statistically significant random disagreement. Percentage agreement was 63-100% for individual items and 71-88% for total score. Weighted Kappa of agreement for the individual items rated by the assessors were 0.94-0.77; highest for back motion, and lowest for wrist/hand position. The Swedish translation of the Quick Exposure Check has moderate to very good inter-rater reliability with fair to slight levels of systematic disagreement. There was no statistically significant random disagreement.

AB Multimodal fusion of audio, vision, and text has demonstrated significant benefits in advancing the performance of several tasks, including machine translation, video captioning, and video summarization. Audio-Visual Scene-aware Dialog (AVSD) is a new and more challenging task, proposed recently, that focuses on generating sentence responses to questions that are asked in a dialog about video content. While prior approaches designed to tackle this task have shown the need for multimodal fusion to improve response quality, the best-performing systems often rely heavily on human-generated summaries of the video content, which are unavailable when such systems are deployed in real-world. This paper investigates how to compensate for such information, which is missing in the inference phase but available during the training phase. To this end, we propose a novel AVSD system using student-teacher learning, in which a student network is (jointly) trained to mimic the teacher's responses. Our experiments demonstrate that in addition to yielding state-of-the-art accuracy against the baseline DSTC7-AVSD system, the proposed approach (which does not use human-generated summaries at test time) performs competitively with methods that do use those summaries.

AB Basaa is one of the three Bantu languages of BULB (Breaking the Unwritten Language Barrier), a project whose aim is to provide NLP-based tools to support linguists in documenting under-resourced and unwritten languages. To develop technologies such as automatic phone transcription or machine translation, a massive amount of speech data is needed. Approximately 50 hours of Basaa speech were thus collected and then carefully re-spoken and orally translated into French in a controlled environment by a few bilingual speakers. For a subset of approximate to 10 hours of the corpus, each utterance was additionally phonetically transcribed to establish a golden standard for the output of our NLP tools. The experiments described in this paper are meant to provide an automatic phonetic transcription using a set of derived phone-like units. As every language features a specific set of idiosyncrasies, automating the process of phonetic unit discovery in its entirety is a challenging task. Within BULB, we envision a workflow where linguists are able to refine the set of automatically discovered units and the system is then able to re-iterate on the data, providing a better approximation of the actual phone set.

AB Video content has increased much on the Internet during last years. In spite of the efforts of different organizations and governments to increase the accessibility of websites, most multimedia content on the Internet is not accessible. This paper describes a system that contributes to make multimedia content more accessible on the Web, by automatically translating subtitles in oral language to Sign Writing, a way of writing Sign Language. This system extends the functionality of a general web platform that can provide accessible web content for different needs. This platform has a core component that automatically converts any web page to a web page compliant with level AA of WAI guidelines. Around this core component, different adapters complete the conversion according to the needs of specific users. One adapter is the Deaf People Accessibility Adapter, which provides accessible web content for the Deaf, based on Sign Writting. Functionality of this adapter has been extended with the video subtitle translator system. A first prototype of this system has been tested through different methods including usability and accessibility tests and results show that this tool can enhance the accessibility of video content available on the Web for Deaf people.

AB This discussion examines several philosophical considerations (phenomenology, embodiment, corpothetics and mediation) which form powerful interlocking arguments, whose qualities are prerequisites for building presence and place in virtual heritage landscapes. The discourse draws upon Interpretive Archaeology and Interpretive Archaeological Systems theory and it is in Symmetrical Archaeology theory that we find a basis for complex emergent narratives in immersive virtual environments. Firmly rooted in praxis, the argument explores these issues through research associated with applications from the Place-Hampi project. Place-Hampi is an embodied theatre of participation in the drama of Hindu mythology focused at the most significant archaeological, historical and sacred locations of the World Heritage site Vijayanagara (Hampi), South India. Through the Advanced Visualization Interactive Environment a translation of spatial potential is enacted in Place-Hampi where participants are able to transform myths into the drama of a co-evolutionary narrative by their actions within the virtual landscape and through the creation of a virtual heritage embodiment of a real world dynamic. Place-Hampi restores symmetry to the autonomy of interactions within virtual heritage and allows machine and human entities to make narrative sense of each other's actions (as an entanglement of people-things cf Bruno Latour).

AB Transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art results on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their attention mechanism comes with a quadratic complexity in sequence lengths, making the computational overhead prohibitive, especially for long sequences. Attention context can be seen as a random-access memory with each token taking a slot. Under this perspective, the memory size grows linearly with the sequence length, and so does the overhead of reading from it. One way to improve the efficiency is to bound the memory size. We show that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction, attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and they vary in their organization of the memory. ABC reveals new, unexplored possibilities. First, it connects several efficient attention variants that would otherwise seem distinct. Second, this abstraction gives new insights-an established approach (Wang et al., 2020b) previously thought to not be applicable in causal attention, actually is. Last, we present a new instance of ABC, which draws inspiration from existing ABC approaches, but replaces their heuristic memory-organizing functions with a learned, contextualized one. Our experiments on language modeling, machine translation, and masked language model fine-tuning show that our approach outperforms previous efficient attention models; compared to strong transformer baselines, it significantly improves the inference time and space efficiency with no or negligible accuracy loss.

AB Code summarization with deep learning has been widely studied in recent years. Current deep learning models for code summarization generally follow the principle in neural machine translation and adopt the encoder-decoder framework, where the encoder learns the semantic representations from source code and the decoder transforms the learnt representations into human-readable text that describes the functionality of code snippets. Despite they achieve the new state-of-the-art performance, we notice that current models often either generate less fluent summaries, or fail to capture the core functionality, since they usually focus on a single type of code representations. As such we propose GypSum, a new deep learning model that learns hybrid representations using graph attention neural networks and a pre-trained programming and natural language model. We introduce particular edges related to the control flow of a code snippet into the abstract syntax tree for graph construction, and design two encoders to learn from the graph and the token sequence of source code, respectively. We modify the encoder-decoder sublayer in the Transformer's decoder to fuse the representations and propose a dual-copy mechanism to facilitate summary generation. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of GypSum over existing code summarization models.

AB The side-scan sonar (SSS) is a critical sensor device used to explore underwater environments in the deep sea. Gathering SSS data, however, is an expensive and time-consuming task because it requires sensor towing and involves complicated field operations. Recently, deep learning has been making advances rapidly in the field of computer vision. Benefiting from this development, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been demonstrated to produce realistic synthetic data of various types, including images and acoustics signals. In this letter, we propose a GAN-based semantic image synthesis model based on GAN that can generate high-quality SSS images at a low cost in less time. We evaluate the proposed model using both shallow and deep water SSS data sets that include a diverse range of imaging conditions. such as high and low sonar operating frequencies and different landscapes. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively generate synthesized SSS data characterized by the shape and style of real data, thereby demonstrating its promising potential for SSS data augmentation in diverse SSS relevant machine learning tasks.

AB Timing estimation, a significant process in microprocessor design, should be performed promptly and accurately by the simulators to exploit the enormous design space of processors. The challenging task is how to integrate the timing data generated by the timing models of various processor components of a functional simulator, such as pipeline, branch predictor, and cache. The timing model of one processor component must interact with the other processor components, the same way processor components interact with each other in real machines for accurate timing estimation and are individually configurable and produce timing data for fast simulation. In this article, we present a configurable, fast, and cycle-approximate timing estimation method, for instruction-level emulators to solve the timing model problem. We extend QEMU, a dynamic binary translation functional emulator, to allow timing models of different processor components to be plugged in, to provide cycle-approximate timing information, while at the same time keep the fast simulation speed by providing a Timing Record Caching technique. In the proposed model, the pipeline timing of each basic block is fixed and independent of others while maintaining the timing accuracy at the same time. We have also provided instrumentation and profiling capability to help the designers to analyze and find design bottlenecks.

TI Integrated Parallel Sentence and Fragment Extraction from Comparable
   Corpora: A Case Study on Chinese-Japanese Wikipedia
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB Parallel corpora are crucial for statistical machine translation (SMT); however, they are quite scarce for most language pairs and domains. As comparable corpora are far more available, many studies have been conducted to extract either parallel sentences or fragments from them for SMT. In this article, we propose an integrated system to extract both parallel sentences and fragments from comparable corpora. We first apply parallel sentence extraction to identify parallel sentences from comparable sentences. We then extract parallel fragments from the comparable sentences. Parallel sentence extraction is based on a parallel sentence candidate filter and classifier for parallel sentence identification. We improve it by proposing a novel filtering strategy and three novel feature sets for classification. Previous studies have found it difficult to accurately extract parallel fragments from comparable sentences. We propose an accurate parallel fragment extraction method that uses an alignment model to locate the parallel fragment candidates and an accurate lexicon-based filter to identify the truly parallel fragments. A case study on the Chinese-Japanese Wikipedia indicates that our proposed methods outperform previously proposed methods, and the parallel data extracted by our system significantly improves SMT performance.

TI Lost In Translation: Exposing Hidden Compiler Optimization Opportunities
SO COMPUTER JOURNAL
AB Existing iterative compilation and machine learning-based optimization techniques have been proven very successful in achieving better optimizations than the standard optimization levels of a compiler. However, they were not engineered to support the tuning of a compiler's optimizer as part of the compiler's daily development cycle. In this paper, we first establish the required properties that a technique must exhibit to enable such tuning. We then introduce an enhancement to the classic nightly routine testing of compilers, which exhibits all the required properties and thus is capable of driving the improvement and tuning of the compiler's common optimizer. This is achieved by leveraging resource usage and compilation information collected while systematically exploiting prefixes of the transformations applied at standard optimization levels. Experimental evaluation using the LLVM v6.0.1 compiler demonstrated that the new approach was able to reveal hidden cross-architecture and architecture-dependent potential optimizations on two popular processors: the Intel i5-6300U and the Arm Cortex-A53-based Broadcom BCM2837 used in the Raspberry Pi 3B+. As a case study, we demonstrate how the insights from our approach enabled us to identify and remove a significant shortcoming of the CFG simplification pass of the LLVM v6.0.1 compiler.

AB In this paper, we study the security attacks on Android using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks. As one of the most popular operating systems, Android is a prime target for security attacks. Only in 2019, 10.5 million malware was detected. Recursive neural networks are in essence machine models made up of a list of cells. Their particularity is that part of the output of the previous cell is used as input for the next one. LSTM have shown good results in several areas, for example, text generation, translation, trajectory prediction. Among the recursive neural network models, LSTM is one of the most efficient approaches to sequence classification as it is able to make relations between very distant elements in a sequence. This research explored the application of LSTM for Android malware detection using source code decompiled from the Android Application Package (APK). The approach we have tried is to first extract the instructions from the source code while respecting their execution order as much as possible. We then explored several ways to filter and encode these instructions. For all feature sets we created, we obtained an accuracy greater than 70% of accuracy and for some feature sets the accuracy reached 83% showing that it is possible to successfully detect malware using source code and LSTM.

TI Toward platelet transcriptomics in cancer diagnosis, prognosis and
   therapy
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB Widespread adoption of next-generation techniques such as RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) has enabled research examining the transcriptome of anucleate blood platelets in health and disease, thus revealing a rich platelet transcriptomic signature that is reprogrammed in response to disease. Platelet signatures not only capture information from parent megakaryocytes and progenitor hematopoietic stem cells but also the bone marrow microenvironment, and underlying disease states. In cancer, the substantive body of research in patients with solid tumours has identified distinct signatures in 'tumour-educated platelets', reflecting influences of the tumour, stroma and vasculature on splicing, sequestration of tumour-derived RNAs, and potentially cytokine and microvesicle influences on megakaryocytes. More recently, platelet RNA expression has emerged as a highly sensitive approach to profiling chronic progressive haematologic malignancies, where the combination of large data cohorts and machine-learning algorithms enables precise feature selection and potential prognostication. Despite these advances, however, our ability to translate platelet transcriptomics toward clinical diagnostic and prognostic efforts remains limited. In this Perspective, we present a few actionable steps for our basic, translational and clinical research communities in advancing the utility of the platelet transcriptome as a highly sensitive biomarker in cancer and collectively enable efforts toward clinical translation and patient benefit.

TI An in silico approach to identification, categorization and prediction
   of nucleic acid binding proteins
SO BRIEFINGS IN BIOINFORMATICS
AB The interaction between proteins and nucleic acid plays an important role in many processes, such as transcription, translation and DNA repair. The mechanisms of related biological events can be understood by exploring the function of proteins in these interactions. The number of known protein sequences has increased rapidly in recent years, but the databases for describing the structure and function of protein have unfortunately grown quite slowly. Thus, improving such databases is meaningful for predicting protein-nucleic acid interactions. Furthermore, the mechanism of related biological events, such as viral infection or designing novel drug targets, can be further understood by understanding the function of proteins in these interactions. The information for each sequence, including its function and interaction sites, were collected and identified, and a database called PNIDB was built. The proteins in PNIDB were grouped into 27 classes, such as transcription, immune system, and structural protein, etc. The function of each protein was then predicted using a machine learning method. Using our method, the predictor was trained on labeled sequences, and then the function of a protein was predicted based on the trained classifier. The prediction accuracy achieved a score of 77.43% by 10-fold cross validation.

TI A survey on automatic image annotation
SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE
AB Automatic image annotation is a crucial area in computer vision, which plays a significant role in image retrieval, image description, and so on. Along with the internet technique developing, there are numerous images posted on the web, resulting in the fact that it is a challenge to annotate images only by humans. Hence, many computer vision researchers are interested in automatic image annotation and make a great effort in optimizing its performance. Automatic image annotation is a task that assigns several tags in a limited vocabulary to describe an image. There are many algorithms proposed to tackle this problem and all achieve great performance. In this paper, we review seven algorithms for automatic image annotation and evaluate these algorithms leveraging different image features, such as color histograms and Gist descriptor. Our goal is to provide insights into the automatic image annotation. A lot of comprehensive experiments, which are based on Corel5K, IAPR TC-12, and ESP Game datasets, are designed to compare the performance of these algorithms. We also compare the performance of traditional algorithms employing deep learning features. Considering that not all associated labels are annotated by human annotators, we leverage the DIA metrics on IAPR TC-12 and ESP Game datasets.

TI Stop codons affect 5 ' splice site selection by surveillance of splicing
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Pre-mRNA splicing involves recognition of a consensus sequence at the 5' splice site (SS). However, only some of the many potential sites that conform to the consensus are true ones, whereas the majority remain silent and are not normally used for splicing. We noticed that in most cases the utilization of such a latent intronic 5' SS for splicing would introduce an in-frame stop codon into the resultant mRNA. This finding suggested a link between SS selection and maintenance of an ORF within the mRNA. Here we tested this idea by analyzing the splicing of pre-mRNAs in which in-frame stop codons upstream of a latent 5' SS were mutated. We found that splicing with the latent site is indeed activated by such mutations. Our findings predict the existence of a checking mechanism, as a component of the nuclear pre-mRNA splicing machine, to ensure the maintenance of an ORE This notion is highly important for accurate gene expression, as perturbations that would lead to splicing at these latent sites are expected to introduce in-frame stop codons into the majority of mRNAs.

TI Quantum maximum mean discrepancy GAN
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
AB Generative adversarial network (GAN) has shown profound power in machine learning. It inspires many researchers from other fields to create powerful tools for various tasks, including quantum state preparation, quantum circuit translation, and so on. It is known as classical techniques cannot efficiently simulate the quantum system, and the existing works haven't investigated the quantum version of maximum mean discrepancy as the metric in learning models and applied it to quantum data. In this paper, we propose a metric named quantum maximum mean discrepancy (qMMD), which can be used to measure the distance between quantum data in Hilbert space. Based on the qMMD, we then design a quantum generative adversarial model, named qMMD-GAN, under the hybrid quantum-classical methods. We also provide the construction of qMMD-GAN that can be easily implemented on a quantum device. We demonstrate the power of our qMMD-GAN by applying it to a crucial real-world application that is generating an unknown quantum state. Our numerical experiments show that qMMD-GAN has a competitive performance compared to existing results. We believe that the hybrid-based models will not only be applied to physics research but provide a new direction for improving classical data processing tasks. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI HyperBench: A Benchmark Suite for Virtualization Capabilities
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON MEASUREMENT AND ANALYSIS OF COMPUTING SYSTEMS
AB Virtualization is becoming increasingly common in data centers due to its various advantages. However, how to choose among different platforms, including both software and hardware, is a considerable challenge. In this context, evaluating the virtualization capabilities of different platforms is critically important. Regrettably, the existing benchmarks are not qualified for meeting this requirement. Different hardware mechanisms and hypervisor designs introduce many different hypervisor-level events, such as transitions between VMs and the hypervisor, two-dimensional page walk, and binary translation. These events are key factors affecting virtualization performance. Existing benchmarks either overlook these changes or are tightly coupled to a particular hypervisor.
   In this paper, we present HyperBench, a benchmark suite that focuses on the capabilities of different virtualization platforms. Currently, we design 15 hypervisor benchmarks covering CPU, memory, and I/O.
   The virtualization-sensitive operation in each benchmark triggers hypervisor-level events, which examines the platform's ability in the target area. HyperBench is designed as a custom kernel which can adapt to different hypervisors and architectures. What's more, adding a new benchmark is pretty easy.
   Finally, we perform a series of experiments on the host machine and several popular hypervisors, such as QEMU, KVM, and Xen, demonstrating that HyperBench is capable of revealing the performance implications of the hardware mechanism and hypervisor design.

TI Recent Advances of Generative Adversarial Networks in Computer Vision
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The appearance of generative adversarial networks (GAN) provides a new approach and framework for computer vision. Compared with traditional machine learning algorithms, GAN works via adversarial training concept and is more powerful in both feature learning and representation. GAN also exhibits some problems, such as non-convergence, model collapse, and uncontrollability due to high degree of freedom. How to improve the theory of GAN and apply it to computer-vision-related tasks have now attracted much research efforts. In this paper, recently proposed GAN models and their applications in computer vision are systematically reviewed. In particular, we firstly survey the history and development of generative algorithms, the mechanism of GAN, its fundamental network structures, and theoretical analysis of the original GAN. Classical GAN algorithms are then compared comprehensively in terms of the mechanism, visual results of generated samples, and Frechet Inception Distance. These networks are further evaluated from network construction, performance, and applicability aspects by extensive experiments conducted over public datasets. After that, several typical applications of GAN in computer vision, including high-quality samples generation, style transfer, and image translation, are examined. Finally, some existing problems of GAN are summarized and discussed and potential future research topics are forecasted.

AB Malicious software, or malware, continues to be a problem for computer users, corporations, and governments. Previous research [1] has explored training file-based, malware classifiers using a two-stage approach. In the first stage, a malware language model is used to learn the feature representation which is then input to a second stage mal ware classifier. In Pascanu et al. [1], the language model is either a standard recurrent neural network (RNN) or an echo state network (ESN). In this work, we propose several new mal ware classification architectures which include a long short-term memory (LSTM) language model and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) language model. We also propose using an attention mechanism similar to [12] from the machine translation literature, in addition to temporal max pooling used in [1], as an alternative way to construct the file representation from neural features. Finally, we propose a new single-stage malware classifier based on a character-level convolutional neural network (CNN). Results show that the LSTM with temporal max pooling and logistic regression offers a 31.3% improvement in the true positive rate compared to the best system in [1] at a false positive rate of 1 %.

TI Sentence alignment using local and global information
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB Parallel corpora are essential resources for statistical machine translation (SMT) and cross language information retrieval (CLIR) systems. Creating parallel corpora is highly expensive in terms of both time and cost. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automatically extract parallel sentences from aligned documents. To do so, we first train a Maximum Entropy binary classifier to compute the local similarity between each two sentences in different languages. To consider global information (e.g., the position of sentence pairs in the aligned documents), we define an objective function to penalize the cross alignments and then propose an integer linear programming approach to optimize the objective function. In our experiments, we focus on English and Persian Wikipedia articles. The experimental results on manually aligned test data indicate that the proposed method outperforms the baselines, significantly. Furthermore, the extrinsic evaluations of the corpus extracted from Wikipedia on both SMT and CUR systems demonstrate the quality of the extracted parallel sentences. In addition, Experiments on the English German language pair demonstrate that the proposed ILP method is a language-independent sentence alignment approach. The extracted English Persian parallel corpus is freely available for research purposes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Automatic sign language recognition (SLR) is an important topic within the areas of human-computer interaction and machine learning. On the one hand, it poses a complex challenge that requires the intervention of various knowledge areas, such as video processing, image processing, intelligent systems and linguistics. On the other hand, robust recognition of sign language could assist in the translation process and the integration of hearing-impaired people, as well as the teaching of sign language for the hearing population.
   SLR systems usually employ Hidden Markov Models, Dynamic Time Warping or similar models to recognize signs. Such techniques exploit the sequential ordering of frames to reduce the number of hypothesis. This paper presents a general probabilistic model for sign classification that combines sub-classifiers based on different types of features such as position, movement and handshape. The model employs a bag-of-words approach in all classification steps, to explore the hypothesis that ordering is not essential for recognition. The proposed model achieved an accuracy rate of 97% on an Argentinian Sign Language dataset containing 64 classes of signs and 3200 samples, providing some evidence that indeed recognition without ordering is possible.

AB A key to solving the multiclass object recognition problem is to extract a set of features which accurately and uniquely capture the salient characteristics of different objects. In this work we modify a hierarchical model of the visual cortex that is based on the HMAX model. The first layer of the HMAX model convolves the image with a set of multi-scale, multi-oriented and localized filters, which in our case are learnt from thousands of image patches randomly extracted from natural stimuli. These filters emerge as a result of optimization based in part on approximate-L1-norm sparseness maximization. A key difference between these filters and standard Gabor filters used in the HAMX model is that these filters are adapted to natural stimuli, and hence are more biologically plausible. Based on the modified model we extract a flexible set of features which are largely scale, translation and rotation invariant. This model is applied to extract features from Caltech-5 and Caltech-101 datasets, which are then fed to a support vector machine classifier for the object recognition task. The overall performance successfully demonstrates the plausibility of using filters learned from natural stimuli for feature extraction in object recognition problems.

AB Neural text generation models are typically trained by maximizing log-likelihood with the sequence cross entropy (CE) loss, which encourages an exact token-by-token match between a target sequence with a generated sequence. Such training objective is sub-optimal when the target sequence is not perfect, e.g., when the target sequence is corrupted with noises, or when only weak sequence supervision is available. To address the challenge, we propose a novel Edit-Invariant Sequence Loss (EISL), which computes the matching loss of a target n-gram with all n-grams in the generated sequence. EISL is designed to be robust to various noises and edits in the target sequences. Moreover, the EISL computation is essentially an approximate convolution operation with target n-grams as kernels, which is easy to implement and efficient to compute with existing libraries. To demonstrate the effectiveness of EISL, we conduct experiments on a wide range of tasks, including machine translation with noisy target sequences, unsupervised text style transfer with only weak training signals, and non-autoregressive generation with non-predefined generation order. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms the common CE loss and other strong baselines on all the tasks. EISL has a simple API that can be used as a drop-in replacement of the CE loss.(1)

AB Existing automated techniques for software documentation typically attempt to reason between two main sources of information: code and natural language. However, this reasoning process is often complicated by the lexical gap between more abstract natural language and more structured programming languages. One potential bridge for this gap is the Graphical User Interface (GUI), as GUIs inherently encode salient information about underlying program functionality into rich, pixel-based data representations. This paper offers one of the first comprehensive empirical investigations into the connection between GUIs and functional, natural language descriptions of software. First, we collect, analyze, and open source a large dataset of functional GUI descriptions consisting of 45,998 descriptions for 10,204 screenshots from popular Android applications. The descriptions were obtained from human labelers and underwent several quality control mechanisms. To gain insight into the representational potential of GUIs, we investigate the ability of four Neural Image Captioning models to predict natural language descriptions of varying granularity when provided a screenshot as input. We evaluate these models quantitatively, using common machine translation metrics, and qualitatively through a large-scale user study. Finally, we offer learned lessons and a discussion of the potential shown by multimodal models to enhance future techniques for automated software documentation.

TI An Artificial Intelligence Approach for Word Semantic Similarity Measure

SO KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB AI combined with NLP techniques has promoted the use of Virtual Assistants and have made people rely on them for many diverse uses. Conversational Agents are the most promising technique that assists computer users through their operation. An important challenge in developing Conversational Agents globally is transferring the groundbreaking expertise obtained in English to other languages. AI is making it possible to transfer this learning. There is a dire need to develop systems that understand secular languages. One such difficult language is Hindi, which is the fourth most spoken language in the world. Semantic similarity is an important part of Natural Language Processing, which involves applications such as ontology learning and information extraction, for developing conversational agents. Most of the research is concentrated on English and other European languages. This paper presents a Corpus-based word semantic similarity measure for Hindi. An experiment involving the translation of the English benchmark dataset to Hindi is performed, investigating the incorporation of the corpus, with human and machine similarity ratings. A significant correlation to the human intuition and the algorithm ratings has been calculated for analyzing the accuracy of the proposed similarity measures. The method can be adapted in various applications of word semantic similarity or module for any other language.

TI word.alignment: an R package for computing statistical word alignment
   and its evaluation
SO COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS
AB Word alignment has lots of applications in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. As far as we are aware, there is no word alignment package in the R environment. In this paper, word.alignment, a new R software package is introduced which implements a statistical word alignment model as an unsupervised learning. It uses IBM Model 1 as a machine translation model based on the use of the EM algorithm and the Viterbi search in order to find the best alignment. It also provides the symmetric alignment using three heuristic methods such as union, intersection, and grow-diag. It has also the ability to build an automatic bilingual dictionary applying an innovative rule. The generated dictionary is suitable for a number of NLP tasks. This package provides functions for measuring the quality of the word alignment via comparing the alignment with a gold standard alignment based on five metrics as well. It is easily installed and executable on the mostly widely used platforms. Note that it is easily usable and we show that its results are almost everywhere better than some other word alignment tools. Finally, some examples illustrating the use of word.alignment is provided.

AB Language and vocabulary continue to evolve in this era of big data, making language modelling an important language processing task that benefits from the enormous data in different languages provided by web-based corpora. In this paper, we present a set of 6-gram language models based on a big-data training of the contemporary Polish language, using the Common Crawl corpus (a compilation of over 3.25 billion webpages) and other resources. The corpus is provided in different combinations of POS-tagged, grammatical groups-tagged, and sub-word-divided versions of raw corpora and trained models. The dictionary of contemporary Polish was updated and presented, and we used the KENLM toolkit to train big-data language models in ARPA format. Additionally, we have provided pre-trained vector models. The language model was trained, and the advances in BLEU score were obtained in MT systems along with the perplexity values, utilizing our models. The superiority of our model over Google's WEB1T n-gram counts and the first version of our model was demonstrated through experiments, and the results illustrated that it guarantees improved quality in perplexity and machine translation. Our models can be applied in several natural language processing tasks and several scientific interdisciplinary fields.

TI A High-Speed, Real-Time Vision System for Texture Tracking and Thread
   Counting
SO IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS
AB In garment manufacturing, an automatic sewing machine is desirable to reduce cost. To accomplish this, a high-speed vision system is required to track fabric motions and recognize repetitive weave patterns with high accuracy, from a microperspective near a sewing zone. In this letter, we present an innovative framework for real-time texture tracking and weave pattern recognition. Our framework includes a module for motion estimation using blob detection and feature matching. It also includes a module for lattice detection to facilitate the weave pattern recognition. Our lattice-detection algorithm utilizes blob detection and template matching to assess pair-wise similarity in blobs' appearance. In addition, it extracts information of dominant orientations to obtain a global constraint in the topology. By incorporating both constraints in the appearance similarity and the global topology, the algorithm determines a lattice that characterizes the topological structure of the repetitive weave pattern, thus allowing for thread counting. In our experiments, the proposed thread-based texture tracking system is capable of tracking denim fabric with high accuracy (e.g., 0.03. rotation and 0.02 weave-thread translation errors) and high speed (3 frames per second), demonstrating its high potential for automatic real-time textile manufacturing.

TI Pose optimization based on integral of the distance between line
   segments
SO SCIENCE CHINA-TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB In this paper, new solutions for the problem of pose estimation from correspondences between 3D model lines and 2D image lines are proposed. Traditional line-based pose estimation methods rely on the assumption that the noises (perpendicular to the line) for the two endpoints are statistically independent. However, these two noises are in fact negatively correlated when the image line segment is fitted using the least-squares technique. Therefore, we design a new error function expressed by the average integral of the distance between line segments. Three least-squares techniques that optimize both the rotation and translation simultaneously are proposed in which the new error function is exploited. In addition, Lie group formalism is utilized to describe the pose parameters, and then, the optimization problem can be solved by means of a simple iterative least squares method. To enhance the robustness to outliers existing in the match data, an M-estimation method is developed to convert the pose optimization problem into an iterative reweighted least squares problem. The proposed methods are validated through experiments using both synthetic and real-world data. The experimental results show that the proposed methods yield a clearly higher precision than the traditional methods.

TI Spherical motion burnishing implemented on lathes
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS & MANUFACTURE
AB This paper presents a new method of mechanical surface treatment of external cylindrical surfaces and it is called "Spherical motion burnishing" (SMB). The axes of the workpiece and ring-shaped tool having toroidal acting surface intersect at angle theta = 2 degrees. The tool motion is superposition from a spherical motion and rectilinear translation with respect to the workpiece. The contact between the surface treated and its enveloped-tool acting surface is one of sliding friction in the presence of a lubricant. The method can be implemented on conventional machine tools, in particular on lathes by means of a relatively simple device and tool. To evaluate the manufacturing potentials of the SMB method a designed experiment has been carried out. The quality of the treated surfaces of workpieces made of low- and medium-carbon steel has been investigated experimentally. Mathematical models of the roughness and the residual axial normal stresses have been obtained on the basis of a planned experiment. The authenticity of the models has been proved on the basis of four extra tests. The method can be classified as mixed burnishing because it combines the advantages of hardening, dimensional burnishing and smoothing burnishing. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we present an analysis and automatic implementation tool of security protocols based on Techniques of Formal Description. A sufficiently complete and concise formal specification that has allowed us to define the state machine that corresponds to a cryptographic protocol has been designed to achieve our goals. This formal specification also makes it possible to incorporate in a flexible way the mechanisms and functions of security. Our system makes it possible to automatically translate formal specifications of protocols to a group of derivation Prolog rules. Our work improves the solution first proposed by J.K. Millen in [1]. We study the vulnerability of security protocols exploring, in an automatic way, all its possible behaviors in agreement both with their formal specification and with the information potentially recorded by an intruder. As a result of our work, for example, the vulnerability of security protocols that is already proven in a theoretical way (Needhman-Schroeder protocol [2] or SSH or AKA protocols [3]) can be proven and analyzed automatically starting from the translation to rules of those protocols. Additionally, our tool incorporates a new concept of implementation of protocols based on the interpretation of formal specifications on distributed systems.

AB This paper presents a vision system which purpose is to detect topographies of highly reflective, metallic surfaces of minted tokens. We call this technique "Selective Stereo Gradient Method" (SSGM). The objective is to decide from comparison of the measured characteristic surface topography with topographical data in a database, whether a test token belongs to a reference class or not. A 3 sector 120degrees LED illumination is used for generating three images under different illumination directions. The comparison between these three sequentially taken images leads to a discrimination between a real object with 3D topography and a photographic image. The experimental setup and special illumination conditions to generate grey-scale images of the token's surface topography are described. The raw data images are segmented, scaled and binarised. Rotation and translation invariance of the recognition and classification process are implemented. A specimen will be identified to belong to the class of interest if, in a subsequent template matching step, selected patterns taken from the class reference objects and deposited in a database, can be successfully identified in the image. The classification statistics results will be reported for metallic tokens.

TI Urdu Named Entity Recognition System Using Deep Learning Approaches
SO COMPUTER JOURNAL
AB Named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamental part of other natural language processing tasks such as information retrieval, question answering systems and machine translation. Progress and success have already been achieved in research on the English NER systems. However, the Urdu NER system is still in its infancy due to the complexity and morphological richness of the Urdu language. Existing Urdu NER systems are highly dependent on manual feature engineering and word embedding to capture similarity. Their performance lags if the words are previously unknown or infrequent. The feature-based models suffer from complicated feature engineering and are often highly reliant on external resources. To overcome these limitations in this study, we present several deep neural approaches that automatically learn features from the data and eliminate manual feature engineering. Our extension involved convolutional neural network to extract character-level features and combine them with word embedding to handle out-of-vocabulary words. The study also presents a tweets dataset in Urdu, annotated manually for five named entity classes. The effectiveness of the deep learning approaches is demonstrated on four benchmarks datasets. The proposed method demonstrates notable progress upon current state-of-the-art NER approaches in Urdu. The results show an improvement of 6.26% in the F1 score.

SO RADIOLOGY
AB Over the past few decades, pulmonary imaging technologies have advanced from chest radiography and nuclear medicine methods to high-spatial-resolution or low-dose chest CT and MRI. It is currently possible to identify and measure pulmonary pathologic changes before these are obvious even to patients or depicted on conventional morphologic images. Here, key technological advances are described, including multiparametric CT image processing methods, inhaled hyperpolarized and fluorinated gas MRI, and four-dimensional free-breathing CT and MRI methods to measure regional ventilation, perfusion, gas exchange, and biomechanics. The basic anatomic and physiologic underpinnings of these pulmonary functional imaging techniques are explained. In addition, advances in image analysis and computational and artificial intelligence (machine learning) methods pertinent to functional lung imaging are discussed. The clinical applications of pulmonary functional imaging, including both the opportunities and challenges for clinical translation and deployment, will be discussed in part 2 of this review. Given the technical advances in these sophisticated imaging methods and the wealth of information they can provide, it is anticipated that pulmonary functional imaging will be increasingly used in the care of patients with lung disease.

TI Designing a system for identifying persons using 3d images
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NONLINEAR ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Nowadays, information security has become a very important and difficult matter. Security cameras are widespread in banks, ATMs, airports, universities, offices, and anywhere with a security system. The face recognition process is one of the most demanding image analysis and computer vision tasks. Faces are biometric systems that utilized a digital image of a person to identify or authenticate that person. This system is employed in the field of security. The face recognition system is required to detect and recognize the face in the image automatically. It works by extracting and then recognizing its attributes, irrespective of expression or illumination, transitions (translation, rotation and scaling of the image) and ageing, which is a difficult task. The proposed system records the facial features of the person standing in front of the camera, such as the size, position of the nose, eyes, jawbones, and cheekbones structure. This program also allows the user to evaluate and analyze the image. This system does not require long training for technicians because it is easy to use and gives quick and accurate results compared to biometric techniques the other. It is worth noting that Matlab roll was used in the design of this program.

AB Word embeddings are currently the most popular vector space model in Natural Language Processing. How we encode words is important because it affects the performance of many downstream tasks such as Machine Translation (MT), Information Retrieval (IR) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). While much focus has been placed on constructing word embeddings for English, very little attention is paid to under-resourced languages, especially native African languages. In this paper we select four popular word embedding models (Word2Vec CBOW and Skip-Gram; FastText and GloVe) and train them on the 10 million token isiZulu National Corpus (INC) to create isiZulu word embeddings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that word embeddings in isiZulu have been constructed and made available to the public. We create a semantic similarity data set analogous to WordSim353, which we also make publicly available. This data set is used to conduct an evaluation of the four models to determine which is the best for creating isiZulu word embeddings in a low-resource (small corpus) setting. We found that the Word2Vec Skip-Gram model produced the highest quality embeddings, as measured by this semantic similarity task. However, it was the GloVe model which performed best on the nearest neighbours task.

SO IEEE INTERNET COMPUTING
AB Performing jump exercise can maintain a healthy lymphatic system, which keeps human body in an optimal condition and is a critical component of human immune system. Accurate jump detection and count are crucial to patients with a dysfunctional lymph system. In this article, we present a continuous jump detection framework on smartphones, SmartJump, for human jump detection and count, by leveraging the accelerometer and magnetometer ubiquitously built into smartphones. Specifically, SmartJump collects sensing data from the accelerometer and magnetometer, and processes these data through coordinate system translation and data smoothing filter. Then, jump features are extracted based on the smoothed z-axis acceleration data using the peak and valley detection algorithm and then are matched with the concluded three features from the analysis of physical jumps using a finite state machine for jump detection and count. We implement SmartJump on Samsung S6 Edge smartphones and recruit six subjects for data collection. We evaluate the accuracy of SmartJump in terms of five-fold cross-validation test, self-test, and leave-one-out cross-validation test, and the experimental results indicate that SmartJump achieves an average of 96.4 % recall, 97.2 % precision, and 96.8 % F1 score in five different scenarios.

AB Recent advances in deep learning have achieved state-of-the-art results for object detection by replacing the traditional detection methodologies with deep convolutional neural network architectures. A contemporary technique that is shown to further improve the performance of these models on tasks ranging from optical character recognition and neural machine translation to object detection is based on incorporating an attention mechanism within the models. The idea behind the attention mechanism and its variations was to improve the information quality extracted for any confronted task by focusing on the most relevant parts of the input. In this paper we propose two novel deep neural architectures for object recognition that incorporate the idea of the attention mechanism in the well-known faster-RCNN object detector. The objective is to develop attention mechanisms that can be used for small objects detection as they appear when using Drones for covering sport events like bicycle races, football matches and rowing races. The proposed approaches include a class agnostic method that applies the same predetermined context for every class, and a class specific method which learns to include context that maximizes the class's precision individually for each class. The proposed methods are evaluated in the VOC2007 dataset, improving the performance of the baseline faster-RCNN architecture.

AB Word sense disambiguation (WSD) can be defined as a task that focuses on estimating the right sense of a word in its context. It is important as a preprocessing step in information extraction, machine translation, question answering and many other natural language processing tasks. Ambiguity in Word Sense arises when a particular word has more than one possible sense. Finding the correct sense requires thorough knowledge regarding words. This information of words is often derived from the sources such as words appearing in the context of the target word, part of speech information of the words in the neighbour, syntactical relations and local collocations. Our main aim in this paper is to develop an automatic system for WSD in Assamese using a Naive Bayes classifier. This is the first work to the best of our knowledge on developing an automatic WSD system for Assamese language. Assamese, the main language of most of the people in North-Eastern part of India is a morphologically very rich language. In Assamese WSD is a challenging task because a word can behave differently when combined with a suffix or a sequence of suffixes to have an entirely different sense. WSD often makes use of lexical resources such as WordNet, lexicon, annotated or unannotated corpora etc for its process of disambiguation.

TI Distribution of dwell times of a ribosome: effects of infidelity,
   kinetic proofreading and ribosome crowding
SO PHYSICAL BIOLOGY
AB Ribosome is a molecular machine that polymerizes a protein where the sequence of the amino acid residues, the monomers of the protein, is dictated by the sequence of codons (triplets of nucleotides) on a messenger RNA (mRNA) that serves as the template. The ribosome is a molecular motor that utilizes the template mRNA strand also as the track. Thus, in each step the ribosome moves forward by one codon and, simultaneously, elongates the protein by one amino acid. We present a theoretical model that captures most of the main steps in the mechanochemical cycle of a ribosome. The stochastic movement of the ribosome consists of an alternating sequence of pause and translocation; the sum of the durations of a pause and the following translocation is the time of dwell of the ribosome at the corresponding codon. We derive the analytical expression for the distribution of the dwell times of a ribosome in our model. Wherever experimental data are available, our theoretical predictions are consistent with those results. We suggest appropriate experiments to test the new predictions of our model, particularly the effects of the quality control mechanism of the ribosome and that of their crowding on the mRNA track.

TI Influence of Rocking Motion on Vibratory Roller-Based Measurement of
   Soil Stiffness
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MECHANICS
AB Experimental data have shown that vibratory roller compactors often exhibit rotational kinematics in addition to translation during operation. This rotation is not considered in roller-integrated measurement systems that estimate soil stiffness based on drum vibration. To model and explore the effect of rotation, a lumped parameter roller/soil model was developed. The machine parameters for this model were tuned from suspended drum testing that isolated the drum from the ground. The model was then verified using field data collected over a range of excitation frequencies on spatially homogenous soil, and over transversely heterogeneous soil using one excitation frequency. Rotational motion was found to significantly influence roller-integrated measurement of soil stiffness based on single position drum vibration data. Rotational motion causes single position measurement system results to be nonunique and to vary depending on the direction of roller travel. Using the model, various alternative measurement schemes were investigated. The directional dependence was eliminated by deriving a measurement at the drum's center of gravity, and dual-sided measurement is proposed to gain a measure of heterogeneity. A more theoretical approach was also created wherein the contact force between the drum and soil are measured rather then being calculated.

AB Named Entity Recognition (NER) on low-resource languages remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of labeled data. With the advent of large-scale neural machine translation systems and multilingual pre-training models, it has become possible to transfer knowledge from the resource-rich source language side (e.g., English) to the resource-poor target language side. In this paper, we focus on scenarios where the source language side labeled data is also insufficient. We found that transfer entity boundary information alone cross the languages is much easier than transfer the whole labeled information, which includes not only the entity boundary but also the entity category. Therefore, we propose a simple but effective cross-lingual NER method called NEB-Filter for the first time. NEB-Filter trains a filter based on the boundaries of named entities, which can greatly improve the precision of the cross-lingual NER model, but only brings a small reduction in recall. Moreover, our method has been shown to benefit from knowledge distillation (KD), leading to greater improvements on F1 score. A series of experiments have shown encouraging results for our approach in low-resource cross-lingual NER.

TI Unsupervised deep domain adaptation framework in remote acoustic time
   parametric imaging
SO IET SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB Intelligent waveform analysis surveying geological structures is a challenging task in remote acoustic measurement for formation detection, which has two problems: (1) time parametric imaging is disturbed by noisy environments and (2) manually annotated data for machine learning are unattainable. These restrict the deployment of advanced parameter extraction methods in imaging instruments. As a potential theory, domain adaptation makes the intelligent prediction implementable in the above situations. Hence, to counter high precision travel time extraction for acoustic imaging, a deep adaptation-picking network (DAPN) framework is proposed, which consists of three modules: signal-to-signal generator, domain adaptation encoder, and feature recognition decoder. The translation module preprocesses the different datasets to improve the training accuracy and confuses the distribution between source and target domains based on the adversarial network. The core convolution neural network achieves travel time measurement, where the backbone extracts content features with modified maximum mean discrepancy embedding. Meanwhile, the decoding structure preserves the signal features in the training process. The effectiveness and feasibility of DAPN are verified by experimental results, suggesting that DAPN accurately extracts time parameters. Compared with traditional parametric imaging schemes, the proposed method has the advantages of high accuracy and anti-noise ability.

TI Fast and Precise Positioning in PCBs Using Deep Neural Network
   Regression
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT
AB Precision positioning is a very important task for automatic assembly and inspection in the manufacturing process. The conventional image processing for image alignment has relied on template matching, which is computationally intensive for objects in arbitrary locations and orientations. In this article, we propose the deep neural network regressors for fast and accurate image alignment. They are especially applied to the positioning of printed circuit boards (PCBs). The simple multilayer perceptron (MLP), the convolutional neural network (CNN), and the CNN models incorporated with support vector regression (SVR) are proposed and evaluated for the PCB positioning task. The proposed deep neural networks require only one single reference sample with a manually marked template window. All training images and the ground-truth geometric parameters are automatically generated for the model training. The effect of illumination changes and the strategies to cope with lighting variations are analyzed and proposed for robust positioning. Experimental results indicate that the proposed regressors can achieve a subpixel accuracy in translation and yield a rotation error less than 1 degrees with 1-ms evaluation time for PCB positioning.

AB Lattice-based cryptography has been growing in demand due to their quantum attack resiliency. Polynomial multiplication is a major computational bottleneck of lattice cryptosystems. To address the challenge, lattice-based cryptosystems use the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT). Although NTT reduces complexity, it is still a well-known computational bottleneck. At the same time, NTT arithmetic needs vary for different algorithms, motivating flexible solutions. Although there are prior hardware and software NTT designs, they do not simultaneously offer flexibility and efficiency. This work provides an efficient and flexible NTT solution through domain-specific architectural support on RISC-V. Rather than using instruction-set extensions with compiler modifications or loosely coupling a RISC-V core with an NTT co-processor, our proposal uses application-specific dynamic instruction scheduling, memory dependence prediction, and datapath optimizations. This allows achieving a direct translation of C code to optimized NTT executions. We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by implementing the NTT used in several lattice-based cryptography protocols: NewHope, qTESLA, CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, and Falcon. The results on the FPGA technology show that the proposed design is respectively 6x, 40x, and 3x more efficient than the baseline solution, Berkeley Out-of-Order Machine, and a prior HW/SW co-design, while providing the needed flexibility.

AB Low accuracy, poor real-time performance, and low efficiency of manual textitle defect detection are problems lying in textile manufacturing industry, an integrated fabric defect detection algorithm based on deep convolutional neural networks was proposed. First of all, considering that the fabric defect sample set rarely overfits, the original sample is preprocessed, and the data is enhanced by random translation, rotation and noise addition operations, and divided into a training set and a validation set at a ratio of 10: 1. Then train the trained model on fabric defect samples, retaining the parameters of all convolutional layers of the pre-trained model. Secondly, because the amount of parameters of the fully connected layer affects the overall training efficiency, it is proposed to replace the fully connected layer with a pooling operation that combines the global maximum pooling layer and the global average pooling layer. Finally, support vector machines (SVM) and SoftMAX multi-class classifier to recognize it. and finally integrate the two classification results as the final recognition result. The experimental results show that the algorithm in this paper can effectively improve the accuracy of fabric defect recognition, and the accuracy rate can reach 93.7%.

TI Using google translate in EFL drafts: a preliminary investigation
SO COMPUTER ASSISTED LANGUAGE LEARNING
AB This study investigates the impact on extemporaneous English-language first drafts by using Google Translate (GT) in three different tasks assigned to Chinese sophomore, junior, and senior students of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) majoring in English. Students wrote first in Chinese (Step 1), then drafted corresponding texts in English (Step 2), and translated the Chinese into English using the 2016 GT version (Step 3), and finally compared their self-written (SW) English texts drafted in Step 2 and their GT English texts translated from the Chinese texts in Step 3. Both English drafts were analyzed using two types of online computational assessments to compare and evaluate grammatical components of writing quality and lexical features. Results indicate that the GT English texts presented a number of components of significantly higher writing quality than those of students' SW texts, by having more words, fewer mistakes in spelling and grammar, and fewer errors per words. In addition, there were more advanced-level words in the students' GT texts than in their SW ones. A follow-up questionnaire survey indicated that EFL students found satisfaction with using Google Translate in their English writing, especially in finding vocabulary items and enhancing the completion of English writing.

TI Calculation of Semantic Distances Between Words: From Synonymy to
   Antonymy
SO JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE LINGUISTICS
AB A new approach to numerically measure the semantic distances between lexical units (words and collocations) based on the geometric analogies and analytical calculation, is put forward. Having considered the cases of equal and different weights of semes, we obtained exact algebraic formulas describing different levels of the meanings proximity, ranging from absolute synonymy to full antonymy. It was emphasized that absolute synonymy arises when the compared units contain equal numbers of semes that fully coincide and have equal weights in the corresponding pairs. Calculation of the semes weights helps to locate the unit more precisely on the semantic sphere. It was shown that the level of synonymy and antonymy decreases if different semes are accentuated, while the semantic distance between the units without identical semes cannot be influenced by seme boosting. It was observed that depending on the context, a word may wander over this sphere, thus modifying its lexical semantic relations with other units. As the proposed approach contributes to formalization of the units comparison procedure, it is advisable for incorporation into relevant automatic tools, particularly into WordNet and FrameNet. The obtained results may be useful for various linguistic and associated studies including automatic text analysis and processing, computer lexicography, information search and retrieval, machine translation and other NLP applications that are related to the artificial intelligence problem.

TI iLoc-lncRNA: predict the subcellular location of lncRNAs by
   incorporating octamer composition into general PseKNC
SO BIOINFORMATICS
AB Motivation: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of RNA molecules with more than 200 nucleotides. They have important functions in cell development and metabolism, such as genetic markers, genome rearrangements, chromatin modifications, cell cycle regulation, transcription and translation. Their functions are generally closely related to their localization in the cell. Therefore, knowledge about their subcellular locations can provide very useful clues or preliminary insight into their biological functions. Although biochemical experiments could determine the localization of lncRNAs in a cell, they are both time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop bioinformatics tools for fast and effective identification of their subcellular locations.
   Results: We developed a sequence-based bioinformatics tool called 'iLoc-lncRNA' to predict the subcellular locations of LncRNAs by incorporating the 8-tuple nucleotide features into the general PseKNC (Pseudo K-tuple Nucleotide Composition) via the binomial distribution approach. Rigorous jackknife tests have shown that the overall accuracy achieved by the new predictor on a stringent benchmark dataset is 86.72%, which is over 20% higher than that by the existing state-of-the-art predictor evaluated on the same tests.

AB A new method for Automatic Radar Targets Recognition is presented based on Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR). In this work, the first step is to construct ISAR images via a Non uniformly Sampled Bivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition Time-Frequency Distribution (NSBEMD-TED) method. Indeed, this Time-Frequency representation is well suited for non-stationary signals analysis and provides high resolution with good accuracy. The obtained ISAR images is used to provide the evolution of two-dimensional spatial distribution of a moving target and, therefore, its are suitable to be used for radar target recognition tasks. In second step, a feature vectors are extracted from each ISAR images in order to describe the discriminative informations about a target. In the features extraction step, we computed several rings of polar space applied on ISAR image. Then, these rings is projected on 1-D vector. To ensure translation invariance of the obtained projected 1-D vector, a Fourier Descriptors are computed. In third step of this work, the recognition task is achieved using k-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Fuzzy k-NN, Neural network and Bayesian classifiers. To validate our approach, simulation results are presented on a set of several targets constituted by ideal point scatterers models.

TI Learning Crowdsourced User Preferences for Visual Summarization of Image
   Collections
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA
AB In this paper we propose a novel approach to selecting images suitable for inclusion in the visual summaries. The approach is grounded in insights about how people summarize image collections. We utilize the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing platform to obtain a large number of manually created visual summaries as well as information about criteria for image inclusion in the summary. Based on these large-scale user tests, we propose an automatic image selection approach, which jointly utilizes the analysis of image content, context, popularity, visual aesthetic appeal as well as the sentiment derived from the comments posted on the images. In our approach we do not describe images based on their properties only, but also in the context of semantically related images, which improves robustness and effectively enables propagation of sentiment, aesthetic appeal as well as various inherent attributes associated with a particular group of images. We discuss the phenomenon of a low inter-user agreement, which makes an automatic evaluation of visual summaries a challenging task and propose a solution inspired by the text summarization and machine translation communities. The experiments performed on a collection of geo-referenced Flickr images demonstrate the effectiveness of our image selection approach.

AB We propose a top-down fully automatic 3D vertebra segmentation algorithm using global shape-related as well as local appearance-related prior information. The former is brought into the system by a global statistical shape model built from annotated training data, i.e., annotated CT volumes. The latter is handled by a machine learning-based component, i.e., a boundary detector, providing a strong discriminative model for vertebra surface appearance by making use of local context-encoding features. This boundary detector, which is essentially a probabilistic boosting-tree classifier, is also learnt from annotated training data. Contextual information is taken into account by representing vertebra surface candidate voxels with high-dimensional vectors of 3D steerable features derived from the observed volume intensities. Our system does not only consider the body of the individual vertebrae but also the spinal processes. Before segmentation, the image parts depicting individual vertebrae are spatially normalized with respect to their bounding box information in terms of translation, orientation, and scale leading to more accurate results. We evaluate segmentation accuracy on 7 CT volumes each depicting 22 vertebrae. The results indicate a symmetric point-to-mesh surface error of 1.37 +/- 0.37 mm, which matches the current state-of-the-art.

SO COMMUNICATION METHODS AND MEASURES
AB This paper presents a critical discussion of the processing, reliability and implications of free big data repositories. We argue that big data is not only the starting point of scientific analyses but also the outcome of a long string of invisible or semi-visible tasks, often masked by the fetish of size that supposedly lends validity to big data. We unpack these notions by illustrating the process of extracting protest event data from the Global Database of Events, Language and Tone (GDELT) in six European countries over a period of seven years. To stand up to rigorous scientific scrutiny, we collected additional data by computational means and undertook large-scale neural-network translation tasks, dictionary-based content analyses, machine-learning classification tasks, and human coding. In a documentation and critical discussion of this process, we render visible opaque procedures that inevitably shape any dataset and show how this type of freely available datasets require significant additional resources of knowledge, labor, money, and computational power. We conclude that while these processes can ultimately yield more valid datasets, the supposedly free and ready-to-use big news data repositories should not be taken at face value.

TI Dynamically Relative Position Encoding-Based Transformer for Automatic
   Code Edit
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY
AB Adapting Deep Learning (DL) techniques to automate non-trivial coding activities, such as code documentation and defect detection, has been intensively studied recently. Learning to predict code changes is one of the popular and essential investigations. Prior studies have shown that DL techniques such as Neural Machine Translation (NMT) can benefit meaningful code changes, including bug fixing and code refactoring. However, NMT models may encounter bottleneck when modeling long sequences, thus are limited in accurately predicting code changes. In this work, we design a Transformer-based approach, considering that Transformer has proven effective in capturing long-term dependencies. Specifically, we propose a novel model named DTrans. For better incorporating the local structure of code, i.e., statement-level information in this paper, DTrans is designed with dynamically relative position encoding in the multi-head attention of Transformer. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DTrans can more accurately generate patches than the state-of-the-art methods, increasing the performance by at least 5.45\%-46.57\% in terms of the exact match metric on different datasets. Moreover, DTrans can locate the lines to change with 1.75\%-24.21\% higher accuracy than the existing methods.

TI AAN plus : Generalized Average Attention Network for Accelerating Neural
   Transformer
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
AB Transformer benefits from the high parallelization of attention networks in fast training, but it still suffers from slow decoding partially due to the linear dependency O(m) of the decoder self-attention on previous target words at inference. In this paper, we propose a generalized average attention network (AAN+) aiming at speeding up decoding by reducing the dependency from O(m) to O(1). We find that the learned self-attention weights in the decoder follow some patterns which can be approximated via a dynamic structure. Based on this insight, we develop AAN+, extending our previously proposed average attention (Zhang et al., 2018a, AAN) to support more general position-and content-based attention patterns. AAN+ only requires to maintain a small constant number of hidden states during decoding, ensuring its O(1) dependency. We apply AAN+ as a drop-in replacement of the decoder self -attention and conduct experiments on machine translation (with diverse language pairs), table-to-text generation and document summarization. With masking tricks and dynamic programming, AAN+ enables Transformer to decode sentences around 20% faster without largely compromising in the training speed and the generation performance. Our results further reveal the importance of the localness (neighboring words) in AAN+ and its capability in modeling long-range dependency.

State-of-the-art decentralized optimizers mitigate the problem, but require more iterations to achieve the same accuracy as their globally-communicating counterparts. We present Wait-Avoiding Group Model Averaging (WAGMA) SGD, a wait-avoiding stochastic optimizer that reduces global communication via subgroup weight exchange. The key insight is a combination of algorithmic changes to the averaging scheme and the use of a group allreduce operation. We prove the convergence of WAGMA-SGD, and empirically show that it retains convergence rates similar to Allreduce-SGD. For evaluation, we train ResNet-50 on ImageNet; Transformer for machine translation; and deep reinforcement learning for navigation at scale. Compared with state-of-the-art decentralized SGD variants, WAGMA-SGD significantly improves training throughput (e.g., 2.1x on 1,024 GPUs for reinforcement learning), and achieves the fastest time-to-solution (e.g., the highest score using the shortest training time for Transformer).

TI Plant leaf classification and retrieval using multi-scale shape
   descriptor
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING-JOE
AB Plant leaf classification is a significant and challenging research problem in computer vision area. In this study, an original multi-scale shape descriptor is presented to perform leaf classification and retrieval. Firstly, a novel iterative rule is proposed as scales generation method, which is parameter free. Secondly, leaf contour points are represented by angle information which is calculated using their neighbour points under each scale. The angle information representation is invariant to image rotation, translation and scaling. More importantly, it can describe leaf in a hierarchical way by capturing leaf features from global to local variations. Then Fast Fourier Transform operation is applied to make the representation more compact and independent from starting point. Subsequently, for leaf retrieval the dissimilarity of each pair of leaf under each scale is computed using city block metric. And support vector machine is used as classifier for leaf classification. Finally, experiments and comparisons with multiple state-of-the-art approaches are performed. The classification accuracy was 96.85% and 93.56% respectively on Swedish and Flavia leaf datasets. The mean average precision score was 66.42%, 76.69% and 44.14% respectively on Flavia, Swedish and MEW2012 leaf datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed method has excellent performance.

AB Reinforcement Learning algorithms and Neural Networks have diverse applications in many domains, e.g., stock market prediction, facial recognition and automatic machine translation. The concept of modeling the portfolio management through a reinforcement learning formulation is novel, and the Deep Q-Network has been successfully applied to portfolio management recently. However, the model does not take into account of commission fee for transaction. This paper introduces a framework, based on the hierarchical Deep Q-Network, that addresses the issue of zero commission fee by reducing the number of assets assigned to each Deep Q-Network and dividing the total portfolio value into smaller parts. Furthermore, this framework is flexible enough to handle an arbitrary number of assets. In our experiments, the time series of four stocks for three different time periods are used to assess the efficacy of our model. It is found that our hierarchical Deep Q-Network based strategy outperforms ten other strategies, including nine traditional strategies and one reinforcement learning strategy, in profitability as measured by the Cumulative Rate of Return. Moreover, the Sharpe ratio and Max Drawdown metrics both demonstrate that the risk of policy associated with hierarchical Deep Q-Network is the lowest among all ten strategies.

AB LSTM (long short-term memory) is a powerful deep learning technique that has been widely used in many real-world data-mining applications such as language modeling and machine translation. In this paper we aim to minimize the latency of LSTM inference on cloud systems without losing accuracy. If an LSTM model does not fit in cache, the latency due to data movement will likely be greater than that due to computation. In this case we reduce model parameters. If, as in most applications we consider, the LSTM models are able to fit the cache of cloud server processors, we focus on reducing the number of floating point operations, which has a corresponding linear impact on the latency of the inference calculation. Thus, in our system, we dynamically reduce model parameters or flops depending on which most impacts latency. Our inference system is based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD). We evaluate our system based on models from a series of real-world applications like language modeling, computer vision, question answering, and sentiment analysis. Users of our system can use either pre-trained models or start from scratch. Our system achieves 15x average speedup for six real-world applications without losing accuracy in inference.

AB We present a new approach to evaluate computational models for the task of text understanding by the means of out-of-context error detection. Through the novel design of our automated modification process, existing large-scale data sources can be adopted for a vast number of text understanding tasks. The data is thereby altered on a semantic level, allowing models to be tested against a challenging set of modified text passages that require to comprise a broader narrative discourse.
   Our newly introduced task targets actual real-world problems of transcription and translation systems by inserting authentic out-of-context errors. The automated modification process is applied to the 2016 TEDTalk corpus. Entirely automating the process allows the adoption of complete datasets at low cost, facilitating supervised learning procedures and deeper networks to be trained and tested. To evaluate the quality of the modification algorithm a language model and a supervised binary classification model are trained and tested on the altered dataset. A human baseline evaluation is examined to compare the results with human performance. The outcome of the evaluation task indicates the difficulty to detect semantic errors for machine-learning algorithms and humans, showing that the errors cannot be identified when limited to a single sentence.

   Afrikaans
SO SOUTHERN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS AND APPLIED LANGUAGE STUDIES
AB Named entity recognition is a core technology, widely used in applications such as question-and-answer systems, automated text summarisation systems, information retrieval, machine translation, bioinformatics and search engines. Owing to the resources needed, the labour-intensive methods required and the difficulty of developing a named entity recogniser (NER), the focus has mainly been on developing NERs for resource-rich languages such as Dutch, Swedish and Spanish, while neglecting the development for related resource-scarce languages such as Afrikaans, Norwegian and Portuguese. The lack of NERs limits access to information and also lowers the general development thrust of resources for such languages. This article presents a time- and cost-efficient method based on the principle of technology recycling (or technology transfer) that can be used to develop NERs for suitable resource-scarce languages; its application to Afrikaans is used here as a case study. Six experiments are described, which differ only by the pre-processing methods (A2DC and gazetteers) and the language of the input data used. The final experiment yielded an f-score of 0.72 for the identification and an f-score of 0.65 for the classification of named entities. This study provides evidence for the usefulness of technology recycling in developing an NER for Afrikaans and potentially for other languages that have so far been neglected.

TI Multiparametric fit method in reconstruction of Fletcher-Suit-Delclos
   applicator
SO MEDICAL PHYSICS
AB In our institution we have introduced the variable angle reconstruction method with a nonisocentric C-arm as brachytherapy localizer in gynecological treatments. The main advantage of this method is that on the posterior oblique images the ovoids of the Fletcher-Suit-Delclos (FSD) applicator are clearly separated. The main problem with the nonisocentric machine is that the magnification factor is not known exactly and varies with the C-arm angle. For generation of treatment plans with a commercial brachytherapy planning system the magnification factors of the reconstruction images have to be determined previously. We present a multiparametric fit method (MPF) that is suitable for reconstruction of FSD applicators and that utilizes pairs of posterior-anterior and lateral or preferably posterior oblique reconstruction images obtained by a C-arm. The MPF reconstruction relies on the known geometry of the tandem and the ovoid. The actual FSD insertion is reconstructed by adaptation of the geometry of tandem and ovoid by translations and rotations. The fixation mechanism limits the possible excursions of the FSD applicator's parts. The limited freedom of excursions and the determination of the magnification factors are also incorporated.

TI RNA Polymerases I and III in development and disease
SO SEMINARS IN CELL & DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Ribosomes are macromolecular machines that are globally required for the translation of all proteins in all cells. Ribosome biogenesis, which is essential for cell growth, proliferation and survival, commences with transcription of a variety of RNAs by RNA Polymerases I and III. RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) transcribes ribosomal RNA (rRNA), while RNA Polymerase III (Pol III) transcribes 5S ribosomal RNA and transfer RNAs (tRNA) in addition to a wide variety of small non-coding RNAs. Interestingly, despite their global importance, disruptions in Pol I and Pol III function result in tissue-specific developmental disorders, with craniofacial anomalies and leukodystrophy/neurodegenerative disease being among the most prevalent. Furthermore, pathogenic variants in genes encoding subunits shared between Pol I and Pol III give rise to distinct syndromes depending on whether Pol I or Pol III function is disrupted. In this review, we discuss the global roles of Pol I and III transcription, the consequences of disruptions in Pol I and III transcription, disorders arising from pathogenic variants in Pol I and Pol III subunits, and mechanisms underpinning their tissue-specific phenotypes.

AB Language identification is one of the fundamental tasks in natural language processing that is a prerequisite to data processing and numerous applications. Low-resourced languages with similar typologies are generally confused with each other in real-world applications such as machine translation, affecting the user's experience. In this work, we present a languageidentification dataset for five typologically and phylogenetically related low-resourced East African languages that use the Ge'ez script as a writing system; namely Amharic, Blin, Ge'ez, Tigre, and Tigrinya. The dataset is built automatically from selected data sources, but we also performed a manual evaluation to assess its quality. Our approach to constructing the dataset is cost-effective and applicable to other low-resource languages. We integrated the dataset into an existing language-identification tool and also fine-tuned several Transformer based language models, achieving very strong results in all cases. While the task of language identification is easy for the informed person, such datasets can make a difference in real-world deployments and also serve as part of a benchmark for language understanding in the target languages. The data and models are made available at https://github.com/fgaim/geezswitch.

TI Sentence Similarity Algorithm Based on Fused Bi-Channel Dependency
   Matching Feature
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Many tasks of natural language processing such as information retrieval, intelligent question answering, and machine translation require the calculation of sentence similarity. The traditional calculation methods used in the past could not solve semantic understanding problems well. First, the model structure based on Siamese lack of interaction between sentences; second, it has matching problem which contains lacking position information and only using partial matching factor based on the matching model. In this paper, a combination of word and word's dependence is proposed to calculate the sentence similarity. This combination can extract the word features and word's dependency features. To extract more matching features, a bidirectional multi-interaction matching sequence model is proposed by using word2vec and dependency2vec. This model obtains matching features by convolving and pooling the word-granularity (word vector, dependency vector) interaction sequences in two directions. Next, the model aggregates the bi-direction matching features. The paper evaluates the model on two tasks: paraphrase identification and natural language inference. The experimental results show that the combination of word and word's dependence can enhance the ability of extracting matching features between two sentences. The results also show that the model with dependency can achieve higher accuracy than these models without using dependency.

TI Double attention recurrent convolution neural network for answer
   selection
SO ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
AB Answer selection is one of the key steps in many question answering (QA) applications. In this paper, a new deep model with two kinds of attention is proposed for answer selection: the double attention recurrent convolution neural network (DARCNN). Double attention means self-attention and cross-attention. The design inspiration of this model came from the transformer in the domain of machine translation. Self-attention can directly calculate dependencies between words regardless of the distance. However, self-attention ignores the distinction between its surrounding words and other words. Thus, we design a decay self-attention that prioritizes local words in a sentence. In addition, cross-attention is established to achieve interaction between question and candidate answer. With the outputs of self-attention and decay self-attention, we can get two kinds of interactive information via cross-attention. Finally, using the feature vectors of the question and answer, elementwise multiplication is used to combine with them and multilayer perceptron is used to predict the matching score. Experimental results on four QA datasets containing Chinese and English show that DARCNN performs better than other answer selection models, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of self-attention, decay self-attention and cross-attention in answer selection tasks.

TI What scans we will read: imaging instrumentation trends in clinical
   oncology
SO CANCER IMAGING
AB Oncological diseases account for a significant portion of the burden on public healthcare systems with associated costs driven primarily by complex and long-lasting therapies. Through the visualization of patient-specific morphology and functional-molecular pathways, cancerous tissue can be detected and characterized non-invasively, so as to provide referring oncologists with essential information to support therapy management decisions. Following the onset of stand-alone anatomical and functional imaging, we witness a push towards integrating molecular image information through various methods, including anato-metabolic imaging (e.g., PET/CT), advanced MRI, optical or ultrasound imaging. This perspective paper highlights a number of key technological and methodological advances in imaging instrumentation related to anatomical, functional, molecular medicine and hybrid imaging, that is understood as the hardware-based combination of complementary anatomical and molecular imaging. These include novel detector technologies for ionizing radiation used in CT and nuclear medicine imaging, and novel system developments in MRI and optical as well as opto-acoustic imaging. We will also highlight new data processing methods for improved non-invasive tissue characterization. Following a general introduction to the role of imaging in oncology patient management we introduce imaging methods with well-defined clinical applications and potential for clinical translation. For each modality, we report first on thestatus quoand, then point to perceived technological and methodological advances in a subsequentstatus gosection. Considering the breadth and dynamics of these developments, this perspective ends with a critical reflection on where the authors, with the majority of them being imaging experts with a background in physics and engineering, believe imaging methods will be in a few years from now. Overall, methodological and technological medical imaging advances are geared towards increased image contrast, the derivation of reproducible quantitative parameters, an increase in volume sensitivity and a reduction in overall examination time. To ensure full translation to the clinic, this progress in technologies and instrumentation is complemented by advances in relevant acquisition and image-processing protocols and improved data analysis. To this end, we should accept diagnostic images as "data", and - through the wider adoption of advanced analysis, including machine learning approaches and a "big data" concept - move to the next stage of non-invasive tumour phenotyping. The scans we will be reading in 10 years from now will likely be composed of highly diverse multi-dimensional data from multiple sources, which mandate the use of advanced and interactive visualization and analysis platforms powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) for real-time data handling by cross-specialty clinical experts with a domain knowledge that will need to go beyond that of plain imaging.

AB Conventional automatic speech recognition systems do not produce punctuation marks which are important for the readability of the speech recognition results. They are also needed for subsequent natural language processing tasks such as machine translation. There have been a lot of works on punctuation prediction models that insert punctuation marks into speech recognition results as post-processing. However, these studies do not utilize acoustic information for punctuation prediction and are directly affected by speech recognition errors. In this study, we propose an end-to-end model that takes speech as input and outputs punctuated texts. This model is expected to predict punctuation robustly against speech recognition errors while using acoustic information. We also propose to incorporate an auxiliary loss to train the model using the output of the intermediate layer and unpunctuated texts. Through experiments, we compare the performance of the proposed model to that of a cascaded system. The proposed model achieves higher punctuation prediction accuracy than the cascaded system without sacrificing the speech recognition error rate. It is also demonstrated that the multi-task learning using the intermediate output against the unpunctuated text is effective. Moreover, the proposed model has only about 1/7th of the parameters compared to the cascaded system.

AB While mobile applications (i.e., apps) are becoming capable of handling various needs from users, their increasing access to sensitive data raises privacy concerns. To inform such sensitive behaviors to users, existing techniques propose to automatically identify explanatory sentences from app descriptions; however, many sensitive behaviors are not explained in the corresponding app descriptions. There also exist general techniques that translate code to sentences. However, these techniques lack the vocabulary to explain the uses of sensitive data and fail to consider the context (i.e., the app functionalities) of the sensitive behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose DESCRIBECTX, a context-aware description synthesis approach that trains a neural machine translation model using a large set of popular apps, and generates app-specific descriptions for sensitive behaviors. Specifically, DESCRIBECTX encodes three heterogeneous sources as input, i.e., vocabularies provided by privacy policies, behavior summary provided by the call graphs in code, and contextual information provided by GUI texts. Our evaluations on 1,262 Android apps show that, compared with existing baselines, DESCRIBECTX produces more accurate descriptions (24.96 BLEU) and achieves higher user ratings with respect to the reference sentences manually identified in the app descriptions.

Available (terminological) resources will be presented-paper dictionaries and digital resources related to the raw material domain, as well as general lexica morphological dictionaries. Resource preparation started with dictionary (retro)digitisation and corpora enlargement, followed by adding new Serbian terms to general lexica dictionaries, as well as adding bilingual terms. Dictionary development is relying on corpus analysis, details of which are also presented. Usage examples, collocations and concordances play an important role in raw material terminology, and have also been included in this research. Some important related issues discussed are collocation extraction methods, the use of domain labels, lexical and semantic relations, definitions and subentries.

AB This paper presents a self-supervised learning method for pointer-generator networks to improve spoken-text normalization. Spoken-text normalization that converts spoken-style text into style normalized text is becoming an important technology for improving subsequent processing such as machine translation and summarization. The most successful spoken-text normalization method to date is sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) mapping using pointer-generator networks that possess a copy mechanism from an input sequence. However, these models require a large amount of paired data of spoken-style text and style normalized text, and it is difficult to prepare such a volume of data. In order to construct spoken-text normalization model from the limited paired data, we focus on self-supervised learning which can utilize unpaired text data to improve seq2seq models. Unfortunately, conventional self-supervised learning methods do not assume that pointer-generator networks are utilized. Therefore, we propose a novel self-supervised learning method, MAsked Pointer-Generator Network (MAPGN). The proposed method can effectively pre-train the pointer-generator network by learning to fill masked tokens using the copy mechanism. Our experiments demonstrate that MAPGN is more effective for pointer-generator networks than the conventional self-supervised learning methods in two spoken-text normalization tasks.

AB Transformer models have revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and they achieve state-of-the-art performance in applications like machine translation, question answering, regression, and summarization. However, training Transformers is challenging because of their large memory and compute requirements. The literature contains several approaches to parallelize training, like layer parallelism and pipeline parallelism, but they are optimized to benefit outof-core models and they don't exploit the inherent parallelism in Transformer models. Other work uses model parallelism to achieve weak scaling by increasing the model size. In this paper, we propose sub-graph parallelism that provides a significant performance improvement over pure data parallelism with a fixed number of resources, and as an additional technique for strong- and weak-scaling without increasing model capacity. Our technique accelerates the training of Transformer models and we generalize the concept to any neural network with multiple branches. We optimize the communication for sub-graph parallelism and combine it with data parallelism to scale performance up to 1024 GPUs. To decrease communication overheads, we propose a topology-aware scheme that limits inter-node communication. Finally, we empirically compare sub-graph parallelism with pure data parallelism and demonstrate its performance benefits in end-to-end training.

AB Recent progress in task-oriented neural dialogue systems is largely focused on a handful of languages, as annotation of training data is tedious and expensive. Machine translation has been used to make systems multilingual, but this can introduce a pipeline of errors. Another promising solution is using cross-lingual transfer learning through pre-trained multilingual models. Existing methods train multilingual models with additional code-mixed task data or refine the cross-lingual representations through parallel ontologies. In this work, we enhance the transfer learning process by intermediate fine-tuning of pre-trained multilingual models, where the multilingual models are fine-tuned with different but related data and/or tasks. Specifically, we use parallel and conversational movie subtitles datasets to design cross-lingual intermediate tasks suitable for downstream dialogue tasks. We use only 200K lines of parallel data for intermediate fine-tuning which is already available for 1782 language pairs. We test our approach on the cross-lingual dialogue state tracking task for the parallel MultiWoZ (English -> Chinese, Chinese -> English) and Multilingual WoZ (English -> German, English -> Italian) datasets. We achieve impressive improvements (> 20% on joint goal accuracy) on the parallel MultiWoZ dataset and the Multilingual WoZ dataset over the vanilla baseline with only 10% of the target language task data and zero-shot setup respectively.

TI Black-box adversarial sample generation based on differential evolution
SO JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
AB Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are being used in various daily tasks such as object detection, speech processing, and machine translation. However, it is known that DNNs suffer from robustness problems - perturbed inputs called adversarial samples leading to misbehaviors of DNNs. In this paper, we propose a black-box technique called Black-box Momentum Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (BMI-FGSM) to test the robustness of DNN models. The technique does not require any knowledge of the structure or weights of the target DNN. Compared to existing white-box testing techniques that require accessing model internal information such as gradients, our technique approximates gradients through Differential Evolution and uses approximated gradients to construct adversarial samples. Experimental results show that our technique can achieve 100% success in generating adversarial samples to trigger misclassification, and over 95% success in generating samples to trigger misclassification to a specific target output label. It also demonstrates better perturbation distance and better transferability. Compared to the state-of-the-art black-box technique, our technique is more efficient. Furthermore, we conduct testing on the commercial Aliyun API and successfully trigger its misbehavior within a limited number of queries, demonstrating the feasibility of real-world black-box attack.

TI Towards humanex vivoorgan perfusion models to elucidate drug
   pharmacokinetics in health and disease
SO DRUG METABOLISM REVIEWS
AB To predict the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) profile of candidate drugs a variety of preclinical models can be applied. The ADME and toxicological behavior of newly developed drugs are often investigated prior to assessment in humans, which is associated with long time-lines and high costs. Therefore, good predictions of ADME profiles earlier in the drug development process are very valuable. Good prediction of intestinal absorption and renal and biliary excretion remain especially difficult, as there is an interplay of active transport and metabolism involved. To study these processes, including enterohepatic circulation,ex vivotissue models are highly relevant and can be regarded as the bridge betweenin vitroandin vivomodels. In this review the currentin vitro, in vivoand in more detailex vivomodels for studying pharmacokinetics in health and disease are discussed. Additionally, we propose novel models, i.e., perfused whole-organs, which we envision will generate valuable pharmacokinetic information in the future due to improved translation to thein vivosituation. These machine-perfused organ models will be particularly interesting in combination with biomarkers for assessing the functionality of transporter and CYP450 proteins.

TI A depth-based Indian Sign Language recognition using Microsoft Kinect
SO SADHANA-ACADEMY PROCEEDINGS IN ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB Recognition of sign language by a system has become important to bridge the communication gap between the abled and the Hearing and Speech Impaired people. This paper introduces an efficient algorithm for translating the input hand gesture in Indian Sign Language (ISL) into meaningful English text and speech. The system captures hand gestures through Microsoft Kinect (preferred as the system performance is unaffected by the surrounding light conditions and object colour). The dataset used consists of depth and RGB images (taken using Kinect Xbox 360) with 140 unique gestures of the ISL taken from 21 subjects, which includes single-handed signs, double-handed signs and fingerspelling (signs for alphabets and numbers), totaling to 4600 images. To recognize the hand posture, the hand region is accurately segmented and hand features are extracted using Speeded Up Robust Features, Histogram of Oriented Gradients and Local Binary Patterns. The system ensembles the three feature classifiers trained using Support Vector Machine to improve the average recognition accuracy up to 71.85%. The system then translates the sequence of hand gestures recognized into the best approximate meaningful English sentences. We achieved 100% accuracy for the signs representing 9, A, F, G, H, N and P.

AB Deep learning models have achieved great success in many real-world tasks such as image recognition, machine translation, and self-driving cars. A large amount of data are needed to train a model, and in many cases, the training data are private. Publishing or sharing a deep learning model trained on private datasets could pose privacy concerns. We study the model inversion attacks against deep learning models, which attempt to reconstruct the features of training data corresponding to a given class given access to the model. While deep learning with differential privacy is state-of-the-art for training privacy-preserving models, whether they can provide meaningful protection against model inversion attacks remains an open question. In this paper, we first improve the existing model inversion attacks (MIA) to successfully reconstruct training images from neural network based image recognition models. Then, we demonstrate that deep learning with the standard record-level differential privacy does not provide quantifiable protection against MIA. Subsequently, we propose class-level and subclass-level differential privacy and develop algorithms to provide a quantifiable privacy guarantee against MIA. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that our proposed privacy notions and mechanisms can effectively defend against MIA while maintaining model accuracy.

AB Open-domain question answering (OpenQA) aims to answer questions through text retrieval and reading comprehension. Recently, lots of neural network-based models have been proposed and achieved promising results in OpenQA. However, the success of these models relies on a massive volume of training data (usually in English), which is not available in many other languages, especially for those low-resource languages. Therefore, it is essential to investigate cross-lingual OpenQA. In this paper, we construct a novel dataset XQA for cross-lingual OpenQA research. It consists of a training set in English as well as development and test sets in eight other languages. Besides, we provide several baseline systems for cross-lingual OpenQA, including two machine translation-based methods and one zero-shot cross-lingual method (multilingual BERT). Experimental results show that the multilingual BERT model achieves the best results in almost all target languages, while the performance of cross-lingual OpenQA is still much lower than that of English. Our analysis indicates that the performance of cross-lingual OpenQA is related to not only how similar the target language and English are, but also how difficult the question set of the target language is. The XQA dataset is publicly available at http://github.com/thunlp/XQA.

AB Inspired by recent successes in neural machine translation and image caption generation, we present an attention based encoder decoder model (AED) to recognize Vietnamese Handwritten Text. The model composes of three parts: a convolution neural network (CNN) for extracting invariant features, a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network (BLSTM) for encoding extracted features (BLSTM encoder), and a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) with an attention model incorporated for generating output text (LSTM decoder), which are connected from the CNN part to the BLSTM encoder and finally the LSTM decoder. The input of the CNN part is a handwritten text image and the target of the LSTM decoder is the corresponding text of the input image. Our model is trained end-to-end to predict the text from a given input image since all the parts are differential components. In the experiment section, we evaluate our proposed AED model on the VNOnDB-Word database to verify its efficiency. The experiential results show that our model achieves 12.30% of word error rate without using language model. This result is competitive with the handwriting recognition system provided by Google in the Vietnamese Online Handwritten Text Recognition competition.

AB In this digital age, natural language is causing hindrance in the advancement of information technology revolution in India. There is a need to perform Natural Language Processing (NLP) using computer processing, so that computer based systems can be accessible through natural languages like Hindi. Therefore a language translator is very important tool to resolve this problem. One of the key challenges involved in the design of a language translator is Polysemy disambiguation. Polysemy means having two or more meanings to a single word. For language translation operations, it is crucial to find the right meaning of any given word in its context. This is known as Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). Various resources and tools already exist for WSD in English language while regional languages have not been equally explored yet. This project has a user interface where the user enters a meaningful sentence in Hindi with polysemy word. The system identifies the polysemous word/s if any in the sentence and lists one or more meanings associated with the polysemous word. Using existing machine learning techniques the project identifies the right meaning of the polysemous word based on the given context.

AB Many fundamental problems in natural language processing rely on determining what entities appear in a given text. Commonly referenced as entity linking, this step is a fundamental component of many NLP tasks such as text understanding, automatic summarization, semantic search or machine translation. Name ambiguity, word polysemy, context dependencies and a heavy-tailed distribution of entities contribute to the complexity of this problem.
   We here propose a probabilistic approach that makes use of an effective graphical model to perform collective entity disambiguation. Input mentions (i.e., linkable token spans) are disambiguated jointly across an entire document by combining a document-level prior of entity co-occurrences with local information captured from mentions and their surrounding context. The model is based on simple sufficient statistics extracted from data, thus relying on few parameters to be learned.
   Our method does not require extensive feature engineering, nor an expensive training procedure. We use loopy belief propagation to perform approximate inference. The low complexity of our model makes this step sufficiently fast for real-time usage. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach on a wide range of benchmark datasets, showing that it matches, and in many cases outperforms, existing stateof-the-art methods.

AB Nested paging is a hardware solution for alleviating the software memory management overhead imposed by system virtualization. Nested paging complements existing page walk hardware to form a two-dimensional (2D) page walk, which reduces the need for hypervisor intervention in guest page table management. However, the extra dimension also increases the maximum number of architecturally-required page table references.
   This paper presents an in-depth examination of the 2D page table walk overhead and options for decreasing it. These options include using the AMD Opteror(TM) processor's page walk cache to exploit the strong reuse of page entry references. For a mix of server and SPEC(R) benchmarks, the presented results show a 15%-38% improvement in guest performance by extending the existing page walk cache to also store the nested dimension of the 2D page walk. Caching nested page table translations and skipping multiple page entry references produce an additional 3%-7% improvement.
   Much of the remaining 2D page walk overhead is due to low-locality nested page entry references, which result in additional memory hierarchy misses. By using large pages, the hypervisor can eliminate many of these long-latency accesses and further improve the guest performance by 3%-22%.

TI Results of measurements of accelerations of technological devices
   onboard the Foton spacecraft
SO COSMIC RESEARCH
AB This paper generalizes the results of measuring the residual accelerations arising when investigations in space materials science are carried out onboard the unmanned Foton spacecraft. The levels of vibroaccelerations are analyzed in the frequency band of 1-500 Hz for the technological devices UZ01, UZ04, and POLIZON, developed by the Federal Unitary State Enterprise "Barmin Design Bureau of General Machine Building" (V.P. Barmin KBOM). The levels of accelerations are estimated in the frequency band of 0-1 Hz in the zone of technological operations of these facilities. The basic sources of vibroaccelerations acting upon the frames of devices are determined in the capsule zone, where technological processes of producing new materials take place. In the frequency band of 1-500 Hz the vibroaccelerations are shown to be generated by the operation of Foton spacecraft units and a drive of capsule translation during the technological process. On the capsule frame they reach the values of (1-3) x 10(-3)g. The level of linear accelerations in the infralow-frequency band is determined by rotational motions of the Foton spacecraft. It depends on the device location with respect to the spacecraft center of mass and does not exceed (1-7) x 10(-6)g in the steady-state regime in the zone of technological activity.

In many instances, the need is to connect not a single computer but a remote subnetwork and to be able to have not only clients but also servers oil the remote subnetwork (for instance to access files on computers on the remote network from workstations in the university), We present here a solution to meet these needs through a simple dial-up-like connection to which the access provider allocates only a single temporary IP address to a single remote machine, The solution allows remote networks to be started anytime like little bubbles and be integrated dynamically into the big bubble that is the university network. It is based on the use of IPSec, DHCP and address translation. Beside providing confidentiality, this allows allocating dynamically IP addresses in the range of tile university to computers in the remote bubble, and binding them to permanent DNS names in the domain of the university. After configuration, the computers in the remote subnetwork appear as if they were located inside the university. The solution can, of course, be applied to any organization.

TI sORFPred: A Method Based on Comprehensive Features and Ensemble Learning
   to Predict the sORFs in Plant LncRNAs
SO INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCES-COMPUTATIONAL LIFE SCIENCES
AB Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important regulators of biological processes. It has recently been shown that some lncRNAs include small open reading frames (sORFs) that can encode small peptides of no more than 100 amino acids. However, existing methods are commonly applied to human and animal datasets and still suffer from low feature representation capability. Thus, accurate and credible prediction of sORFs with coding ability in plant lncRNAs is imperative. This paper proposes a new method termed sORFPred, in which we design a model named MCSEN by combining multi-scale convolution and Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks to fully mine distinct information embedded in sORFs, integrate and optimize multiple sequence-based and physicochemical feature descriptors, and built a two-layer prediction classifier based on Bayesian optimization algorithm and Extra Trees. sORFPred has been evaluated on sORFs datasets of three species and experimentally validated sORFs dataset. Results indicate that sORFPred outperforms existing methods and achieves 97.28% accuracy, 97.06% precision, 97.52% recall, and 97.29% F1-score on Arabidopsis thaliana, which shows a significant improvement in prediction performance compared to various conventional shallow machine learning and deep learning models.

AB Grammatical error correction (GEC) aims to automatically detect and correct grammatical errors in sentences. With the development of deep learning, neural machine translation-based approach becomes the mainstream approach for this task. Recently, Chinese GEC attracts a certain amount of attention. However, Chinese GEC has two main problems that limit model learning: (1) insufficient data; (2) flexible error forms. In this paper, we attempt to address these limitations by proposing a method called online self-boost learning for Chinese GEC. Online self-boost learning enables the model to generate multiple instances with different errors for model's weaknesses from each original sample within each batch and to learn the new data in time without additional I/O. And taking advantage of the features of the new data, a consistency loss is introduced to drive the model to produce similar distributions for different inputs with the same target. Our method is capable of fully exploiting the potential knowledge of the annotated data. Meanwhile, it allows for the use of unlabeled data to extend to a semi-supervised method. Sufficient experiments and analyses show the effectiveness of our method. Besides, our method achieves a state-of-the-art result on the Chinese benchmark.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS I-REGULAR PAPERS
AB Deep neural network (DNN) has been widely studied due to its high performance and usability for various applications such as image classification, detection, segmentation, translation, and action recognition. Thanks to the universal applications and high performance of DNN algorithm, DNN is adopted for various AI platforms, including edge/mobile devices as well as cloud servers. However, high-performance DNN requires a large amount of computation and memory access, making it challenging to implement DNN operation on edge/mobile. There have been several ways to solve these problems, including algorithms as well as hardware for DNN. Algorithms that help accelerate DNN in hardware enable much more efficient operation of high-performance AI. This article aims to provide an overview of the recent hardware and algorithm co-design schemes enabling efficient processing of DNNs. Specifically, it will provide algorithm optimization methods for DNN structure, neurons, synapses, and data types. This paper also introduces optimization methods for hardware architectures, PE array, data-path control, and microarchitecture of PE. And we will also show examples of DNN algorithm and hardware co-designed ASICs.

TI Twitter sentiment analysis using hybrid Spider Monkey optimization
   method
SO EVOLUTIONARY INTELLIGENCE
AB The use of social media, over the past few years, has escalated enormously. Social media has formed a platform for the availability of abundant data. Thousands of people express their perceptions through social media. Sentiment Analysis (SA) of such views and perceptions is very substantial to measure public notion on a peculiar/specific subject matter of concern. SA is a remarkable field of data mining concerned with identification and translation of sentiments accessible on social media. Twitter is a microblogging site in which users can post updates (tweets) to friends (followers). This paper proposes a mechanism for extracting the sentiments from the tweets posted on Twitter. Tweets can be classified as positive, neutral or negative. The metaheuristic-based clustering techniques are superior to conventional techniques due to the subjective behaviour of tweets. A hybrid strategy, named as Hybrid Spider Monkey optimization with k-means clustering, is introduced to obtain the optimal cluster-heads of the dataset. The accuracy of the proposed method is determined on two datasets, namely, sender2 and twitter. To analyse the authenticity of the proposed method, a comparative analysis is performed with a few significant Nature-Inspired Algorithms such as Spider-Monkey optimization, Particle-Swarm algorithm, Genetic-Algorithm and Differential Evolution.

AB Recent advances in natural language processing have enabled automation of a wide range of tasks, including machine translation, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis. Automated summarization of documents, or groups of documents, however, has remained elusive, with many efforts limited to extraction of keywords, key phrases, or key sentences. Accurate abstractive summarization has yet to be achieved due to the inherent difficulty of the problem, and limited availability of training data. In this paper, we propose a topic-centric unsupervised multi-document summarization framework to generate extractive and abstractive summaries for groups of scientific articles across 20 Fields of Study (FoS) in Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) and news articles from DUC-2004 Task 2. The proposed algorithm generates an abstractive summary by developing salient language unit selection and text generation techniques. Our approach matches the state-of-the-art when evaluated on automated extractive evaluation metrics and performs better for abstractive summarization on five human evaluation metrics (entailment, coherence, conciseness, readability, and grammar). We achieve a kappa score of 0.68 between two co-author linguists who evaluated our results. We plan to publicly share MAG-20, a human-validated gold standard dataset of topic-clustered research articles and their summaries to promote research in abstractive summarization.

AB Currently available foot interfaces to command an external assistive robotic arm for laparoscopic surgery typically consist of a couple of push buttons placed on a planar platform. In this paper, we develop and compare two foot interfaces implementing isotonic vs. elastic isometric control strategies. A four DOF robotic arm is used as the slave robot to evaluate both interfaces and their corresponding control strategies. This robot is controlled by foot's translation/rotation in the isotonic interface and by force/torque in the elastic isometric interface. The isotonic interface is used for position control, and the isometric interface for rate control. An experimental study mimicking a laparoscopic surgery task was conducted to compare the performance with these two systems, in which the slave robot is used as an endoscope holder controlled by the foot in the specific interface. The subjects strongly preferred using the elastic isometric interface, which they found more intuitive and less tiring. The low physical burden of this interface allows the users to concentrate on the main task of manipulation. Also, they preferred the rate control as it provides them with a more accurate control on the slave robot.

AB Linear transformation is a way to learn a linear relationship between two word embeddings, such that words in the two different embedding spaces can be semantically related. In this paper, we examine the reproducibility and generalisation of the linear transformation of word embeddings. Linear transformation is particularly useful when translating word embedding models in different languages, since it can capture the semantic relationships between two models. We first reproduce two linear transformation approaches, a recent one using orthogonal transformation and the original one using simple matrix transformation. Previous findings on a machine translation task are re-examined, validating that linear transformation is indeed an effective way to transform word embedding models in different languages. In particular, we show that the orthogonal transformation can better relate the different embedding models. Following the verification of previous findings, we then study the generalisation of linear transformation in a multi-language Twitter election classification task. We observe that the orthogonal transformation outperforms the matrix transformation. In particular, it significantly outperforms the random classifier by at least 10% under the F1 metric across English and Spanish datasets. In addition, we also provide best practices when using linear transformation for multi-language Twitter election classification.

TI Multilingual Information Retrieval & Use: Perceptions and Practices
   Amongst Bi/Multilingual Academic Users
SO JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIANSHIP
AB In recent years, technological advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) such as machine translation have made it possible for users to access information in multiple languages, even those in which they may not be proficient. The current study investigated the information searching behavior of bi/multilingual academic users, and examined their practices and perceptions regarding searching for information on the Internet and on electronic databases. Bi/multilingual students were recruited from a Canadian university and a community college both located in London, Ontario. A total of 250 (N = 250) students completed a web survey through a link that was embedded in an invitation e-mail. Results showed that though advancements in NLP technology have alleviated some of the linguistic related challenges that some bi/multilingual academic users face while searching for information online, language barriers do still exist for some especially at the query formulation stage. The study found that an increase in Multilingual Information Access (MLIA) tools on electronic databases coupled with appropriate information literacy instruction could be helpful in further alleviating language barriers.

AB This paper proposes a method that extracts local features, i.e., angle patterns, around the apex and base of a leaf. The proposed method only requires leaf contour and the location of apex and base as inputs. Starting from an origin point, which can be either the apex or base, the contour is tracked in two directions, i.e., leftward and rightward, and then sampled at five different distances from the origin point. The angle formed by the origin and two sampled points, at each distance, is then calculated. Altogether, 10 angle features, five from the apex and five from the base, are obtained. These features are invariant to translation, rotation, and scaling. In addition, this paper also aims to measure the effectiveness of the proposed apical and basal features. In the experiment, two sets of features are compared. The first set includes 12 shape descriptors while the second set includes not only the 12 shape descriptors but also the proposed features. By using support vector machine as a classifier, leaf identification has been done by using the two sets of features. Experimental results indicate that the use of apical and basal features can significantly improve the accuracy of leaf identification.

AB The objective of this paper is to propose an approach to formalize and verify the compatibility between SysML blocks, and to help in making decision about the possibility of assembling these blocks. We specify the architecture of the system using SysML internal block diagrams. To model the interaction between blocks with a convivial manner, we propose HPSM (Hierarchical Protocol State Machine) diagram. In order to permit the verification of such interactions, we perform a translation of HPSMs into HIA-ILTs (Hierarchical Interface Automata with Inter-Level Transitions), a variant of interface automata (IA) which we propose for this purpose. Our major objective is to benefit from the hierarchy which is present in HIA-ILTs. Thus, we have adapted the existing approaches of compatibility verification based on IAs to be applicable on the HIA-ILTs. However, in order to avoid the flattening of the entire HIA-ILT, we propose a preliminary phase that allows selecting the composite states to flatten. The aim behind this is to alleviate the verification phase. Our approach is illustrated by a case study, where we demonstrate the expressiveness of the HPSM and the HIA-ILT, and we show how the hierarchy and the abstraction help to reduce the complexity of verification.

AB Parsing human-human conversations consists in automatically enriching text transcription with semantic structure information. We use in this paper a FrameNet-based approach to semantics that, without needing a full semantic parse of a message, goes further than a simple flat translation of a message into basic concepts. FrameNet-based semantic parsing may follow a syntactic parsing step, however spoken conversations in customer service telephone call centers present very specific characteristics such as non-canonical language, noisy messages (disfluencies, repetitions, truncated words or automatic speech transcription errors) and the presence of superfluous information. For syntactic parsing the traditional view based on context-free grammars is not suitable for processing non-canonical text. New approaches to parsing based on dependency structures and discriminative machine learning techniques are more adapted to process spontaneous speech for two main reasons: (a) they need less training data and (b) the annotation with syntactic dependencies of conversation transcripts is simpler than with syntactic constituents. Another advantage is that partial annotation can be performed. This paper presents the adaptation of a syntactic dependency parser to process very spontaneous speech recorded in a call centre environment. This parser is used in order to produce FrameNet candidates for characterizing conversations between an operator and a caller.

AB This paper describes a computationally viable localization technique for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that is used to carry visual inspection and nondestructive testing equipment inside large water conduits and tunnels without decommissioning the service. The localization technique is required to estimate the instantaneous location of the robot with sufficient accuracy for the control system of the robot in real time. The proposed technique features a sensor fusion framework that incorporates a monocular camera and an inertial navigation system (INS). Localization is carried out using a standard Lucas-Kanade algorithm which searches for a subset of matching pixels between two sequential images to estimate a motion vector for the time interval between the two images. The novelty of the proposed technique is in regards with the use of an INS to predict a rotation and translation vector between the two sequential images. This prediction is used to minimize the search region of the Lucas-Kanade algorithm and hence significantly reduce the computational load of the overall localization process. Experimental results on a special testbed verify that the proposed system not only reduces the computational load but also improves the accuracy since finding a false match in the minimized search region is unlikely.

TI Training a neural network to predict dynamics it has never seen
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Neural networks have proven to be remarkably successful for a wide range of complicated tasks, from image recognition and object detection to speech recognition and machine translation. One of their successes lies in their ability to predict future dynamics given a suitable training data set. Previous studies have shown how echo state networks (ESNs), a type of recurrent neural networks, can successfully predict both short-term and long-term dynamics of even chaotic systems. This study shows that, remarkably, ESNs can successfully predict dynamical behavior that is qualitatively different from any behavior contained in their training set. Evidence is provided for a fluid dynamics problem where the flow can transition between laminar (ordered) and turbulent (seemingly disordered) regimes. Despite being trained on the turbulent regime only, ESNs are found to predict the existence of laminar behavior. Moreover, the statistics of turbulent-to-laminar and laminar-to-turbulent transitions are also predicted successfully. The utility of ESNs in acting as early-warning generators for transition is discussed. These results are expected to be widely applicable to data-driven modeling of temporal behavior in a range of physical, climate, biological, ecological, and finance models characterized by the presence of tipping points and sudden transitions between several competing states.

TI Volatile organic compound profiling to explore primary graft dysfunction

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is a major determinant of morbidity and mortality following lung transplantation. Delineating basic mechanisms and molecular signatures of PGD remain a fundamental challenge. This pilot study examines if the pulmonary volatile organic compound (VOC) spectrum relate to PGD and postoperative outcomes. The VOC profiles of 58 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and blind bronchial aspirate samples from 35 transplant patients were extracted using solid-phase-microextraction and analyzed with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The support vector machine algorithm was used to identify VOCs that could differentiate patients with severe from lower grade PGD. Using 20 statistically significant VOCs from the sample headspace collected immediately after transplantation (< 6 h), severe PGD was differentiable from low PGD with an AUROC of 0.90 and an accuracy of 0.83 on test set samples. The model was somewhat effective for later time points with an AUROC of 0.80. Three major chemical classes in the model were dominated by alkylated hydrocarbons, linear hydrocarbons, and aldehydes in severe PGD samples. These VOCs may have important clinical and mechanistic implications, therefore large-scale study and potential translation to breath analysis is recommended.

TI Pose Correction Method for Micro-Motion Stages Based on
   Dual-Orthogonal-Camera
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB The observation stage, on which the vision-based monitoring system is installed, experiences slight 6 degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) shaking when working for a long time. As a result, it brings great errors to the measurement results. Therefore, a linear solution method for micro-motion variations of the cameras was proposed. Micro 6-DOF pose variations of the cameras were then linearly calculated with a newly constructed model of two orthogonal cameras in fixed connection. Simulation verification shows that when the three Euler angles of the cameras are less than 30' and the three translation vectors are less than 10 mm, the proposed method delivers better solution accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency than the typical monocular perspective-n-point (PnP) pose estimation algorithm. Meanwhile, outdoor experiments show that the proposed method better calibrates the measurement error caused by the micro-motion of the observation stage. The subsidence of the target point 44 m away from the observation stage was measured and the result shows that in the case of 6 control points, the average absolute measurement error after the pose variation of the stage is calibrated decreases to 0.2 mm, which verifies the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method.

TI A Deep Learning Approach to Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs Classification
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Nowadays, advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially in machine and deep learning, present new opportunities to build tools that support the work of specialists in areas apparently far from the information technology field. One example of such areas is that of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic writing. In this study, we explore the ability of different convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify pictures of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs coming from two different datasets of images. Three well-known CNN architectures (ResNet-50, Inception-v3 and Xception) were taken into consideration and trained on the available images. The paradigm of transfer learning was tested as well. In addition, modifying the architecture of one of the previous networks, we developed a specifically dedicated CNN, named Glyphnet, tailoring its complexity to our classification task. Performance comparison tests were carried out and Glyphnet showed the best performances with respect to the other CNNs. In conclusion, this work shows how the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs identification task can be supported by the deep learning paradigm, laying the foundation for information tools supporting automatic documents recognition, classification and, most importantly, the language translation task.

AB The biggest obstacle to develop end-to-end Japanese text-to-speech (TTS) systems is to estimate phonetic and prosodic information (PPI) from Japanese texts. The following are the reasons: (1) the Kanji characters of the Japanese writing system have multiple corresponding pronunciations, (2) there is no separation mark between words, and (3) an accent nucleus must be assigned at appropriate positions. In this paper, we propose to solve the problems by neural machine translation (NMT) on the basis of encoder-decoder models, and compare NMT models of recurrent neural networks and the Transformer architecture. The proposed model handles texts on token (character) basis, although conventional systems handle them on word basis. To ensure the potential of the proposed approach, NMT models are trained using pairs of sentences and their PPIs that are generated by a conventional Japanese TTS system from 5 million sentences. Evaluation experiments were performed using PPIs that are manually annotated for 5,142 sentences. The experimental results showed that the Transformer architecture has the best performance, with 98.0% accuracy for phonetic information estimation and 95.0% accuracy for PPI estimation. Judging from the results, NMT models are promising toward end-to-end Japanese TTS.

AB Solving geometric tasks involving point clouds by using machine learning is a challenging problem. Standard feed-forward neural networks combine linear or, if the bias parameter is included, affine layers and activation functions. Their geometric modeling is limited, which motivated the prior work introducing the multilayer hypersphere perceptron (MLHP). Its constituent part, i.e., the hypersphere neuron, is obtained by applying a conformal embedding of Euclidean space. By virtue of Clifford algebra, it can be implemented as the Cartesian dot product of inputs and weights. If the embedding is applied in a manner consistent with the dimensionality of the input space geometry, the decision surfaces of the model units become combinations of hyperspheres and make the decision-making process geometrically interpretable for humans. Our extension of the MLHP model, the multilayer geometric perceptron (MLGP), and its respective layer units, i.e., geometric neurons, are consistent with the 3D geometry and provide a geometric handle of the learned coefficients. In particular, the geometric neuron activations are isometric in 3D, which is necessary for rotation and translation equivariance. When classifying the 3D Tetris shapes, we quantitatively show that our model requires no activation function in the hidden layers other than the embedding to outperform the vanilla multilayer perceptron. In the presence of noise in the data, our model is also superior to the MLHP.

TI High-performance user plane function (UPF) for the next generation core
   networks
SO IET NETWORKS
AB Comparing with previous mobile communications, the fifth generation (5G) mobile communication provides three different types of services including enhanced mobile broadband, massive machine type communications, and ultra-reliable and low latency communications. To fulfil various requirements of these services, 5G defines new technologies and architectures such as the next-generation core network (NGC) and the new radio of the access network (5G-AN). The user plane function (UPF), which is an essential component in 5G NGC, connects 5G-AN and packet data networks (e.g. internet). Typically, the UPF provides the tunnelling, internet protocol/port translation, and forwarding functions. To provide flexibility and scalability deployment for 5G NGC, this study virtualises the UPF by using the Docker container. However, the virtualisation architecture degrades the performance of the UPF, and the performance of the UPF dominates the performance (e.g. throughput) of the 5G user-plane transmission. To provide high-performance packet processing, this study utilises Intel Data Plane Development Kit to develop the UPF, reduces the number of memory copy on header processing, and investigates the CPU core allocation methods for the UPF deployment. Based on the results of this study, the proposed UPF can provide the UPF functions and process the packets up to 40 Gbps on a x86-based platform.

TI Weakly Supervised Deep Learning for Segmentation of Remote Sensing
   Imagery
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB Accurate automated segmentation of remote sensing data could benefit applications from land cover mapping and agricultural monitoring to urban development surveyal and disaster damage assessment. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve state-of-the-art accuracy when segmenting natural images with huge labeled datasets, their successful translation to remote sensing tasks has been limited by low quantities of ground truth labels, especially fully segmented ones, in the remote sensing domain. In this work, we perform cropland segmentation using two types of labels commonly found in remote sensing datasets that can be considered sources of "weak supervision": (1) labels comprised of single geotagged points and (2) image-level labels. We demonstrate that (1) a U-Net trained on a single labeled pixel per image and (2) a U-Net image classifier transferred to segmentation can outperform pixel-level algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest. While the high performance of neural networks is well-established for large datasets, our experiments indicate that U-Nets trained on weak labels outperform baseline methods with as few as 100 labels. Neural networks, therefore, can combine superior classification performance with efficient label usage, and allow pixel-level labels to be obtained from image labels.

AB Today, robots are increasingly present in the machine building industry, sometimes even in some sections to replace workers altogether, due to the high quality of their work, repetitive, without stopping or pausing, without any manufacturing and assembly scuffs. In this paper, one presents the mechanisms with bars and gears, which are planetary mechanisms for robot automation and mechatronics, structurally-topological. The gears and bars consist of at least one movable articulated bar and one of the cylindrical, tapered or hipoidal gears. Only gears with circular or straight toothed gears, in which the relative position of the rotation or translation axes does not change, shall be considered. The topological structure of the gears and gears is characterized by a kinematic chain with articulated bars and at least one kinematic chain with gears. The kinematic chain may be chain open (with a fixed rotation joint) or closed chain (with at least two fixed joints). The kinematic chain with gears is attached to the kinematic chain with bars so that at least two gear wheels have centers in the bars of the bars and some wheels may be integral with the bars. In practice, some of these gears with gears and gears are known as planetary gears with cylindrical, conical or hipoidal gears.

TI A survey on Urdu and Urdu like language stemmers and stemming techniques
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW
AB Stemming is one of the basic steps in natural language processing applications such as information retrieval, parts of speech tagging, syntactic parsing and machine translation, etc. It is a morphological process that intends to convert the inflected forms of a word into its root form. Urdu is a morphologically rich language, emerged from different languages, that includes prefix, suffix, infix, co-suffix and circumfixes in inflected and multi-gram words that need to be edited in order to convert them into their stems. This editing (insertion, deletion and substitution) makes the stemming process difficult due to language morphological richness and inclusion of words of foreign languages like Persian and Arabic. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of different algorithms and techniques of stemming Urdu text and also considering the syntax, morphological similarity and other common features and stemming approaches used in Urdu like languages, i.e. Arabic and Persian analyzed, extract main features, merits and shortcomings of the used stemming approaches. In this paper, we also discuss stemming errors, basic difference between stemming and lemmatization and coin a metric for classification of stemming algorithms. In the final phase, we have presented the future work directions.

AB Detection of spelling error is not so facile in Bangla. To check for real-world error in a sentence, it comes with more difficulties. In this paper, we focus on correcting homophone error in real-word error. We use N-gram Model which is used in many purposes like machine translation, speech recognition, to extract syntactic information etc. We have used a combination of Bi-gram and Tri-gram with candidate word which is going to be detected whether it is a real-word error or not. We have developed corpora which contain: (i) one of them is a collection of sets of homophone (confusing) word, (ii) another two are the collection of bigrams and trigrams using homophone word and (iii) other seven are the test sets. A candidate word extracts the set of homophone words from the corpus. In our proposed method, we create tri-gram and bigram using homophone word, then it checks the validity and takes the frequency of bi-gram or tri-gram, and finally calculates the probability for making the final decision about the candidate word. We have used around a million words to inspect our system. Our proposed method achieves more than 96% accuracy in detecting and correcting real-word errors of Bangla Text.

AB We study how to find relevant questions in community forums when the language of the new questions is different from that of the existing questions in the forum. In particular, we explore the Arabic-English language pair. We compare a kernel-based system with a feed-forward neural network in a scenario where a large parallel corpus is available for training a machine translation system, bilingual dictionaries, and cross-language word embeddings. We observe that both approaches degrade the performance of the system when working on the translated text, especially the kernel-based system, which depends heavily on a syntactic kernel. We address this issue using a cross-language tree kernel, which compares the original Arabic tree to the English trees of the related questions. We show that this kernel almost closes the performance gap with respect to the monolingual system. On the neural network side, we use the parallel corpus to train cross-language embeddings, which we then use to represent the Arabic input and the English related questions in the same space. The results also improve to close to those of the monolingual neural network. Overall, the kernel system shows a better performance compared to the neural network in all cases.

AB Internet users today prefer getting precise answers to their questions rather than sifting through a bunch of relevant documents provided by search engines. This has led to the huge popularity of Community Question Answering (cQA) services like Yahoo! Answers, Baidu Zhidao, Quora, StackOverflow etc., where forum users respond to questions with precise answers. Over time, such cQA archives become rich repositories of knowledge encoded in the form of questions and user generated answers. In cQA archives, retrieval of similar questions, which have already been answered in some form, is important for improving the effectiveness of such forums. The main challenge while retrieving similar questions is the "lexico-syntactic" gap between the user query and the questions already present in the forum. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called "Deep Structured Topic Model (DSTM)" to bridge the lexico-syntactic gap between the question posed by the user and forum questions. DSTM employs a two-step process consisting of initially retrieving similar questions that lie in the vicinity of the query and latent topic vector space and then re-ranking them using a deep layered semantic model. Experiments on large scale real-life cQA dataset show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art translation and topic based baseline approaches.

TI Transformation of a Relational Database to RDF/RDFS with ER(2)iDM
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB The Semantic Web uses RDF/RDFS, which can enable a machine to understand web data without human interference. But most web data is not available in RDF/RDFS documents because most web data is still stored in databases. It is much more favorable to use stored data in a database to build the Semantic Web. This paper proposes an enhanced relational RDF/RDFS interoperable data model (ER(2)iDM) and a transformation procedure from relational data model (RDM) to RDF/RDFS based on ER(2)iDM. The ER(2)iDM is a data model that plays the role of an inter-mediator between RDM and RDF/RDFS during a transformation procedure. The data and schema information in the database are migrated to the ER(2)iDM according to the proposed translation procedures without incurring loss of meaning of the entities, relationships, and data. The RDF/RDFS generation tool makes a RDF/RDFS XML document automatically from,the ER(2)iDM. The proposed ER(2)iDM and transformation procedure provides detailed guidelines for transformation from RDM to RDF/RDFS unlike existing studies; therefore, we can more efficiently build up the Semantic Web using database stored data.

TI Supporting Dynamic Aspect-Oriented Features
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY
AB Dynamic aspect-oriented (AO) features have important software engineering benefits such as allowing unanticipated software evolution and maintenance. It is thus important to efficiently support these features in language implementations. Current implementations incur unnecessary design-time and runtime overhead due to the lack of support in underlying intermediate language (IL) models. To address this problem, we present a flexible and dynamic IL model that we call Nu. The Nu model provides a higher level of abstraction compared to traditional object-oriented ILs, making it easier to efficiently support dynamic AO features. We demonstrate these benefits by providing an industrial-strength VM implementation for Nu, by showing translation strategies from dynamic source-level constructs to Nu and by analyzing the performance of the resulting IL code.
   Nu's VM extends the Sun Hotspot VM interpreter and uses a novel caching mechanism to significantly reduce the amortized costs of join point dispatch. Our evaluation using standard benchmarks shows that the overhead of supporting a dynamic deployment model can be reduced to as little as similar to 1.5%. Nu provides an improved compilation target for dynamic deployment features, which makes it easier to support such features with corresponding software engineering benefits in software evolution and maintenance and in runtime verification.

TI Accurately predicting microbial phosphorylation sites using evolutionary
   and structural features
SO GENE
AB Post-translational modification (PTM) is a biological process involving a protein's enzymatic changes after its translation by the ribosome. Phosphorylation is one of the most critical PTMs that occurs when a phosphate group interacts with an amino acid residue along protein sequence. It contributes to cell communication, DNA repair, and gene regulation. Predicting microbial phosphorylation sites can provide better understanding of hostpathogen interaction and the development of anti-microbial agents. Experimental methods such as mass spectrometry are time-consuming, laborious, and expensive. This paper proposes a new approach, called RotPhoPred, for predicting phospho-serine (pS), phospho-threonine (pT), and phospho-tyrosine (pY) sites in the microbial organism by integrating evolutionary bigram profile with structural information and using Rotation Forest as the classification technique. To the best of our knowledge, our extracted features and employed classifier have never been utilized for this task. Comparative results demonstrate that the RotPhoPred surpasses its peers in terms of different metrics such as sensitivity (90.0%, 75.4% and 78.2%), specificity (92.1%, 97.2% and 94.7%), accuracy (91.0%, 86.3%, 86.4%), and MCC (0.82, 0.74 and 0.74) for pS, pT, and pY sites predictions, respectively.

SO JOURNAL OF SENSORS
AB Radar-based human motion recognition has received extensive attention in recent years. Most current recognition methods generate a heat map of features through simple signal processing and then feed into a classification-based neural network for recognition. Such an approach can only identify a single action. When a set of data contains information about multiple movements, it can also only be recognized as a single movement. Another point that cannot be overlooked is that continuous action recognition methods are able to recognize continuously changing actions but ignore the issue of whether continuous actions are legitimate or not (continuous actions obtained by stitching together multiple current actions do not conform to real time). In this paper, we propose a continuous action recognition method based on micro-Doppler features and transformer, which translates the micro-Doppler features of continuous actions into machine translation tasks and uses the idea of natural language processing (NLP) to identify continuous action. In order to judge whether the continuous action is legal or not, we also design the action state transition diagram as a constraint condition to strictly control the forward and backward actions. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper achieves good recognition accuracy for the recognition of a single action and can also effectively segment and recognize continuous actions.

TI Learning Cosmology and Clustering with Cosmic Graphs
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We train deep-learning models on thousands of galaxy catalogs from the state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations of the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) project to perform regression and inference. We employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), architectures designed to work with irregular and sparse data, like the distribution of galaxies in the universe. We first show that GNNs can learn to compute the power spectrum of galaxy catalogs with a few percent accuracy. We then train GNNs to perform likelihood-free inference at the galaxy-field level. Our models are able to infer the value of Omega(m) with a similar to 12%-13% accuracy just from the positions of similar to 1000 galaxies in a volume of (25 h(-1) Mpc)(3) at z = 0 while accounting for astrophysical uncertainties as modeled in CAMELS. Incorporating information from galaxy properties, such as the stellar mass, stellar metallicity, and stellar radius, increases the accuracy to 4%-8%. Our models are built to be translation and rotation invariant, and they can extract information from any scale larger than the minimum distance between two galaxies. However, our models are not completely robust: testing on simulations run with a different subgrid physics than the ones used for training does not yield accurate results.

TI Scalable Thousand Channel Penetrating Microneedle Arrays on Flex for
   Multimodal and Large Area Coverage BrainMachine Interfaces
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB The Utah array powers cutting-edge projects for restoration of neurological function, such as BrainGate, but the underlying electrode technology has itself advanced little in the last three decades. Here, advanced dual-side lithographic microfabrication processes is exploited to demonstrate a 1024-channel penetrating silicon microneedle array (SiMNA) that is scalable in its recording capabilities and cortical coverage and is suitable for clinical translation. The SiMNA is the first penetrating microneedle array with a flexible backing that affords compliancy to brain movements. In addition, the SiMNA is optically transparent permitting simultaneous optical and electrophysiological interrogation of neuronal activity. The SiMNA is used to demonstrate reliable recordings of spontaneous and evoked field potentials and of single unit activity in chronically implanted mice for up to 196 days in response to optogenetic and to whisker air-puff stimuli. Significantly, the 1024-channel SiMNA establishes detailed spatiotemporal mapping of broadband brain activity in rats. This novel scalable and biocompatible SiMNA with its multimodal capability and sensitivity to broadband brain activity will accelerate the progress in fundamental neurophysiological investigations and establishes a new milestone for penetrating and large area coverage microelectrode arrays for brain-machine interfaces.

TI Predicting T-cell quality during manufacturing through an artificial
   intelligence-based integrative multiomics analytical platform
SO BIOENGINEERING & TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
AB Large-scale, reproducible manufacturing of therapeutic cells with consistently high quality is vital for translation to clinically effective and widely accessible cell therapies. However, the biological and logistical complexity of manufacturing a living product, including challenges associated with their inherent variability and uncertainties of process parameters, currently make it difficult to achieve predictable cell-product quality. Using a degradable microscaffold-based T-cell process, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven experimental-computational platform to identify a set of critical process parameters and critical quality attributes from heterogeneous, high-dimensional, time-dependent multiomics data, measurable during early stages of manufacturing and predictive of end-of-manufacturing product quality. Sequential, design-of-experiment-based studies, coupled with an agnostic machine-learning framework, were used to extract feature combinations from early in-culture media assessment that were highly predictive of the end-product CD4/CD8 ratio and total live CD4(+) and CD8(+) naive and central memory T cells (CD63L(+)CCR7(+)). Our results demonstrate a broadly applicable platform tool to predict end-product quality and composition from early time point in-process measurements during therapeutic cell manufacturing.

TI Robust Hand Gestures Recognition Using a Deep CNN and Thermal Images
SO IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
AB Medical systems and assistive technologies, human-computer interaction, human-robot interaction, industrial automation, virtual environment control, sign language translation, crisis and disaster management, entertainment and computer games, and so on all use RGB cameras for hand gesture recognition. However, their performance is limited especially in low-light conditions. In this paper, we propose a robust hand gesture recognition system based on high-resolution thermal imaging that is light-independent. A dataset of 14,400 thermal hand gestures is constructed, separated into two color tones. We also propose using a deep CNN to classify high-resolution hand gestures accurately. The proposed models were also tested on Raspberry Pi 4 and Nvidia AGX edge computing devices, and the results were compared to the benchmark models. The model also achieves an accuracy of 98.81% and an inference time of 75.138 ms on Nvidia Jetson AGX. In contrast to hand gesture recognition systems based on RGB cameras, which have limited performance in the dark-light conditions, the proposed system based on reliable high resolution thermal images is well-suited to a wide range of applications.

AB Dense video captioning is a task of localizing interesting events from an untrimmed video and producing textual description (captions) for each localized event. Most of the previous works in dense video captioning are solely based on visual information and completely ignore the audio track. However, audio, and speech, in particular, are vital cues for a human observer in understanding an environment. In this paper, we present a new dense video captioning approach that is able to utilize any number of modalities for event description. Specifically, we show how audio and speech modalities may improve a dense video captioning model. We apply automatic speech recognition (ASR) system to obtain a temporally aligned textual description of the speech (similar to subtitles) and treat it as a separate input alongside video frames and the corresponding audio track. We formulate the captioning task as a machine translation problem and utilize recently proposed Transformer architecture to convert multi-modal input data into textual descriptions. We demonstrate the performance of our model on ActivityNet Captions dataset. The ablation studies indicate a considerable contribution from audio and speech components suggesting that these modalities contain substantial complementary information to video frames. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of the ActivityNet Caption results by leveraging the category tags obtained from original YouTube videos. Code is publicly available: github.com/v-iashin/MDVC.

AB The past few years have seen a surge of applying Deep Learning (DL) models for a wide array of tasks such as image classification, object detection, machine translation, etc. While DL models provide an opportunity to solve otherwise intractable tasks, their adoption relies on them being optimized to meet target latency and resource requirements. Benchmarking is a key step in this process but has been hampered in part due to the lack of representative and up-to-date benchmarking suites.
   This paper proposes DLBricks, a composable benchmark generation design that reduces the effort of developing, maintaining, and running DL benchmarks. DLBricks decomposes DL models into a set of unique runnable networks and constructs the original model's performance using the performance of the generated benchmarks. Since benchmarks are generated automatically and the benchmarking time is minimized, DLBricks can keep up-to-date with the latest proposed models, relieving the pressure of selecting representative DL models. We evaluate DLBricks using 50 MXNet models spanning 5 DL tasks on 4 representative CPU systems. We show that DLBricks provides an accurate performance estimate for the DL models and reduces the benchmarking time across systems (e.g. within 95% accuracy and up to 4.4x benchmarking time speedup on Amazon EC2 c5.xlarge).

AB Recognizing named entities like Person, Organization, Locations and Date are very useful for web mining. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an emerging research area which aims to address problems such as Machine Translation, Question Answering Systems and Semantic Web Search. The study focuses on proposing a methodology based on the integration of an NER system and Text Analytics to provide information necessary for business in Additive Manufacturing. The study proposes a foundation of utilizing the Stanford NER system for tagging news data related to the keywords "Additive Manufacturing". The objective is to first derive the organization names from news data. This information is useful to define the digital footprints of an organization in the Additive Manufacturing sector. The existence of an organization derived using the NER approach is validated by matching their names with companies listed on the Companies House portal. The organization names will be matched using a Fuzzy-based text matching algorithm. Further information on company profile, officers and key financial data is extracted to provide information about companies interested and working within the Additive Manufacturing sector. This data gives an insight into which companies have digital footprints in the Additive Manufacturing sector within the UK.

AB The ultrashort laser processing of the cutting tools and cutting inserts from tungsten carbide, ceramic and metal composites (CERMET), and polycrystalline diamond materials was demonstrated, and the ablation rates of mentioned ultra-hard materials were evaluated for a laser wavelength of 1064 and 532 nm. The optimal processing throughput was estimated. Laser manufacturing was performed with the five-axis computer numerical control (CNC) machine and scanner for beam translation with the high speed and the ultrashort similar to 12 ps pulse duration high repetition rate laser source. The systematic approach was implemented in an experimental variation of process parameters that play a significant role in processing quality. By varying the laser fluence, pulse overlap, and layers' count, different material removing rates can be achieved from 300 nm/layer to similar to 18 mu m/layer. The submicrometer removing rate involves a high precision control of the structure depth. It was demonstrated that only by a minor change of the processing parameters, the surface roughness of the material could be minimized down to Ra < 300 nm. Rough and smooth processing can be combined to optimize the structure processing throughput. (C) 2018 Laser Institute of America.

AB This paper begins to describe a new kind of database, one that explores a diverse range of movement in the field of dance through capture of different bodies and different backgrounds - or what we are terming movement vernaculars. We re-purpose Ivan Illich's concept of 'vernacular work' [11] here to refer to those everyday forms of dance and organized movement that are informal, refractory (resistant to formal analysis), yet are socially reproduced and derived from a commons. The project investigates the notion of vernaculars in movement that is intentional and aesthetic through the development of a computational approach that highlights both similarities and differences, thereby revealing the specificities of each individual mover. This paper presents an example of how this movement database is used as a research tool, and how the fruits of that research can be added back to the database, thus adding a novel layer of annotation and further enriching the collection. Future researchers can then benefit from this layer, further refining and building upon these techniques.
   The creation of a robust, open source, movement lexicon repository will allow for observation, speculation, and contextualization - along with the provision of clean and complex data sets for new forms of creative expression.

TI From Media History to Zeitkritik
SO THEORY CULTURE & SOCIETY
AB Wolfgang Ernst, Professor of Media Theories at the Humboldt University in Berlin, has become known through his work on media archaeology. Hence the inclusion of this translation represents an alternative take on cultural techniques. It places the legacy of cultural studies, or Kulturwissenschaften, in an interesting tension with the different epistemological demands that technical media impose. After Vico and Dilthey, argues Ernst, we need to investigate the specific modes of knowledge that technical media propose to cultural techniques. Ernst's media archaeology and the slightly different approach to cultural techniques found in some other contributions in this issue can be seen as two of the most intriguing ways in which current German media studies has been developing in relation to Friedrich Kittler's impact. For Ernst, this has resulted in a more technical focus and also in the development of critiques of temporality that go beyond media history. Ernst argues that media temporality is not to be understood only through the cultural history of media technologies, but also how media technologies produce time. Machines have their own specific temporality, Eigenzeit. It is in this context that the article discusses the different approaches to cultural techniques, taking into consideration the specific time-critical and epistemic implications of technical media.

TI Cross-Platform Comparison of Microarray-Based Multiple-Class Prediction
SO PLOS ONE
AB High-throughput microarray technology has been widely applied in biological and medical decision-making research during the past decade. However, the diversity of platforms has made it a challenge to re-use and/or integrate datasets generated in different experiments or labs for constructing array-based diagnostic models. Using large toxicogenomics datasets generated using both Affymetrix and Agilent microarray platforms, we carried out a benchmark evaluation of cross-platform consistency in multiple-class prediction using three widely-used machine learning algorithms. After an initial assessment of model performance on different platforms, we evaluated whether predictive signature features selected in one platform could be directly used to train a model in the other platform and whether predictive models trained using data from one platform could predict datasets profiled using the other platform with comparable performance. Our results established that it is possible to successfully apply multiple-class prediction models across different commercial microarray platforms, offering a number of important benefits such as accelerating the possible translation of biomarkers identified with microarrays to clinically-validated assays. However, this investigation focuses on a technical platform comparison and is actually only the beginning of exploring cross-platform consistency. Further studies are needed to confirm the feasibility of microarray-based cross-platform prediction, especially using independent datasets.

AB Previous approaches to spontaneous speech recognition address the multiple pronunciation problem by modeling the alteration of the pronunciation on a phoneme to phoneme level. However, the phonetic transformation effects induced by the pronunciation of the whole sentence are not considered yet. In this paper we attempt to model the sequence-based pronunciation variation using a noisy-channel approach where the spontaneous phoneme sequence is considered as a "noisy" string and the goal is to recover the "clean" string of the word sequence. Hereby, the whole word sequence and its effect on the alternation of the phonemes will be taken into consideration. Moreover, the system not only learns the phoneme transformation but also the mapping from the phoneme to the word directly. In this preliminary study, first the phonemes will be recognized with the present recognition system and afterwards the pronunciation variation model based on the noisy-channel approach will map from the phoneme to the word level. Our experiments use Switchboard as spontaneous speech corpus. The results show that the proposed method improves the word accuracy consistently over the conventional recognition system. The best system achieves up to 38.9% relative improvement to the baseline speech recognition.

AB This paper describes a computer architecture, Spatial Computation (SC), which is based on the translation of high-level language programs directly into hardware structures. SC program implementations are completely distributed, with no centralized control. SC circuits are optimized for wires at the expense of computation units.
   In this paper we investigate a particular implementation of SC: ASH (Application-Specific Hardware). Under the assumption that computation is cheaper than communication, ASH replicates computation units to simplify interconnect, building a system which uses very simple, completely dedicated communication channels. As a consequence, communication on the datapath never requires arbitration; the only arbitration required is for accessing memory. ASH relies on very simple hardware primitives, using no associative structures, no multiported register files, no scheduling logic, no broadcast, and no clocks. As a consequence, ASH hardware is fast and extremely power efficient.
   In this work we demonstrate three features of ASH: (1) that such architectures can be built by automatic compilation of C programs; (2) that distributed computation is in some respects fundamentally different from monolithic superscalar processors; and (3) that ASIC implementations of ASH use three orders of magnitude less energy compared to high-end superscalar processors, while being on average only 33% slower in performance (3.5x worst-case).

AB The aim of this study was to determine the significance of a new artificial nucleus implant for lumbar discs (polymethyl siloxane polymer, DR-PMSO) with special regard to the biomechanical properties of the spinal motion segment.
   The lumbar segments L1/L2 and L4/L5 were harvested from six calf cadavers. The segments were fixed on a special device mounted on a three-dimensional testing machine. Physiological load with a maximum of 7 Nm was applied in flexion/extension, right and left lateral bending, and right and left torsion.
   The movement of the measuring point (center of L1 and L4) was registered along three axes (sagittal,frontal, and vertical). Three cycles of measurements were performed on all specimens: (1) intact segment, (2) segment after nucleotomy,and (3) segment with PMSO. There was a statistically significant (p=0.0313) increase in segmental mobility in all directions after nucleotomy with an increased mobility of the segment up to 30% for rotation and 50% for translation. After introduction of the PMSO implant, segmental mobility for all movement directions was restored with no statistically significant difference from the intact situation before nucleotomy. The disc material was found to be noncytotoxic according to current ISO 10993 standards.

TI The ASR Post-Processor Performance Challenges of BackTranScription
   (BTS): Data-Centric and Model-Centric Approaches
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Training an automatic speech recognition (ASR) post-processor based on sequence-to-sequence (S2S) requires a parallel pair (e.g., speech recognition result and human post-edited sentence) to construct the dataset, which demands a great amount of human labor. BackTransScription (BTS) proposes a data-building method to mitigate the limitations of the existing S2S based ASR post-processors, which can automatically generate vast amounts of training datasets, reducing time and cost in data construction. Despite the emergence of this novel approach, the BTS-based ASR post-processor still has research challenges and is mostly untested in diverse approaches. In this study, we highlight these challenges through detailed experiments by analyzing the data-centric approach (i.e., controlling the amount of data without model alteration) and the model-centric approach (i.e., model modification). In other words, we attempt to point out problems with the current trend of research pursuing a model-centric approach and alert against ignoring the importance of the data. Our experiment results show that the data-centric approach outperformed the model-centric approach by +11.69, +17.64, and +19.02 in the F1-score, BLEU, and GLEU tests.

TI Variational quantum algorithms for trace distance and fidelity
   estimation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Estimating the difference between quantum data is crucial in quantum computing. However, as typical characterizations of quantum data similarity, the trace distance and quantum fidelity are believed to be exponentially-hard to evaluate in general. In this work, we introduce hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for these two distance measures on near-term quantum devices where no assumption of input state is required. First, we introduce the variational trace distance estimation (VTDE) algorithm. We in particular provide the technique to extract the desired spectrum information of any Hermitian matrix by local measurement. A novel variational algorithm for trace distance estimation is then derived from this technique, with the assistance of a single ancillary qubit. Notably, VTDE could avoid the barren plateau issue with logarithmic depth circuits due to a local cost function. Second, we introduce the variational fidelity estimation algorithm. We combine Uhlmann's theorem and the freedom in purification to translate the estimation task into an optimization problem over a unitary on an ancillary system with fixed purified inputs. We then provide a purification subroutine to complete the translation. Both algorithms are verified by numerical simulations and experimental implementations, exhibiting high accuracy for randomly generated mixed states.

AB Delineation approaches provide significant benefits to various domains, including agriculture, environmental and natural disasters monitoring. Most of the work in the literature utilize traditional segmentation methods that require a large amount of computational and storage resources. Deep learning has transformed computer vision and dramatically improved machine translation, though it requires massive dataset for training and significant resources for inference. More importantly, energy-efficient embedded vision hardware delivering real-time and robust performance is crucial in the aforementioned application. In this work, we propose a U-Net based tree delineation method, which is effectively trained using multi-spectral imagery but can then delineate single-spectrum images. The deep architecture that also performs localization, i.e., a class label corresponds to each pixel, has been successfully used to allow training with a small set of segmented images. The ground truth data were generated using traditional image denoising and segmentation approaches. To be able to execute the proposed DNN efficiently in embedded platforms designed for deep learning approaches, we employ traditional model compression and acceleration methods. Extensive evaluation studies using data collected from UAVs equipped with multi-spectral cameras demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in terms of delineation accuracy and execution efficiency.

AB Subwords are the most widely used output units in end-to-end speech recognition. They combine the best of two worlds by modeling the majority of frequent words directly and at the same time allow open vocabulary speech recognition by backing off to shorter units or characters to construct words unseen during training. However, mapping text to subwords is ambiguous and often multiple segmentation variants are possible. Yet, many systems are trained using only the most likely segmentation. Recent research suggests that sampling subword segmentations during training acts as a regularizer for neural machine translation and speech recognition models, leading to performance improvements. In this work, we conduct a principled investigation on the regularizing effect of the subword segmentation sampling method for a streaming end-to-end speech recognition task. In particular, we evaluate the subword regularization contribution depending on the size of the training dataset. Our results suggest that subword regularization provides a consistent improvement of 2 - 8% relative word-error-rate reduction, even in a large-scale setting with datasets up to a size of 20k hours. Further, we analyze the effect of subword regularization on recognition of unseen words and its implications on beam diversity.

AB Deep neural networks (DNN) are the de-facto solution behind many intelligent applications of today, ranging from machine translation to autonomous driving. DNNs are accurate but resource-intensive, especially for embedded devices such as mobile phones and smart objects in the Internet of Things. To overcome the related resource constraints, DNN inference is generally offloaded to the edge or to the cloud. This is accomplished by partitioning the DNN and distributing computations at the two different ends. However, most of existing solutions simply split the DNN into two parts, one running locally or at the edge, and the other one in the cloud. In contrast, this article proposes a technique to divide a DNN in multiple partitions that can be processed locally by end devices or offloaded to one or multiple powerful nodes, such as in fog networks. The proposed scheme includes both an adaptive DNN partitioning scheme and a distributed algorithm to offload computations based on a matching game approach. Results obtained by using a self-driving car dataset and several DNN benchmarks show that the proposed solution significantly reduces the total latency for DNN inference compared to other distributed approaches and is 2.6 to 4.2 times faster than the state of the art.

AB Current state-of-the-art NMT systems use large neural networks that are not only slow to train, but also often require many heuristics and optimization tricks, such as specialized learning rate schedules and large batch sizes. This is undesirable as it requires extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we propose a curriculum learning framework for NMT that reduces training time, reduces the need for specialized heuristics or large batch sizes, and results in overall better performance. Our framework consists of a principled way of deciding which training samples are shown to the model at different times during training, based on the estimated difficulty of a sample and the current competence of the model. Filtering training samples in this manner prevents the model from getting stuck in bad local optima, making it converge faster and reach a better solution than the common approach of uniformly sampling training examples. Furthermore, the proposed method can be easily applied to existing NMT models by simply modifying their input data pipelines. We show that our framework can help improve the training time and the performance of both recurrent neural network models and Transformers, achieving up to a 70% decrease in training time, while at the same time obtaining accuracy improvements of up to 2.2 BLEU.

TI Data-Driven Transducer Design and Identification for Internally-Paced
   Motor Brain Computer Interfaces: A Review
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
AB Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are systems that establish a direct communication pathway between the users' brain activity and external effectors. They offer the potential to improve the quality of life ofmotor-impaired patients. Motor BCIs aim to permit severely motor-impaired users to regain limb mobility by controlling orthoses or prostheses. In particular, motor BCI systems benefit patients if the decoded actions reflect the users' intentions with an accuracy that enables them to efficiently interact with their environment. One of the main challenges of BCI systems is to adapt the BCI's signal translation blocks to the user to reach a high decoding accuracy. This paper will review the literature of data-driven and user-specific transducer design and identification approaches and it focuses on internally-paced motor BCIs. In particular, continuous kinematic biomimetic and mental-task decoders are reviewed. Furthermore, static and dynamic decoding approaches, linear and non-linear decoding, offline and real-time identification algorithms are considered. The current progress and challenges related to the design of clinical-compatible motor BCI transducers are additionally discussed.

AB This paper examines the meanings, expressive functions, and semantic construal strategy of the adverbs bai. gan, xia, kong, xu, tu, and wang in Mandarin. We begin by discussing the original meaning of the adverbs through which their implicit negations are then depicted. Then, we explore the counter-expectative function of the implicit negative adverbs and match them with different verbs. The counter-expectation of these implicit negative adverbs were classified and categorized based on the speakers'intentions, which mainly discusses the semantic condition and construal strategy of implicit negative adverbs. Finally, the construal formula in logic and construal process is analyzed. We conclude that bai, gan, xia, kong, xu, tu, and wang in Mandarin have implicit meanings, which negate the felicity condition of an event. The implicit negative adverbs can express the counter-expectation of the speaker, indicating that the actual situation is different from what the speaker expected. Additionally, the semantic construal of the counter-expectation relates to the evaluative function of the event, which corresponds to the optimistic orientation of human beings. The semantic construal of the implicit negation in Mandarin can help process negative information in both machine translation and teaching Chinese as a foreign language.

TI Detecting variation of emotions in online activities
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB Online text sources form evolving large scale data repositories out of which valuable knowledge about human emotions can be derived. Beyond the primary emotions which refer to the global emotional signals, deeper understanding of a wider spectrum of emotions is important to detect online public views and attitudes. The present work is motivated by the need to test and provide a system that categorizes emotion in online activities. Such a system can be beneficial for online services, companies recommendations, and social support communities. The main contributions of this work are to: (a) detect primary emotions, social ones, and those that characterize general affective states from online text sources, (b) compare and validate different emotional analysis processes to highlight those that are most efficient, and (c) provide a proof of concept case study to monitor and validate online activity, both explicitly and implicitly. The proposed approaches are tested on three datasets collected from different sources, i.e., news agencies, Twitter, and Facebook, and on different languages, i.e., English and Greek. Study results demonstrate that the methodologies at hand succeed to detect a wider spectrum of emotions out of text sources. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Assessing sentence similarity through lexical, syntactic and semantic
   analysis
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB The degree of similarity between sentences is assessed by sentence similarity methods. Sentence similarity methods play an important role in areas such as summarization, search, and categorization of texts, machine translation, etc. The current methods for assessing sentence similarity are based only on the similarity between the words in the sentences. Such methods either represent sentences as bag of words vectors or are restricted to the syntactic information of the sentences. Two important problems in language understanding are not addressed by such strategies: the word order and the meaning of the sentence as a whole. The new sentence similarity assessment measure presented here largely improves and refines a recently published method that takes into account the lexical, syntactic and semantic components of sentences. The new method was benchmarked using Li-McLean, showing that it outperforms the state of the art systems and achieves results comparable to the evaluation made by humans. Besides that, the method proposed was extensively tested using the SemEval 2012 sentence similarity test set and in the evaluation of the degree of similarity between summaries using the CNN-corpus. In both cases, the measure proposed here was proved effective and useful. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB While there are many current approaches to solving the difficulties that come with detecting, tracking, and recognizing a given face in a video sequence, the difficulties arising when there are differences in pose, facial expression, orientation, lighting, scaling, and location remain an open research problem. In this paper we present and perform the study and analysis of a computationally efficient approach for each of the three processes, namely a given template face detection, tracking, and recognition. The proposed algorithms are faster relatively to other existing iterative methods. In particular, we show that unlike such iterative methods, the proposed method does not estimate a given face rotation angle or scaling factor by looking into all possible face rotations or scaling factors. The proposed method looks into segmenting and aligning the distance between two eyes' pupils in a given face image with the image x-axis. Reference face images in a given database are normalized with respect to translation, rotation, and scaling. We show here how the proposed method to estimate a given face image template rotation and scaling factor leads to real-time template image rotation and scaling corrections. This allows the recognition algorithm to be less computationally complex than iterative methods.

AB Image and video content analysis applications typically require functionalities such as object classification, detection and tracking, and activity recognition. Objects may undergo translation, rotation, and changes in scale due to perspective projection. Further, the appearance of objects and illumination conditions may change over time. Occasionally objects might also occlude one another in the scene making consistent classification, detection, and tracking a challenge. To reduce the effect of these limitations it is proposed to model objects in wavelets domain using silhouettes. The silhouette of an object is characterized using projected histograms of sixteen wavelet primitives extracted from a silhouette map of the scene. A classifier based on eigen decomposition of histogram of feature vectors combined with sparse coding prediction is presented. The model of a class is represented as over complete dictionary of sparse codes. For robustness multiple classifiers based on the same sparse code operate in parallel but at different scales. It is combined with spatial histogram classifier to realize a bank of multiple classifiers. The accuracy of the proposed classifier is compared with support vector machine and published state-of the-art results. Accuracy evaluation and real-time performance demonstrates competitive performance with the published stat-of-the-art results.

AB AnHitz is a project promoted by the Basque Government to develop language technologies for the Basque language. The participants in AnHitz are research groups with very different backgrounds: text processing, speech processing and multimedia. The project aims to further develop existing language, speech and visual technologies for Basque: up to now its fruit is a set of 7 different language resources, 9 NLP tools, and 5 applications.. But also, in the last year of this project we are integrating, for the first time, such resources and tools (both existing and generated in the project) into a content management application for Basque with a natural language communication interface.
   This application consists of a Question Answering and a Cross Lingual Information Retrieval system on the area of Science and Technology. The interaction between the system and the user will be in Basque (the results of the CLIR module that are not in Basque will be translated through Machine Translation) using Speech Synthesis, Automatic Speech Recognition and a Visual Interface.
   The various resources, technologies and tools that we are developing are already in a very advanced stage, and the implementation of the content management application to integrate them all is in work and is due to be completed by October 2008.

TI Simultaneous 3D-2D image registration and C-arm calibration: Application
   to endovascular image-guided interventions
SO MEDICAL PHYSICS
AB Purpose: Three-dimensional to two-dimensional (3D-2D) image registration is a key to fusion and simultaneous visualization of valuable information contained in 3D pre-interventional and 2D intra-interventional images with the final goal of image guidance of a procedure. In this paper, the authors focus on 3D-2D image registration within the context of intracranial endovascular image-guided interventions (EIGIs), where the 3D and 2D images are generally acquired with the same C-arm system. The accuracy and robustness of any 3D-2D registration method, to be used in a clinical setting, is influenced by (1) the method itself, (2) uncertainty of initial pose of the 3D image from which registration starts, (3) uncertainty of C-arm's geometry and pose, and (4) the number of 2D intra-interventional images used for registration, which is generally one and at most two. The study of these influences requires rigorous and objective validation of any 3D-2D registration method against a highly accurate reference or "gold standard" registration, performed on clinical image datasets acquired in the context of the intervention.
   Methods: The registration process is split into two sequential, i.e., initial and final, registration stages. The initial stage is either machine-based or template matching. The latter aims to reduce possibly large in-plane translation errors by matching a projection of the 3D vessel model and 2D image. In the final registration stage, four state-of-the-art intrinsic image-based 3D-2D registration methods, which involve simultaneous refinement of rigid-body and C-arm parameters, are evaluated. For objective validation, the authors acquired an image database of 15 patients undergoing cerebral EIGI, for which accurate gold standard registrations were established by fiducial marker coregistration.
   Results: Based on target registration error, the obtained success rates of 3D to a single 2D image registration after initial machine-based and template matching and final registration involving C-arm calibration were 36%, 73%, and 93%, respectively, while registration accuracy of 0.59 mm was the best after final registration. By compensating in-plane translation errors by initial template matching, the success rates achieved after the final stage improved consistently for all methods, especially if C-arm calibration was performed simultaneously with the 3D-2D image registration.
   Conclusions: Because the tested methods perform simultaneous C-arm calibration and 3D-2D registration based solely on anatomical information, they have a high potential for automation and thus for an immediate integration into current interventional workflow. One of the authors' main contributions is also comprehensive and representative validation performed under realistic conditions as encountered during cerebral EIGI.

TI Examining Attention Mechanisms in Deep Learning Models for Sentiment
   Analysis
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Attention-based methods for deep neural networks constitute a technique that has attracted increased interest in recent years. Attention mechanisms can focus on important parts of a sequence and, as a result, enhance the performance of neural networks in a variety of tasks, including sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, machine translation and speech recognition. In this work, we study attention-based models built on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and examine their performance in various contexts of sentiment analysis. Self-attention, global-attention and hierarchical-attention methods are examined under various deep neural models, training methods and hyperparameters. Even though attention mechanisms are a powerful recent concept in the field of deep learning, their exact effectiveness in sentiment analysis is yet to be thoroughly assessed. A comparative analysis is performed in a text sentiment classification task where baseline models are compared with and without the use of attention for every experiment. The experimental study additionally examines the proposed models' ability in recognizing opinions and emotions in movie reviews. The results indicate that attention-based models lead to great improvements in the performance of deep neural models showcasing up to a 3.5% improvement in their accuracy.

TI Expansion segments in bacterial and archaeal 5S ribosomal RNAs
SO RNA
AB The large ribosomal RNAs of eukaryotes frequently contain expansion sequences that add to the size of the rRNAs but do not affect their overall structural layout and are compatible with major ribosomal function as an mRNA translation machine. The expansion of prokaryotic ribosomal RNAs is much less explored. In order to obtain more insight into the structural variability of these conserved molecules, we herein report the results of a comprehensive search for the expansion sequences in prokaryotic 5S rRNAs. Overall, 89 expanded 5S rRNAs of 15 structural types were identified in 15 archaeal and 36 bacterial genomes. Expansion segments ranging in length from 13 to 109 residues were found to be distributed among 17 insertion sites. The strains harboring the expanded 5S rRNAs belong to the bacterial orders Clostridiales, Halanaerobiales, Thermoanaerobacterales, and Alteromonadales as well as the archael order Halobacterales. When several copies of a 5S rRNA gene are present in a genome, the expanded versions may coexist with normal 5S rRNA genes. The insertion sequences are typically capable of forming extended helices, which do not seemingly interfere with folding of the conserved core. The expanded 5S rRNAs have largely been overlooked in 5S rRNA databases.

TI Breast cancer: The translation of big genomic data to cancer precision
   medicine
SO CANCER SCIENCE
AB Cancer is a complex genetic disease that develops from the accumulation of genomic alterations in which germline variations predispose individuals to cancer and somatic alterations initiate and trigger the progression of cancer. For the past 2 decades, genomic research has advanced remarkably, evolving from single-gene to whole-genome screening by using genome-wide association study and next-generation sequencing that contributes to big genomic data. International collaborative efforts have contributed to curating these data to identify clinically significant alterations that could be used in clinical settings. Focusing on breast cancer, the present review summarizes the identification of genomic alterations with high-throughput screening as well as the use of genomic information in clinical trials that match cancer patients to therapies, which further leads to cancer precision medicine. Furthermore, cancer screening and monitoring were enhanced greatly by the use of liquid biopsies. With the growing data complexity and size, there is much anticipation in exploiting deep machine learning and artificial intelligence to curate integrative -omics data to refine the current medical practice to be applied in the near future.

AB Neural networks are powerful technology for classifying character patterns and object images. A huge number of training samples is very important for classification accuracy. A novel method for recognizing handwritten hiragana characters is proposed that combines pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNN) and support vector machines (SVM). The training samples are augmented by pattern distortion such as by cosine translation and elastic distortion. A pre-trained CNN, Alex-Net, can be used as the pattern feature extractor. Alex-Net is pre-trained for large-scale object image datasets. An SVM is used as a trainable classifier. Original hiragana samples of 71 classes on the ETL9B are divided in two-fold by odd and even dataset numbers. Samples with the odd dataset number and augmented patterns on the ETL9B database are trained by the SVM. The feature vectors of character patterns are passed to the SVM from Alex-Net. The average error rate was 2.378% for 100 test patterns of each of the 71 classes for a 5-times test, and the lowest error rate was 2.113% with 468,600 training patterns of distorted hiragana characters. Experimental results showed that the proposed method is effective in recognizing handwritten hiragana characters.

AB A single image captures the appearance and position of multiple entities in a scene as well as their complex interactions. As a consequence, natural language grounded in visual contexts tends to be diverse - with utterances differing as focus shifts to specific objects, interactions, or levels of detail. Recently, neural sequence models such as RNNs and LSTMs have been employed to produce visually-grounded language. Beam Search, the standard work-horse for decoding sequences from these models, is an approximate inference algorithm that decodes the top-B sequences in a greedy left-to-right fashion. In practice, the resulting sequences are often minor rewordings of a common utterance, failing to capture the multimodal nature of source images. To address this shortcoming, we propose Diverse Beam Search (DBS), a diversity promoting alternative to BS for approximate inference. DBS produces sequences that are significantly different from each other by incorporating diversity constraints within groups of candidate sequences during decoding; moreover, it achieves this with minimal computational or memory overhead. We demonstrate that our method improves both diversity and quality of decoded sequences over existing techniques on two visually-grounded language generation tasks - image captioning and visual question generation - particularly on complex scenes containing diverse visual content. We also show similar improvements at language-only machine translation tasks, highlighting the generality of our approach.

AB Sentiment analysis is a hard problem, while multilingual sentiment analysis is even harder due to the different expression styles in different languages. Although many methods for multilingual sentiment analysis have been developed in the open literature, most of them suffer from two major problems. The first is their excessive dependence on external tools or resources (e.g., machine translation systems or bilingual dictionaries), which may not be readily obtained, especially for minority languages; The second is conflictive sentiments, i.e., the sentiment polarity of some parts of a text is inconsistent with its overall sentiment polarity. It is observed that in a product or service review there usually exist a few sentences which play a more important role in determining its sentiment polarity, as compared to others. Therefore, differentiating key sentences from trivial ones may be helpful to improve sentiment analysis. Inspired by this observation in this paper we propose a novel framework to estimate the sentiment polarity of reviews by virtue of opinion lexica and key sentences automatically extracted from unlabelled data. This framework cannot only overcome the problem of excessive dependence on external resources, but also is able to capture the overall sentiment polarity of reviews. Experimental results on realistic review datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework is effective and competitive with the representative baselines.

TI A Shift-Tolerant Dissimilarity Measure for Surface Defect Detection
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB Template matching has been widely used in image processing for visual inspection of complicated, patterned surfaces. The currently existing methods such as golden template matching and normalized cross correlation are very sensitive to the displacement even the object under test is carefully aligned with respect to the template. This paper proposes a dissimilarity measure based on the optical-flow technique for surface defect detection, and aims at light-emitting diode (LED) wafer die inspection. The dissimilarity measure of each pixel derived from the optical flow field does not represent the true translation distance, but is reliable enough to indicate the degree of difference between an image pair. It is well tolerated to misalignment and random product variation. The integral image technique is applied to replace the sum operations in optical flow computation, and speeds up the intensive computation. We also point out the pitfall of the Lucas-Kanade optical flow when it is applied for defect detection, and propose a swapping process to tackle the problem. The experiment on LED wafer dies has shown that the proposed method can achieve a 100% recognition rate based on a test set of 357 die images.

AB The supervisory level of the Detector Control System (DCS) of the CMS experiment is implemented using Finite State Machines (FSM), which model the behaviours and control the operations of all the sub-detectors and support services. The FSM tree of the whole CMS experiment consists of more than 30.000 nodes. An analysis of a system of such size is a complex task but is a crucial step towards the improvement of the overall performance of the FSM system. This paper presents the analysis of the CMS FSM system using the micro Common Representation Language 2 (mcrl2) methodology. Individual mCRL2 models are obtained for the FSM systems of the CMS sub-detectors using the ASF+SDF automated translation tool. Different mCRL2 operations are applied to the mCRL2 models. A mCRL2 simulation tool is used to closer examine the system. Visualization of a system based on the exploration of its state space is enabled with a mCRL2 tool. Requirements such as command and state propagation are expressed using modal mu-calculus and checked using a model checking algorithm. For checking local requirements such as endless loop freedom, the Bounded Model Checking technique is applied. This paper discusses these analysis techniques and presents the results of their application on the CMS FSM system.

AB Locating and fixing bugs is a time-consuming task. Most neural machine translation (NMT) based approaches for automatically bug fixing lack generality and do not make full use of the rich information in the source code. In NMT-based bug fixing, we find some predicted code identical to the input buggy code (called unchanged fix) in NMT-based approaches due to high similarity between buggy and fixed code (e.g., the difference may only appear in one particular line). Obviously, unchanged fix is not the correct fix because it is the same as the buggy code that needs to be fixed. Based on these, we propose an intuitive yet effective general framework (called Fix-Filter-Fix or F-3) for bug fixing. F-3 connects models with our filter mechanism to filter out the last model's unchanged fix to the next. We propose an F-3 theory that can quantitatively and accurately calculate the F-3 lifting effect. To evaluate, we implement the Seq2Seq Transformer (ST) and the AST2Seq Transformer (AT) to form some basic F-3 instances, called F-ST+AT(3) and F-AT+ST(3). Comparing them with single model approaches and many model connection baselines across four datasets validates the effectiveness and generality of F-3 and corroborates our findings and methodology.

TI Paradigm Shift Toward Digital Neuropsychology and High-Dimensional

SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB Neuropsychologists in the digital age have increasing access to emerging technologies. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) initiatives for behavioral and social sciences have emphasized these developing scientific and technological potentials (eg, novel sensors) for augmented characterization of neurocognitive, behavioral, affective, and social processes. Perhaps these innovative technologies will lead to a paradigm shift from disintegrated and data-poor behavioral science to cohesive and data-rich science that permits improved translation from bench to bedside. The 4 main advances influencing the scientific priorities of a recent NIH Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research strategic plan include the following: integration of neuroscience into behavioral and social sciences, transformational advances in measurement science, digital intervention platforms, and large-scale population cohorts and data integration. This paper reviews these opportunities for novel brain-behavior characterizations. Emphasis is placed on the increasing concern of neuropsychology with these topics and the need for development in these areas to maintain relevance as a scientific discipline and advance scientific developments. Furthermore, the effects of such advancements necessitate discussion and modification of training as well as ethical and legal mandates for neuropsychological research and praxes.

TI Masked multi-head self-attention for causal speech enhancement
SO SPEECH COMMUNICATION
AB Accurately modelling the long-term dependencies of noisy speech is critical to the performance of a speech enhancement system. Current deep learning approaches to speech enhancement employ either a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a temporal convolutional network (TCN). However, RNNs and TCNs both demonstrate deficiencies when modelling long-term dependencies. Enter multi-head attention (MHA) - a mechanism that has outperformed both RNNs and TCNs in tasks such as machine translation. By using sequence similarity, MHA possesses the ability to more efficiently model long-term dependencies. Moreover, masking can be employed to ensure that the MHA mechanism remains causal - an attribute critical for real-time processing. Motivated by these points, we investigate a deep neural network (DNN) that utilises masked MHA for causal speech enhancement. The conditions used to evaluate the proposed DNN include real-world non-stationary and coloured noise sources at multiple SNR levels. Our extensive experimental investigation demonstrates that the proposed DNN can produce enhanced speech at a higher quality and intelligibility than both RNNs and TCNs. We conclude that deep learning approaches employing masked MHA are more suited for causal speech enhancement than RNNs and TCNs.

TI Pointwise geometric and semantic learning network on 3D point clouds
SO INTEGRATED COMPUTER-AIDED ENGINEERING
AB The geometric and semantic information of 3D point clouds significantly influence the analysis of 3D point cloud structures. However, semantic learning of 3D point clouds based on deep learning is challenging due to the naturally unordered data structure. In this work, we strive to impart machines with the knowledge of 3D object shapes, thereby enabling them to infer the high-level semantic information from the 3D model. Inspired by the vector of locally aggregated descriptors, we propose indirectly describing the high-level semantic information by associating each point's low-level geometric descriptor with a few visual words. Based on this approach, we design an end-to-end network for 3D shape analysis that combines pointwise low-level geometric and high-level semantic information. The network includes a spatial transform and a uniform operation that make it invariant to input rotation and translation, respectively. Our network also employs pointwise feature extraction and pooling operations to solve the unordered point cloud problem. In a series of experiments with popular 3D shape analysis benchmarks, our network exhibits competitive performance on many important tasks, such as 3D object classification, 3D object part segmentation, semantic segmentation in scenes, and commercial 3D CAD model retrieval.

TI Exploring the Performance of Tagging for the Classical and the Modern
   Standard Arabic
SO ADVANCES IN FUZZY SYSTEMS
AB The part of speech (PoS) tagging is a core component in many natural language processing (NLP) applications. In fact, the PoS taggers contribute as a preprocessing step in various NLP tasks, such as syntactic parsing, information extraction, machine translation, and speech synthesis. In this paper, we examine the performance of a modern standard Arabic (MSA) based tagger for the classical (i.e., traditional or historical) Arabic. In this work, we employed the Stanford Arabic model tagger to evaluate the imperative verbs in the Holy Quran. In fact, the Stanford tagger contains 29 tags; however, this work experimentally evaluates just one that is the VB imperative verb. The testing set contains 741 imperative verbs, which appear in 1,848 positions in the Holy Quran. Despite the previously reported accuracy of the Arabic model of the Stanford tagger, which is 96.26% for all tags and 80.14% for unknown words, the experimental results show that this accuracy is only 7.28% for the imperative verbs. This result promotes the need for further research to expose why the tagging is severely inaccurate for classical Arabic. The performance decline might be an indication of the necessity to distinguish between training data for both classical and MSA Arabic for NLP tasks.

TI Multiword Expression Processing: A Survey
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Multiword expressions (MWEs) are a class of linguistic forms spanning conventional word boundaries that are both idiosyncratic and pervasive across different languages. The structure of linguistic processing that depends on the clear distinction between words and phrases has to be re-thought to accommodate MWEs. The issue of MWE handling is crucial for NLP applications, where it raises a number of challenges. The emergence of solutions in the absence of guiding principles motivates this survey, whose aim is not only to provide a focused review of MWE processing, but also to clarify the nature of interactions between MWE processing and downstream applications. We propose a conceptual framework within which challenges and research contributions can be positioned. It offers a shared understanding of what is meant by MWE processing, distinguishing the subtasks of MWE discovery and identification. It also elucidates the interactions between MWE processing and two use cases: Parsing and machine translation. Many of the approaches in the literature can be differentiated according to how MWE processing is timed with respect to underlying use cases. We discuss how such orchestration choices affect the scope of MWE-aware systems. For each of the two MWE processing subtasks and for each of the two use cases, we conclude on open issues and research perspectives.

TI RPI-Pred: predicting ncRNA-protein interaction using sequence and
   structural information
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB RNA-protein complexes are essential in mediating important fundamental cellular processes, such as transport and localization. In particular, ncRNA-protein interactions play an important role in post-transcriptional gene regulation like mRNA localization, mRNA stabilization, poly-adenylation, splicing and translation. The experimental methods to solve RNA-protein interaction prediction problem remain expensive and time-consuming. Here, we present the RPI-Pred (RNA-protein interaction predictor), a new support-vector machine-based method, to predict protein-RNA interaction pairs, based on both the sequences and structures. The results show that RPI-Pred can correctly predict RNA-protein interaction pairs with similar to 94% prediction accuracy when using sequence and experimentally determined protein and RNA structures, and with similar to 83% when using sequences and predicted protein and RNA structures. Further, our proposed method RPI-Pred was superior to other existing ones by predicting more experimentally validated ncRNA-protein interaction pairs from different organisms. Motivated by the improved performance of RPI-Pred, we further applied our method for reliable construction of ncRNA- protein interaction networks. The RPI-Pred is publicly available at: http://ctsb.is.wfubmc.edu/projects/rpi-pred.

TI Automatic Design of Ensembles of Window Operators for Ocular Image
   Segmentation
SO IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS
AB W-operators are a nonlinear class of locally defined and translation invariant image operators. A W-operator is completely defined and represented by a characteristic function, or classifier, that maps a set of window observations to a set of labels. In this work, we propose a new approach to design W-operators for grayscale image processing. In the proposed approach, we constrain both the space of characteristic functions using artificial feed-forward neural networks and the space of observations using the 2-D Haar wavelet transform. The goal of these constraints is to reduce the cost of design and improve the performance of W-operators for practical applications. Based on this approach, a family or set of W-operators is designed and then combined into a single operator using an ensemble method. We evaluated the performance of this approach in the segmentation of blood vessels in ocular images of the DRIVE database. The results show the suitability of this approach: It outperforms W-operators based on logistic regression without any constraint in the space of observations; aperture filters designed using support vector machines and pyramidal multiresolution, and a fast segmentation using the local thresholding method of Otsu.

TI INTENSITY ESTIMATION OF STATIONARY FIBRE PROCESSES FROM DIGITAL IMAGES
   WITH A LEARNED DETECTOR
SO IMAGE ANALYSIS & STEREOLOGY
AB Stationary fibre processes are processes of curves in a higher dimensional space, whose distribution is translation invariant. In practical applications, they can be used to model several real objects, such as roots, vascular networks and fibres of materials. Often it is required to compare processes showing similar shape, thus a quantitative approach to describe their stochastic geometry is necessary. One of the basic geometric characteristics of these processes is the intensity (i.e., mean total length per unit area or volume). Here, a general computational-statistical approach is proposed for the estimation of this quantity from digital images of the process, thus only planar fibre processes or projections of processes onto a plane are considered. Differently from approaches based on segmentation, it does not depend on the particular application. The statistical estimator of the intensity is proportional to the number of intersections between the process under study and an independent motion invariant test fibre process. The intersections are detected on the real digital image by a learned detector, easily trained by the user. Under rather mild regularity conditions on the fibre process under study, the method also allows to estimate approximate confidence intervals for the intensity, which is useful especially for comparison purposes.

TI Automated image analysis and artificial intelligence in nephropathology
SO NEPHROLOGIE
AB Background The digital transformation of pathology through the widespread use of so-called whole slide scanners offers numerous opportunities for nephropathology, especially with respect to the implementation of computer assistance. Currently, the possibilities of systems based on the use of deep learning, a special technique of information processing, are being intensively explored. Objective The aim is to determine the current state of research regarding applications of deep learning methods for image analysis in nephropathology. Material and methods A literature search was carried out in Web of Science (WOS) and PubMed. For figure one the following search query in WOS was used: ALL= (digital pathology AND AI OR deep learning OR machine learning). Results There are numerous applications of deep learning-based methods to assist in nephropathology. These focus largely on segmentation and quantification of renal histology, although diagnostic classification and synthetic data generation are also increasingly being explored. The translation of these systems into everyday diagnostic practice has not yet taken place. For example, prospective evidence demonstrating the utility of these methods in clinical care is lacking. Conclusion The implementation of digital nephropathology with assistance from deep learning-based methods has great potential. The translational gap should be filled by multicenter prospective interdisciplinary studies in the future.

AB In this paper, a translation from structured sequential programs to equivalent dataflow process networks (DPNs) is presented that is based ,on a carefully chosen set of nodes including load/store operations to access a shared global memory. For every data structure stored in the main memory, we use corresponding tokens to enforce the sequential ordering of load/store operations accessing that data structure as far as needed Except for the load/store nodes, all nodes obey the Kahn principle so that they are deterministic in the sense that the same inputs are always mapped to the same outputs regardless of the execution schedule of the nodes. Due to the sequential ordering of load/store nodes, determinacy is also maintained by them. Moreover, the generated DPNs are quasi-static, i.e., they have schedules that are bounded in a very strict sense: For every statement of the sequential program, the corresponding DPN behaves like a homogeneous synchronous actor, i.e., it consumes one value of each input port and will finally provide one value on each output port. Hence, no more than one value needs to be stored in each buffer.

TI Ramanujan bipartite graph products for efficient block sparse neural
   networks
SO CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB Sparse neural networks are shown to give accurate predictions competitive to denser versions, while also minimizing the number of arithmetic operations performed. However current GPU hardware can only exploit structured sparsity patterns for better efficiency. We propose a framework for generating structured multilevel block sparse neural networks by using the theory of graph products. Our Ramanujan bipartite graph product (RBGP) framework uses products of Ramanujan graphs to obtain the best connectivity for a given level of sparsity. This essentially ensures that the i.) the networks has the structured block sparsity for which runtime efficient algorithms exists, ii.) the model gives high prediction accuracy, due to the better expressive power derived from the connectivity of the graph, iii.) the graph data structure has a succinct representation that can be stored efficiently in memory. We use our framework to design a specific connectivity pattern called RBGP4 which makes efficient use of the memory hierarchy available on GPU. We benchmark our approach on image classification and machine translation tasks with an edge (Jetson Nano 2GB) as well as server (V100) GPUs. When compared with commonly used sparsity patterns like unstructured and block, we obtain significant speedups while achieving the same level of accuracy.

AB Data filtering for machine translation (MT) describes the task of selecting a subset of a given, possibly noisy corpus with the aim to maximize the performance of an MT system trained on this selected data. Over the years, many different filtering approaches have been proposed. However, varying task definitions and data conditions make it difficult to draw a meaningful comparison. In the present work, we aim for a more systematic approach to the task at hand. First, we analyze the performance of language identification, a tool commonly used for data filtering in the MT community and identify specific weaknesses. Based on our findings, we then propose several novel methods for data filtering, based on cross-lingual word embeddings. We compare our approaches to one of the winning methods from the WMT 2018 shared task on parallel corpus filtering on three real-life, high resource MT tasks. We find that said method, which was performing very strong in the WMT shared task, does not perform well within our more realistic task conditions. While we find that our approaches come out at the top on all three tasks, different variants perform best on different tasks. Further experiments on the WMT 2020 shared task for parallel corpus filtering show that our methods achieve comparable results to the strongest submissions of this campaign.

AB The generalization capability of deep neural networks has been substantially improved by applying a wide spectrum of regularization methods, e.g., restricting function space, injecting randomness during training, augmenting data, etc. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective regularization method named progressive self-knowledge distillation (PS-KD), which progressively distills a model's own knowledge to soften hard targets (i.e., one-hot vectors) during training. Hence, it can be interpreted within a framework of knowledge distillation as a student becomes a teacher itself. Specifically, targets are adjusted adaptively by combining the ground-truth and past predictions from the model itself. We show that PS-KD provides an effect of hard example mining by rescaling gradients according to difficulty in classifying examples. The proposed method is applicable to any supervised learning tasks with hard targets and can be easily combined with existing regularization methods to further enhance the generalization performance. Furthermore, it is confirmed that PS-KD achieves not only better accuracy, but also provides high quality of confidence estimates in terms of calibration as well as ordinal ranking. Extensive experimental results on three different tasks, image classification, object detection, and machine translation, demonstrate that our method consistently improves the performance of the state-of-the-art baselines.

SO INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY
AB In this article we present an analysis of the concepts offenxiangandgongxiang -the Mandarin words for 'sharing'-in the context of Chinese social media. We do so through an interrogation of the wordsfenxiangandgongxiangas used by Chinese social media companies. Using the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, we created screenshots of 32 Chinese social network sites between 2000 and 2018 and tracked changes in the usage offenxiangandgongxiangover time. The Mandarin translations in some ways operate like the English word, 'sharing'.Fenxianghas the meaning of participating in social media, andgongxiangrefers to technological aspects of sharing, while also conveying a sense of harmony. However, the interpersonal relations implied byfenxiang, and the political order implied bygongxiang, are quite different from those conveyed by 'sharing'. Together,fenxiangandgongxiangconstruct a convergence of micro-level interpersonal harmony and macro-level social harmony. Thus, the language of sharing becomes the lens through which to observe the subtlety, complexity and idiosyncrasies of the Chinese internet. This article offers a new heuristic for understanding Chinese social media, while also pointing to an important facet of the discursive construction of Chinese social media. This implies a continuing need to de-westernize research into the internet and to identify cultural-specific meanings of social media.

TI Representing local atomic environment using descriptors based on local
   correlations
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Statistical learning of material properties is an emerging topic of research and has been tremendously successful in areas such as representing complex energy landscapes as well as in technologically relevant areas, like identification of better catalysts and electronic materials. However, analysis of large data sets to efficiently learn characteristic features of a complex energy landscape, for example, depends on the ability of descriptors to effectively screen different local atomic environments. Thus, discovering appropriate descriptors of bulk or defect properties and the functional dependence of such properties on these descriptors remains a difficult and tedious process. To this end, we develop a framework to generate descriptors based on many-body correlations that can effectively capture intrinsic geometric features of the local environment of an atom. These descriptors are based on the spectrum of two-body, three-body, four-body, and higher order correlations between an atom and its neighbors and are evaluated by calculating the corresponding two-body, three-body, and four-body overlap integrals. They are invariant to global translation, global rotation, reflection, and permutations of atomic indices. By systematically testing the ability to capture the local atomic environment, it is shown that the local correlation descriptors are able to successfully reconstruct structures containing 10-25 atoms which was previously not possible.

TI Divergence Analysis
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS
AB Growing interest in graphics processing units has brought renewed attention to the Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) execution model. SIMD machines give application developers tremendous computational power; however, programming them is still challenging. In particular, developers must deal with memory and control-flow divergences. These phenomena stem from a condition that we call data divergence, which occurs whenever two processing elements (PEs) see the same variable name holding different values. This article introduces divergence analysis, a static analysis that discovers data divergences. This analysis, currently deployed in an industrial quality compiler, is useful in several ways: it improves the translation of SIMD code to non-SIMD CPUs, it helps developers to manually improve their SIMD applications, and it also guides the automatic optimization of SIMD programs. We demonstrate this last point by introducing the notion of a divergence-aware register spiller. This spiller uses information from our analysis to either rematerialize or share common data between PEs. As a testimony of its effectiveness, we have tested it on a suite of 395 CUDA kernels from well-known benchmarks. The divergence-aware spiller produces GPU code that is 26.21% faster than the code produced by the register allocator used in the baseline compiler.

TI In situ volumetric imaging and analysis of FRESH 3D bioprinted
   constructs using optical coherence tomography
SO BIOFABRICATION
AB As 3D bioprinting has grown as a fabrication technology, so too has the need for improved analytical methods to characterize engineered constructs. This is especially challenging for engineered tissues composed of hydrogels and cells, as these materials readily deform when trying to assess print fidelity and other properties non-destructively. Establishing that the 3D architecture of the bioprinted construct matches its intended anatomic design is critical given the importance of structure-function relationships in most tissue types. Here we report development of a multimaterial bioprinting platform with integrated optical coherence tomography for in situ volumetric imaging, error detection, and 3D reconstruction. We also report improvements to the freeform reversible embedding of suspended hydrogels bioprinting process through new collagen bioink compositions, gelatin microparticle support bath optical clearing, and optimized machine pathing. This enables quantitative 3D volumetric imaging with micron resolution over centimeter length scales, the ability to detect a range of print defect types within a 3D volume, and real-time imaging of the printing process at each print layer. These advances provide a comprehensive methodology for print quality assessment, paving the way toward the production and process control required for achieving regulatory approval and ultimately clinical translation of engineered tissues.

TI Angle-Based Sensor Network Localization
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL
AB This article studies angle-based sensor network localization (ASNL) in a plane, which is to determine locations of all sensors in a sensor network, given locations of partial sensors (called anchors) and angle measurements obtained in the local coordinate frame of each sensor. First, it is shown that a framework with a nondegenerate bilateration ordering must be angle fixable, implying that it can be uniquely determined by angles between edges up to translations, rotations, reflections, and uniform scaling. Then, ASNL is proved to have a unique solution if and only if the grounded framework is angle fixable and anchors are not all collinear. Subsequently, ASNL is solved in centralized and distributed settings, respectively. The centralized ASNL is formulated as a rank-constrained semidefinite program (SDP) in either a noise-free or a noisy scenario, with a decomposition approach proposed to deal with large-scale ASNL. The distributed protocol for ASNL is designed based on intersensor communications. Graphical conditions for equivalence of the formulated rank-constrained SDP and a linear SDP, decomposition of the SDP, as well as the effectiveness of the distributed protocol, are proposed, respectively. Finally, simulation examples demonstrate our theoretical results.

AB Code comments play a significant role in software maintenance as they can greatly improve the efficiency of software developers' program understanding and reduce maintenance costs. However, due to the bad programming habits of developers and tight project development time, the annotations of many projects are incomplete. Studies have shown that project maintainers spend almost half of their time on understanding programs. Accordingly, this paper proposes a dual-encoder-based deep learning method code structure-enhanced comment generation (CSE-GC) to automatically generate annotation texts for Java methods. CSE-GC uses the CSE traversal method to traverse the abstract syntax tree of the Java method; input the structure information obtained by the traversal and vocabulary information of the source code into the gate recurrent unit encoder and convolutional neural network encoder, respectively; and use the attention mechanism to guide the decoder to generate annotations. This study obtained 131,823 Java methods as the training set data to train the model. The final METEOR value on the test set is 30.95%, and the BLEU-4 value is 45.01%. The results demonstrate that the method proposed in this paper has better performance compared to state-of-the-art models.

However, such applications often suffer due to the limited quantity and variety of non-visible spectral domain imagery, in contrast to the high data availability of visible-band imagery that readily enables contemporary deep learning driven detection and classification approaches. To address this problem, this paper proposes and evaluates a novel data augmentation approach that leverages the more readily available visible-band imagery via a generative domain transfer model. The model can synthesise large volumes of non-visible domain imagery by image-to-image (I2I) translation from the visible image domain. Furthermore, we show that the generation of interpolated mixed class (non-visible domain) image examples via our novel Conditional CycleGAN Mixup Augmentation (C2GMA) methodology can lead to a significant improvement in the quality of non-visible domain classification tasks that otherwise suffer due to limited data availability. Focusing on classification within the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) domain, our approach is evaluated on a variation of the Statoil/C-CORE Iceberg Classifier Challenge dataset and achieves 75.4% accuracy, demonstrating a significant improvement when compared against traditional data augmentation strategies (Rotation, Mixup, and MixCycleGAN).

AB Edge and fog computing encompass a variety of technologies that are poised to enable new applications across the Internet that support data capture, storage, processing, and communication across the networking continuum. These environments pose new challenges to the design and implementation of networks - as membership can be dynamic and devices are heterogeneous, widely distributed geographically, and in proximity to end-users, as is the case with mobile and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. We present a demonstration of EdgeVPN.io (Evio for short), an open-source programmable, software-defined network that addresses challenges in the deployment of virtual networks spanning distributed edge and cloud resources, in particular highlighting its use in support of the Kubernetes container orchestration middleware. The demo highlights a deployment of unmodified Kubernetes middleware across a virtual cluster comprising virtual machines deployed both in cloud providers, and in distinct networks at the edge where all nodes are assigned private IP addresses and subject to different NAT (Network Address Translation) middleboxes, connected through an Evio virtual network. The demo includes an overview of the configuration of Kubernetes and Evio nodes and the deployment of Docker-based container pods, highlighting the seamless connectivity for TCP/IP applications deployed on the pods.

TI TRANSGRESSION, FUSION AND DANGEROUS POSSIBILITY. THE GRAPHIC KEYS OF
   GHOST IN THE SHELL
SO CON A DE ANIMACION
AB In 2017, Ghost in the Shell. The Soul of the Machine was released in a real-image version of the animated film Ghost in the Shell, created by Mamoru Oshii in 1995 from the manga of Masamune Shirow Kokaku Kidotai (1989). While the remake tried to honor the plastic universe of the director and the entire saga, its aesthetic approach showed some differences that made the new proposal a technophobic and pessimistic version. The reason is that while this review highlights the human essence as a superior feature, the anime defended cyborg hybridization as a revolutionary attitude and open to the future. To develop that optimistic view, Oshii used three graphic clues that defined the discourse of his film, to highlight the transgressed limits, to represent the fusion of opposites, and to design the dangerous possibilities that the technological future could bring. In our opinion, those three ideas already appeared in a work previous to Oshii's film, which looked to the future in a very similar way: Donna Haraway's "A Cyborg Manifesto" (1991). This article addresses the translation of these theoretical assumptions to their aesthetic representation through animation, a genre that offered Oshii the possibilities with which to create a unique universe.

TI Fine-grained attention for image caption generation
SO MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Despite the progress, generating natural language descriptions for images is still a challenging task. Most state-of-the-art methods for solving this problem apply existing deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models to extract a visual representation of the entire image, based on which the parallel structures between images and sentences are exploited using recurrent neural networks. However, there is an inherent drawback that their models may attend to a partial view of a visual element or a conglomeration of several concepts. In this paper, we present a fine-grained attention based model based on a deep recurrent architecture that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation. The model contains three sub-networks: a deep recurrent neural network for sentences, a deep convolutional network for images, and a region proposal network for nearly cost-free region proposals. Our model is able to automatically learn to fix its gaze on salient region proposals. The process of generating the next word, given the previously generated ones, is aligned with this visual perception experience. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed model on three benchmark datasets (Flickr 8K, Flickr 30K and MS COCO). The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system.

AB We describe MultiSynth, a framework for synthesizing domain-specific programs from a multimodal dataset of examples. Given a domain-specific language (DSL), a dataset is multimodal if there is no single program in the DSL that generalizes over all the examples. Further, even if the examples in the dataset were generalized in terms of a set of programs, the domains of these programs may not be disjoint, thereby leading to ambiguity in synthesis. MultiSynth is a framework that incorporates concepts of synthesizing programs with minimum generality, while addressing the need of accurate prediction. We show how these can be achieved through (i) transformation driven partitioning of the dataset, (ii) least general generalization, for a generalized specification of the input and the output, and (iii) learning to rank, for estimating feature weights in order to map an input to the most appropriate mode in case of ambiguity. We show the effectiveness of our framework in two domains: in the first case, we extend an existing approach for synthesizing programs for XML tree transformations to ambiguous multimodal datasets. In the second case, MultiSynth is used to preorder words for machine translation, by learning permutations of productions in the parse trees of the source side sentences. Our evaluations reflect the effectiveness of our approach.

AB Soldiers, first responders and other personnel operating at the tactical edge increasingly make use of mobile devices to help with tasks such as face recognition, language translation, decision-making and mission planning. Tactical-edge environments are characterized by limited resources, dynamic context, high stress and poor connectivity. This paper focuses on three architecture patterns that address these conditions. The Data Source Integration pattern uses server-side standardized definitions of live or cached geo-located data feeds that can be customized and filtered on a single, map-based user interface on a mobile device. The Group Context Awareness pattern uses context obtained from groups of handheld devices operating as part of a team to make sure that the right information is displayed to the right soldier at the right time. The Cloudlet-Based Cyber-Foraging pattern uses cloudlets as code-offload elements to optimize resources and increase computation power of mobile devices. Cloudlets are discoverable, localized, stateless servers running one or more virtual machines on which users can offload resource-intensive computations from their mobile devices. Prototype applications have been implemented for each of these patterns. Experiment results and participation in exercises have shown the effectiveness of the patterns in addressing the challenges of resource-constrained environments.

TI Mitochondrial Protein Synthesis, Import, and Assembly
SO GENETICS
AB The mitochondrion is arguably the most complex organelle in the budding yeast cell cytoplasm. It is essential for viability as well as respiratory growth. Its innermost aqueous compartment, the matrix, is bounded by the highly structured inner membrane, which in turn is bounded by the intermembrane space and the outer membrane. Approximately 1000 proteins are present in these organelles, of which eight major constituents are coded and synthesized in the matrix. The import of mitochondrial proteins synthesized in the cytoplasm, and their direction to the correct soluble compartments, correct membranes, and correct membrane surfaces/topologies, involves multiple pathways and macromolecular machines. The targeting of some, but not all, cytoplasmically synthesized mitochondrial proteins begins with translation of messenger RNAs localized to the organelle. Most proteins then pass through the translocase of the outer membrane to the intermembrane space, where divergent pathways sort them to the outer membrane, inner membrane, and matrix or trap them in the intermembrane space. Roughly 25% of mitochondrial proteins participate in maintenance or expression of the organellar genome at the inner surface of the inner membrane, providing 7 membrane proteins whose synthesis nucleates the assembly of three respiratory complexes.

TI Replacement Attacks Against VM-protected Applications

CY MAR 03-04, 2012
CL London, ENGLAND
AB Process-level virtualization is increasingly being used to enhance the security of software applications from reverse engineering and unauthorized modification (called software protection). Process-level virtual machines (PVMs) can safeguard the application code at run time and hamper the adversary's ability to launch dynamic attacks on the application. This dynamic protection, combined with its flexibility, ease in handling legacy systems and low performance overhead, has made process-level virtualization a popular approach for providing software protection. While there has been much research on using process-level virtualization to provide such protection, there has been less research on attacks against PVM-protected software. In this paper, we describe an attack on applications protected using process-level virtualization, called a replacement attack. In a replacement attack, the adversary replaces the protecting PVM with an attack VM thereby rendering the application vulnerable to analysis and modification. We present a general description of the replacement attack methodology and two attack implementations against a protected application using freely available tools. The generality and simplicity of replacement attacks demonstrates that there is a strong need to develop techniques that meld applications more tightly to the protecting PVM to prevent such attacks.

AB One of the major problems in the implementation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) or Machine Translation(MT) is a complete lexicon: the place where the systems information about words is stored. There are difficulties in deciding what information should be stored in a lexicon and even greater difficulties in acquiring this information in proper form. OriNet system designed to incorporate multiple lexical database and tools under one consistent functional interface in order to facilitate systems requiring syntactic, semantic and lexical information of Oriya language. We divide the whole work into two independent task. One task is to write the source file that contains the basic lexical data and the content of those files are the lexical substance of OriNet. Lexicographer did the major work of this task. In the second task was to create a set of programs those would accept the source files and processing it ultimately to display for the user. This paper describes an ongoing work on designing an Object Oriented model for OriNet system. The technology of Object Oriented programming in particular the rich library of classes and programming principles in which Java offers. It also provides a convenient tool to conceptualise the process of OriNet system. This technique also allows flexibility and extensibility of the system with more robustness.

AB Different shape representation and classification methods for complex medical lesions were compared using oral lesions as a case study. The problem studied was the discrimination between potentially cancerous lesions, called leukoplakia, and other usually harmless lesions, called lichenoid reactions, which can appear in human oral cavities. The classification problem is difficult because these lesions vary in shape within classes and there are no easily recognizeable characteristics. The representations evaluated were the centroidal profile function, the curvature function, and polar and complex coordinate functions. From these representations, translation, scale and rotation independent features were derived using Fourier transformations, auto-regressive modeling, and Zernike moments. A nonparametric kNN classifier with the leave-one-out cross-validation method was used as a classifier. An overall classification accuracy of about 84% was achieved using only the shape properties of the lesions, compared with a human visual classification rate of 65%. The best results were obtained using complex representation and Fourier/Zernike methods. In clinical practice, the preliminary diagnosis is based mainly on the visual inspection of the oral cavity, using both color, shape and texture as differentiating parameters. This study showed that machine analysis of shape could also play an important part in diagnosis and decisions regarding future treatment.

TI A singular Riemannian geometry approach to Deep Neural Networks I.
   Theoretical foundations
SO NEURAL NETWORKS
AB Deep Neural Networks are widely used for solving complex problems in several scientific areas, such as speech recognition, machine translation, image analysis. The strategies employed to investigate their theoretical properties mainly rely on Euclidean geometry, but in the last years new approaches based on Riemannian geometry have been developed. Motivated by some open problems, we study a particular sequence of maps between manifolds, with the last manifold of the sequence equipped with a Riemannian metric. We investigate the structures induced through pullbacks on the other manifolds of the sequence and on some related quotients. In particular, we show that the pullbacks of the final Riemannian metric to any manifolds of the sequence is a degenerate Riemannian metric inducing a structure of pseudometric space. We prove that the Kolmogorov quotient of this pseudometric space yields a smooth manifold, which is the base space of a particular vertical bundle. We investigate the theoretical properties of the maps of such sequence, eventually we focus on the case of maps between manifolds implementing neural networks of practical interest and we present some applications of the geometric framework we introduced in the first part of the paper.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

   Neurorehabilitation: Ready or Not?
SO NEUROREHABILITATION AND NEURAL REPAIR
AB The development of brain-computer interface-controlled exoskeletons promises new treatment strategies for neurorehabilitation after stroke or spinal cord injury. By converting brain/neural activity into control signals of wearable actuators, brain/neural exoskeletons (B/NEs) enable the execution of movements despite impaired motor function. Beyond the use as assistive devices, it was shown that-upon repeated use over several weeks-B/NEs can trigger motor recovery, even in chronic paralysis. Recent development of lightweight robotic actuators, comfortable and portable real-world brain recordings, as well as reliable brain/neural control strategies have paved the way for B/NEs to enter clinical care. Although B/NEs are now technically ready for broader clinical use, their promotion will critically depend on early adopters, for example, research-oriented physiotherapists or clinicians who are open for innovation. Data collected by early adopters will further elucidate the underlying mechanisms of B/NE-triggered motor recovery and play a key role in increasing efficacy of personalized treatment strategies. Moreover, early adopters will provide indispensable feedback to the manufacturers necessary to further improve robustness, applicability, and adoption of B/NEs into existing therapy plans.

TI Paraphrase thought: Sentence embedding module imitating human language
   recognition
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Sentence embedding is an important research topic in natural language processing. It is essential to generate a good embedding vector that fully reflects the semantic meaning of a sentence in order to achieve an enhanced performance for various natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation and document classification. Thus far, various sentence embedding models have been proposed, and their feasibility has been demonstrated through good performances on tasks following embedding, such as sentiment analysis and sentence classification. However, because the performances of sentence classification and sentiment analysis can be enhanced by using a simple sentence representation method, it is not sufficient to claim that these models fully reflect the meanings of sentences based on good performances for such tasks. In this paper, inspired by human language recognition, we propose the following concept of semantic coherence, which should be satisfied for a good sentence embedding method: similar sentences should be located close to each other in the embedding space. Then, we propose the Paraphrase-Thought (P-thought) model to pursue semantic coherence as much as possible. Experimental results on three paraphrase identification datasets (MS COCO, STS benchmark, SICK) show that the P-thought models outperform the benchmarked sentence embedding methods.

TI Pooled CRISPR screens with imaging on microraft arrays reveals stress
   granule-regulatory factors
SO NATURE METHODS
AB CRISPR-based microraft followed by guide RNA identification (CRaft-ID) combines microraft arrays, microscopy and CRISPR-Cas9 technology for high-content image-based phenotyping. CRaft-ID was used to identify proteins involved in stress granule formation.
   Genetic screens using pooled CRISPR-based approaches are scalable and inexpensive, but restricted to standard readouts, including survival, proliferation and sortable markers. However, many biologically relevant cell states involve cellular and subcellular changes that are only accessible by microscopic visualization, and are currently impossible to screen with pooled methods. Here we combine pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screening with microraft array technology and high-content imaging to screen image-based phenotypes (CRaft-ID; CRISPR-based microRaft followed by guide RNA identification). By isolating microrafts that contain genetic clones harboring individual guide RNAs (gRNA), we identify RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that influence the formation of stress granules, the punctate protein-RNA assemblies that form during stress. To automate hit identification, we developed a machine-learning model trained on nuclear morphology to remove unhealthy cells or imaging artifacts. In doing so, we identified and validated previously uncharacterized RBPs that modulate stress granule abundance, highlighting the applicability of our approach to facilitate image-based pooled CRISPR screens.

AB Neural networks are powerful technology for classifying character patterns and object images. A huge number of training samples is very important for classification accuracy. A novel method for recognizing handwritten hiragana characters is proposed that combines pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNN) and support vector machines (SVM). The training samples are augmented by pattern distortion such as by cosine translation and elastic distortion. A pre-trained CNN, Alex-Net, can be used as the pattern feature extractor. Alex-Net is pre-trained for large-scale object image datasets. An SVM is used as a trainable classifier. Original hiragana samples of 46 classes on the ETL9B are divided in two-fold by odd and even dataset numbers. Samples with the odd dataset number and augmented patterns on the ETL9B database are trained by the SVM. The feature vectors of character patterns are passed to the SVM from Alex-Net. The average error rate was 1.130% for 100 test patterns of each of the 46 classes for a 5-times test, and the lowest error rate was 0.978% with 506138 training patterns of distorted hiragana characters. Experimental results showed that the proposed method is effective in recognizing handwritten hiragana characters.

AB In language processing applications like speech recognition, printed/handwritten character recognition, or statistical machine translation, the language model usually has a major influence on the performance, by introducing context. An increase of context length usually improves perplexity and increases the accuracy of a classifier using such a language model. In this work, the effect of context reduction, i.e. the accuracy difference between a context sensitive, and a context-insensitive classifier is considered. Context reduction is shown to be related to feature omission in the case of single symbol classification. Therefore, the simplest non-trivial case of feature omission will be analyzed by comparing a feature-aware classifier that uses an emission model to a prior-only classifier that statically infers the prior maximizing class only for all observations. Upper and lower tight bounds are presented for the accuracy difference of these model classifiers. The corresponding analytic proofs, though not presented here, were supported by an extensive simulation analysis of the problem, which gave empirical estimates of the accuracy difference bounds. Further, it is shown that the same bounds, though not tightly, also apply to the original case of context reduction. This result is supported by further simulation experiments for symbol string classification.

AB This study proposes a method that classifies Chinese social network positive-negative comments (Weibo) using naive Bayes algorithm trained from English social network (Twitter) corpus. We train our text classifier using Twitter corpus (in English language), and use this classifier to classify Chinese text. In the previous research, Chinese sentences are processed using Chinese word segmentation algorithms before the application of machine learning algorithm. Chinese word segmentation algorithms split Chinese sentences into a series of words since a Chinese word consists of several Chinese characters unlike English sentences. Therefore, the quality of word segmentation algorithm obviously influences the accuracy of Chinese text categorization problems. In our research, we eliminate Chinese word segmentation stage (a traditional preprocessing stage of Chinese text classification) to avoid the effect on the quality of segmentation algorithms. Instead of Chinese word segmentation processing, we translate Chinese text into English text via Google translator. Based on Twitter corpus, we directly generate a text classifier by using naive Bayes multinomial algorithm. Finally, the text classifier classifies a new Chinese text (a Weibo text, which has been translated into English by Google translation at preprocessing stage). We conduct an experiment comparing the performance of naive Bayes multinomial algorithm and C4.5 in terms of accuracy.

TI Intragenomic variation in non-adaptive nucleotide biases causes
   underestimation of selection on synonymous codon usage
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Patterns of non-uniform usage of synonymous codons vary across genes in an organism and between species across all domains of life. This codon usage bias (CUB) is due to a combination of non-adaptive (e.g. mutation biases) and adaptive (e.g. natural selection for translation efficiency/accuracy) evolutionary forces. Most models quantify the effects of mutation bias and selection on CUB assuming uniform mutational and other non-adaptive forces across the genome. However, non-adaptive nucleotide biases can vary within a genome due to processes such as biased gene conversion (BGC), potentially obfuscating signals of selection on codon usage. Moreover, genome-wide estimates of non-adaptive nucleotide biases are lacking for non-model organisms. We combine an unsupervised learning method with a population genetics model of synonymous coding sequence evolution to assess the impact of intragenomic variation in non-adaptive nucleotide bias on quantification of natural selection on synonymous codon usage across 49 Saccharomycotina yeasts. We find that in the absence of a priori information, unsupervised learning can be used to identify genes evolving under different non-adaptive nucleotide biases. We find that the impact of intragenomic variation in non-adaptive nucleotide bias varies widely, even among closely-related species. We show that the overall strength and direction of translational selection can be underestimated by failing to account for intragenomic variation in non-adaptive nucleotide biases. Interestingly, genes falling into clusters identified by machine learning are also physically clustered across chromosomes. Our results indicate the need for more nuanced models of sequence evolution that systematically incorporate the effects of variable non-adaptive nucleotide biases on codon frequencies.
   Author summaryCodon usage bias (CUB), or the unequal usage of codons of the same amino acid (i.e. synonymous codons), has been observed in species across all domains of life. CUB is known to be shaped by both non-adaptive (e.g. mutation biases) and adaptive (e.g. natural selection for translation efficiency/accuracy) evolution. A key challenge for researchers is disentangling the role of various processes shaping codon usage, often for the purpose of identifying codons favored by natural selection, sometimes referred to as "optimal" or "preferred" codons. Despite large variation in non-adaptive nucleotide biases within a genome, most methods to quantify natural selection typically ignore this variation for the sake of simplicity. Here, we combine a population genetics model with unsupervised machine learning to identify genes evolving under different non-adaptive nucleotide biases across 49 budding yeasts species. We find that ignoring for variation in non-adaptive nucleotide biases can obfuscate signals of selection on codon usage. Our results indicate the need for more nuanced models of coding sequence evolution.

TI Leonardo da Vinci's path from painting to military technology
SO HISTORISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT
AB The alleged letter of application from Leonardo da Vinci to the regent of Milan Ludovico Sforza received a lot of attention but is almost always incorrectly dated. It is neither a letter to get an employment, nor does it belong to the beginning of Leonardo's work in Milan. His nine suggestions for improving military technology correspond to studies lasting several years, they are particularly reflected in Leonardo's sketchbook B (1487-1490) and go back to his study of the Italian translation of Valturio's famous war book "De re militari " by Paolo Ramusio in 1483. Further criteria result from Leonardo's activity as an architect at the Milan Cathedral from 1487-1489 and from the doubts attested in July 1489 about his ability as a bronze caster of the large-scale equestrian monument for the founder of the Sforza dynasty. After this re-dating to 1489, Leonardo's letter no longer appears as a series of frivolous assertions, but as the result of preparatory work that he carried out in order to obtain further assignments for himself and his students. His war machines led him to an in-depth study of mechanics in the 1490s.

TI A Survey of Cross-lingual Sentiment Analysis: Methodologies, Models and
   Evaluations
SO DATA SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Cross-lingual sentiment analysis (CLSA) leverages one or several source languages to help the low-resource languages to perform sentiment analysis. Therefore, the problem of lack of annotated corpora in many non-English languages can be alleviated. Along with the development of economic globalization, CLSA has attracted much attention in the field of sentiment analysis and the last decade has seen a surge of researches in this area. Numerous methods, datasets and evaluation metrics have been proposed in the literature, raising the need for a comprehensive and updated survey. This paper fills the gap by reviewing the state-of-the-art CLSA approaches from 2004 to the present. This paper teases out the research context of cross-lingual sentiment analysis and elaborates the following methods in detail: (1) The early main methods of CLSA, including those based on Machine Translation and its improved variants, parallel corpora or bilingual sentiment lexicon; (2) CLSA based on cross-lingual word embedding; (3) CLSA based on multi-BERT and other pre-trained models. We further analyze their main ideas, methodologies, shortcomings, etc., and attempt to reach a conclusion on the coverage of languages, datasets and their performance. Finally, we look into the future development of CLSA and the challenges facing the research area.

TI On the correction of errors in English grammar by deep learning
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB Using computer programs to correct English grammar can improve the efficiency of English grammar correction, improve the effect of error correction, and reduce the workload of manual error correction. In order to deal with and solve the problem of loss evaluation mismatch in the current mainstream machine translation, this study proposes the application of the deep learning method to propose an algorithm model with high error correction performance. Therefore, the framework of confrontation learning network is introduced to continuously improve the optimization model parameters through the confrontation training of discriminator and generator. At the same time, convolutional neural network is introduced to improve the algorithm training effect, which can make the correction sentences generated by the model generator better in confrontation. In order to verify the performance of the algorithm model, P-value, R-value, F-0.5-value, and MRR-value were selected for the comprehensive evaluation of the model performance index. The simulation results of the CoNLL-2014 test set and Lang-8 test set show that the proposed algorithm model has significant performance improvement compared with the traditional transformer method and can correct the fluency of sentences. It has good application values.

TI AI for Doctors-A Course to Educate Medical Professionals in Artificial
   Intelligence for Medical Imaging
SO HEALTHCARE
AB Successful adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging requires medical professionals to understand underlying principles and techniques. However, educational offerings tailored to the need of medical professionals are scarce. To fill this gap, we created the course "AI for Doctors: Medical Imaging ". An analysis of participants' opinions on AI and self-perceived skills rated on a five-point Likert scale was conducted before and after the course. The participants' attitude towards AI in medical imaging was very optimistic before and after the course. However, deeper knowledge of AI and the process for validating and deploying it resulted in significantly less overoptimism with respect to perceivable patient benefits through AI (p = 0.020). Self-assessed skill ratings significantly improved after the course, and the appreciation of the course content was very positive. However, we observed a substantial drop-out rate, mostly attributed to the lack of time of medical professionals. There is a high demand for educational offerings regarding AI in medical imaging among medical professionals, and better education may lead to a more realistic appreciation of clinical adoption. However, time constraints imposed by a busy clinical schedule need to be taken into account for successful education of medical professionals.

TI Self-attention-based conditional random fields latent variables model

SO PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS
AB To process data like text and speech, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a valuable tool. As on of NLP?s upstream tasks, sequence labeling is a vital part of NLP through techniques like text classification, machine translation, and sentiment analysis. In this paper, our focus is on sequence labeling where we assign semantic labels within input sequences. We present two novel frameworks, namely SA-CRFLV-I and SA-CRFLV-II, that use latent variables within random fields. These frameworks make use of an encoding schema in the form of a latent variable to be able to capture the latent structure in the observed data. SA-CRFLV-I shows the best performance at the sentence level whereas SA-CRFLV-II works best at the word level. In our in-depth experimental results, we compare our frameworks with 4 well-known sequence prediction methodologies which include NER, reference parsing, chunking as well as POS tagging. The proposed frameworks are shown to have better performance in terms of many well-known metrics.

TI An Energy-Efficient and Noise-Tolerant Recurrent Neural Network Using
   Stochastic Computing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VERY LARGE SCALE INTEGRATION (VLSI) SYSTEMS
AB Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are widely used to solve a large class of recognition problems, including prediction, machine translation, and speech recognition. The hardware implementation of RNNs is, however, challenging due to the high area and energy consumption of these networks. Recently, stochastic computing (SC) has been considered for implementing neural networks and reducing the hardware consumption. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient and noise-tolerant long short-term memory-based RNN using SC. In this SC-RNN, a hybrid structure is developed by utilizing SC designs and binary circuits to improve the hardware efficiency without significant loss of accuracy. The area and energy consumption of the proposed design are between 1.6%-2.3% and 6.5%41.2%, respectively, of a 32-bit floating-point (FP) implementation. The SC-RNN requires significantly smaller area and lower energy consumption in mast cases compared to an 8-bit fixed point implementation. The proposed design achieves a higher noise tolerance compared to binary implementations. The inference accuracy is from 10% to 13% higher than an FP design when the noise level is high in the computation process.

TI Using Smartphones Physical Interfaces in Engineering Education:
   Experiences in Promoting Student Motivation and Learning
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION
AB Smartphones are already taking part of the everyday life of more than two and a half billion people. University students are one of the population groups in which smartphone penetration is more intense. Applications for activities organization, voting, translation, information sharing, flashcarding, etc. are already of general use. However, despite the considerable big number of available data acquisition and analysis applications, few learning activities take advantage of the smartphone physical interfacing capabilities (accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometer, microphone, camera, flashlight, loudspeaker), which, due to the present computing power of smartphones, are excellent. This leads to infer that smartphones could be a relevant tool for enhancing the teaching-learning process in technical studies. Students attending to engineering careers are an especially adequate target for smartphone aided teaching due to their training in the use of computers and other electronic equipment and their strong previous knowledge in fields as programming or quantitative data management. In this work, the data acquisition capability of smartphones is studied, different teaching-learning activities based on this capability are proposed, and the impact of the introduction of three representative smartphone based learning activities, as balancing of shafts, evaluation of stick-slip instabilities or machine acoustic power measurement, is analyzed.

AB On language generation system such as chatbot and machine translation, there is a recent approach called sequence to sequence learning. This approach takes advantages of two recurrent neural networks (encoder and decoder) as an end-to-end mapping tool to generatively build the output from a certain input. In this paper, we try to find a combination of topology and feature which produces the highest result according to automatic evaluation metrics BLEU for non-task-oriented chatbot as the case study. The topologies used in the experiment are RNN, GRU, and LSTM along with their modifications, which are bidirectional encoder and attention-based decoder. The features used in the experiment are word-based feature and character-based feature. The experiment is conducted using Papaya English dialogue dataset. From the dataset, ten thousand pairs of conversation are picked for training data and a thousand pairs of conversation are picked for testing data. The result shows that bidirectional LSTM encoder with attention-based decoder and word based feature produced the highest cumulative BLEU-4 score amongst other topologies, which is 0.31.

AB This paper presents a first attempt of leveraging Wikipedia knowledge to represent textual news stories as vectors of Wikipedia concepts, and analysis its suitability for creating a cross-language classifier of textual news stories written in Spanish when it is trained only with English ones. We describe two approaches. The first one is based only on Wikipedia concepts to represent the news stories (WikiBoC-CLCM). The second approach (Hybrid-WikiBoC) combines the WikiBoC-CLCM classifier with the state-of-the-art approach based on the bag of words model along with machine translation techniques (BoW-MT). To evaluate the approaches proposed we present a dataset composed of news written in English and Spanish, extracted from several online newspapers and news agencies such as Reuters and Europa Press. The results obtained show that the purely based on concepts WikiBoC-CLCM approach offers the highest classification performance, achieving increases up to 55.07% over the state-of-the-art BoW-MT approach. The Hybrid-WikiBoC approach also outperforms the BoW-MT model, achieving performance increases up to 2.34%.

TI Comparison of Wind Power Converter Reliability With Low-Speed and
   Medium-Speed Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Generators
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS
AB More and more wind turbine manufacturers turn to using the full-scale power electronic converter due to the stricter grid code requirements to thoroughly decouple the generator from the grid connection. However, a commonly used type of this generator is still unclear, where the selections of the low-speed (LS; direct-drive) and medium-speed (MS; one-stage) permanent-magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs) are both promising solutions. This paper will assess and compare the reliability metrics for the machine-side converter (MSC) for those two configurations. First, a translation from the mission profile of the turbine to the current and voltage loading of each power semiconductor is achieved based on synchronous generator modeling. Afterward, a simplified approach to calculate the loss profile and the thermal profile is used to determine the most stressed power semiconductors in the converter. Finally, according to the lifetime power cycles, the lifespan can be calculated when operating in various wind classes. It is concluded that, although the LS PMSG is able to eliminate the gearbox, the lifespan of its MSC is lower than the one-stage MS generator.

TI Cephalometric investigation of craniomaxillofacial structures during the
   prenatal period: A cadaver study
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ORTHODONTICS AND DENTOFACIAL ORTHOPEDICS
AB Introduction: We aimed to investigate the morphometric development of the cranial base and its related structures, and their growth rate changes from the ninth gestational week to full term in a large group of human fetuses. Methods: We selected 203 (109 male, 94 female) fetuses between 9 and 40 weeks of gestation and without any external anomalies. From each fetus, standard lateral and posteroanterior cephalometric images were taken using a dental digital panoramic and cephalometric x-ray machine. Fourteen linear and 9 angular parameters were measured. Results: The cranial base angle showed a statistically significant increase between the groups from only the second to the third trimester periods. The sagittal translation of the maxilla increased during the prenatal period, whereas the mandibular sagittal relation grew at a steady rate. The vertical plane angles of the maxilla and the mandible did not show any significant changes. The maxillary length to mandibular length ratio remained stable. Conclusions: The cranial base angle increased, especially in the second through the third trimesters. The maxilla and the mandible demonstrated different growth patterns in the sagittal direction. The findings of this study could be a guide for interpreting the relationships among the craniofacial structures.

TI Word-level and phrase-level strategies for figurative text
   identification
SO MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Metaphors are a common language tool used in communication that widely exist in natural language. Metaphor detection is beneficial to improving the performance of natural language processing tasks such as machine translation. The current metaphor detection method captures the semantic incoherence of the metaphorical word and its surrounding text. However, it ignores the different contributions of phrases and words. In addition, word information and its contextual information should be deeply integrated. We propose a learning framework that combines word representations, contextual representations and combined representations. Specifically, we establish word-level and phrase-level attention mechanisms to learn enhanced feature representations. For the word-level attention, we extract word embedding, part-of-speech (POS) and distance features as multilevel representations and use multi-attention to obtain weight information. For the phrase-level attention, the IndRNN and self-attention are employed to obtain the deep semantic representation of the sentence. By using this strategy, our model has the ability to mine richer semantic representations. Experiments on the VUA metaphor corpus show that our method achieves an F-score of 69.7% on the test dataset, thereby surpassing the scores of all the existing models by a considerable margin.

TI Insulin signaling regulates longevity through protein phosphorylation in
   Caenorhabditis elegans
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Insulin/IGF-1 Signaling (IIS) is known to constrain longevity by inhibiting the transcription factor FOXO. How phosphorylation mediated by IIS kinases regulates lifespan beyond FOXO remains unclear. Here, we profile IIS-dependent phosphorylation changes in a large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of wild-type and three IIS mutant Caenorhabditis elegans strains. We quantify more than 15,000 phosphosites and find that 476 of these are differentially phosphorylated in the long-lived daf-2/insulin receptor mutant. We develop a machine learning-based method to prioritize 25 potential lifespan-related phosphosites. We perform validations to show that AKT-1 pT492 inhibits DAF-16/FOXO and compensates the loss of daf-2 function, that EIF-2 alpha pS49 potently inhibits protein synthesis and daf-2 longevity, and that reduced phosphorylation of multiple germline proteins apparently transmits reduced DAF-2 signaling to the soma. In addition, an analysis of kinases with enriched substrates detects that casein kinase 2 (CK2) subunits negatively regulate lifespan. Our study reveals detailed functional insights into longevity. How phosphorylation mediated by Insulin/IGF-1 Signaling kinases regulates lifespan remains unclear. Here the authors perform a large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of wildtype and IIS mutant C. elegans strains to reveal detailed functional insights into longevity.

TI A Sonification of Cross-Cultural Differences in Happiness-Related Tweets
SO JOURNAL OF THE AUDIO ENGINEERING SOCIETY
AB We report an approach to communicating cross-cultural differences in sentiment data through sonification. Sonification is a powerful technique for the translation of patterns into sound that is understandable, accessible, and musically pleasant. A machine-learning classifier was trained on sentiment information of two samples of Tweets with the keyword of "happiness," from Singapore and New York. Positively valenced words, which we argue relate to the concept of "happiness," showed stronger influences on the classifier than negative words. For mapping, Tweet frequency differences of the semantic variable "anticipation" affected tempo, "positive" affected pitch, "joy" affected loudness, and "trust" affected rhythmic regularity. We evaluated a sonification of the original two cities' data, together with a control condition generated from random mappings, in a listening experiment. Results suggest that the original was rated as significantly more pleasant. No effects were found on ratings of interest or confidence in hearing a difference. We claim that our statistically informed approach to sonification enabled the making of better aesthetic decisions in the design of a pleasant listening experience. Further studies might employ extensive sentiment analysis of social media data and sonification with more input parameters and facilitate the communication of statistical results and a nuanced understanding of cross-cultural differences.

TI Leveraging Wikipedia knowledge to classify multilingual biomedical
   documents
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE
AB This article presents a classifier that leverages Wikipedia knowledge to represent documents as vectors of concepts weights, and analyses its suitability for classifying biomedical documents written in any language when it is trained only with English documents. We propose the cross-language concept matching technique, which relies on Wikipedia interlanguage links to convert concept vectors between languages. The performance of the classifier is compared to a classifier based on machine translation, and two classifiers based on MetaMap. To perform the experiments, we created two multilingual corpus. The first one, Multi-Lingual UVigoMED (ML-UVigoMED) is composed of 23,647 Wikipedia documents about biomedical topics written in English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Galician, Romanian, and Icelandic. The second one, English-French-Spanish-German UVigoMED (EFSG-UVigoMED) is composed of 19,210 biomedical abstract extracted from MEDLINE written in English, French, Spanish, and German. The performance of the approach proposed is superior to any of the state-of-the art classifier in the benchmark. We conclude that leveraging Wikipedia knowledge is of great advantage in tasks of multilingual classification of biomedical documents. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Automated musical genre classification using machine learning techniques has gained popularity for research and development of powerful tools to organize music collections available on web. Mel cepstral co-efficients (MFCC's) have been successfully used in music genre classification but they do not reflect the correlation between the adjacent co-efficients of Mel filters of a frame neither the relation between adjacent co-efficients of Mel filters of neighboring frames. This leads to loss of useful features. In this work, Hu moment based features are extracted from the spectrogram to study impact of energy concentration in the spectrogram. Under different musical genres the difference in rhythm in genres drastically changes the texture of spectrogram image. This alters the energy concentration in spectrogram. Hu moments being invariant to translation, scaling as well as rotation can capture useful features from spectrogram that are not considered by the MFCC's. Since the spectral moments are computed locally, they can assess the intensity of energy concentration at certain frequencies in spectrogram and prove as distinct features in characterizing different genres of music. Hu moment based features along with conventional music features lead to an accuracy of 83.33% for classifying 5 genres.

AB Superpixels are frequently used in pixel-level preprocessing for recognition purposes because they enable regional representation. Because dense motion contains more dynamic information for consecutive frames than pixels, it is beneficial for the task of video recognition. Correspondingly, we introduce motion superpixels in motion space, which are independently constructed per frame using superpixels extracted via energy driven sampling (SEEDS) and temporally tracked based on the nearest neighbourhood within consecutive flow fields. To define temporal information features, we track superpixels based on its central masses and descript the evolution of three motion based features namely histogram of flow (HOF), neighbourhood correlations, and centre of mass itself. Furthermore, we use the integrations of wavelet packet decomposition coefficients to achieve invariant scale and translation of sampled subsequences within a video sequence while also enrich features. To form sparseness of feature vectors, bag of features and generalized Histogram Kernel Support Vector Machine (HK-SVM) are used as learning algorithms. In our findings, firstly, various sizes of flow localisations are useful to improve recognition and secondly, spatio temporal dynamics of events can be covered by using wavelet packet either along space or time in which also improving accuracies. We demonstrate our results using the egocentric videos of JPL First-Person Interaction dataset and wild sport videos of UCF Sports dataset.

TI Laughter, Music, and Memory at the Moment of Danger: Tsvetaeva's Mother
   and Music in Light of Modernist Memory Practices
SO SLAVIC REVIEW
AB In this article, Monika Greenleaf shows how Marina Tsvetaeva protested the erasure of her generation's intimate and embodied styles of memory by postrevolutionary historical narrative. While Soviet writers began to disappear into the Lubianka, labor camps, translation programs, children's literature, and silence in the 1930s, exiled writers found themselves in European capitals contesting the keys to legitimate memory before the emigration's fractured milieux de memoire. In a piece written for oral performance in Paris, Tsvetaeva uses Bergson's famous techniques of bodily and musical memory-retrieval and comic revelation of temporal rhythms and archetypes to frame her childhood memoir as an exemplary mimetic rite for her generation. Bergson's synergistic theory of "matter and memory" promised total recall, whereas Walter Benjamin's meditation on the different nature of memories that "flash up at the moment of danger" offers new insight into the fiercely selective comic scenes her mnemonic technique "produces." Greenleaf's examination poses the question: What is the nature of the past that involuntarily repeats itself through our bodies and the very configuration of our imaginations: living Being or copying machine? Is the poet's act of memory socially useful or dangerous and "mad"? Mimesis according to Aristotle or Plato?

TI Detecting and locating burrs of industrial parts
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB Burrs (excess material) are usually squeezed out around the periphery of the mould, and are irregular and vary considerably between parts. This paper aims at the development of a machine vision system for automatic detection of burrs and peripheral defects of casting parts. This non-contact detection result can be applied to automatic deburring systems and used for automatic inspection of peripheral breakdown.
   This research concentrates on flat casting parts comprising piecewise smooth curves on the boundaries. The detection procedure is based on the fact that the irregular burrs show high curvature changes in a small segment of the boundary, whereas a smooth segment without burrs presents a succession of low curvature points. Given a casting part with burrs, we arbitrarily select a few boundary points from the smooth segments and connect these points to form a polygon. The matching process then finds a corresponding polygon from the model part. The transformation parameters of rotational angle and translation between the part in the image and the model part are evaluated from these two equivalent polygons. The proposed matching algorithm is computationally fast and the time complexity is bounded by O(m), where m is the number of points on the digital boundary of the model part.

Additionally, the biosafety evaluation applications of theoretical simulations of biomaterials are presented. Finally, the challenges and future prospects of such computational simulations for biomaterials development are clarified. It is anticipated that these simulations would offer various methodologies for facilitating the development and future clinical translations/utilization of versatile biomaterials.

SO FRONTIERS IN BLOCKCHAIN
AB The rapid upswing in interest in federated learning (FL) and federated analytics (FA) architectures has corresponded with the rapid increase in commercial AI software products, ranging from face detection and language translation to connected IOT devices, smartphones, and autonomous vehicles equipped with high-resolution sensors. However, the traditional client-server model does not readily address questions of data ownership, privacy, and data location in the context of the multiple datasets required for machine learning. In this paper, we report on a pilot distributed ledger and smart contract network model, designed to track analytic jobs in an HPC supercomputing environment. The test system design integrates the FL/FA model into a blockchain-based network architecture, wherein the test system records interactions with the global server and blockchain network. The design goal is to create a secure audit trail of supercomputer analytic operations and the ability to securely federate those operations across multiple supercomputer deployments. As there are still relatively few real-world applications of FL/FA models and blockchain networks in use, our system design, test deployment, and sample code are intended to provide interested researchers with exploratory tools for future research.

   Neural Networks
SO COMPLEXITY
AB The annotated dataset is an essential requirement to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system effectively and expect the generalization of the predictive models and to avoid overfitting. Lack of the training data is a big barrier so that AI systems can broaden in several domains which have no or missing training data. Building these datasets is a tedious and expensive task and depends on the domains and languages. This is especially a big challenge for low-resource languages. In this paper, we experiment and evaluate many various approaches on sentiment analysis problems so that they can still obtain high performances under limited training data. This paper uses the preprocessing techniques to clean and normalize the data and generate the new samples from the limited training dataset based on many text augmentation techniques such as lexicon substitution, sentence shuffling, back translation, syntax-tree transformation, and embedding mixup. Several experiments have been performed for both well-known machine learning-based classifiers and deep learning models. We compare, analyze, and evaluate the results to indicate the advantage and disadvantage points of the techniques for each approach. The experimental results show that the data augmentation techniques enhance the accuracy of the predictive models; this promises that smart systems can be applied widely in several domains under limited training data.

TI A roadmap for translational cancer glycoimmunology at single cell

SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH
AB Cancer cells can evade immune responses by exploiting inhibitory immune checkpoints. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies based on anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies have been extensively explored over the recent years to unleash otherwise compromised anti-cancer immune responses. However, it is also well established that immune suppression is a multifactorial process involving an intricate crosstalk between cancer cells and the immune systems. The cancer glycome is emerging as a relevant source of immune checkpoints governing immunosuppressive behaviour in immune cells, paving an avenue for novel immunotherapeutic options. This review addresses the current state-of-the-art concerning the role played by glycans controlling innate and adaptive immune responses, while shedding light on available experimental models for glycoimmunology. We also emphasize the tremendous progress observed in the development of humanized models for immunology, the paramount contribution of advances in high-throughput single-cell analysis in this context, and the importance of including predictive machine learning algorithms in translational research. This may constitute an important roadmap for glycoimmunology, supporting careful adoption of models foreseeing clinical translation of fundamental glycobiology knowledge towards next generation immunotherapies.

TI Emerging trends: Deep nets for poets
SO NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING
AB Deep nets have done well with early adopters, but the future will soon depend on crossing the chasm. The goal of this paper is to make deep nets more accessible to a broader audience including people with little or no programming skills, and people with little interest in training new models. A github is provided with simple implementations of image classification, optical character recognition, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, question answering (QA/SQuAD), machine translation, speech to text (SST), and speech recognition (STT). The emphasis is on instant gratification. Non-programmers should be able to install these programs and use them in 15 minutes or less (per program). Programs are short (10-100 lines each) and readable by users with modest programming skills. Much of the complexity is hidden behind abstractions such as pipelines and auto classes, and pretrained models and datasets provided by hubs: PaddleHub, PaddleNLP, HuggingFaceHub, and Fairseq. Hubs have different priorities than research. Research is training models from corpora and fine-tuning them for tasks. Users are already overwhelmed with an embarrassment of riches (13k models and 1k datasets). Do they want more? We believe the broader market is more interested in inference (how to run pretrained models on novel inputs) and less interested in training (how to create even more models).

TI Artificial intelligence image recognition of melanoma and basal cell
   carcinoma in racially diverse populations
SO JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGICAL TREATMENT
AB Background Artificial intelligence (AI) image recognition models have been relatively successful in diagnosing cutaneous manifestations in individuals with light skin tone. However, when these models are tested on the same cutaneous manifestations in individuals with darker or brown skin tone, the performance of the model drops due to a paucity of such images available for model training. Objective The objective of this study was to improve the performance of AI models in recognizing cutaneous diseases in individuals with darker skin tone. Methods Unsupervised computer darkening of skin color with preservation of the dermatological disease/lesion characteristics in images of light-skinned individuals with basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and melanoma was performed. Results Training an AI model on these artificially "darkened" images as compared to training on the original "light-skinned" images resulted in a higher sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, F-1 score and area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of the AI model in differentiating between BCC and melanoma in individuals with brown skin tone. Conclusion Use of unsupervised image to image translation in medical AI image recognition models has the potential to significantly improve their accuracy in diagnosing diseases in individuals with racially diverse skin tone.

AB Truecasing is the process of finding the proper capitalization of words in a text where the correct case information of the word is not given. The case of letters is often lost while performing language translation from non-capitalized languages (eg: Japanese, Arabic, Hindi) to capitalized languages (eg: Greek, Latin, English). In Optical Character Recognition (OCR) where the different cases for letters like `p' and `P' are similar, the case as well as the context and proper meaning of the text is lost. A similar situation is observed for text generated from Automatic Speech Recognition. This paper proposes to solve the problem of truecasing while focusing on three different architectures, all based on transformers. Transformers have generally proved to outperform recurrent and convolutional models. A proposal for a novel light-weight transformer architecture has been made which performs competitively with existing models that are computationally expensive. To provide a basis for comparison, two existing transformer architectures were fine-tuned for truecasing - BERT and GPT-2. These architectures are analyzed and compared on various metrics. The proposed architecture shows an accuracy of 98.25%, which is also an improvement of 0.41 against the current state-of-art. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The premise of this translation tutorial is that human rights serves as a complementary framework - in addition to Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics - for guiding and governing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning research and development. Attendees will participate in a case study, which will demonstrate show how a human rights framework, grounded in international law, fundamental values, and global systems of accountability, can offer the technical community a practical approach to addressing global AI risks and harms. This tutorial discusses how human rights frameworks can inform, guide and govern AI policy and practice in a manner that is complementary to Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics (FATE) frameworks. Using the case study of researchers developing a facial recognition API at a tech company and its use by a law enforcement client, we will engage the audience to think through the benefits and challenges of applying human rights frameworks to AI system design and deployment. We will do so by providing a brief overview of the international human rights law, and various non-binding human rights frameworks in relation to our current discussions around FATE and then apply them to contemporary debates and case studies

AB Business process monitoring techniques have been investigated in depth over the last decade to enable organizations to deliver process insight. Recently, a new stream of work in predictive business process monitoring leveraged deep learning techniques to unlock the potential business value locked in process execution event logs. These works use Recurrent Neural Networks, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and suffer from misinformation and accuracy as they use the last hidden state (as the context vector) for the purpose of predicting the next event. On the other hand, in operational processes, traces may be very long, which makes the above methods inappropriate for analyzing them. In addition, in predicting the next events in a running case, some of the previous events should be given a higher priority. To address these shortcomings, in this paper, we present a novel approach inspired by the notion of attention mechanism, utilized in Natural Language Processing and, particularly, in Neural Machine Translation. Our proposed approach uses all hidden states to accurately predict future behavior and the outcome of individual activities. Experimental evaluation of real-world event logs revealed that the use of attention mechanisms in the proposed approach leads to a more accurate prediction.

AB Home appliance test is an essential part of the R&D process. However, since home appliance test must be carried out under certain circumstances, it makes the development cycle longer. If it is possible to predicting the home appliance test data, it will improve the efficiency of home appliance development. Sequence to sequence model has been proved that it has a strong ability to map the input sequence and output sequence and it has been widely used in machine translation tasks. In order to solve the home appliance test data prediction problem, we firstly tried to apply sequence to sequence model to predict numerically continuous time series data. Our experiments proved that our model can predict the data of relatively long-time steps when inputting data of relatively short time steps. In our experiment, the mean absolute percentage error of the prediction of our model is about 0.1%. Our approach has a strong generalization ability and performs well in different experimental scenarios. Finally, we believe that the sequence to sequence method performs satisfactorily on prediction problems for continuous time series data. With this model, we can obtain more accurate results than traditional methods and it is meaningful for the R&D of home appliances.

TI Bilingual embeddings with random walks over multilingual wordnets
SO KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS
AB Bilingual word embeddings represent words of two languages in the same space, and allow to transfer knowledge from one language to the other without machine translation. The main approach is to train monolingual embeddings first and then map them using bilingual dictionaries. In this work, we present a novel method to learn bilingual embeddings based on multilingual knowledge bases (KB) such as Word Net. Our method extracts bilingual information from multilingual wordnets via random walks and learns a joint embedding space in one go. We further reinforce cross-lingual equivalence adding bilingual constraints in the loss function of the popular Skip-gram model. Our experiments on twelve cross-lingual word similarity and relatedness datasets in six language pairs covering four languages show that: 1) our method outperforms the state-of-the-art mapping method using dictionaries; 2) multilingual wordnets on their own improve over text-based systems in similarity datasets; 3) the combination of wordnet-generated information and text is key for good results. Our method can be applied to richer KBs like DBpedia or BabelNet, and can be easily extended to multilingual embeddings. All our software and resources are open source. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI High-precision quality assurance of robotic couches with six degrees of
   freedom
SO PHYSICA MEDICA-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PHYSICS
AB A robotic couch capable of six degrees of freedom (6-DoF) of motion was introduced for state-of-the-art radiation therapy. Patient treatment requires precise quality assurance (QA) of 6-DoF. Unfortunately, conventional methods do not provide the requisite accuracy and precision. Therefore, we developed a high-precision automated QA system using a visual tracking system (VTS). The VTS comprises four motion-sensing cameras, a cube with infrared reflective markers. To acquire data in treatment room coordinates, a transformation matrix from VTS coordinates to treatment room coordinates was determined.
   The mean error and standard deviation of linear and rotational motions, as well as couch sagging were analyzed from continuously acquired images in the moving couch. The accuracy of VTS was 0.024 mm deviation for the sinusoidal motion, and the accuracy of the transformation matrix was 0.02 mm. In a cross-comparison, the difference between Laser Tracker (FARO) measurements was 0.14 +/- 0.12 mm for translation and 0.032 +/- 0.026 degrees on average for yaw rotation. The new system provides QA of yaw, pitch and roll motion as well as sagging of the couch and sub-millimeter/degree accuracy together with precision.

TI Feature extraction in Brazilian Sign Language Recognition based on
   phonological structure and using RGB-D sensors
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB In contrast to speech recognition, whose speech features have been extensively explored in the research literature, feature extraction in Sign Language Recognition (SLR) is still a very challenging problem. In this paper we present a methodology for feature extraction in Brazilian Sign Language (BSL, or LIBRAS in Portuguese) that explores the phonological structure of the language and relies on RGB-D sensor for obtaining intensity, position and depth data. From the RGB-D images we obtain seven vision-based features. Each feature is related to one, two or three structural elements in BSL. We investigate this relation between extracted features and structural elements based on shape, movement and position of the hands. Finally we employ Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify signs based on these features and linguistic elements. The experiments show that the attributes of these elements can be successfully recognized in terms of the features obtained from the RGB-D images, with accuracy results individually above 80% on average. The proposed feature extraction methodology and the decomposition of the signs into their phonological structure is a promising method to help expert systems designed for SLR. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI HspB8 Participates in Protein Quality Control by a Non-chaperone-like
   Mechanism That Requires eIF2 alpha Phosphorylation
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Aggregation of mutated proteins is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington disease. We previously reported that overexpression of the HspB8 . Bag3 chaperone complex suppresses mutated huntingtin aggregation via autophagy. Classically, HspB proteins are thought to act as ATP-independent molecular chaperones that can bind unfolded proteins and facilitate their processing via the help of ATP-dependent chaperones such as the Hsp70 machine, in which Bag3 may act as a molecular link between HspB, Hsp70, and the ubiquitin ligases. However, here we show that HspB8 and Bag3 act in a non-canonical manner unrelated to the classical chaperone model. Rather, HspB8 and Bag3 induce the phosphorylation of the alpha-subunit of the translation initiator factor eIF2, which in turn causes a translational shut-down and stimulates autophagy. This function of HspB8 . Bag3 does not require Hsp70 and also targets fully folded substrates. HspB8 . Bag3 activity was independent of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress kinase PERK, demonstrating that its action is unrelated to ER stress and suggesting that it activates stress-mediated translational arrest and autophagy through a novel pathway.

   Mechanics of five-axis flank milling
SO JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME
AB This work is the first of a two part paper on cutting force prediction and feed optimization for the five-axis flank milling of jet engine impellers. In Part I, a mathematical model for predicting cutting forces is presented for five-axis machining with tapered, helical, ball-end mills with variable pitch and serrated flutes. The cutter is divided axially into a number of differential elements, each with its own feed-coordinate system due to five-axis motion. At each element, the total velocity due to translation and angular motion is split into horizontal and vertical feed components, which are used to calculate total chip thickness along the cutting edge. The cutting forces for each element are calculated by transforming friction angle, shear stress, and shear angle from an orthogonal cutting database to the oblique cutting plane. The distributed cutting load is digitally summed to obtain the total forces acting on the cutter and blade. The model can be used for general five-axis flank milling processes, and supports a variety of cutting tools. Predicted cutting forces are shown to be in reasonable agreement with those collected during a roughing operation on a prototype integrally bladed rotor.

TI CONCEPTUAL GRAPHS AS A UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION
SO COMPUTERS & MATHEMATICS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB Conceptual graphs are a knowledge representation language designed as a synthesis of several different traditions. First are the semantic networks, which have been used in machine translation and computational linguistics for over thirty years, Second axe the logic-based techniques of unification, lambda calculus, and Peirce's existential graphs. Third is the linguistic research based on Tesniere's dependency graphs and various forms of case grammar and thematic relations. Fourth are the dataflow diagrams and Petri nets, which provide a computational mechanism for relating conceptual graphs to external procedures and databases. The result is a highly expressive system of logic with a direct mapping to and from natural languages. The lambda calculus supports the definitions for a taxonomic system and provides a general mechanism for restructuring knowledge bases. With the definitional mechanisms, conceptual graphs can be used as an intermediate stage between natural languages and the rules and frames of expert systems-an important feature for knowledge acquisition and for help and explanations. During the past five years, conceptual graphs have been applied to almost every aspect of AI, ranging from expert systems and natural language to computer vision and neural networks. This paper surveys conceptual graphs, their development from each of these traditions, and the applications based on them.

TI Attentive Octave Convolutional Capsule Network for Medical Image
   Classification
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Medical image classification plays an essential role in disease diagnosis and clinical treatment. More and more research efforts have been dedicated to the design of effective methods for medical image classification. As an effective framework, the capsule network (CapsNet) can realize translation equivariance. Lots of current research applies capsule networks in medical image analysis. In this paper, we propose an attentive octave convolutional capsule network (AOC-Caps) for medical image classification. In AOC-Caps, an AOC module is used to replace the traditional convolution operation. The purpose of the AOC module is to process and fuse the high- and low-frequency information in the input image simultaneously, and weigh the important parts automatically. Following the AOC module, a matrix capsule is used and the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is applied to update the routing weights. The proposed AOC-Caps and comparative methods are tested on seven datasets, including PathMNIST, DermaMNIST, OCTMNIST, PneumoniaMNIST, OrganMNIST_Axial, OrganMNIST_Coronal, and OrganMNIST_Sagittal, which are from MedMNIST. In the experiments, baselines include the traditional CNN models, automated machine learning (AutoML) methods, and related capsule network methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed AOC-Caps achieves better performance on most of the seven medical image datasets.

TI Mechanical metamaterials with programmable compression-twist coupling
SO SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES
AB The rational design of mechanical metamaterials has the potential to grant them with properties unattainable by bulk materials. This paper describes twisting mechanical metamaterials (TMMs), a new class of programmable matter whose rationally designed architecture endows them with compression-twist coupling, a property absent in conventional materials. Upon compression, the cellular architecture of TMMs efficiently transforms longitudinal strain into unidirectional or bidirectional twisting-free from mechanical frustrations and independent of the flexible material chosen to fabricate the TMM. TMMs can be rapidly designed using an automated generative algorithm, which enables the tailoring of their twisting properties (up to 3.24 degrees twist per % strain) and Poisson's ratio (-0.6 to +1.22) using only two design parameters. The scalable architecture of TMMs does not suffer from size effects which impair their twist per unit strain. Bidirectional TMMs autonomously switch their direction of rotation during uniform displacement-controlled compressive loading, conferring them with non-interchangeable compression-twist coupling. The capability of TMMs to controllably convert translation to rotation blurs the boundary between materials and machines, expanding the range of mechanical properties currently accessible to 3D printed materials and paving the way toward the creation of future programmable matter.

TI Image captioning in Turkish language: Database and model
SO JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF ENGINEERING AND ARCHITECTURE OF GAZI
   UNIVERSITY
AB Automatic image captioning is a challenging issue in artificial intelligence, which covers both the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. Inspired by the later advances in machine translation, a successful encoder-decoder technique is currently the state-of-the-art in English language captioning. In this study, we proposed an image captioning model for Turkish Language. This paper evaluates the encoder-decoder model on MS COCO database by coupling an encoder Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) -the component that is responsible for extracting the features of the given images-, with a decoder Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) -the component that is responsible for generating captions using the given inputs- to generate Turkish captions. We conducted the experiments using the most common evaluation metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE and CIDEr. Results show that the performance of the proposed model is satisfactory in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Finally, this study introduces a Web platform (http://mscoco-contributor.herokuapp.com/website/), which is proposed to improve the dataset via crowd-sourcing and free to use. The Turkish MS COCO dataset is available for research purpose. When all the images are completed, a Turkish dataset will be available for comparative studies.

TI Towards accurate prediction of epileptic seizures: A review
SO BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL
AB Recent research has investigated the possibility of predicting epileptic seizures. Intervention before the onset of seizure manifestations could be envisioned with accurate seizure forecasting. Although efforts for better prediction have been made, the translation of current approaches to clinical applications is still not possible. While early findings have been optimistic, the absence of statistical validation and reproducibility has raised doubts about the existence of a preictal state. Analysis and algorithmic studies are providing evidence that transition to the ictal state is not random, with build-up leading to seizures. We have reviewed the general framework of reliable algorithmic seizure prediction studies, discussing each component of the whole block diagram. We have explored steps along the pathway, from signal acquisition to adequate performance evaluation that should be taken into account in the design of an efficient seizure advisory/intervention system. The present review has established that there is potential for improvement and optimization in the seizure prediction framework. New databases, higher sampling frequencies, adequate preprocessing, electrode selection, and machine-learning considerations are all elements of the prediction scheme that should be assessed to achieve more realistic, better-than-chance performances.

AB Soldiers and front-line personnel operating in tactical environments increasingly make use of handheld devices to help with tasks such as face recognition, language translation, decision-making, and mission planning. These resource-constrained edge environments are characterized by dynamic context, limited computing resources, high levels of stress, and intermittent network connectivity. Cyber-foraging is the leverage of external resource-rich surrogates to augment the capabilities of resource-limited devices. In cloudlet-based cyber-foraging, resource-intensive computation and data is offloaded to cloudlets. Forward-deployed, discoverable, virtual-machine-based tactical cloudlets can be hosted on vehicles or other platforms to provide infrastructure to offload computation, provide forward data staging for a mission, perform data filtering to remove unnecessary data from streams intended for dismounted users, and serve as collection points for data heading for enterprise repositories. This paper describes tactical cloudlets and presents experimentation results for five different cloudlet provisioning mechanisms. The goal is to demonstrate that cyber-foraging in tactical environments is possible by moving cloud computing concepts and technologies closer to the edge so that tactical cloudlets, even if disconnected from the enterprise, can provide capabilities that can lead to enhanced situational awareness and decision making at the edge.

TI Generating Circuits with Generators
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB The most widely used languages and methods used for designing digital hardware fall into two rough categories. One of them, register transfer level (RTL), requires specifying each and every component in the designed circuit. This gives the designer full control, but burdens the designer with many trivial details. The other, the high-level synthesis (HLS) method, allows the designer to abstract the details of hardware away and focus on the problem being solved. This method however cannot be used for a class of hardware design problems because the circuit's clock is also abstracted away.
   We present YieldFSM, a hardware description language that uses the generator abstraction to represent clock-level timing in a digital circuit. It represents a middle ground between the RTL and HLS approaches: the abstraction level is higher than in RTL, but thanks to explicit information about clock-level timing, it can be used in applications where RTL is traditionally used. We also present the YieldFSM compiler, which uses methods developed by the functional programming community - including continuation-passsing style translation and defunctionalization - to translate YieldFSM programs to Mealy machines. It is implemented using Template Haskell and the Clash functional hardware description language. We show that this approach leads to short and conceptually simple hardware descriptions.

TI ProtTrans-Glutar: Incorporating Features From Pre-trained
   Transformer-Based Models for Predicting Glutarylation Sites
SO FRONTIERS IN GENETICS
AB Lysine glutarylation is a post-translational modification (PTM) that plays a regulatory role in various physiological and biological processes. Identifying glutarylated peptides using proteomic techniques is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, developing computational models and predictors can prove useful for rapid identification of glutarylation. In this study, we propose a model called ProtTrans-Glutar to classify a protein sequence into positive or negative glutarylation site by combining traditional sequence-based features with features derived from a pre-trained transformer-based protein model. The features of the model were constructed by combining several feature sets, namely the distribution feature (from composition/transition/distribution encoding), enhanced amino acid composition (EAAC), and features derived from the ProtT5-XL-UniRef50 model. Combined with random under-sampling and XGBoost classification method, our model obtained recall, specificity, and AUC scores of 0.7864, 0.6286, and 0.7075 respectively on an independent test set. The recall and AUC scores were notably higher than those of the previous glutarylation prediction models using the same dataset. This high recall score suggests that our method has the potential to identify new glutarylation sites and facilitate further research on the glutarylation process.

TI Computational analysis of neurodevelopmental phenotypes: Harmonization
   empowers clinical discovery
SO HUMAN MUTATION
AB Making a specific diagnosis in neurodevelopmental disorders is traditionally based on recognizing clinical features of a distinct syndrome, which guides testing of its possible genetic etiologies. Scalable frameworks for genomic diagnostics, however, have struggled to integrate meaningful measurements of clinical phenotypic features. While standardization has enabled generation and interpretation of genomic data for clinical diagnostics at unprecedented scale, making the equivalent breakthrough for clinical data has proven challenging. However, increasingly clinical features are being recorded using controlled dictionaries with machine readable formats such as the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), which greatly facilitates their use in the diagnostic space. Improving the tractability of large-scale clinical information will present new opportunities to inform genomic research and diagnostics from a clinical perspective. Here, we describe novel approaches for computational phenotyping to harmonize clinical features, improve data translation through revising domain-specific dictionaries, quantify phenotypic features, and determine clinical relatedness. We demonstrate how these concepts can be applied to longitudinal phenotypic information, which represents a critical element of developmental disorders and pediatric conditions. Finally, we expand our discussion to clinical data derived from electronic medical records, a largely untapped resource of deep clinical information with distinct strengths and weaknesses.

TI Data-driven modeling of two-dimensional detonation wave fronts
SO WAVE MOTION
AB Historical experimental testing of high-altitude nuclear explosions (HANEs) are known to cause severe and detrimental effects to radio frequency signals and communications infrastructure. In order to study and predict the impact of HANEs, tractable computational approaches are required to model the complex physical processes involved in the detonation wave physics. Modern reduced-order models (ROMs) can enable long-time and many-parameter simulations with minimal computational cost. However, translational and scale invariances inherent to this type of wave propagation problem are known to limit traditional ROM approaches. Specifically, dimensionality reduction methods are typically ineffective in producing low-rank models when invariances are present in the data. In this work, an unsupervised machine learning method is used to discover coordinate systems that make such invariances amenable to traditional dimensionality reduction methods. The method, which has previously been demonstrated on one-dimensional translations, is extended to higher dimensions and additional invariances. A surrogate HANE system, i.e. a HANE-ROM, with one detonation wave is captured well at extremely low-rank. Two detonation-waves are also considered with various amounts of interaction between the waves, with improvements to low-rank models for multiple wave quantities with limited interaction.

AB In programming, the names for the program entities, especially for the methods, are the intuitive characteristic for understanding the functionality of the code. To ensure the readability and maintainability of the programs, method names should be named properly. Specifically, the names should be meaningful and consistent with other names used in related contexts in their codebase. In recent years, many automated approaches are proposed to suggest consistent names for methods, among which neural machine translation (NMT) based models are widely used and have achieved state-of-the-art results. However, these NMT-based models mainly focus on extracting the code-specific features from the method body or the surrounding methods, the project-specific context and documentation of the target method are ignored. We conduct a statistical analysis to explore the relationship between the method names and their contexts. Based on the statistical results, we propose GTNM, a Global Transformer-based Neural Model for method name suggestion, which considers the local context, the project-specific context, and the documentation of the method simultaneously. Experimental results on java methods show that our model can outperform the state-of-the-art results by a large margin on method name suggestion, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed model.

TI Development of Sindhi text corpus
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Sindhi language is a rich language with plenty of literary and general texts. There are number of books, newspapers, magazines and internet material available to develop Sindhi text corpus but yet proper and useful text corpus could not be developed and presented online for research, language features analysis, linguistics analysis and information retrieval systems. The lack of resources for research on computational linguistics and NLP applications for Sindhi language are challenging tasks at this stage. However, we have developed Sindhi text corpora in order to provide text resources to computational linguists, Natural Languages process (NLP) experts and researchers. Online books, newspapers, magazines, blogs and social websites are utilized to build Sindhi text corpus. Sindhi sentiment based text corpus is developed and analyzed with Document Term Matrix and TF-IDF models using 2-gram technique of n-gram model. The corpus may be useful for research on language variation analysis, sentiment analysis, aspect based sentiment analysis, semantic analysis, machine translation, information retrieval, Word2Vec, topic modeling and cluster analysis.

AB Currently, there is a boom in introducing Machine Learning models to various aspects of everyday life. A relevant field consists of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that seeks to model human language. A key and basic component for these models to learn properly consists of the data. This article proposes a methodological framework for constructing a large-scale corpus to feed NLP models. The development of this framework emerges from the problem of finding inputs in languages other than English to feed NLP models. With an approach focused on producing a high-quality resource, the construction phases were designed along with the considerations that must be taken. The stages implemented consist of the corpus characterization to be obtained, collecting documents, cleaning, translation, storage, and evaluation. The proposed approach implemented automatic translators to take advantage of the vast amount of English literature and implemented through non-cost libraries. Finally, a case study was developed, resulting in a corpus in Spanish with more than 170,000 documents within a specific domain, i.e., opinions on textile products. Through the evaluations carried out, it is established that the proposed framework can build a large-scale and high-quality corpus.

AB In recent years, cyberbullying has grown out of proportion due to the increasing usage of social media platforms along with the benefit of user anonymization over the Internet. Affecting people across all demographics, the effect of cyberbullying has been more pronounced over adolescents and insecure individuals. Victims suffer from societal isolation, depression, degrading self-confidence and suicidal thoughts. Thus, prevention of cyberbullying becomes a necessity and requires timely detection. Recent advances in Deep learning and Natural Language Processing have provided suitable models to predict whether a text sample is an example of cyberbullying. In this context, we explore the adaptivity and efficiency of self-attention models in detecting cyberbullying. Though a few of the recent works in this context have employed models like deep neural networks, SVM, CNN, LSTM and other hybrid models, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work exploring self-attention models which have achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in Machine Translation tasks since 2017. We experiment with the Wikipedia, Formspring and Twitter cyberbullying datasets and achieve more efficient results over existing cyberbullying detection models. We also propose new research directions within cyberbullying detection over recent forms of media like Internet memes which pose a variety of new and hybrid problems.

TI A Qualitative Investigation of College Student Perceptions of Their
   Nutrition Environment: Recommendations for Improvement
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH EDUCATION
AB Background: College is the first environment in which students are responsible for making all decisions relating to their eating and exercise behaviors. Of all contributing factors to overweight and obesity, one main influence seems to be the environment. Purpose: This study explored college students' perceptions of their nutrition environment on campus. Methods: A convenience sample of 33 undergraduate college students (15 males, 18 females) participated in focus groups and key informant interviews on topics related to the college nutrition environment. Results: Major themes included accessibility, money, food, education, and student opinions. Students indicated that unhealthy, processed foods are more available than healthy foods on campus. They also brought up many barriers for eating healthy on campus. Discussion: The accessibility of healthy foods was a major barrier brought up by participants. This barrier included issues with ongoing construction limiting access to food locations, lack of locations for healthy foods, lack of a market-type store, time, and a plethora of vending machines. Elimination of these barriers would help to improve the campus' overall nutrition environment. Translation to Health Education Practice: Health Educators should work with college personnel to develop policies and practices that promote healthy eating and prevent college weight gain.

TI Improving Semantic Similarity with Cross-Lingual Resources: A Study in
   Bangla-A Low Resourced Language
SO INFORMATICS-BASEL
AB Semantic similarity is a long-standing problem in natural language processing (NLP). It is a topic of great interest as its understanding can provide a look into how human beings comprehend meaning and make associations between words. However, when this problem is looked at from the viewpoint of machine understanding, particularly for under resourced languages, it poses a different problem altogether. In this paper, semantic similarity is explored in Bangla, a less resourced language. For ameliorating the situation in such languages, the most rudimentary method (path-based) and the latest state-of-the-art method (Word2Vec) for semantic similarity calculation were augmented using cross-lingual resources in English and the results obtained are truly astonishing. In the presented paper, two semantic similarity approaches have been explored in Bangla, namely the path-based and distributional model and their cross-lingual counterparts were synthesized in light of the English WordNet and Corpora. The proposed methods were evaluated on a dataset comprising of 162 Bangla word pairs, which were annotated by five expert raters. The correlation scores obtained between the four metrics and human evaluation scores demonstrate a marked enhancement that the cross-lingual approach brings into the process of semantic similarity calculation for Bangla.

SO CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROLOGY
AB Purpose of review The field of neurotrauma research faces a reproducibility crisis. In response, research leaders in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spinal cord injury (SCI) are leveraging data curation and analytics methods to encourage transparency, and improve the rigor and reproducibility. Here we review the current challenges and opportunities that come from efforts to transform neurotrauma's big data to knowledge. Recent findings Three parallel movements are driving data-driven-discovery in neurotrauma. First, large multicenter consortia are collecting large quantities of neurotrauma data, refining common data elements (CDEs) that can be used across studies. Investigators are now testing the validity of CDEs in diverse research settings. Second, data sharing initiatives are working to make neurotrauma data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). These efforts are reflected by recent open data repository projects for preclinical and clinical neurotrauma. Third, machine learning analytics are allowing researchers to uncover novel data-driven-hypotheses and test new therapeutics in multidimensional outcome space. We are on the threshold of a new era in data collection, curation, and analysis. The next phase of big data in neurotrauma research will require responsible data stewardship, a culture of data-sharing, and the illumination of 'dark data'.

AB Sequence-to-sequence attention-based models have recently shown very promising results on automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks, which integrate an acoustic, pronunciation and language model into a single neural network. In these models, the Transformer, a new sequence-to-sequence attention based model relying entirely on self-attention without using RNNs or convolutions, achieves a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU on neural machine translation (NMT) tasks. Since the outstanding performance of the Transformer, we extend it to speech and concentrate on it as the basic architecture of sequence-to-sequence attention-based model on Mandarin Chinese ASR tasks. Furthermore, we investigate a comparison between syllable based model and context-independent phoneme (CI-phoneme) based model with the Transformer in Mandarin Chinese. Additionally, a greedy cascading decoder with the Transformer is proposed for mapping CI-phoneme sequences and syllable sequences into word sequences. Experiments on HKUST datasets demonstrate that syllable based model with the Transformer performs better than CI-phoneme based counterpart, and achieves a character error rate (CER) of 28.77%, which is competitive to the state-of-the-art CER of 28.0% by the joint CTC-attention based encoder-decoder network.

AB Most of the common recommender systems deal with the task of generating recommendations for assortments in which a product is usually bought only once, like books or DVDs. However, there are plenty of online shops selling consumer goods like drugstore products, where the customer purchases the same product repeatedly. We call such scenarios repeat-buying scenarios (Bohm et al., Studies in classification, data analysis, and knowledge organization, 2001). For our approach we utilized the results of information geometry (Amari and Nagaoka, Methods of information geometry. Translation of mathematical monographs, vol 191, American Mathematical Society, Providence, 2000) and transformed customer data taken from a repeat-buying scenario into a multinomial space. Using the multinomial diffusion kernel from Lafferty and Lebanon (J Mach Learn Res 6:129-163, 2005) we developed the multinomial SVM (Support Vector Machine) item recommender system MN-SVM-IR to calculate personalized item recommendations for a repeat-buying scenario. We evaluated our SVM item recommender system in a tenfold-cross-validation against the state of the art recommender BPR-MF (Bayesian Personalized Ranking Matrix Factorization) developed by Rendle et al. (BPR: Bayesian personalized ranking from implicit feedback, 2009). The evaluation was performed on a real world dataset taken from a larger German online drugstore.

AB For an effective vision-based HCI system, inference from natural means of sources (i.e. hand) is a crucial challenge in unconstrained environment. In this paper, we have aimed to build an interaction system through hand posture recognition for static finger spelling American Sign Language (ASL) alphabets and numbers. Unlike the interaction system based on speech, the coarticulation due to hand shape, position and movement influences the different aspects of sign language recognition. Due to this, we have computed the features which are invariant to translation, rotation and scaling. Considering these aspects as the main objectives of this research, we have proposed a three-step approach: first, features vector are computed using two moment based approaches namely Hu-Moment along with geometrical features and Zernike moment. Second, the categorization of symbols according to the fingertip is performed to avoid mis-classification among the symbols. Third, the extracted set of two features vectors (i.e. Hu-Moment with geometrical features and Zernike moment) are trained by Support Vector Machines (SVM) for the classification of the symbols. Experimental results of the proposed approaches achieve recognition rate of 98.5% using Hu-Moment with geometrical features and 96.2% recognition rate using Zernike moment for ASL alphabets and numbers demonstrating the dominating performance of Hu-Moment with geometrical features over Zernike moments.

TI Computer assisted orthopaedic surgery with image based individual
   templates
SO CLINICAL ORTHOPAEDICS AND RELATED RESEARCH
AB Recent developments in computer assisted surgery offer promising solutions for the translation of the high accuracy of the preoperative imaging and planning into precise intraoperative surgery. Broad clinical application is hindered by high costs, additional time during intervention, problems of intraoperative man and machine interaction, and the spatially constrained arrangement of additional equipment within the operating theater, An alternative technique for computerized tomographic image based preoperative three-dimensional planning and precise surgery on bone structures using individual templates has been developed, For the preoperative customization of these mechanical tool guides, a desktop computer controlled milling device is used as a three-dimensional printer to mold the shape of small reference areas of the bone surface automatically into the body of the template. Thus, the planned position and orientation of the tool guide in spatial relation to bone is stored in a structural way and can be reproduced intraoperatively by adjusting the position of the customized contact faces of the template until the location of exact fit to the bone is found, No additional computerized equipment or time is needed during surgery, The feasibility of this approach has been shown in spine, hip, and knee surgery, and it has been applied clinically for pelvic repositioning osteotomies in acetabular dysplasia therapy.

TI Compressing and interpreting word embeddings with latent space
   regularization and interactive semantics probing
SO INFORMATION VISUALIZATION
AB Word embedding, a high-dimensional (HD) numerical representation of words generated by machine learning models, has been used for different natural language processing tasks, for example, translation between two languages. Recently, there has been an increasing trend of transforming the HD embeddings into a latent space (e.g. via autoencoders) for further tasks, exploiting various merits the latent representations could bring. To preserve the embeddings' quality, these works often map the embeddings into an even higher-dimensional latent space, making the already complicated embeddings even less interpretable and consuming more storage space. In this work, we borrow the idea of beta VAE to regularize the HD latent space. Our regularization implicitly condenses information from the HD latent space into a much lower-dimensional space, thus compressing the embeddings. We also show that each dimension of our regularized latent space is more semantically salient, and validate our assertion by interactively probing the encoding-level of user-proposed semantics in the dimensions. To the end, we design a visual analytics system to monitor the regularization process, explore the HD latent space, and interpret latent dimensions' semantics. We validate the effectiveness of our embedding regularization and interpretation approach through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

TI Energy Transfer into Period-Tripled States in Coupled Electromechanical
   Modes at Internal Resonance
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Efficient energy transfer often occurs between oscillation modes in a resonator when they are tuned to internal resonance. We design the eigenfrequencies of two vibrational modes of an electromechanical resonator to be close to a ratio of 3:1 and demonstrate that the energy supplied to the upper mode can he controllably transferred to the lower mode. With the lower mode vibrating with a period tripled that of the upper mode, the discrete time-translation symmetry imposed by the periodic drive is broken. The lower mode settles into one of three stable period-tripled states with different phases. This channel for energy transfer from the upper mode can be turned on or off without changing system parameters. When the upper mode itself becomes multistable under strong resonant or parametric drive, additional sets of coexisting period-tripled states emerge in the lower mode. In the latter case, we measure a total of six coexisting vibration states with identical amplitude but phases differing by pi/3. Excitation of coexisting states with three different phases could open new opportunities in designing mechanical memory based on ternary logic. Coupled resonators with period-tripled states can also be used to model complex interacting systems with spin equal to one.

TI Chinese Address Recognition Method Based on Multi-Feature Fusion
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB A place name is a textual identification of a specific spatial location by people and is an important carrier of geographical information. The recognition of Chinese place names is of great importance in information retrieval and event extraction. The traditional approach is to transform the recognition of Chinese place names into a sequential annotation problem, with commonly used classification models such as support vector machines and conditional random fields. In this paper, Chinese address recognition is converted into a sequential annotation task, and a multi-feature fusion approach to Chinese address recognition is proposed. A deep learning network architecture model based on the fusion of character, word, and address features is constructed to convert characters, words, and their features into vector representations; finally, the sequential annotation of sentences is performed by CRF to achieve the recognition and extraction of address information. On the autonomously constructed dataset, the proposed method MFBL (Multi-Feature-BiLSTM) improves in accuracy by 4 to 10 percentage points compared to other methods, demonstrating that the MFBL model has better performance in the address recognition task.

TI Optical brain imaging and its application to neurofeedback
SO NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL
AB Besides passive recording of brain electric or magnetic activity, also non-ionizing electromagnetic or optical radiation can be used for real-time brain imaging. Here, changes in the radiation's absorption or scattering allow for continuous in vivo assessment of regional neurometabolic and neurovascular activity. Besides magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), over the last years, also functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was successfully established in real-time metabolic brain imaging. In contrast to MRI, fNIRS is portable and can be applied at bedside or in everyday life environments, e.g., to restore communication and movement. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of the history and state-of-the-art of real-time optical brain imaging with a special emphasis on its clinical use towards neurofeedback and brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. Besides pointing to the most critical challenges in clinical use, also novel approaches that combine real-time optical neuroimaging with other recording modalities (e.g. electro- or magnetoencephalography) are described, and their use in the context of neuroergonomics, neuroenhancement or neuroadaptive systems discussed.

TI Identifying polyadenylation signals with biological embedding via
   self-attentive gated convolutional highway networks
SO APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
AB Polyadenylation is responsible for regulating mRNA function and translation efficiency. The accurate polyadenylation signal (PAS) recognition is essential for understanding the genome annotation and function. Currently, computational methods mainly rely on human-designed features and do not extract complex discriminative patterns. In this work, we first adopt a shallow neural network to automatically learn biological embedding information with discriminative patterns from biological sequences alone. Next, we devise a hybrid deep learning framework termed PASNet to automatically extract underlying patterns by integrating gated convolutional highway networks with a self-attention mechanism and then identify PAS from genomic sequences. Specifically, we devise a gated convolutional highway unit by gated convolutional mechanisms, and the highway unit has significant paths to allow unimpeded information to pass between two adjacent layers. PASNet requires little prior knowledge and no laborious feature engineering. Besides, we evaluate PASNet on four different organism datasets through genome-wide experiments. Compared to published machine learning and deep learning predictors, results show that our framework achieves the improvement with the error rate decreasing by 4% and 1.02% respectively on average.

TI A Chronically Implantable Bidirectional Neural Interface for Non-human
   Primates
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
AB Optogenetics has potential applications in the study of epilepsy and neuroprostheses, and for studies on neural circuit dynamics. However, to achieve translation to clinical usage, optogenetic interfaces that are capable of chronic stimulation and monitoring with minimal brain trauma are required. We aimed to develop a chronically implantable device for photostimulation of the brain of non -human primates. We used a micro-light-emitting diode (LED) array with a flexible polyimide film. The array was combined with a whole cortex electrocorticographic (ECoG) electrode array for simultaneous photostimulation and recording. Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) was virally transduced into the cerebral cortex of common marmosets, and then the device was epidurally implanted into their brains. We recorded the neural activity during photostimulation of the awake monkeys for 4 months. The neural responses gradually increased after the virus injection for 8 weeks and remained constant for another 8 weeks. The micro-LED and ECoG arrays allowed semi-invasive simultaneous stimulation and recording during long-term implantation in the brains of non-human primates. The development of this device represents substantial progress in the field of optogenetic applications.

TI Classification of automobile and transit trips from Smartphone data:
   Enhancing accuracy using spatial statistics and GIS
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY
AB As the practices of transportation engineering and planning evolve from "data poor" to "data rich", methods to automate the translation of data to information become increasingly important. A major field of study is the automatic identification of travel modes from passively collected GPS data. In previous work, the authors have developed a robust modal classification system using an optimized combination of statistical inference techniques. One problem that remains very difficult is the correct identification of transit travel, particularly when the system is operating in mixed traffic. This type of operation generates a wide range of values for many travel parameters (average speed, maximum speed, and acceleration for example) which have similar characteristics to other urban modes. In this paper, we supplement the previous research to improve the identification of transit trips. The method employed evaluates the likelihood that GPS travel data belong to transit by comparing the location and pattern of zero-travel speeds (stopping) to the presence of transit stops and signalized intersections. These comparisons are done in a GIS. The consideration of the spatial attributes of GPS data vastly improves the accuracy of transit travel prediction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Loss of rps9 in Zebrafish Leads to p53-Dependent Anemia
SO G3-GENES GENOMES GENETICS
AB Ribosome is a vital molecular machine for protein translation in the cell. Defects in several ribosomal proteins including RPS19, RPL11 and RPS14 have been observed in two types of anemia: Diamond Blackfan Anemia and 5q-syndrome. In zebrafish, deficiency of these ribosomal proteins shows similar anemic phenotype. It remains to be determined if any other ribosome proteins are similarly involved in regulating erythropoiesis. Here we generated mutations in zebrafish rps9, a rarely studied ribosomal protein gene, and investigated its function. Analysis of this mutant demonstrates that rps9 disruption leads to impairment of erythrocyte maturation, resulting in anemia. In addition, the overall phenotype including the anemic state is p53-dependent in rps9 mutants. Furthermore, this anemic state can be partially relieved by the treatment of L-leucine, and dexamethasone, which have been previously used in rescuing the phenotype of other ribosomal protein mutants. Finally, by comparing the phenotype, we show that there are considerable differences in morphology, cytomorphology, and hemoglobin levels for four ribosomal protein mutants in zebrafish. Based on the observed difference, we suggest that the level of anemic severity correlates with the delayed status of erythrocyte maturation in zebrafish models.

AB Interactive visual analysis of documents relies critically on the ability of machines to process and analyze texts. Important techniques for text processing include text summarization, classification, or translation. Many of these approaches are based on part-of-speech tagging, a core natural language processing technique. Part-of-speech taggers are typically trained on collections of modern newspaper, magazine, or journal articles. They are known to have high accuracy and robustness when applied to contemporary newspaper style texts. However, the performance of these taggers deteriorates quickly when applying them to more domain specific writings, such as older or even historical documents. Large training sets tend to be scarce for these types of texts due to the limited availability of source material and costly digitization and annotation procedures. In this paper, we present an interactive visualization approach that facilitates analysts in determining part-of-speech tagging errors by comparing several standard part-of-speech tagger results graphically. It allows users to explore, compare, evaluate, and adapt the results through interactive feedback in order to obtain a new model, which can then be applied to similar types of texts. A use case shows successful applications of the approach and demonstrates its benefits and limitations. In addition, we provide insights generated through expert feedback and discuss the effectiveness of our approach.

TI Intrinsic Properties of tRNA Molecules as Deciphered via Bayesian
   Network and Distribution Divergence Analysis
SO LIFE-BASEL
AB The identity/recognition of tRNAs, in the context of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (and other molecules), is a complex phenomenon that has major implications ranging from the origins and evolution of translation machinery and genetic code to the evolution and speciation of tRNAs themselves to human mitochondrial diseases to artificial genetic code engineering. Deciphering it via laboratory experiments, however, is difficult and necessarily time-and resource-consuming. In this study, we propose a mathematically rigorous two-pronged in silico approach to identifying and classifying tRNA positions important for tRNA identity/recognition, rooted in machine learning and information-theoretic methodology. We apply Bayesian Network modeling to elucidate the structure of intra-tRNA-molecule relationships, and distribution divergence analysis to identify meaningful inter-molecule differences between various tRNA subclasses. We illustrate the complementary application of these two approaches using tRNA examples across the three domains of life, and identify and discuss important (informative) positions therein. In summary, we deliver to the tRNA research community a novel, comprehensive methodology for identifying the specific elements of interest in various tRNA molecules, which can be followed up by the corresponding experimental work and/or high-resolution position-specific statistical analyses.

AB Writing diary is not only a hobby but also provides a personal lifelog for better analysis and understanding of a user's daily activities and events. However, in a busy society, people may not have enough time to write in diary all their social interaction. This motivates our proposal to develop a ubiquitous system to automatically generate daily text diary using our novel method for image captioning from photos taken periodically from wearable cameras. We propose to incorporate common visual concepts extracted from a photo to enhance the details of the image description. We also propose a wide trail beam search strategy to enhance the naturalness of text caption. Our captioning method improves the results on MSCOCO dataset on four metrics: BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE-L, CIDEr. As compared to the method proposed by Xu et.al and Neuraltalk of Karpathy, our model has better performance on all four metrics. We also develop smart glasses and a prototype smart workplace in which people can have their personal diary generated from photos taken by smart glasses. Furthermore, we also apply a transformer machine translation model in order to translate captions into Vietnamese language. The results are promising and can be used for Vietnamese people.

AB This paper studies dynamics of a point-absorbing Wave Energy Conversion System (WECS) that employs a Trans-Rotary Magnetic Gear (TROMAG) within its Power Take-Off (PTO) system. The TROMAG is a magnetic device, consisting of a rotor and a translator, intended to convert high-force, low-speed translation to high-speed, low-torque rotation. Translator of the TROMAG is coupled to the buoy and heaves along with it while its rotor is coupled to the rotor of a rotary machine. The adopted control strategy for the buoy determines the force by which the translator has to react to the wave excitation force. Whereas in the case of a Direct Drive Linear Generator (DDLG) the desired force can be directly generated by controlling the generator current, in the case of TROMAG the generator torque would go through certain dynamics to appear in the form of the translator force. Understanding the aforementioned dynamics is the purpose of this paper. A dynamic model, verified by three-dimensional (3D) finite element analysis (FEA), is presented for the TROMAG. The proposed nonlinear analytical model is then linearized and combined with the linearized model of a point absorbing WECS. Transfer functions are derived and the variations of the system characteristics with different parameters are studied.

TI Sparse 2-D PZT-on-PCB Arrays With Density Tapering
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ULTRASONICS FERROELECTRICS AND FREQUENCY CONTROL
AB Two-dimensional (2-D) arrays offer volumetric imaging capabilities without the need for probe translation or rotation. A sparse array with elements seeded in a tapering spiral pattern enables one-to-one connection to an ultrasound machine, thus allowing flexible transmission and reception strategies. To test the concept of sparse spiral array imaging, we have designed, realized, and characterized two prototype probes designed at 2.5-MHz low-frequency (LF) and 5-MHz high-frequency (HF) center frequencies. Both probes share the same electronic design, based on piezoelectric ceramics and rapid prototyping with printed circuit board substrates to wire the elements to external connectors. Different center frequencies were achieved by adjusting the piezoelectric layer thickness. The LF and HF prototype probes had 88% and 95% of working elements, producing peak pressures of 21 and 96 kPa/V when focused at 5 and 3 cm, respectively. The one-way -3-dB bandwidths were 26% and 32%. These results, together with experimental tests on tissue-mimicking phantoms, show that the probes are viable for volumetric imaging.

TI Pushing the limits of nanopore transport performance by polymer
   functionalization
SO CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB Inspired by the design and performance of biological pores, polymer functionalization of nanopores has emerged as an evolving field to advance transport performance within the last few years. This feature article outlines developments in nanopore functionalization and the resulting transport performance including gating based on electrostatic interaction, wettability and ligand binding, gradual transport controlled by polymerization as well as functionalization-based asymmetric nanopore and nanoporous material design going towards the transport direction. Pushing the limits of nanopore transport performance and thus reducing the performance gap between biological and technological pores is strongly related to advances in polymerization chemistry and their translation into nanopore functionalization. Thereby, the effect of the spatial confinement has to be considered for polymer functionalization as well as for transport regulation, and mechanistic understanding is strongly increased by combining experiment and theory. A full mechanistic understanding together with highly precise nanopore structure design and polymer functionalization is not only expected to improve existing application of nanoporous materials but also opens the door to new technologies. The latter might include out of equilibrium devices, ionic circuits, or machine learning based sensors.

AB The management of industrial maintenance has rapidly evolved in the past few decades. Thanks to the advancements of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) brought by Industry 4.0, the present and future health state of machines can be estimated and, as a result, smart maintenance based on real-time sensor data has emerged. One way to implement CPSs in an enterprise is through smart retrofitting: the integration of new technologies into legacy devices to enable CPS capabilities. Among these capabilities, communication involves the integration, translation and transmission of data from legacy devices to external applications. In this work, XWare (eXperimental middleWare) is proposed as a low-cost middleware for smart maintenance applications that eases the implementation of the communication capability into legacy devices. This implementation is enabled through the integration of various open-source technologies: MQTT, OM2M, and a custom-made library of Python functions. The integration of these components allows sensors placed on different locations to transmit maintenance-related data to a local server through the use of gateways. By methodically designing, implementing and verifying XWare, a scalable, easy to deploy, and open-source middleware for smart retrofitting in maintenance was developed.

TI Can We Exploit All Datasets? Multimodal Emotion Recognition Using
   Cross-Modal Translation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The use of sufficiently large datasets is important for most deep learning tasks, and emotion recognition tasks are no exception. Multimodal emotion recognition is the task of considering multiple types of modalities simultaneously to improve accuracy and robustness, typically utilizing three modalities: visual, audio, and text. Similar to other deep learning tasks, large datasets are required. Various heterogeneous datasets exist, including unimodal datasets constructed for traditional unimodal recognition and bimodal or trimodal datasets for multi-modal emotion recognition. A trimodal emotion recognition model shows high performance and robustness by comprehensively considering multiple modalities. However, the use of unimodal or bimodal datasets in this case is problematic. In this study, we propose a novel method to improve the performance of emotion recognition based on a cross-modal translator that can translate between the three modalities. The proposed method can train a multimodal model based on three modalities with different types of heterogeneous datasets, and the dataset does not require alignment between modalities: visual, audio, and text. We achieved a high performance exceeding the baseline in CMU-MOSEI and IEMOCAP, which are representative multimodal datasets, by adding unimodal and bimodal datasets to the trimodal dataset.

TI Tag-Enhanced Dynamic Compositional Neural Network over arbitrary tree
   structure for sentence representation
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB Learning the distributed representation of a sentence is a fundamental operation for a variety of natural language processing tasks, such as text classification, machine translation, and text semantic matching. Tree structured dynamic compositional networks have achieved promising performance in sentence representation due to its ability in capturing the richness of compositionality. However, existing dynamic compositional networks are mostly based on binarized constituency trees which cannot represent the inherent structural information of sentences effectively. Moreover, syntactic tag information, which is demonstrated to be useful in sentence representation, has been rarely exploited in existing dynamic compositional models. In this paper, a novel LSTM structure, ARTree-LSTM, is proposed to handle general constituency trees in which each non-leaf node can have any number of child nodes. Based on ARTree-LSTM, a novel network model, Tag Enhanced Dynamic Compositional Neural Network (TE-DCNN), is proposed for sentence representation learning, which contains two ARTree-LSTMs, i.e. tag-level ARTree-LSTM and word-level ARTree-LSTM. The tag-level ARTree-LSTM guides the word-level ARTree-LSTM in conducting dynamic composition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed TE-DCNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on text classification and text semantic matching tasks.

TI Arbitrary linear transformations for photons in the frequency synthetic
   dimension
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Arbitrary linear transformations are of crucial importance in a plethora of photonic applications spanning classical signal processing, communication systems, quantum information processing and machine learning. Here, we present a photonic architecture to achieve arbitrary linear transformations by harnessing the synthetic frequency dimension of photons. Our structure consists of dynamically modulated micro-ring resonators that implement tunable couplings between multiple frequency modes carried by a single waveguide. By inverse design of these short- and long-range couplings using automatic differentiation, we realize arbitrary scattering matrices in synthetic space between the input and output frequency modes with near-unity fidelity and favorable scaling. We show that the same physical structure can be reconfigured to implement a wide variety of manipulations including single-frequency conversion, nonreciprocal frequency translations, and unitary as well as non-unitary transformations. Our approach enables compact, scalable and reconfigurable integrated photonic architectures to achieve arbitrary linear transformations in both the classical and quantum domains using current state-of-the-art technology. Photonic processors that can perform arbitrary tasks are in demand for many applications. Here, the authors present a photonic architecture using waveguide and resonator couplings to perform arbitrary linear transformations, by taking advantage of the frequency synthetic dimension.

AB India is one of the most linguistically diverse nations of the world and is culturally very rich. Most of these languages are somewhat similar to each other on account of sharing a common ancestry or being in contact for a long period of time (Bhattacharyya et al., 2016). Nowadays, researchers are constantly putting efforts in utilizing the language relatedness to improve the performance of various NLP systems such as cross lingual semantic search, machine translation (Kunchukuttan and Bhattacharyya, 2020), sentiment analysis systems, etc. So in this paper, we performed an extensive case study on similarity involving languages of the Indian subcontinent. Language similarity prediction is defined as the task of measuring how similar the two languages are on the basis of their lexical, morphological and syntactic features. In this study, we concentrate only on the approach to calculate lexical similarity between Indian languages by looking at various factors such as size and type of corpus, similarity algorithms, subword segmentation, etc. The main takeaways from our work are: (i) Relative order of the language similarities largely remain the same, regardless of the factors mentioned above, (ii) Similarity within the same language family is higher, (iii) Languages share more lexical features at the subword level.

AB Neural autoregressive sequence models are used to generate sequences in a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, where they are evaluated according to sequence-level task losses. These models are typically trained with maximum likelihood estimation, which ignores the task loss, yet empirically performs well as a surrogate objective. Typical approaches to directly optimizing the task loss such as policy gradient and minimum risk training are based around sampling in the sequence space to obtain candidate update directions that are scored based on the loss of a single sequence. In this paper, we develop an alternative method based on random search in the parameter space that leverages access to the maximum likelihood gradient. We propose maximum likelihood guided parameter search (MGS), which samples from a distribution over update directions that is a mixture of random search around the current parameters and around the maximum likelihood gradient, with each direction weighted by its improvement in the task loss. MGS shifts sampling to the parameter space, and scores candidates using losses that are pooled from multiple sequences. Our experiments show that MGS is capable of optimizing sequence-level losses, with substantial reductions in repetition and non-termination in sequence completion, and similar improvements to those of minimum risk training in machine translation.

TI Automatically Translating Image Processing Libraries to Halide
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON GRAPHICS
AB This paper presents DEXTER, a new tool that automatically translates image processing functions from a low-level general-purpose language to a high-level domain-specific language (DSL), allowing them to leverage cross-platform optimizations enabled by DSLs. Rather than building a classical syntax-driven compiler to do this translation, DEXTER leverages recent advances in program synthesis and program verification, along with a new domain-specific synthesis algorithm, to translate C++ image processing code to the Halide DSL, while guaranteeing semantic equivalence. This new synthesis algorithm scales and generalizes to much larger and more complex functions than prior work, including the ability to handle tiling, conditionals, and multi-stage pipelines in the original low-level code. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate DEXTER using real-world image processing functions from Adobe Photoshop, a widely used multi-platform image processing program. Our results show that DEXTER can translate 264 out of 353 functions in our test set, with the original implementations ranging from 20 to 150 lines of code. By leveraging Halide's advanced auto-scheduling capabilities, we get median speedups of 7.03x and 4.52x for DEXTER-translated functions as compared to the original implementations on Intel and ARM architectures, respectively.

TI Generating Adversarial Examples in One Shot With Image-to-Image
   Translation GAN
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) provide state-of-the-art results for most machine learning and computer vision tasks. However, they have been found susceptible to adversarial examples. In the recent literature, many ways of generating adversarial examples have been discovered. In this work, we propose a novel method to generate adversarial examples with generative adversarial networks (GANs). Compared to traditional optimisation-based methods, our method provides a fast yet powerful alternative for adversary generation. Unlike other GAN-based approaches in the literature which learn to generate an intermediate perturbation vector, our method generates adversarial examples from benign input images in a straightforward manner. By directly generating adversarial examples from given input images, our method produces perturbations that better align with the underlying edge and shape contained in the inputs, hence more natural-looking and imperceptible to human eyes. We evaluate our method on the MNIST and the CIFAR-10 dataset and demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art GAN-based attack AdvGAN with similar attack capability in terms of distortion. We show that our method produces competitive results to notable optimisation-based attacks in the literature including the strongest Carlini Wagner (CW) attack.

AB The lack of hand curated data is a major impediment to developing statistical semantic processors for many of the world languages. Our paper aims to bridge this gap by leveraging existing annotations and semantic processors from multiple source languages by projecting their annotations via the statistical word alignments traditionally used in Machine Translation. Taking the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task as a use case, this work presents a method to automatically induce Named Entity annotated data using parallel corpora without any manual intervention. The projected annotations can then be used to automatically generate semantic processors for the target language helping to overcome the lack of training data for a given language. The experiments are focused on 4 languages: German, English, Spanish and Italian, and our empirical evaluation results show that our method obtains competitive results when compared with models trained on gold-standard, albeit out-of-domain, data. The results point out that our projection algorithm is effective to transport NER annotations across languages thus providing a fully automatic method to obtain NER taggers for as many as the number of languages aligned in parallel corpora. Every resource generated (training data, manually annotated test set and NER models) is made publicly available for its use and to facilitate reproducibility of results.

TI Cryo-EM structure of the spinach chloroplast ribosome reveals the
   location of plastid-specific ribosomal proteins and extensions
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Ribosomes are the protein synthesizing machines of the cell. Recent advances in cryo-EM have led to the determination of structures from a variety of species, including bacterial 70S and eukaryotic 80S ribosomes as well as mitoribosomes from eukaryotic mitochondria, however, to date high resolution structures of plastid 70S ribosomes have been lacking. Here we present a cryo-EM structure of the spinach chloroplast 70S ribosome, with an average resolution of 5.4 A for the small 30S subunit and 3.6 A for the large 50S ribosomal subunit. The structure reveals the location of the plastid-specific ribosomal proteins (RPs) PSRP1, PSRP4, PSRP5 and PSRP6 as well as the numerous plastid-specific extensions of the RPs. We discover many features by which the plastid-specific extensions stabilize the ribosome via establishing additional interactions with surrounding ribosomal RNA and RPs. Moreover, we identify a large conglomerate of plastid-specific protein mass adjacent to the tunnel exit site that could facilitate interaction of the chloroplast ribosome with the thylakoid membrane and the protein-targeting machinery. Comparing the Escherichia coli 70S ribosome with that of the spinach chloroplast ribosome provides detailed insight into the co-evolution of RP and rRNA.

AB For a long time, the detection of diabetic retinopathy has always been a great challenge. People want to find a fast and effective computer-aided treatment to diagnose the disease. In recent years, the rapid development of the deep learning makes it gradually become an effective technique for the analysis of medical images. In this paper, we propose a method to deal with diabetic retinopathy images with generative caption technique of images to generate a simple sequence to explain the abnormal contents in fundus images. The generative technique of images is a generative model based on a deep recurrent architecture that combines convolution neural network (CNN) which is currently state-of-the-art for object recognition and detection with long short -term-memory (LSTM) which is applied with great success to machine translation and sequence generation, and that can be used to generate natural sentences describing an image. The target of the model in training is to maximize the likelihood of the target description sentence given from the training images. The model built on dataset DIARETDBO, DIARETDB1 and Messidor can achieve good performance and generate fluent sequences. In addition, the experimental results show that the accuracy of diagnosis for individual abnormal discoveries is up to 88.53% and the diagnosis accuracy is more than 90%.

Each increment takes into account new properties and system aspects. In this paper, we propose to couple a graphical notation called Algebraic State-Transition Diagrams (ASTD) with an Event-B specification in order to provide a better understanding of the software behaviour. The dynamic behaviour is captured by the ASTD, which is based on automata and process algebra operators, while the data model is described by means of an Event-B specification. We propose a methodology to incrementally refine such specification couplings, taking into account new refinement relations and consistency conditions between the control specification and the data specification. We compare the specifications obtained using each approach for readability and proof complexity. The advantages and drawbacks of the traditional approach and of our methodology are discussed. The whole process is illustrated by a railway CBTC-like case study. Our approach is supported by tools for translating ASTD's into B and Event-B into B.

AB The design and implementation of caches on a given platform has significant impacts to many areas in computer system design. On chip-multiprocessors (CMP), new cache architectures are proposed to meet the rapidly increasing performance requirements. However, the cache architectures are usually not well-documented for commercial processors.
   This raises difficulties for people to precisely understand the working principle of many components of the processors, not only the cache itself, but also the related components like the whole memory subsystem. This paper aims at disclosing the working principle of the last level cache of Intel Ivy Bridge processors. First, we identify the address translation logic on this cache. Second, we disclose the replacement policy of the cache. This is a dynamic insertion replacement policy, which is very different from the widely used LRU policy and its variants. Although this replacement policy has been proposed in academic literatures, our work is the first one showing it is actually used in commercial processors. To show the significance of our discovery, we design a methodology to generate controllable cache miss sequences under this new cache, and apply it to the design of a benchmark to model the memory concurrency. Evaluations on physical machines are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI Ratchet, swivel, tilt and roll: a complete description of subunit
   rotation in the ribosome
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Protein synthesis by the ribosome requires large-scale rearrangements of the 'small' subunit (SSU; similar to 1 MDa), including inter- and intra-subunit rotational motions. However, with nearly 2000 structures of ribosomes and ribosomal subunits now publicly available, it is exceedingly difficult to design experiments based on analysis of all known rotation states. To overcome this, we developed an approach where the orientation of each SSU head and body is described in terms of three angular coordinates (rotation, tilt and tilt direction) and a single translation. By considering the entire RCSB PDB database, we describe 1208 fully-assembled ribosome complexes and 334 isolated small subunits, which span >50 species. This reveals aspects of subunit rearrangements that are universal, and others that are organism/domain-specific. For example, we show that tilt-like rearrangements of the SSU body (i.e. 'rolling') are pervasive in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic (cytosolic and mitochondrial) ribosomes. As another example, domain orientations associated with frameshifting in bacteria are similar to those found in eukaryotic ribosomes. Together, this study establishes a common foundation with which structural, simulation, single-molecule and biochemical efforts can more precisely interrogate the dynamics of this prototypical molecular machine.

TI In vivo spectroscopy: optical fiber probes for clinical applications
SO EXPERT REVIEW OF MEDICAL DEVICES
AB Introduction Fiber optic probe-based in vivo spectroscopy techniques are fast and highly objective methods for intraoperative diagnoses and minimally invasive surgical interventions for all procedures where endoscopic observations are carried out for cancers of different types. The Raman spectral features provide molecular fingerprint-type information and can reveal the subjects' pathological state in label-free manner, making endoscopy multiplexed fiber optic probe-based devices with the potential for translation from bench to bedside for routine applications. Areas Covered This review provides a general overview of different fiber-optic probes for in vivo measurements with emphasis on Raman spectroscopy for biomedical application. Various aspects such as fiber-optic probe, radiation source, detector, and spectrometer for extracting optimum spectral features have also been discussed. Expert opinion Optical spectroscopy-based fiber probe systems with 'Chip-on-Tip' technology, combined with machine learning, can in the near future, become a complementary diagnostic tool to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scan, ultrasound, etc. Hyperspectral imaging and fluorescence-based devices are in the advanced stage of technology readiness level (TRL), and with advances in lasers and miniature spectroscopy systems, probe-based Raman devices are also coming up.

CL Incheon, SOUTH KOREA
AB Inverse text normalization (ITN) is an essential post-processing step in automatic speech recognition (ASR). It converts numbers, dates, abbreviations, and other semiotic classes from the spoken form generated by ASR to their written forms. One can consider ITN as a Machine Translation task and use neural sequence-to-sequence models to solve it. Unfortunately, such neural models are prone to hallucinations that could lead to unacceptable errors. To mitigate this issue, we propose a single-pass token classifier model that regards ITN as a tagging task. The model assigns a replacement fragment to every input token or marks it for deletion or copying without changes. We present a method of dataset preparation, based on granular alignment of ITN examples. The proposed model is less prone to hallucination errors. The model is trained on the Google Text Normalization dataset and achieves state-of-the-art sentence accuracy on both English and Russian test sets. One-to-one correspondence between tags and input words improves the interpretability of the model's predictions, simplifies debugging, and allows for post-processing corrections. The model is simpler than sequence-to-sequence models and easier to optimize in production settings. The model and the code to prepare the dataset is published as part of NeMo project(1).

TI Variation in School District Nutrition Policies and Practices: Community
   Context Matters
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH EDUCATION
AB Background The school nutrition environment has a large impact on child diet. However, there is a paucity of nationally representative research on factors that predict effective nutrition policies, practices, and education in schools.Purpose:The current study utilized Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data from the 2016 School Health Policies and Practices Survey (SHPPS) to explore the impact of poverty and community type (i.e., urban/rural spectrum) on these variables.Methods:Data from the 2016 SHPPS included 740 U.S. public schools. Composite scores were created from survey items related to dietary policies and practices.Results:Schools of greater rurality and urbanicity had more nutrition policies and education but fewer practices than suburban districts. Rural districts generally had fewer nutrition policies, practices, and education than urban districts. Poverty did not consistently predict these variables.Discussion:Community type is a crucial variable in the school nutrition environment and may better explain discrepancies among schools than poverty. Future efforts might focus on improving school nutrition policy and practice adherence, especially in rural areas.Translation to Health Eduation Practice:Further research using nationally representative data can help health educators better understand what interventions may produce the best results within their unique community type.

TI Cross-language question retrieval with multi-layer representation and
   layer-wise adversary
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB In cross-language question retrieval (CLQR), users employ a new question in one language to search the community question answering (CQA) archives for similar questions in another language. In addition to the ranking problem in monolingual question retrieval, one needs to bridge the language gap in CLQR. The existing adversarial models for cross-language learning normally rely on a single adversarial component. Since natural languages consist of units of different abstract levels, we argue that crossing the language gap adaptatively on different levels with multiple adversarial components should lead to smoother text representation and better CLQR performance. To this end, we first encode questions into multi-layer representations of different abstract levels with a CNN based model which enhances conventional models with diverse kernel shapes and the corresponding pooling strategy so as to capture different aspects of a text segment. We then impose a set of adversarial components on different layers of question representation so as to decide the appropriate abstract levels and their role in performing cross-language mapping. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models for CLQR, which is on par with the strong machine translation baselines and most monolingual baselines.

AB There has been an unprecedented surge in the number of service providers offering a wide range of machine learning prediction APIs for tasks such as image classification, language translation, etc. thereby monetizing the underlying data and trained models. Typically, a data owner (API provider) develops a model, often over proprietary data, and leverages the infrastructure services of a cloud vendor for hosting and serving API requests. Clearly, this model assumes complete trust between the API Provider and cloud vendor. On the other hand, a malicious/buggy cloud vendor may copy the APIs and offer an identical service, under-report model usage metrics, or unfairly discriminate between different API providers by offering them a nominal share of the revenue. In this work, we present the design of a blockchain based decentralized trustless API marketplace that enables all the stakeholders in the API ecosystem to audit the behavior of the parties without having to trust a single centralized entity. In particular, our system divides an AI model into multiple pieces and deploys them among multiple cloud vendors who then collaboratively execute the APIs. Our design ensures that cloud vendors cannot collude with each other to steal the combined model, while individual cloud vendors and clients cannot repudiate their input or model executions.

AB Existing vision-language methods typically support two languages at a time at most. In this paper, we present a modular approach which can easily be incorporated into existing vision-language methods in order to support many languages. We accomplish this by learning a single shared Multimodal Universal Language Embedding (MULE) which has been visually-semantically aligned across all languages. Then we learn to relate MULE to visual data as if it were a single language. Our method is not architecture specific, unlike prior work which typically learned separate branches for each language, enabling our approach to easily be adapted to many vision-language methods and tasks. Since MULE learns a single language branch in the multimodal model, we can also scale to support many languages, and languages with fewer annotations can take advantage of the good representation learned from other (more abundant) language data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our embeddings on the bidirectional image-sentence retrieval task, supporting up to four languages in a single model. In addition, we show that Machine Translation can be used for data augmentation in multilingual learning, which, combined with MULE, improves mean recall by up to 20.2% on a single language compared to prior work, with the most significant gains seen on languages with relatively few annotations. Our code is publicly available(1).

TI A Variational Approach to Registration with Local Exponential
   Coordinates
SO COMPUTER GRAPHICS FORUM
AB We identify a novel parameterization for the group of finite rotations (SO3), consisting of an atlas of exponential maps defined over local tangent planes, for the purpose of computing isometric transformations in registration problems that arise in machine vision applications. Together with a simple representation for translations, the resulting system of coordinates for rigid body motions is proper, free from singularities, is unrestricted in the magnitude of motions that can be represented and poses no difficulties in computer implementations despite their multi-chart nature. Crucially, such a parameterization helps to admit varied types of data sets, to adopt data-dependent error functionals for registration, seamlessly bridges correspondence and pose calculations, and inspires systematic variational procedures for computing optimal solutions. As a representative problem, we consider that of registering point clouds onto implicit surfaces without introducing any discretization of the latter. We derive coordinate-free stationarity conditions, compute consistent linearizations, provide algorithms to compute optimal solutions and examine their performance with detailed examples. The algorithm generalizes naturally to registering curves and surfaces onto implicit manifolds, is directly adaptable to handle the familiar problem of pairwise registration of point clouds and allows for incorporating scale factors during registration.

AB As brain-computer interfaces (BCI) must provide reliable ways for end users to accomplish a specific task, methods to secure the best possible translation of the intention of the users are constantly being explored. In this paper, we propose and test a number of convolutional neural network (CNN) structures to identify and classify single-trial P300 in electroencephalogram (EEG) readings of an auditory BCI. The recorded data correspond to nine subjects in a series of experiment sessions in which auditory stimuli following the oddball paradigm were presented via earphones from six different virtual directions at time intervals of 200, 300, 400 and 500 ms. Using three different approaches for the pooling process, we report the average accuracy for 18 CNN structures. The results obtained for most of the CNN models show clear improvement over past studies in similar contexts, as well as over other commonly-used classifiers. We found that the models that consider data from the time and space domains and those that overlap in the pooling process usually offer better results regardless of the number of layers. Additionally, patterns of improvement with single-layered CNN models can be observed.

AB In this paper we present a surgery planning software of total knee replacement (TKR). It was established initially based on the open source package - Visualization Toolkit (VTK). The main innovative feature of this surgery planning system is that it could help the surgeon to choose correct size, orientation and position of the prosthetic components, in order to restore the correct alignment of the mechanical axis of the lower limb. To simulate the multiple degrees of freedom of the embedded prosthesis in operation, such as introversion-extroversion, exterior-interior rotation, flexion-extension, and translations along anatomical axes, in total knee replacement procedure, the appropriate human-machine interactive technology and alignment restrictions were designed to help the operator to perform the virtual cutting and virtual assembly manipulation. Moreover, the clinical commonly used quantitative index contradistinction was provided to assist the doctor to determine the spatial relation of the implantable prosthetic components in 3D space. The function design of the software system was evaluated by the virtual motion analysis of the knee flexion, which obtained a good effect. The process diagram and detailed treatments of virtual operation was provided in this paper. The software of surgery planning plays important roles in preoperative lectotype of the prosthesis and alignment procedure of bone resection and assembly operation.

TI Learning the lie groups of visual invariance
SO NEURAL COMPUTATION
AB A fundamental problem in biological and machine vision is visual invariance: How are objects perceived to be the same despite transformations such as translations, rotations, and scaling? In this letter, we describe a new, unsupervised approach to learning invariances based on Lie group theory. Unlike traditional approaches that sacrifice information about transformations to achieve invariance, the Lie group approach explicitly models the effects of transformations in images. As a result, estimates of transformations are available for other purposes, such as pose estimation and visuomotor control. Previous approaches based on first-order Taylor series expansions of images can be regarded as special cases of the Lie group approach, which utilizes a matrix-exponential-based generative model of images and can handle arbitrarily large transformations. We present an unsupervised expectation-maximization algorithm for learning Lie transformation operators directly from image data containing examples of transformations. Our experimental results show that the Lie operators learned by the algorithm from an artificial data set containing six types of affine transformations closely match the analytically predicted affine operators. We then demonstrate that the algorithm can also recover novel transformation operators from natural image sequences. We conclude by showing that the learned operators can be used to both generate and estimate transformations in images, thereby providing a basis for achieving visual invariance.

AB One of the key requirements of service and rehabilitation robotic systems is the robust perception of the environment. This paper presents the Machine Vision Framework within the rehabilitation robotic system FRIEND II and a method for improving the visual perceptual capability of this system. For the reliable, autonomous performing of the "beverage serving" task robust visual information about the objects to be manipulated in the presence of variable lighting conditions is necessary. A novel aspect of the proposed color object recognition method is its use of feedback control at the image segmentation level, which makes it able to cope with the object color uncertainty caused by different illumination conditions. The idea behind the closed-loop image segmentation is to provide the object recognition step with input data on which it can rely. The proposed object recognition method uses Hu moments which are invariant to rotation, translation and scaling of the object in the image. The benefit of the closed-loop color object recognition in service robotics is demonstrated through the example of the recognition of the green bottle. The presented experimental results on the performance evaluation show that the proposed method has robustness with respect to illumination as well as with respect to the different localization of the object to be manipulated.

AB Purpose: C-arm fluoroscopy is ubiquitous in contemporary surgery, but it lacks the ability to accurately reconstruct 3D information. A major obstacle in fluoroscopic reconstruction is discerning the pose of the Xray image, in 3D space. Optical/magnetic trackers are prohibitively expensive, intrusive and cumbersome.
   Method: We present single-image-based fluoroscope tracking (FTRAC) with the use of an external radiographic fiducial consisting of a mathematically optimized set of points, lines, and ellipses. The fiducial encodes six degrees of freedom in a single image by creating a unique view from any direction. A non-linear optimizer can rapidly compute the pose of the fiducial using this image. The current embodiment has salient attributes: small dimensions (3 x 3 x 5 cm), it need not be close to the anatomy of interest and can be segmented automatically.
   Results: We tested the fiducial and the pose recovery method on synthetic data and also experimentally on a precisely machined mechanical phantom. Pose recovery had an error of 0.56 mm in translation and 0.33 degrees in orientation. Object reconstruction had a mean error of 0.53 mm with 0.16 mm STD.
   Conclusion: The method offers accuracies similar to commercial tracking systems, and is sufficiently robust for intra-operative quantitative C-arm fluoroscopy.

TI Combining BERT with TCN-BiGRU for enhancing Arabic aspect category
   detection
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
AB Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a challenging task of sentiment analysis that aims at extracting the discussed aspects and identifying the sentiment corresponding to each aspect. We can distinguish three main ABSA tasks: aspect term extraction, aspect category detection (ACD), and aspect sentiment classification. Most Arabic ABSA research has relied on rule-based or machine learning-based methods, with little attention to deep learning techniques. Moreover, most existing Arabic deep learning models are initialized using context-freeword embedding models, which cannot handle polysemy. Therefore, this paper aims at overcoming the limitations mentioned above by exploiting the contextualized embeddings from pre-trained language models, specifically the BERT model. Besides, we combine BERT with a temporal convolutional network and a bidirectional gated recurrent unit network in order to enhance the extracted semantic and contextual features. The evaluation results show that the proposed method has outperformed the baseline and other models by achieving an F1-score of 84.58% for the Arabic ACD task. Furthermore, a set of methods are examined to handle the class imbalance in the used dataset. Data augmentation based on back-translation has shown its effectiveness through enhancing the first results by an overall improvement of more than 3% in terms of F1-score.

TI What makes the difference? An empirical comparison of fusion strategies
   for multimodal language analysis
SO INFORMATION FUSION
AB Multimodal video sentiment analysis is a rapidly growing area. It combines verbal (i.e., linguistic) and non-verbal modalities (i.e., visual, acoustic) to predict the sentiment of utterances. A recent trend has been geared towards different modality fusion models utilizing various attention, memory and recurrent components. However, there lacks a systematic investigation on how these different components contribute to solving the problem as well as their limitations. This paper aims to fill the gap, marking the following key innovations. We present the first large-scale and comprehensive empirical comparison of eleven state-of-the-art (SOTA) modality fusion approaches in two video sentiment analysis tasks, with three SOTA benchmark corpora. An in-depth analysis of the results shows that the attention mechanisms are the most effective for modelling crossmodal interactions, yet they are computationally expensive. Second, additional levels of crossmodal interaction decrease performance. Third, positive sentiment utterances are the most challenging cases for all approaches. Finally, integrating context and utilizing the linguistic modality as a pivot for non-verbal modalities improve performance. We expect that the findings would provide helpful insights and guidance to the development of more effective modality fusion models.

AB Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of tasks including Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Text-To-Speech (TTS). These models are usually trained with teacher forcing, where the reference back-history is used to predict the next token. This makes training efficient, but limits performance, because during inference the free-running back-history must be used. To address this problem, deliberation-based multi-pass seq2seq has been used in NMT. Here the output sequence is generated in multiple passes, each one conditioned on the initial input and the free-running output of the previous pass. This paper investigates, and compares, deliberation-based multi-pass seq2seq for TTS and NMT. For NMT the simplest form of multi-pass approaches, where the free-running first-pass output is combined with the initial input, improves performance. However, applying this scheme to TTS is challenging: the multi-pass model tends to converge to the standard single-pass model, ignoring the previous output. To tackle this issue, a guided attention loss is added, enabling the system to make more extensive use of the free-running output. Experimental results confirm the above analysis and demonstrate that the proposed TTS model outperforms a strong baseline.

TI Coreference Resolution Using Neural MCDM and Fuzzy Weighting Technique
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS
AB Coreference resolution has been an active field of research in the past several decades and plays a vital role in many areas such as information extraction, document summarization, machine translation, and question answering systems. This paper presents a new coreference resolution approach by incorporating RoBERTa embedding with a neural multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method. The proposed model does not use any syntactic and dependency parser. Mentions were extracted from the text with an unhand engineered mention detector and features were extracted from a deep neural network. Next, the problem is modeled in the form of effective parameters of the performance such as error rate reduction and enhances the F1 by Kohonen MCDM neural network. The weights assigned to the features represent their importance and suggests the best reference for a mention where such weights are computed using a fuzzy weighting method. Comparing to state-of-the-art coreference resolution models, the simulation results show significant improvements for the proposed approach on different datasets in terms of precision and recall and achieving marginal improvements on the following datasets: English CoNLL-2012 shared task (+3.1 F1), Yahoo's news site (+6.6 F1), and English Gigaword (+7.04).

TI Word sense disambiguation using hybrid swarm intelligence approach
SO PLOS ONE
AB Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the process of identifying an appropriate sense for an ambiguous word. With the complexity of human languages in which a single word could yield different meanings, WSD has been utilized by several domains of interests such as search engines and machine translations. The literature shows a vast number of techniques used for the process of WSD. Recently, researchers have focused on the use of meta-heuristic approaches to identify the best solutions that reflect the best sense. However, the application of meta-heuristic approaches remains limited and thus requires the efficient exploration and exploitation of the problem space. Hence, the current study aims to propose a hybrid meta-heuristic method that consists of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and simulated annealing to find the global best meaning of a given text. Different semantic measures have been utilized in this model as objective functions for the proposed hybrid PSO. These measures consist of JCN and extended Lesk methods, which are combined effectively in this work. The proposed method is tested using a three-benchmark dataset (SemCor 3.0, SensEval-2, and SensEval-3). Results show that the proposed method has superior performance in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches.

TI Cross-lingual link discovery with TR-ESA
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Cross-lingual data linking is the problem of establishing links between resources, such as places, services, or movies, which are described in different languages. In cross-lingual data linking it is often the case that very short descriptions have to be matched, which makes the problem even more challenging. This work presents a method named TRanslationbased Explicit Semantic Analysis (TR-ESA) to represent and match short textual descriptions available in different languages. TR-ESA translates short descriptions in any given language into a pivot language by exploiting a machine translation tool. Then, it generates a Wikipedia-based representation of the translated text by using the Explicit Semantic Analysis technique. The resulting representations are used to match short descriptions in different languages. The method is incorporated in CroSeR (Cross-lingual Service Retrieval), an interactive data linking tool that recommends potential matches to users. We compared results coming from an in-vitro evaluation on a gold standard consisting of five datasets in different languages, with an in-vivo experiment that involved human experts supported by CroSeR The in-vivo evaluation confirmed the results of the in-vitro evaluation and the overall effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI Efficient One-Pass Decoding with NNLM for Speech Recognition
SO IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS
AB Neural network language model (NNLM) has achieved very good results in the field of speech recognition, machine translation, etc. Direct decoding with NNLM is challenging for the overwhelmingly heavy burden in complexity. Most of the previous work focused on rescoring the N-best list and lattice with NNLM in the second pass. In this work, several techniques are explored to directly incorporate the NNLM into the decoder of speech recognition. A novel training algorithm based on variance regularization is proposed to approximate the softmax-normalizing factor as a constant for fast evaluation. Also, the evaluation of NNLM is further speeded up via our advanced storage. Moreover, a simple cache-based strategy is explored to avoid redundant computations during the decoding process. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first time to directly incorporate NNLM into decoding. We evaluate our proposed methods on an English-Switchboard phone-call speech-to-text task. Experimental results show that incorporating the NNLM into the decoder significantly reduces the word error rate (WER) by 1.5% and 1.4% absolutely on the Hub5'00-SWB and RT03S-FSH sets, respectively. Also, the decoding with NNLM is twice as fast as the baseline at the same word error rate.

TI Bidirectional Transformer with absolute-position aware relative position
   encoding for encoding sentences
SO FRONTIERS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Transformers have been widely studied in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, which can capture the dependency from the whole sentence with a high parallelizability thanks to the multi-head attention and the position-wise feed-forward network. However, the above two components of transformers are position-independent, which causes transformers to be weak in modeling sentence structures. Existing studies commonly utilized positional encoding or mask strategies for capturing the structural information of sentences. In this paper, we aim at strengthening the ability of transformers on modeling the linear structure of sentences from three aspects, containing the absolute position of tokens, the relative distance, and the direction between tokens. We propose a novel bidirectional Transformer with absolute-position aware relative position encoding (BiAR-Transformer) that combines the positional encoding and the mask strategy together. We model the relative distance between tokens along with the absolute position of tokens by a novel absolute-position aware relative position encoding. Meanwhile, we apply a bidirectional mask strategy for modeling the direction between tokens. Experimental results on the natural language inference, paraphrase identification, sentiment classification and machine translation tasks show that BiAR-Transformer achieves superior performance than other strong baselines.

TI Multiphysics Design Optimization via Generative Adversarial Networks
SO JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN
AB This work presents a method for generating concept designs for coupled multiphysics problems by employing generative adversarial networks (GANs). Since the optimal designs of multiphysics problems often contain a combination of features that can be found in the single-physics solutions, we investigate the feasibility of learning the optimal design from the single-physics solutions, to produce concept designs for problems that are governed by a combination of these single physics. We employ GANs to produce optimal topologies similar to the results of level set topology optimization (LSTO) by finding a mapping between the sensitivity fields of specific boundary conditions, and the optimal topologies. To find this mapping, we perform image-to-image translation GAN training with a combination of structural, heat conduction, and a relatively smaller number of coupled structural and heat conduction data. We observe that the predicted topologies using GAN for coupled multiphysics problems are very similar to those generated by level set topology optimization, which can then be used as the concept designs for further detailed design. We show that using a combination of multiple single-physics data in the training improves the prediction of GAN for multiphysics problems. We provide several examples to demonstrate this.

AB Coherence is an important aspect of text quality and is crucial for ensuring its readability. It is essential for outputs from text generation systems like summarization, question answering, machine translation, question generation, table-to-text, etc. An automated coherence scoring model is also helpful in essay scoring or providing writing feedback. A large body of previous work has leveraged entity-based methods, syntactic patterns, discourse relations, and traditional deep learning architectures for text coherence assessment. However, these approaches do not consider factual information present in the documents. The transitions of facts associated with entities across sentences could help capture the essence of textual coherence better. We hypothesize that coherence assessment is a cognitively complex task that requires deeper fact-aware models and can benefit from other related tasks. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning model that fuses document-level information with factual information to improve coherence modeling. We further enhance the model efficacy by training it simultaneously with Natural Language Inference task in multi-task learning setting, taking advantage of inductive transfer between the two tasks. Our experiments with popular benchmark datasets across multiple domains demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on a synthetic coherence evaluation task and two real-world tasks involving prediction of varying degrees of coherence.

AB This paper presents a corpus of AZee discourse expressions, i.e. expressions which formally describe Sign Language utterances of any length using the AZee approach and language. The construction of this corpus had two main goals: a first reference corpus for AZee, and a test of its coverage on a significant sample of real-life utterances. We worked on productions from an existing corpus, namely the 40 breves, containing an hour of French Sign Language. We wrote the corresponding AZee discourse expressions for the entire video content, i.e. expressions capturing the forms produced by the signers and their associated meaning by combining known production rules, a basic building block for these expressions. These are made available as a version 2 extension of the 40 br`eves. We explain the way in which these expressions can be built, present the resulting corpus and set of production rules used, and perform first measurements on it. We also propose an evaluation of our corpus: for one hour of discourse, AZee allows to describe 94% of it, while ongoing studies are increasing this coverage. This corpus offers a lot of future prospects, for instance concerning synthesis with virtual signers, machine translation or formal grammars for Sign Language.

TI ThamizhiMorph: A morphological parser for the Tamil language
SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB This paper presents an open source and extendable Morphological Analyser cum Generator (MAG) for Tamil named ThamizhiMorph. Tamil is a low-resource language in terms of NLP processing tools and applications. In addition, most of the available tools are neither open nor extendable. A morphological analyser is a key resource for the storage and retrieval of morphophonological and morphosyntactic information, especially for morphologically rich languages, and is also useful for developing applications within Machine Translation. This paper describes how ThamizhiMorph is designed using a Finite-State Transducer (FST) and implemented using Foma. We discuss our design decisions based on the peculiarities of Tamil and its nominal and verbal paradigms. We specify a high-level meta-language to efficiently characterise the language's inflectional morphology. We evaluate ThamizhiMorph using text from a Tamil textbook and the Tamil Universal Dependency treebank version 2.5. The evaluation and error analysis attest a very high performance level, with the identified errors being mostly due to out-of-vocabulary items, which are easily fixable. In order to foster further development, we have made our scripts, the FST models, lexicons, Meta-Morphological rules, lists of generated verbs and nouns, and test data sets freely available for others to use and extend upon.

TI Is neural always better? SMT versus NMT for Dutch text normalization
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB Social media texts have become one of the most used forms of written language and a valuable source of information for companies. However, despite the wealth of information hidden in social media language for profiling, information extraction and sentiment analysis purposes, this user-generated content is also characterized by non-standard language. This makes it difficult to process using standard NLP techniques as these are typically trained on standard text. Text normalization is often used as a preprocessing step to overcome this problem. In this work, we take a machine translation perspective on text normalization and investigate both statistical and neural methods. We perform text normalization in a low-resource scenario and report both SMT and NMT experiments for three different Dutch user-generated text types: tweets, message board posts and text messages. Furthermore, we look into overcoming the over-normalization problem in NMT using different techniques, viz. teacher forcing, copy mechanism and byte pair encoding. Our results reveal that even though the SMT approach obtains the best results, the NMT system using CopyNet shows promising results even in this low resource setting, solving more normalization issues than SMT although not solving all the over-normalization problems.

TI FiC-RNN: A Multi-FPGA Acceleration Framework for Deep Recurrent Neural
   Networks
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been proven effective for sequence-based tasks thanks to their capability to process temporal information. In real-world systems, deep RNNs are more widely used to solve complicated tasks such as large-scale speech recognition and machine translation. However, the implementation of deep RNNs on traditional hardware platforms is inefficient due to long-range temporal dependence and irregular computation patterns within RNNs. This inefficiency manifests itself in the proportional increase in the latency of RNN inference with respect to the number of layers of deep RNNs on CPUs and GPUs. Previous work has focused mostly on optimizing and accelerating individual RNN cells. To make deep RNN inference fast and efficient, we propose an accelerator based on a multi-FPGA platform called Flow-inCloud (FiC). In this work, we show that the parallelism provided by the multi-FPGA system can be taken advantage of to scale up the inference of deep RNNs, by partitioning a large model onto several FPGAs, so that the latency stays close to constant with respect to increasing number of RNN layers. For single-layer and four-layer RNNs, our implementation achieves 31x and 61x speedup compared with an Intel CPU.

TI Paraphrase detection using LSTM networks and handcrafted features
SO MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Paraphrase detection is one of the fundamental tasks in the area of natural language processing. Paraphrase refers to those sentences or phrases that convey the same meaning but use different wording. It has a lot of applications such as machine translation, text summarization, QA systems, and plagiarism detection. In this research, we propose a new deep-learning based model which can generalize well despite the lack of training data for deep models. After preprocessing, our model can be divided into two separate modules. In the first one, we train a single Bi-LSTM neural network to encode the whole input by leveraging its pretrained GloVe word vectors. In the second module, three sets of handcrafted features are used to measure the similarity between each pair of sentences, some of which are introduced in this research for the first time. Our final model is formed by incorporating the handcrafted features with the output of the Bi-LSTM network. Evaluation results on MSRP and Quora datasets show that it outperforms almost all the previous works in terms of f-measure and accuracy on MSRP and achieves comparable results on Quora. On the Quora-question pair competition launched by Kaggle, our model ranked among the top 24% solutions between more than 3000 teams.

TI Localized Convolutional Neural Networks for Geospatial Wind Forecasting
SO ENERGIES
AB Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) possess many positive qualities when it comes to spatial raster data. Translation invariance enables CNNs to detect features regardless of their position in the scene. However, in some domains, like geospatial, not all locations are exactly equal. In this work, we propose localized convolutional neural networks that enable convolutional architectures to learn local features in addition to the global ones. We investigate their instantiations in the form of learnable inputs, local weights, and a more general form. They can be added to any convolutional layers, easily end-to-end trained, introduce minimal additional complexity, and let CNNs retain most of their benefits to the extent that they are needed. In this work we address spatio-temporal prediction: test the effectiveness of our methods on a synthetic benchmark dataset and tackle three real-world wind prediction datasets. For one of them, we propose a method to spatially order the unordered data. We compare the recent state-of-the-art spatio-temporal prediction models on the same data. Models that use convolutional layers can be and are extended with our localizations. In all these cases our extensions improve the results, and thus often the state-of-the-art. We share all the code at a public repository.

TI Neuromorphic Systems Design by Matching Inductive Biases to Hardware
   Constraints
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
AB Neuromorphic systems are designed with careful consideration of the physical properties of the computational substrate they use. Neuromorphic engineers often exploit physical phenomena to directly implement a desired functionality, enabled by "the isomorphism between physical processes in different media" (Douglas et al.,1995). This bottom-up design methodology could be described as matching computational primitives to physical phenomena. In this paper, we propose a top-down counterpart to the bottom-up approach to neuromorphic design. Our top-down approach, termed "bias matching," is to match the inductive biases required in a learning system to the hardware constraints of its implementation; a well-known example is enforcing translation equivariance in a neural network by tying weights (replacing vector-matrix multiplications with convolutions), which reduces memory requirements. We give numerous examples from the literature and explain how they can be understood from this perspective. Furthermore, we propose novel network designs based on this approach in the context of collaborative filtering. Our simulation results underline our central conclusions: additional hardware constraints can improve the predictions of a Machine Learning system, and understanding the inductive biases that underlie these performance gains can be useful in finding applications for a given constraint.

AB Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) is a serious threat to gas pipelines that is challenging to detect with current in-line inspection technologies. Recently, the potential to detect SCC with Guided Ultrasonic Waves (GUW) using Halfwave's ART Scan (R) tool was successfully demonstrated in pressurized gas on real pipe samples. In this work, the ultrasonic detection of SCC is demonstrated by 3-meter-long pull-through experiments with a modified ART Scan (R) tool consisting of 132 broad-band transducer inside a pressure tank with pressurized gas at 60 bar as acoustic coupling medium. Mechanical translation and rotation from inside 4.6 meter long test spools allowed the acquisition of C-scans with resolutions down to 1.6mmx0.2 degrees. Acoustic signals were received in pitch-catch mode and processed to calculate different parameters like spectral power. Processed 2D scan results demonstrated the detection of crack regions and artificial notches. Resulting plots also demonstrated the sensitivity to undesired low-energy areas, of which some highly correlated with misalignment between the tool and the inner pipe wall. The crack sizing potential was successfully demonstrated by initial sizing algorithms applied to artificial notches that were machined one of the test pipes.

TI Inferring Team Task Plans from Human Meetings: A Generative Modeling
   Approach with Logic-Based Prior
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
AB We aim to reduce the burden of programming and deploying autonomous systems to work in concert with people in time-critical domains such as military field operations and disaster response. Deployment plans for these operations are frequently negotiated on-the-fly by teams of human planners. A human operator then translates the agreed-upon plan into machine instructions for the robots. We present an algorithm that reduces this translation burden by inferring the final plan from a processed form of the human team's planning conversation. Our hybrid approach combines probabilistic generative modeling with logical plan validation used to compute a highly structured prior over possible plans, enabling us to overcome the challenge of performing inference over a large solution space with only a small amount of noisy data from the team planning session. We validate the algorithm through human subject experimentations and show that it is able to infer a human team's final plan with 86% accuracy on average. We also describe a robot demonstration in which two people plan and execute a first-response collaborative task with a PR2 robot. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate a logical planning technique within a generative model to perform plan inference.

TI Thinking it Through: Mental Rehearsal and Performance on 2 Types of
   Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy Simulators
SO JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION
AB OBJECTIVE: Simulation-based training (SBT) in laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LCCY) provides an opportunity for junior residents to learn the procedure in a safe, non-threatening environment. Mental rehearsal (MR) has the potential of augmenting skill acquisition. This project investigated the correlation between MR of LCCY with performance on 2 different types of simulators: a procedural task (PT) training model and virtual reality (VR) machine.
   DESIGN: Prospective, quasi-experimental design with purposeful sampling. Postgraduate years (PGYs) 1 through 3 general surgical residents underwent standardized, distributed SBT in LCCY on either a PT trainer or a VR machine with group-based MR undertaken before 2 SBT sessions. Participants completed a pre-MR and post-MR session mental imagery questionnaire (MIQ) containing 8-items using a 7-point Likert-type scale. Data related to VR objective measures and PT video-based performances were also collected. Total scale mean scores were calculated for the first MR session and the second MR session and were compared using the t test. Pearson correlation analysis of MIQ scores with performance scores was determined.
   SETTING: Louisiana State University Health New Orleans Health Sciences Center in New Orleans, Louisiana. This health sciences center is a tertiary care, academic state institution located in the Southeastern United States.
   PARTICIPANTS: A total of 21 PGYs 1 through 3 general surgery residents participated. They were purposefully divided into the PT and VR training groups to allow for even PGY distribution. Of the 21 participants, 19 completed both training sessions (n = 10 for PT [PGY1 = 4, PGY2 =4, PGY3 =2] and n = 9 for VR [PGY1 =4, PGY2 = 3, PGY3 = 2]).
   RESULTS: After the Bonferroni adjustment, significant gains in the MIQ items related to confidence, visual imagery, and knowledge of the procedure were found. VR performance data demonstrated some statistically significant improvements. A significant negative correlation was present between the two-handed clip-and-cut VR task and MIQ gains.
   CONCLUSIONS: Group MR in LCCY before SBT on a VR machine is related to improved performance time for the VR two-handed clip-and-cut task. MR may be a useful adjunct to SBT LCCY. Future work will look at the translation of these skills to clinical practice. (J Surg 72:740-748. (C) 2015 Association of Program Directors in Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Along with the development of space science and technology, it is not a heart-stirring thing to launch a satellite successfully any more. But we pay greatly attention to space autonomous rendezvous and docking (AR&D) in space operations, such as maintaining, assembling, attacking etc. And that autonomous relative position and pose is one of key technologies of these space actions. Currently, celestial Navigation System (CNS), Inertial Navigation System (INS), Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), such as GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO and Compass etc, and the integrations of them are some methods of autonomous navigation for space. But these methods must be depended on the high speed links of the communications network. Moreover, the precision of CNS is always worse, and can not meet the rigorous requirement of the space activities. INS can not be used for long-term space navigation applications for its errors being accumulated. High accuracy can be met by Carrier Differential Global Positioning System (CDGPS), but it is difficult to calculate the ambiguities of CDGPS.
   Fortunately, autonomous relative position and pose based on machine vision is a direction all over the world currently, and is very suitable for autonomous spacecraft navigation because it has some advantages, such as low-cost, high precision, autonomous ability, easy practicality etc. However, there are some disadvantages of some relative navigation algorithms based-on machine vision, such as complicated description, huge calculation burden, and lack of real-time ability etc. Whereas, the rigid motion of 3D objects can be represented by motor algebra, and the rotation and translation transformations can be calculated simultaneously. So it is more effective for dealing with relative navigation of distributed micro/nano satellite earth observation system. In this paper, on the basis of the attitude dynamics of spacecrafts and the theory of machine vision, an autonomous relative navigation algorithm for distributed micro/nano satellites based on motor algebra and EKF (Extended Kalman Filtering) is proposed. Firstly, how to represent a line transform unit using motor algebra is introduced. Then, the feature line point of the line transform unit is defined. And then, on the basis of the attitude dynamics of spacecrafts and the theory of EKF, we build the state and observation equations. Finally, the simulations show that this algorithm is an accurate valid method in relative navigation of distributed micro/nano satellite earth observation system.

TI The effect of heterogeneous Transcription Start Sites (TSS) on the
   translatome: implications for the mammalian cellular phenotype
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB Background: The genetic program, as manifested as the cellular phenotype, is in large part dictated by the cell's protein composition. Since characterisation of the proteome remains technically laborious it is attractive to define the genetic expression profile using the transcriptome. However, the transcriptional landscape is complex and it is unclear as to what extent it reflects the ribosome associated mRNA population (the translatome). This is particularly pertinent for genes using multiple transcriptional start sites (TSS) generating mRNAs with heterogeneous 5' transcript leaders (5'TL). Furthermore, the relative abundance of the TSS gene variants is frequently cell-type specific. Indeed, promoter switches have been reported in pathologies such as cancer. The consequences of this 5'TL heterogeneity within the transcriptome for the translatome remain unresolved. This is not a moot point because the 5'TL plays a key role in regulating mRNA recruitment onto polysomes.
   Results: In this article, we have characterised both the transcriptome and translatome of the MCF7 (tumoural) and MCF10A (non-tumoural) cell lines. We identified similar to 550 genes exhibiting differential translation efficiency (TE). In itself, this is maybe not surprising. However, by focusing on genes exhibiting TSS heterogeneity we observed distinct differential promoter usage patterns in both the transcriptome and translatome. Only a minor fraction of these genes belonged to those exhibiting differential TE. Nonetheless, reporter assays demonstrated that the TSS variants impacted on the translational readout both quantitatively (the overall amount of protein expressed) and qualitatively (the nature of the proteins expressed).
   Conclusions: The results point to considerable and distinct cell-specific 5'TL heterogeneity within both the transcriptome and translatome of the two cell lines analysed. This observation is in-line with the ribosome filter hypothesis which posits that the ribosomal machine can selectively filter information from within the transcriptome. As such it cautions against the simple extrapolation transcriptome. proteome. Furthermore, polysomal occupancy of specific gene 5'TL variants may also serve as novel disease biomarkers.

TI High-throughput quantum cascade laser (QCL) spectral histopathology: a
   practical approach towards clinical translation
SO FARADAY DISCUSSIONS
AB Infrared microscopy has become one of the key techniques in the biomedical research field for interrogating tissue. In partnership with multivariate analysis and machine learning techniques, it has become widely accepted as a method that can distinguish between normal and cancerous tissue with both high sensitivity and high specificity. While spectral histopathology (SHP) is highly promising for improved clinical diagnosis, several practical barriers currently exist, which need to be addressed before successful implementation in the clinic. Sample throughput and speed of acquisition are key barriers and have been driven by the high volume of samples awaiting histopathological examination. FTIR chemical imaging utilising FPA technology is currently state-of-the-art for infrared chemical imaging, and recent advances in its technology have dramatically reduced acquisition times. Despite this, infrared microscopy measurements on a tissue microarray (TMA), often encompassing several million spectra, takes several hours to acquire. The problem lies with the vast quantities of data that FTIR collects; each pixel in a chemical image is derived from a full infrared spectrum, itself composed of thousands of individual data points. Furthermore, data management is quickly becoming a barrier to clinical translation and poses the question of how to store these incessantly growing data sets. Recently, doubts have been raised as to whether the full spectral range is actually required for accurate disease diagnosis using SHP. These studies suggest that once spectral biomarkers have been predetermined it may be possible to diagnose disease based on a limited number of discrete spectral features. In this current study, we explore the possibility of utilising discrete frequency chemical imaging for acquiring high-throughput, high-resolution chemical images. Utilising a quantum cascade laser imaging microscope with discrete frequency collection at key diagnostic wavelengths, we demonstrate that we can diagnose prostate cancer with high sensitivity and specificity. Finally we extend the study to a large patient dataset utilising tissue microarrays, and show that high sensitivity and specificity can be achieved using high-throughput, rapid data collection, thereby paving the way for practical implementation in the clinic.

TI Towards an effective model for lung disease classification Using Dense
   Capsule Nets for early classification of lung diseases
SO APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
AB Machine Learning and computer vision have been the frontiers of the war against the COVID-19 Pandemic. Radiology has vastly improved the diagnosis of diseases, especially lung diseases, through the early assessment of key disease factors. Chest X-rays have thus become among the commonly used radiological tests to detect and diagnose many lung diseases. However, the discovery of lung disease through X-rays is a significantly challenging task depending on the availability of skilled radiologists. There has been a recent increase in attention to the design of Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) models for lung disease classification. A considerable amount of training dataset is required for CNN to work, but the problem is that it cannot handle translation and rotation correctly as input. The recently proposed Capsule Networks (referred to as CapsNets) are new automated learning architecture that aims to overcome the shortcomings in CNN. CapsNets are vital for rotation and complex translation. They require much less training information, which applies to the processing of data sets from medical images, including radiological images of the chest X-rays. In this research, the adoption and integration of CapsNets into the problem of chest X-ray classification have been explored. The aim is to design a deep model using CapsNet that increases the accuracy of the classification problem involved. We have used convolution blocks that take input images and generate convolution layers used as input to capsule block. There are 12 capsule layers operated, and the output of each capsule is used as an input to the next convolution block. The process is repeated for all blocks. The experimental results show that the proposed architecture yields better results when compared with the existing CNN techniques by achieving a better area under the curve (AUC) average. Furthermore, DNet checks the best performance in the ChestXray-14 data set on traditional CNN, and it is validated that DNet performs better with a higher level of total depth. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI Segmentation and classification of ovarian cancer based on conditional
   adversarial image to image translation approach
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS
AB Medical image analysis and disease diagnosis have significantly improved with the use of AI and Machine Learning algorithms. Automated systems for medical image analysis will help the doctors and radiologists understand the anomaly in a short span of time and with better visualization. Such automated systems will help to reduce the time taken for diagnosis by experts. Recently, Computer Vision is industrialized with the advancements in algorithms and hardware. The proposed study aims to develop a computer vision solution for automatic segmentation and classification of ovarian tumours in discriminating between benign and malignant tumours by image-to-image translation approach using Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN). Our method uses a novel algorithm which segments and classifies the images in a single pipeline which makes the algorithm unique and useful. This research also aims to compare its diagnostic accuracy with that of an expert radiologist. The dataset used by in the present study is formulated with images obtained from a hospital and annotated by doctors from the hospital. The obtained results show the proposed study is promising for ovarian cancer segmentation and classification with an average segmentation score of 0.825 for benign and 0.765 for malignant and classification accuracy of 83% for benign and 79% for malignant, precision score of 85% for benign and 80% for malignant and F1 score of 81% for benign and 80.1% for malignant images. The proposed methodology is evaluated on the existing MRI images to perform segmentation and classification. The results obtained shows that the proposed methodology can perform well on other MRI images. In this study, proposed methodology is convenient as separate segmentation need not be done and is giving good result. The same MRI images are segmented using UNet and classified using RESNET 101 and results are compared with the proposed methodology.

AB Terahertz time domain spectroscopy system (THz-TDS) is the most commonly means of measuring terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. The time delay between the pump and probe laser is an important technology to realize THz time domain spectrum measurement. The translation platform with two mirrors and the mechanical structure is the popular means to adjust the optical path difference between the pump and probe laser to get the time delay of femtosecond pulse. Because of the limit of the mechanical structure and the phase-locked amplifier, this technique can't scan spectrum fast. In order to obtain high quality signal, a long time will be taken to scan spectrum. So a more rapid and convenient time delay technology is required to Instead of the machine translation platform and accomplish the Rapid spectral measurement. Asynchronous optical sampling technique is a way to get the time delay by producing a very small frequency difference between the repetition frequency of two femtosecond lasers. The scanner time will be reduced, because of there is no waste of time, due to mechanical inertia, not only by using the asynchronous optical sampling method to replace the mechanical structure without the influence of vibration. It will greatly increase the degree of integration by using the fiber femtosecond laser and highly integrated circuit to realize optical asynchronous sampling.
   To solve the problem above, a terahertz time-domain spectroscopy system based on asynchronous sampling is designed in thisthesis. The system is based of two femtosecond laser whose repetition frequencyis 100MHz. In order to realize asynchronous sampling, the control circuit of the two lasers is the most important. This thesis focuses on the researching, designing and experiment of this circuit. Firstly, the circuit is designed overall. Thenthe selection of the key device and the designing of the circuit principle is done by myself. Secondly, the test of the circuit to phase lockedthe master and slave fiber femtosecond lasershas been done. As a result, the two laserscanphaselockedon two repetition frequencies with a small frequency difference calculated by the circuit.

TI Dynamic interplay between RPL3-and RPL3L-containing ribosomes modulates
   mitochondrial activity in the mammalian heart
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB The existence of naturally occurring ribosome heterogeneity is now a well-acknowledged phenomenon. However, whether this heterogeneity leads to functionally diverse 'specialized ribosomes' is still a controversial topic. Here, we explore the biological function of RPL3L (uL3L), a ribosomal protein (RP) paralogue of RPL3 (uL3) that is exclusively expressed in skeletal muscle and heart tissues, by generating a viable homozygous Rpl3l knockout mouse strain. We identify a rescue mechanism in which, upon RPL3L depletion, RPL3 becomes up-regulated, yielding RPL3-containing ribosomes instead of RPL3L-containing ribosomes that are typically found in cardiomyocytes. Using both ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) and a novel orthogonal approach consisting of ribosome pulldown coupled to nanopore sequencing (Nano-TRAP), we find that RPL3L modulates neither translational efficiency nor ribosome affinity towards a specific subset of transcripts. In contrast, we show that depletion of RPL3L leads to increased ribosome-mitochondria interactions in cardiomyocytes, which is accompanied by a significant increase in ATP levels, potentially as a result of fine-tuning of mitochondrial activity. Our results demonstrate that the existence of tissue-specific RP paralogues does not necessarily lead to enhanced translation of specific transcripts or modulation of translational output. Instead, we reveal a complex cellular scenario in which RPL3L modulates the expression of RPL3, which in turn affects ribosomal subcellular localization and, ultimately, mitochondrial activity.
   Lay Summary Ribosomes are macromolecular machines responsible for protein synthesis in all living beings. Recent studies have shown that ribosomes can be heterogeneous in their structure, possibly leading to a specialized function. Here, we focus on RPL3L, a ribosomal protein expressed exclusively in striated muscles. We find that the deletion of the Rpl3l gene in a mouse model triggers a compensation mechanism, in which the missing RPL3L protein is replaced by its paralogue, RPL3. Furthermore, we find that RPL3-containing ribosomes establish closer interactions with mitochondria, cellular organelles responsible for energy production, leading to higher energy production when compared with RPL3L-containing ribosomes. Finally, we show that the RPL3-RPL3L compensation mechanism is also triggered in heart disease conditions, such as hypertrophy and myocardial infarction.

AB Computer-based automatically generated text is used in various applications (e.g., text summarization, machine translation) and has come to play an important role in daily life. However, computer-generated text may produce confusing information due to translation errors and inappropriate wording caused by faulty language processing, which could be a critical issue in presidential elections and product advertisements. Previous methods for detecting computer-generated text typically estimate text fluency, but this may not be useful in the near future due to the development of neural-network-based natural language generation that produces wording close to human crafted wording. A different approach to detecting computer generated text is thus needed.
   We hypothesize that human-crafted wording is more consistent than that of a computer. For instance, Zipf's law states that the most frequent word in human-written text has approximately twice the frequency of the second most frequent word, nearly three times that of the third most frequent word, and so on. We found that this is not true in the case of computer-generated text. We hence propose a method to identify computer-generated text on the basis of statistics. First, the word distribution frequencies are compared with the corresponding Zipfian distributions to extract the frequency features. Next, complex phrase features are extracted because human-generated text contains more complex phrases than computer-generated text. Finally, the higher consistency of the human-generated text is quantified at both the sentence level using phrasal verbs and at the paragraph level using coreference resolution relationships, which are integrated into consistency features.
   The combination of the frequencies, the complex phrases, and the consistency features was evaluated for 100 English books written originally in English and 100 English books translated from Finnish. The results show that our method achieves better performance (accuracy = 98.0%; equal error rate = 2.9%) compared with the most suitable method for books using parsing tree feature extraction. Evaluation using two other languages (French and Dutch) showed similar results. The proposed method thus works consistently in various languages.

TI SBMLsqueezer: A CellDesigner plug-in to generate kinetic rate equations
   for biochemical networks
SO BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY
AB Background: The development of complex biochemical models has been facilitated through the standardization of machine-readable representations like SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language). This effort is accompanied by the ongoing development of the human-readable diagrammatic representation SBGN (Systems Biology Graphical Notation). The graphical SBML editor CellDesigner allows direct translation of SBGN into SBML, and vice versa. For the assignment of kinetic rate laws, however, this process is not straightforward, as it often requires manual assembly and specific knowledge of kinetic equations.
   Results: SBMLsqueezer facilitates exactly this modeling step via automated equation generation, overcoming the highly error-prone and cumbersome process of manually assigning kinetic equations. For each reaction the kinetic equation is derived from the stoichiometry, the participating species (e.g., proteins, mRNA or simple molecules) as well as the regulatory relations (activation, inhibition or other modulations) of the SBGN diagram. Such information allows distinctions between, for example, translation, phosphorylation or state transitions. The types of kinetics considered are numerous, for instance generalized mass-action, Hill, convenience and several Michaelis-Menten-based kinetics, each including activation and inhibition. These kinetics allow SBMLsqueezer to cover metabolic, gene regulatory, signal transduction and mixed networks. Whenever multiple kinetics are applicable to one reaction, parameter settings allow for user-defined specifications. After invoking SBMLsqueezer, the kinetic formulas are generated and assigned to the model, which can then be simulated in CellDesigner or with external ODE solvers. Furthermore, the equations can be exported to SBML, LaTeX or plain text format.
   Conclusion: SBMLsqueezer considers the annotation of all participating reactants, products and regulators when generating rate laws for reactions. Thus, for each reaction, only applicable kinetic formulas are considered. This modeling scheme creates kinetics in accordance with the diagrammatic representation. In contrast most previously published tools have relied on the stoichiometry and generic modulators of a reaction, thus ignoring and potentially conflicting with the information expressed through the process diagram.

TI Optical Flow Estimation and Denoising of Video Images Based on Deep
   Learning Models
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In order to effectively extract image features highly related to visual perception quality, improve the image quality evaluation method, under the framework of deep learning, combining the optical flow method and the edge detection algorithm, a multi-feature fusion motion based on improved optical flow is proposed target detection algorithm. First, a video fluid model is proposed. The fluid model decomposes the video object area changes into sub-area zoom, rotation and translation movements. The rigid body area and the area hierarchy describe the spatial relationship of pixels, and the rigid body motion describes the time domain relationship of pixels. It provides a region-based video processing. The associated spatiotemporal is association method. Secondly, a video fluid model is proposed. The video fluid model treats all pixels of the same surface imaged in the video as a fluid, using streamlines to represent the regional motion of the object, and streamlines to represent the pixel motion of the video object, using rotators and translation lines to simplify the streamlines when necessary. The streamline of the same fluid is smooth in the time domain, and the flow pattern is smooth in both the time domain and the space domain. Finally, the top-down deep learning generation model conversion is carried out, and finally through continuous adjustment between different levels, the generation model can reconstruct the original sample with lower error, so that the essential characteristics of this sample are obtained, namely the highest abstract representation of the depth model. After processing the deep learning model, the sample features after dimensionality reduction can be obtained, and the recognition module is used on this basis. Experiments show that the optical flow estimation method based on deep learning and multi-grid, optical flow field estimation method based on variational model and desiccation method proposed in this paper are effective, and it is suitable for moving image analysis, target tracking and 3D reconstruction Such research has certain theoretical significance and practical application value.

AB Template matching is a significant approach in machine vision due to its effectiveness and robustness. However, most of the template matching methods are so time consuming that they can't be used to many real time applications. The closed contour matching method is a popular kind of template matching methods. This paper presents a new closed contour template matching method which is suitable for two dimensional objects. Coarse-to-fine searching strategy is used to improve the matching efficiency and a partial computation elimination scheme is proposed to further speed up the searching process. The method consists of offline model construction and online matching. In the process of model construction, triples and distance image are obtained from the template image. A certain number of triples which are composed by three points are created from the contour information that is extracted from the template image. The rule to select the three points is that the template contour is divided equally into three parts by these points. The distance image is obtained here by distance transform. Each point on the distance image represents the nearest distance between current point and the points on the template contour. During the process of matching, triples of the searching image are created with the same rule as the triples of the model. Through the similarity that is invariant to rotation, translation and scaling between triangles, the triples corresponding to the triples of the model are found. Then we can obtain the initial RST (rotation, translation and scaling) parameters mapping the searching contour to the template contour. In order to speed up the searching process, the points on the searching contour are sampled to reduce the number of the triples. To verify the RST parameters, the searching contour is projected into the distance image, and the mean distance can be computed rapidly by simple operations of addition and multiplication. In the fine searching process, the initial RST parameters are discrete to obtain the final accurate pose of the object. Experimental results show that the proposed method is reasonable and efficient, and can be used in many real time applications.

TI The effect of oblique femoral tunnel placement on rotational constraint
   of the knee reconstructed using patellar tendon autografts
SO ARTHROSCOPY-THE JOURNAL OF ARTHROSCOPIC AND RELATED SURGERY
AB Purpose: Despite the high long-term success rates of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions, 8% of patients undergoing this primary procedure have recurrent disability and graft failure. Nonanatomic tunnel positioning (primarily of the femoral tunnel) accounts for most of all technical failures. We hypothesized that reconstructions that closely recreate the oblique femoral attachment of the ACL would result in more normal knee rotational stability than more vertical reconstruction. The purpose of this study was to determine whether obliquity of the femoral tunnel in the coronal (frontal) plane has an effect on rotational constraint after ACL reconstruction, as measured by anterior tibial translation, external rotation, and internal rotation. Type of Study: Ex vivo biomechanical study. Methods: Ten matched pairs of fresh-frozen cadaver knees were alternately assigned to a standard or an oblique tunnel position reconstruction. Each knee was tested at 30degrees and 90degrees of flexion on a materials testing machine in ACL-intact, ACL-sectioned, and ACL-reconstructed states. A 100-N load was applied at a rate of 10 N/second, and anterior tibial translation was measured. Then 6.5 Nm of torque were applied, and external tibial rotation and internal tibial rotation were measured. The effects of tunnel placement and ligament condition were analyzed with a repeated measures analysis of variance. Significance was set at P less than or equal to .05 (Tukey's test). Results: At 30degrees of flexion, internal tibial rotation in oblique reconstruction was restored to intact values and was significantly less than the internal tibial rotation values in standard reconstruction. Internal tibial rotation in standard reconstruction was significantly greater than intact values. No significant differences were found between standard and oblique tunnel reconstructions and the respective intact values for the remaining internal tibial rotation and all external tibial rotation tests, regardless of flexion angle. Conclusions: In our biomechanical model, ACL reconstructions using oblique femoral tunnels restored normal knee kinematics.

TI Tensile and Torsional Structural Properties of the Native Scapholunate
   Ligament
SO JOURNAL OF HAND SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME
AB Purpose The ideal material for reconstruction of the scapholunate interosseous ligament (SLIL) should replicate the mechanical properties of the native SLIL to recreate normal kinematics and prevent posttraumatic arthritis. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the cyclic torsional and tensile properties of the native SLIL and load to failure tensile properties of the dorsal SLIL.
   Methods The SLIL bone complex was resected from 10 fresh-frozen cadavers. The scaphoid and lunate were secured in polymethylmethacrylate and mounted on a test machine that incorporated an x-y stage and universal joint, which permitted translations perpendicular to the rotation/pull axis as well as nonaxial angulations. After a 1 N preload, specimens underwent cyclic torsional testing (+/- 0.45 N m flexion/extension at 0.5 Hz) and tensile testing (1-50 N at 1 Hz) for 500 cycles. Lastly, the dorsal 10 mm of the SLIL was isolated and displaced at 10 mm/min until failure.
   Results During intact SLIL cyclic torsional testing, the neutral zone was 29.7 degrees +/- 6.6 degrees and the range of rotation 46.6 degrees +/- 7.1 degrees. Stiffness in flexion and extension were 0.11 +/- 0.02 and 0.12 +/- 0.02 N m/deg, respectively. During cyclic tensile testing, the engagement length was 0.2 +/- 0.1 mm, the mean stiffness was 276 +/- 67 N/mm, and the range of displacement was 0.4 +/- 0.1 mm The dorsal SLIL displayed a 0.3 +/- 0 2 mm engagement length, 240 +/- 65 N/mm stiffness, peak load of 270 +/- 91 N, and displacement at peak load of 1.8 +/- 0.3 mm.
   Conclusions We report the torsional properties of the SLIL. Our novel test setup allows for free rotation and translation, which reduces out-of-plane force application. This may explain our observation of greater dorsal SLIL load to failure than previous reports. Copyright (C) 2018 by the American Society for Surgery of the Hand. All rights reserved.

TI Restrained tibial rotation may prevent ACL injury during landing at
   different flexion angles
SO KNEE
AB Background: Internal tibial rotation is a risk factor for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. The effect of re-Straining tibial rotation (RTR) to prevent ACL injury during single-leg landing is not well understood. We aimed to investigate the effect of impact load and RTR on ACL injury with respect to flexion angle. We hypothesized that RTR could protect the knee from ACL injury compared to free tibial rotation (FTR) regardless of flexion angle and create a safety zone to protect the ACL.
   Methods: Thirty porcine specimens were potted in a rig manufactured to replicate single-leg landing maneuvers. A mechanical testing machine was used to apply external forces in the direction of the tibial long axis. A 3D displacement sensor measured anterior tibial translation (AU). The specimens were divided into 3 groups of 10 specimens and tested at flexion angles of 22 +/- 1 degrees, 37 +/- 1 degrees and 52 +/- 1 degrees (five RTR and five FTR) through a consecutive range of actuator displacements until ACL failure. After dissection, damage to the joint was visually recorded. Two-way ANOVA were utilized in order to compare compressive forces, torques and A/P displacements with respect to flexion angle.
   Results: The largest difference between peak axial compressive forces (similar to 3.4 kN) causing ACL injury between RTR and FTR was reported at a flexion-angle of 22 degrees Tibial torques-with RTR was in the same range and <20 Nm-at the instance and just before ACL failure, compared to a significant reduction when cartilage/bone damage (no ACL failure) was reported. Isolated ACL injuries were observed in ten of the 15 FTR specimens. Injuries to bone and cartilage were more common with RTR.
   Conclusions: RTR increases the threshold for ACL injury by elevating the compressive impact load required at lower flexion angles. These findings may contribute to neuromuscular training programs or brace designs used to avoid excessive internal/external tibial rotation. Caution must be exercised as bone/cartilage damage may result. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Improving Dynamic Binary Optimization Through Early-Exit Guided Code
   Region Formation
SO ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES
CT 9th ACM SIGPLAN/SIGOPS International Conference on Virtual Execution
   Environments
CY MAR 16-17, 2013
CL Houston, TX
AB Most dynamic binary translators (DBT) and optimizers (DBO) target binary traces, i.e. frequently executed paths, as code regions to be translated and optimized. Code region formation is the most important first step in all DBTs and DBOs. The quality of the dynamically formed code regions determines the extent and the types of optimization opportunities that can be exposed to DBTs and DBOs, and thus, determines the ultimate quality of the final optimized code. The Next-Executing-Tail (NET) trace formation method used in HP Dynamo is an early example of such techniques. Many existing trace formation schemes are variants of NET. They work very well for most binary traces, but they also suffer a major problem: the formed traces may contain a large number of early exits that could be branched out during the execution. If this happens frequently, the program execution will spend more time in the slow binary interpreter or in the unoptimized code regions than in the optimized traces in code cache. The benefit of the trace optimization is thus lost. Traces/regions with frequently taken early-exits are called delinquent traces/regions. Our empirical study shows that at least 8 of the 12 SPEC CPU2006 integer benchmarks have delinquent traces.
   In this paper, we propose a light-weight region formation technique called Early-Exit Guided Region Formation (EEG) to improve the quality of the formed traces/regions. It iteratively identifies and merges delinquent regions into larger code regions. We have implemented our EEG algorithm in two LLVM-based multi-threaded DBTs targeting ARM and IA32 instruction set architecture (ISA), respectively. Using SPEC CPU2006 benchmark suite with reference inputs, our results show that compared to an NET-variant currently used in QEMU, a state-of-the-art retargetable DBT, EEG can achieve a significant performance improvement of up to 72% (27% on average), and to 49% (23% on average) for IA32 and ARM, respectively.

TI Comparison of glenohumeral mechanics following a capsular shift and
   anterior tightening
SO JOURNAL OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME
AB Background: Numerous surgical techniques have been developed to treat glenohumeral instability. Anterior tightening procedures have been associated with secondary glenohumeral osteoarthritis, unlike the anterior-inferior capsular shift procedure, which has been widely advocated as a more anatomical repair. The objective of the present study was to quantify glenohumeral joint translations, articular contact, and resultant forces in cadaveric specimens in order to compare the effects of unidirectional anterior tightening with those of the anterior-inferior capsular shift.
   Methods: Six normal fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders were tested on a custom rig with use of a coordinate-measuring machine to obtain kinematic measurements and a six-axis load transducer to measure resultant external joint forces. Shoulders were tested in the scapular plane in three configurations (normal anatomical, anterior tightening, and anterior-inferior capsular shift) and in three humeral rotations (neutral, internal, and external). Glenohumeral articular surface geometry was quantified with use of stereophotogrammetry for kinematic and contact analyses, Resultant joint forces were computed on the basis of digitized coordinates of tendon insertions and origins.
   Results: Compared with the controls (maximum elevation, 167 degrees +/- 8 degrees), the anteriorly tightened specimens demonstrated loss of external rotation, significantly restricted maximum elevation (135 degrees +/- 16 degrees, p = 0.002), posterior-inferior humeral head subluxation, and significantly greater posteriorly directed resultant forces at higher elevations (p < 0.05). In contrast, compared with the controls, the specimens that had been treated with the anterior-inferior capsular shift demonstrated a similar maximum elevation (159 degrees +/- 11 degrees, p = 0.8) without any apparent loss of external rotation and with reduced humeral translation.
   Conclusions: Anterior tightening adversely affects joint mechanics by decreasing joint stability, limiting both external rotation and arm elevation, and requiring greater posterior joint forces to attain maximum elevation. The anterior-inferior capsular shift improves joint stability while preserving external rotation with no significant loss of maximum elevation.
   Clinical Relevance: The results of this in vitro cadaveric study support clinical observations that the anterior-inferior capsular shift procedure more closely recreates normal joint mechanics in comparison with unidirectional anterior tightening procedures.

TI Physiological Tremor Filtering Without Phase Distortion for Robotic
   Microsurgery
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB All existing physiological tremor filtering algorithms, developed for robotic microsurgery, use nonlinear phase prefilters to isolate the tremor signal. Such filters cause phase distortion to the filtered tremor signal and limit the filtering accuracy. We revisited this long-standing problem to enable filtering of the physiological tremor without any phase distortion. We developed a combined estimation-prediction paradigm that offers zero-phase type filtering. The estimation is achieved with the mathematically modified recursive singular spectrum analysis algorithm, and the prediction is delivered with the standard extreme learning machine. In addition, to limit the computational cost, we developed two moving window versions of this structure, which are appropriate for real-time implementation. The proposed paradigm preserved the natural phase of the filtered tremor. It achieved the key performance index of error limitation below 10 mu m, yielding the estimation accuracy larger than 70%, at a time delay of 36 ms only. Both moving window versions of the proposed approach restricted the computational cost considerably while offering the same performance. It is the first time that the effective estimation of the physiological tremor is achieved, without any prefiltering and phase distortion. This proposed method is feasible for real-time implantation. Clinical translation of the proposed paradigm can significantly enhance the outcome in hand-held surgical robotics.
   Note to Practitioners-The imprecision caused by physiological hand tremor in microsurgeries has motivated researchers to innovate an efficient tremor compensating technique that can improve surgical performance. Yet, all the existing tremor filtering algorithms, implemented in hand-held surgical instruments, use nonlinear phase prefilters to separate the tremor signal. The inherent phase distortion caused by such prefilters restricts the filtering performance significantly and renders the existing methods inadequate for hand-held robotic surgery. Motivated by this, we proposed a novel estimator-predictor-based framework, by adopting the modified recursive singular spectrum analysis estimator and the extreme learning machine predictor. The proposed framework filters the tremor signal accurately, without distorting it, but at a small fixed lag. In a set of rigorous testing performed by emulating real-time processing, the proposed algorithm showed higher performance compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. This validates not only its suitability for real-time implantation but also its potential to improve surgical performance, which has been limited by the distorted filtering. Nonetheless, we have presented a proof-of-principle framework for distortion-free filtering, but its full implementation in a real surgical instrument, such as Micron or ITrem, requires a substantial amount of experimental testing and verification. It can be also applicable in a wide range of areas, including health-care, digital manufacturing, smart automation and control, and various other robotic technologies where efficient filtering of advanced sensor data is highly desirable. In the future, we will develop the multidimensional model of the proposed framework to enable filtering of tremor in the xyz-axes simultaneously.

TI ESTONIANS' ATTEMPTS TO INVENT PERPETUUM MOBILE BETWEEN THE 1870S AND
   1940 AS A MANIFESTATION OF MODERNIZATION OF SOCIETY
SO ACTA HISTORICA TALLINNENSIA
AB The roots of the perpetual motion machine (perpetuum mobile) lie in the 7th century AD. The impossibility of creating perpetuum mobile was established in the 19th century. Modern science considers perpetuum mobile as a pseudoscientific phenomenon.
   Estonians made their first contacts with the problem of perpetual motion abroad or through foreign literature. In Estonia information about perpetuum mobile became widespread in the last quarter of the 19th century, mainly through newspapers. Until the 20th century the problem of perpetuum mobile was covered most thoroughly in the newspaper Olevik. The purpose of Olevik, in which the perpetual motion was regarded as impossible, was to educate and to lead the reader to useful action (of inventing). In other newspapers the problem of perpetual motion was considered randomly. The role of newspapers in spreading information about perpetuum mobile should be considered ambivalent because of the inconsistency of news. The published information influenced people to think about inventing perpetuum mobile but there were also articles that strictly excluded the possibility of such machine. Especially in the 1920s and 1930s perpetual motion was treated as an entertaining topic (perpetuum mobile as a curiosity).
   In literature perpetuum mobile was rarely mentioned. The term ` perpetuum mobile ' was included in some dictionaries and encyclopedias. The accuracy of the definitions increased in the course of time. Terms equivalent to perpetuum mobile in Estonian started to spread in the 1920s. Perpetuum mobile was seldom mentioned in calendars and fiction. In physics textbooks written by Estonians the problem of perpetual motion was not considered. However, in the translated textbook by B. Stewart from the year 1908 the problem was considered. The few popular science publications that mentioned perpetuum mobile were also translations. Magazines mainly treated perpetual motion as a symbol of pointless inventions. The invention of perpetuum mobile was derided. Insufficient treatment of perpetual motion in fiction and in magazines was due to the fact that the problem was not enough attractive or necessary to authors. There were also very few publications about the physics and other topics related to perpetual motion, which could complement the physical knowledge of people and to influence them to give up the idea of building perpetuum mobile.
   Endeavours to invent a perpetual-motion machine spread over the whole area of Estonia. Among inventors were people from schoolboys to aged persons. Women did not try to create perpetuum mobile. The idea of perpetuum mobile especially inspired blacksmiths and (industrial) workers. They had enough knowledge and skills for practical action of invention (but not for making blueprints). A positive result of attempts to create perpetuum mobile was the development of individual skilfulness. Many persons who attempted to create perpetuum mobile could also invent more useful devices and appliances.
   Most of the inventors worked upon the machine with full dedication and selfconfidence. The inventors ' faith in success was magical-religious. It based totally on emotions and wishful thinking. There were people for whom perpetuum mobile became fixation (monomania). The failure of invention could result in physical problems because people were mentally not ready to deal with the complicated issue of perpetual motion (sign of collision between the new and old value systems). The main reasons of trying to build a perpetual-motion device were new needs that emerged in the conditions of modernization (need for creation, self-actualization and recognition).
   The idea of perpetual motion was simple, highly attractive and easily adoptable. The idea of creating an ideal machine -the perpetuum mobile did incite the secret dreams and hopes (the reduction of nature, improving the life and solution to the problem of energy). Money played a very important role in the attempts to create a perpetual-motion machine. The desire to become rich inspired to deal with perpetuum mobile, but there were also costs related to the building process, which needed to be covered. Therefore more watchful inventors tried to find financial backing for finishing their project.
   As perpetuum mobile was thought to be the key to huge wealth, the inventors avoided talking openly about their work. The persons who had no problem of talking wanted above all to get the reputation or just to leave a trace of themselves. The inventor of perpetuum mobile was an active creator, who believed it was possible to change his own life and even the world. The rise of personal selfawareness manifests itself in the development of an individual-based value system.
   The most ambitious inventors tried to patent their perpetual-motion machines in the Estonian Patent Office established in 1919. Although no perpetuum mobile was patented during the years in question, the patent officers regarded the people hoping to patent their machine with understanding at the beginning of the 1920s. The attitude of categorically denying the possibility of perpetuum mobile developed during the second half of the 1930s. Refusal to patent any such devices was explained with the hypothetical machine ' s contradiction with the laws of nature and science. The Patent Office also had to deal with letters and interpellations related to perpetuum mobile. The persons wanting to patent their machine struggled to understand the nature of perpetual motion and they had troubles trying to clearly express their standpoints.
   The widespread interest in building a perpetual-motion machine was related to the modernizing of society (industrialization, the spread of technology and the development of a new system of values). The precondition of the popularity of attempts to invent perpetuum mobile was inadequacy of education and knowledge. Inventors were not able to analyse the problem of perpetual motion thoroughly enough and it was often understood incompletely. The nature of science and its message was alien to the inventors of perpetuum mobile. It was the progress of machines and tools, not the progress of science that was important to the inventors of perpetuum mobile. Constant experience of social and technological progress led to the opinion that science would change its standpoint concerning perpetual motion.
   The endeavours to create a perpetual-motion device have features of pseudoscience but the inventors had no scientific aims. The inventing of perpetuum mobile can be observed as a response to great economic, scientific, social and mental changes. The old, magical-religious worldview had started to collapse and its values needed to be replaced by new values. As the forming of a new scientific worldview needed time, the pseudoscientific sphere helped initially to satisfy the new type of mental and intellectual needs of many people. Perpetuum mobile was part of this sphere.
   The common aspect that characterizes people delighted by the idea of perpetuum mobile was a certain kind of openness. Although their physical and scientific knowledge was limited, they had keen minds, and that is what needs to be highlighted in the context of the era.

TI A roadmap for research in medical physics via academic medical centers:
   The DIVERT Model
SO MEDICAL PHYSICS
AB The field of medical physics has struggled with the role of research in recent years, as professional interests have dominated its growth toward clinical service. This article focuses on the subset of medical physics programs within academic medical centers and how a refocused academic mission within these centers should drive and support Discovery and Invention with Ventures and Engineering for Research Translation (DIVERT). A roadmap to a DIVERT-based scholarly research program is discussed here around the core building blocks of: (a) creativity in research and team building, (b) improved quality metrics to assess activity, (c) strategic partnerships and spinoff directions that extend capabilities, and (d) future directions driven by faculty-led initiatives. Within academia, it is the unique discoveries and inventions of faculty that lead to their recognition as scholars, and leads to financial support for their research programs and reconition of their intellectual contributions. Innovation must also be coupled to translation to demonstrate outcome successes. These ingredients are critical for research funding, and the two-decade growth in biomedical engineering research funding is an illustration of this, where technology invention has been the goal. This record can be contrasted with flat funding within radiation oncology and radiology, where a growing fraction of research is more procedure-based. However, some centers are leading the change of the definition of medical physics, by the inclusion or assimilation of researchers in fields such as biomedical engineering, machine learning, or data science, thereby widening the scope for new discoveries and inventions. New approaches to the assessment of research quality can help realize this model, revisiting the measures of success and impact. While research partnerships with large industry are productive, newer efforts that foster enterprise startups are changing how institutions see the benefits of the connection between academic innovation and affiliated startup company formation. This innovation-to-enterprise focus can help to cultivate a broader bandwidth of donor-to-investor networks. There are many predictions on future directions in medical physics, yet the actual inventive and discovery steps come from individual research faculty creativity. All success through a DIVERT model requires that faculty-led initiatives span the gap from invention to translation, with support from institutional leadership at all steps in the process. Institutional investment in faculty through endowments or clinical revenues will likely need to increase in the coming years due to the relative decreasing size of grants. Yet, radiology and radiation oncology are both high-revenue, translational fields, with the capacity to synergistically support clinical and research operations through large infrastructures that are mutually beneficial. These roadmap principles can provide a pathway for committed academic medical physics programs in scholarly leadership that will preserve medical physics as an active part of university academics.

TI Roman to Gurmukhi Social Media Text Normalization
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT COMPUTING AND CYBERNETICS
AB Purpose Normalization is an important step in all the natural language processing applications that are handling social media text. The text from social media poses a different kind of problems that are not present in regular text. Recently, a considerable amount of work has been done in this direction, but mostly in the English language. People who do not speak English code mixed the text with their native language and posted text on social media using the Roman script. This kind of text further aggravates the problem of normalizing. This paper aims to discuss the concept of normalization with respect to code-mixed social media text, and a model has been proposed to normalize such text. Design/methodology/approach The system is divided into two phases - candidate generation and most probable sentence selection. Candidate generation task is treated as machine translation task where the Roman text is treated as source language and Gurmukhi text is treated as the target language. Character-based translation system has been proposed to generate candidate tokens. Once candidates are generated, the second phase uses the beam search method for selecting the most probable sentence based on hidden Markov model. Findings Character error rate (CER) and bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) score are reported. The proposed system has been compared with Akhar software and RB\_R2G system, which are also capable of transliterating Roman text to Gurmukhi. The performance of the system outperforms Akhar software. The CER and BLEU scores are 0.268121 and 0.6807939, respectively, for ill-formed text. Research limitations/implications It was observed that the system produces dialectical variations of a word or the word with minor errors like diacritic missing. Spell checker can improve the output of the system by correcting these minor errors. Extensive experimentation is needed for optimizing language identifier, which will further help in improving the output. The language model also seeks further exploration. Inclusion of wider context, particularly from social media text, is an important area that deserves further investigation. Practical implications The practical implications of this study are: (1) development of parallel dataset containing Roman and Gurmukhi text; (2) development of dataset annotated with language tag; (3) development of the normalizing system, which is first of its kind and proposes translation based solution for normalizing noisy social media text from Roman to Gurmukhi. It can be extended for any pair of scripts. (4) The proposed system can be used for better analysis of social media text. Theoretically, our study helps in better understanding of text normalization in social media context and opens the doors for further research in multilingual social media text normalization. Originality/value Existing research work focus on normalizing monolingual text. This study contributes towards the development of a normalization system for multilingual text.

TI Rain Streak Removal for Single Images Using Conditional Generative
   Adversarial Networks
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Rapid developments in urbanization and smart city environments have accelerated the need to deliver safe, sustainable, and effective resource utilization and service provision and have thereby enhanced the need for intelligent, real-time video surveillance. Recent advances in machine learning and deep learning have the capability to detect and localize salient objects in surveillance video streams; however, several practical issues remain unaddressed, such as diverse weather conditions, recording conditions, and motion blur. In this context, image de-raining is an important issue that has been investigated extensively in recent years to provide accurate and quality surveillance in the smart city domain. Existing deep convolutional neural networks have obtained great success in image translation and other computer vision tasks; however, image de-raining is ill posed and has not been addressed in real-time, intelligent video surveillance systems. In this work, we propose to utilize the generative capabilities of recently introduced conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) as an image de-raining approach. We utilize the adversarial loss in GANs that provides an additional component to the loss function, which in turn regulates the final output and helps to yield better results. Experiments on both real and synthetic data show that the proposed method outperforms most of the existing state-of-the-art models in terms of quantitative evaluations and visual appearance.

TI Molecular Imaging of Inflammatory Disease
SO BIOMEDICINES
AB Inflammatory diseases include a wide variety of highly prevalent conditions with high mortality rates in severe cases ranging from cardiovascular disease, to rheumatoid arthritis, to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, to graft vs. host disease, to a number of gastrointestinal disorders. Many diseases that are not considered inflammatory per se are associated with varying levels of inflammation. Imaging of the immune system and inflammatory response is of interest as it can give insight into disease progression and severity. Clinical imaging technologies such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are traditionally limited to the visualization of anatomical information; then, the presence or absence of an inflammatory state must be inferred from the structural abnormalities. Improvement in available contrast agents has made it possible to obtain functional information as well as anatomical. In vivo imaging of inflammation ultimately facilitates an improved accuracy of diagnostics and monitoring of patients to allow for better patient care. Highly specific molecular imaging of inflammatory biomarkers allows for earlier diagnosis to prevent irreversible damage. Advancements in imaging instruments, targeted tracers, and contrast agents represent a rapidly growing area of preclinical research with the hopes of quick translation to the clinic.

TI RNA processing machineries in Archaea: the 5 '-3 ' exoribonuclease
   aRNase J of the beta-CASP family is engaged specifically with the
   helicase ASH-Ski2 and the 3 '-5 ' exoribonucleolytic RNA exosome
   machinery
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB A network of RNA helicases, endoribonucleases and exoribonucleases regulates the quantity and quality of cellular RNAs. To date, mechanistic studies focussed on bacterial and eukaryal systems due to the challenge of identifying the main drivers of RNA decay and processing in Archaea. Here, our data support that aRNase J, a 5'-3' exoribonuclease of the beta-CASP family conserved in Euryarchaeota, engages specifically with a Ski2-like helicase and the RNA exosome to potentially exert control over RNA surveillance, at the vicinity of the ribosome. Proteomic landscapes and direct protein-protein interaction analyses, strengthened by comprehensive phylogenomic studies demonstrated that aRNase J interplay with ASH-Ski2 and a cap exosome subunit. Finally, Thermococcus barophilus whole-cell extract fractionation experiments provide evidences that an aRNase J/ASH-Ski2 complex might exist in vivo and hint at an association of aRNase J with the ribosome that is emphasised in absence of ASH-Ski2. Whilst aRNase J homologues are found among bacteria, the RNA exosome and the Ski2-like RNA helicase have eukaryotic homologues, underlining the mosaic aspect of archaeal RNA machines. Altogether, these results suggest a fundamental role of beta-CASP RNase/helicase complex in archaeal RNA metabolism.

TI Spontaneous translation of nanodroplet over a heterogeneous surface due
   to thermal cycles: role of solid-liquid interfacial fluctuations
SO MOLECULAR PHYSICS
AB We study the molecular-scale features of the solid surface that result in the spontaneous motion of a nanodroplet due to the periodic variation of temperature. We first employ a thermodynamic model to predict the variation of solid-fluid interfacial properties that can result in the above motion. The model identifies a composite (surface couple) made of two surfaces that are characterised by a large difference between the entropic parts of the solid-liquid interfacial free energies. In order to understand the molecular-scale features of the two surfaces that may form a surface couple, we performed grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations of Lennard Jones fluid and crystalline surfaces made of Lennard Jones-like atoms. We then used the cumulant expansions of the perturbation formulas to divide the interfacial entropy into two parts: The one that is directly affected by the solid-fluid attraction (direct part), and the other (indirect part) that is indirectly affected by the solid-fluid attraction via the alteration of interfacial fluctuations. Our results indicate that two surfaces form a surface couple if the differences between their chemical natures lead to large differences in the indirect part of the interfacial entropy, while the direct part remains relatively unaffected.

TI Upper and Lower Tight Error Bounds for Feature Omission with an
   Extension to Context Reduction
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB In this work, fundamental analytic results in the form of error bounds are presented that quantify the effect of feature omission and selection for pattern classification in general, as well as the effect of context reduction in string classification, like automatic speech recognition, printed/handwritten character recognition, or statistical machine translation. A general simulation framework is introduced that supports discovery and proof of error bounds, which lead to the error bounds presented here. Initially derived tight lower and upper bounds for feature omission are generalized to feature selection, followed by another extension to context reduction of string class priors (aka language models) in string classification. For string classification, the quantitative effect of string class prior context reduction on symbol-level Bayes error is presented. The tightness of the original feature omission bounds seems lost in this case, as further simulations indicate. However, combining both feature omission andcontext reduction, the tightness of the bounds is retained. A central result of this work is the proof of the existence, and the amount of a statistical threshold w.r.t. the introduction of additional features in general pattern classification, or the increase of context in string classification beyond which a decrease in Bayes error is guaranteed.

TI Kinetics of hydrogen molecules in MAGNUM-PSI
SO PLASMA SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Results from simulations of plasma and neutrals under conditions predictively characterizing the detached plasma regime in the linear machine MAGNUM-PSI are presented. The relaxation of the vibrationally excited hydrogen molecules is investigated in order to establish a relation between their relaxation and dwell times, and the role of the various mechanisms of the molecular vibrational kinetics. The results obtained show that the individual vibrational states have to be included in the transport code for neutrals as distinct species, since the relaxation time of the vibrational states is sufficiently longer than the typical dwell time of hydrogen molecules in the detached plasma region. The parameters of plasma and neutrals are affected by the transport of the vibrationally excited hydrogen molecules. Furthermore, the rate of molecular recombination is overestimated by a factor of similar to 5 provided that the transport of hydrogen molecules only in their ground vibrational state is considered. The role of the various processes of vibrational kinetics is studied. The vibrational excitation through singlet electronic states has a strong influence on the molecular densities for levels with vibrational quantum numbers v >= 5. Vibration-vibration (V-V) collisions between vibrationally excited hydrogen molecules and vibration-translation (V-T) collisions between vibrationally excited hydrogen molecules and ground state molecules and atoms are of minor importance in MAGNUM-PSI.

TI Fine-grained semantic textual similarity measurement via a feature
   separation network
SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE
AB Semantic text similarity (STS), which measures the semantic similarity of sentences, is an important task in the field of NLP. It has a wide range of applications, such as machine translation (MT), semantic search, and summarization. In recent years, with the development of deep neural networks, the existing semantic similarity measurement has made great progress. In particular, pretraining models, such as BERT-based models, which have been good representations of sentence features, have set a new state-of-the-art on STS tasks. Although a large amount of corpus data are used in the pretraining stage, there is no fine-grained semantic analysis. We observe that many sentences, such as user reviews and the QA corpus, can be abstractly regarded as including two core parts: a) this sentence states a certain attribute; and b) this attribute is described by descriptive words. This feature is particularly prominent in the corpus of reviews. Motivated by the above observations, in this paper, we propose a feature separation network (FSN) model, which can further separate and extract attribute features and description features and then measure the semantic similarity according to the separated features. To better verify the effectiveness of our model, we propose an unsupervised approach to construct the semantic similarity dataset in the review domain. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the general semantic similarity measurement method.

TI Automated Coronary Optical Coherence Tomography Feature Extraction with
   Application to Three-Dimensional Reconstruction
SO TOMOGRAPHY
AB Coronary optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an intravascular, near-infrared light-based imaging modality capable of reaching axial resolutions of 10-20 mu m. This resolution allows for accurate determination of high-risk plaque features, such as thin cap fibroatheroma; however, visualization of morphological features alone still provides unreliable positive predictive capability for plaque progression or future major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Biomechanical simulation could assist in this prediction, but this requires extracting morphological features from intravascular imaging to construct accurate three-dimensional (3D) simulations of patients' arteries. Extracting these features is a laborious process, often carried out manually by trained experts. To address this challenge, numerous techniques have emerged to automate these processes while simultaneously overcoming difficulties associated with OCT imaging, such as its limited penetration depth. This systematic review summarizes advances in automated segmentation techniques from the past five years (2016-2021) with a focus on their application to the 3D reconstruction of vessels and their subsequent simulation. We discuss four categories based on the feature being processed, namely: coronary lumen; artery layers; plaque characteristics and subtypes; and stents. Areas for future innovation are also discussed as well as their potential for future translation.

TI Constraint-Based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Network for
   Multi-Modality Cardiac Image Segmentation
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS
AB The cardiac CT and MRI images depict the various structures of the heart, which are very valuable for analyzing heart function. However, due to the difference in the shape of the cardiac images and imaging techniques, automatic segmentation is challenging. To solve this challenge, in this paper, we propose a new constraint-based unsupervised domain adaptation network. This network first performs mutual translation of images between different domains, it can provide training data for the segmentation model, and ensure domain invariance at the image level. Then, we input the target domain into the source domain segmentation model to obtain pseudo-labels and introduce cross-domain self-supervised learning between the two segmentation models. Here, a new loss function is designed to ensure the accuracy of the pseudo-labels. In addition, a cross-domain consistency loss is also introduced. Finally, we construct a multi-level aggregation segmentation network to obtain more refined target domain information. We validate our method on the public whole heart image segmentation challenge dataset and obtain experimental results of 82.9% and 5.5 on dice and average symmetric surface distance (ASSD), respectively. These experimental results prove that our method can provide important assistance in the clinical evaluation of unannotated cardiac datasets.

TI From hidden to visible: A unified framework for transforming behavioral
   theories into rewrite theories
SO THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Algebraic formalization and verification are effective and practical ways of modeling and verifying software systems by both model checking and theorem proving techniques. In algebraic approaches, a system can be modeled either in a hidden way as a behavioral theory or in a visible way as a rewrite theory. Several approaches have been proposed to transform behavioral theories into rewrite theories for integrating model checking and theorem proving in verification. In this paper, we propose a framework for transforming behavioral theories into rewrite theories, which unifies four existing related transformation approaches. In this framework, each existing transformation approach can be viewed as a process of transforming behavioral theories first into a special class of behavioral theories and finally into rewrite theories. From this perspective, these transformation approaches differ from each other only in the transformation from ordinary behavioral theories into the classified ones, and their transformations from the classified ones into rewrite theories are essentially the same. We prove that the transformation framework preserves linear-time properties. The preservation of linear-time properties guarantees that a counterexample found by model checking a linear-time property with a generated rewrite theory is also a counterexample in the original behavioral theory, as required by integrated verification.

TI The ribosome destabilizes native and non-native structures in a nascent
   multidomain protein
SO PROTEIN SCIENCE
AB Correct folding is a prerequisite for the biological activity of most proteins. Folding has largely been studied using in vitro refolding assays with isolated small, robustly folding proteins. A substantial fraction of all cellular proteomes is composed of multidomain proteins that are often not amenable to this approach, and their folding remains poorly understood. These large proteins likely begin to fold during their synthesis by the ribosome, a large molecular machine that translates the genetic code. The ribosome affects how folding proceeds, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely obscure. We have utilized optical tweezers to study the folding of elongation factor G, a multidomain protein composed of five domains. We find that interactions among unfolded domains interfere with productive folding in the full-length protein. The N-terminal G-domain constitutes an independently folding unit that, upon in vitro refolding, adopts two similar states that correspond to the natively folded and a non-native, possibly misfolded structure. The ribosome destabilizes both of these states, suggesting a mechanism by which terminal misfolding into highly stable, non-native structures is avoided. The ribosome may thus directly contribute to efficient folding by modulating the folding of nascent multidomain proteins.

AB Recent advances in neural networks, along with the growth of rich and diverse community question answering (cQA) data, have enabled researchers to construct robust open-domain question answering (QA) systems. It is often claimed that such state-of-the-art QA systems far outperform traditional IR baselines such as BM25. However, most such studies rely on relatively small data sets, e.g., those extracted from the old TREC QA tracks. Given massive training data plus a separate corpus of Q&A pairs as the target knowledge source, how well would such a system really perform? How fast would it respond? In this demonstration, we provide the attendees of SIGIR 2017 an opportunity to experience a live comparison of two open-domain QA systems, one based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture with over 11 million Yahoo! Chiebukuro (i.e., Japanese Yahoo! Answers) questions and over 27.4 million answers for training, and the other based on BM25. Both systems use the same Q&A knowledge source for answer retrieval. Our core demonstration system is a pair of Japanese monolingual QA systems, but we leverage machine translation for letting the SIGIR attendees enter English questions and compare the Japanese responses from the two systems after translating them into English.

TI Compartmentalized gene regulatory network of the pathogenic fungus
   Fusarium graminearum
SO NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB Head blight caused by Fusarium graminearum threatens world-wide wheat production, resulting in both yield loss and mycotoxin contamination.
   We reconstructed the global F. graminearum gene regulatory network (GRN) from a large collection of transcriptomic data using Bayesian network inference, a machine-learning algorithm. This GRN reveals connectivity between key regulators and their target genes. Focusing on key regulators, this network contains eight distinct but interwoven modules. Enriched for unique functions, such as cell cycle, DNA replication, transcription, translation and stress responses, each module exhibits distinct expression profiles.
   Evolutionarily, the F. graminearum genome can be divided into core regions shared with closely related species and variable regions harboring genes that are unique to F. graminearum and perform species-specific functions. Interestingly, the inferred top regulators regulate genes that are significantly enriched from the same genomic regions (P < 0.05), revealing a compartmentalized network structure that may reflect network rewiring related to specific adaptation of this plant pathogen.
   This first-ever reconstructed filamentous fungal GRN primes our understanding of pathogenicity at the systems biology level and provides enticing prospects for novel disease control strategies involving the targeting of master regulators in pathogens. The program can be used to construct GRNs of other plant pathogens.

AB Scene text extraction is recent research area in the field of Computer Vision. Text component in an image is of particular interest, as it is easy to understand by both humans as well as machines and can be used in variety of applications like content- based image retrieval, aids for visually impaired people, translator for tourists. Although there exists a lot of research activities in this field, it is still remained as a challenging problem, mainly due to two issues: different variety of text patterns like fonts, colors, sizes, orientations; and presence of background outliers similar to text characters, such as windows, bricks. In this paper, an android application named as TravelMate is developed, which is a user- friendly application to assist the tourist navigation, while they are roaming in foreign countries. Proposed application is able to extract text from an image, which is captured by an android mobile camera. Extraction is performed using stroke width transform (SWT) approach and connected component analysis. Extracted texts are recognized using Google's open source optical character recognition (OCR) engine 'Tesseract' and translated to a target language using Google's translation. The entire result is displayed back onto the screen of the mobile Phone.

TI An expression-based site of origin diagnostic method designed for
   clinical application to cancer of unknown origin
SO CANCER RESEARCH
AB Gene expression profiling offers a promising new technique for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. We have applied this technology to build a clinically robust site of origin classifier with the ultimate aim of applying it to determine the origin of cancer of unknown primary (CUP). A single cDNA microarray platform was used to profile 229 primary and metastatic tumors representing 14 tumor types and multiple histologic subtypes. This data set was subsequently used for training and validation of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, demonstrating 89% accuracy using a 13-class model. Further, we show the translation of a five-class classifier to a quantitative PCR-based platform. Selecting 79 optimal gene markers, we generated a quantitative-PCR low-density array, allowing the assay of both fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. Data generated using both quantitative PCR and microarray were subsequently used to train and validate a cross-platform SVM model with high prediction accuracy. Finally, we applied our SVM classifiers to 13 cases of CUP. We show that the microarray SVM classifier was capable of making high confidence predictions in 11 of 13 cases. These predictions were supported by comprehensive review of the patients' clinical histories.

   Recognition Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
SO SOFT ROBOTICS
AB Hand gesture recognition, one of the most popular research topics in human-machine interaction, is extensively used in visual and augmented reality, sign language translation, prosthesis control, and so on. To improve the flexibility and interactivity of wearable gesture sensing interfaces, flexible electronic systems for gesture recognition have been widely studied. However, these systems are limited in terms of wearability, stability, scalability, and robustness. Herein, we report a flexible wearable hand gesture recognition system that is based on an iontronic capacitive pressure sensing array and deep convolutional neural networks. The entire capacitive array is integrated into a flexible silicone wristband and can be comfortably and conveniently wrapped around the wrist. The pressure sensing array, which is composed of an iontronic film sandwiched between two flexible screen-printed electrode arrays, exhibits a high sensitivity (775.8 kPa(-1)), fast response time (65 ms), and high durability (over 6000 cycles). Image processing techniques and deep convolutional neural networks are applied for sensor signal feature extraction and hand gesture recognition. Several contexts such as intertrial test (average accuracy of 99.9%), intersession rewearing (average accuracy of 93.2%), electrode shift (average accuracy of 83.2%), and different arm positions during measurement (average accuracy of 93.1%) are evaluated.

TI Low-Frequency Raman Scattering of Transfer and Ribosomal RNA
SO JETP LETTERS
AB DNA and RNA are essential for the life of all organisms, as they support the storage and transfer of hereditary information and its use in protein construction. In addition, some noncoding RNAs are parts of various molecular machines, for instance, ribosomes. The tertiary structures of DNA and RNA are of paramount importance for their normal functioning in replication, transcription, and translation. Information on these structures can be obtained from Raman spectra in the low-frequency (LF) range (below 200 cm(-1)). This is the first report on such spectra for two noncoding RNAs, transfer and ribosomal (the latter within ribosomes) and their comparison with the DNA spectrum. It has been found that the two RNA spectra are very similar in the range below 100 cm(-1), but they are significantly different in the range of 100-200 cm(-1) after subtracting the characteristic broadband signal. In addition, the LF Raman scattering intensity of RNA is notably lower than that of DNA. This difference, additionally confirmed by a molecular dynamics simulation of transfer RNA and DNA, is related to the greater ordering of RNA than DNA owing to the stronger interaction between segments of biomolecules. Thus, the study of LF Raman spectra of nucleic acids may provide information for understanding their state, determining the course of key intracellular processes.

TI Attention-based deep survival model for time series data
SO RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY
AB In the era of internet of things and Industry 4.0, smart products and manufacturing systems emit signals tracking their operating condition in real-time. Survival analysis shows its strength in modeling such signals to determine the condition of in-service equipment and products to yield critical operational decisions, i.e., maintenance and repair. One appealing aspect of survival analysis is the possibility to include subjects in the model which did not have their failure yet or when the exact failure time is unknown.
   NN-based survival models, i.e., deep survival models, show superior performance in modeling the nonlinear relationship between the reliability function and covariates. We propose a novel deep survival model, seq2surv, to incorporate the seq2seq structure and attention mechanism to enhance the ability to analyze a sequence of signals in the survival analysis. Similar to the seq2seq model which shows superior performance in machine translation, we designed the seq2surv model to translate from a sequence of signals to a sequence of survival probabilities and to update the reliability predictions along with real-time monitoring. Our results show that the seq2surv model outperforms existing deep survival approaches in terms of higher prediction accuracy and lower errors in the survival function estimation on both simulated and real-world datasets.

TI Research on Semantic Similarity of Short Text Based on Bert and Time
   Warping Distance
SO JOURNAL OF WEB ENGINEERING
AB The research on semantic similarity of short text plays an important role in machine translation, emotion analysis, information retrieval and other AI business applications. However, according to existing short text similarity research, the characteristics of ambiguous vocabularies are difficult to be effectively analyzed, the solution of the problem caused by words order needs to be further optimized as well. This paper proposes a short text semantic similarity calculation method that combines BERT and time warping distance algorithm, in order to solve the problem of vocabulary ambiguity. The model first uses the pre trained Bert model to extract the semantic features of the short text from the whole level, and obtains a 768 dimensional short text feature vector. Then, it transforms the extracted feature vector into a point sequence in space, uses the CTW algorithm to calculate the time warping distance between the curves connected by the point sequence, and finally uses the weight function designed by the analysis, according to the smaller the time warpage distance is, the higher the degree of small similarity is, to calculate the similarity between short texts. The experimental results show that this model can mine the feature information of ambiguous words, and calculate the similarity of short texts with lexical ambiguity effectively. Compared with other models, it can distinguish the semantic features of ambiguous words more accurately.

TI Based on Improved Edge Detection Algorithm for English Text Extraction
   and Restoration From Color Images
SO IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
AB The superimposed text in color images is an important clue to help understand the content of the image. Extracting and translating it into a familiar language is a hot research topic in the current image field. However, because the background of the image is usually complicated, effective text extraction and restoration is very challenging. In view of the above problems, this paper proposes an English text repair and extraction algorithm for color images based on improved edge detection algorithm. Firstly, the text of the color image is repaired by the sample block-based method. Secondly, the traditional edge-based detection method is improved, and the image is grayed out, and the edge detection is performed to obtain the candidate text area. Then, using the restrictive conditions such as text color and size, the text area is filtered out to extract the target text. Finally, the text information embedded in the extracted processed color image is translated into the target language. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has higher accuracy and faster computing speed, and achieves a better comprehensive effect. It further illustrates the extraction of English text by image processing technology, which can facilitate machine translation.

AB The brain-computer interface (BCI) has become one of the most important biomedical research fields and has many useful applications. An important component of BCI, electroencephalography (EEG) is in general sensitive to noise and rich in all kinds of information from our brain. In this paper, we study the feature fusion problem in electroencephalography (EEG). We introduce (1) a discriminative feature extractor which can classify multi-labels from short-term EEG signals, and (2) a new strategy to filter out unwanted features from EEG signals based on our feature extractor. Filtering out signals relating to one property of the EEG signal while retaining another is similar to the way we can listen to just one voice during a party, which is known as the cocktail party problem in the machine learning area. Built based on the success of short-term EEG discriminative model, the feature filter is an end-to-end framework which is trained to map EEG signals with unwanted features directly to EEG signals without those features. Our experimental results on an alcoholism dataset show that our novel model can filter out over 90% of alcoholism information on average from EEG signals, with an average of only 4.2% useful feature accuracy lost, showing effectiveness for our proposed task.

TI Toward Addiction Prediction: An Overview of Cross-Validated Predictive
   Modeling Findings and Considerations for Future Neuroimaging Research
SO BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY-COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE AND NEUROIMAGING
AB Substance use is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Despite the existence of evidence-based treatments, clinical outcomes are highly variable across individuals, and relapse rates following treatment remain high. Within this context, methods to identify individuals at particular risk for unsuccessful treatment (i.e., limited within-treatment abstinence), or for relapse following treatment, are needed to improve outcomes. Cumulatively, the literature generally supports the hypothesis that individual differences in brain function and structure are linked to differences in treatment outcomes, although anatomical loci and directions of associations have differed across studies. However, this work has almost entirely used methods that may overfit the data, leading to inflated effect size estimates and reduced likelihood of reproducibility in novel clinical samples. In contrast, cross-validated predictive modeling (i.e., machine learning) approaches are designed to overcome limitations of traditional approaches by focusing on individual differences and generalization to novel subjects (i.e., cross-validation), thereby increasing the likelihood of replication and potential translation to novel clinical settings. Here, we review recent studies using these approaches to generate brain-behavior models of treatment outcomes in addictions and provide recommendations for further work using these methods.

AB CT image denoising can be treated as an image-to-image translation task where the goal is to learn the transform between a source domain X (noisy images) and a target domain Y (clean images). Recently, cycle-consistent adversarial denoising network (CCADN) has achieved state-of-the-art results by enforcing cycle-consistent loss without the need of paired training data. Our detailed analysis of CCADN raises a number of interesting questions. For example, if the noise is large leading to significant difference between domain X and domain Y, can we bridge X and Y with an intermediate domain Z such that both the denoising process between X and Z and that between Z and Y are easier to learn? As such intermediate domains lead to multiple cycles, how do we best enforce cycle-consistency? Driven by these questions, we propose a multi-cycle-consistent adversarial network (MCCAN) that builds intermediate domains and enforces both local and global cycle-consistency. The global cycle-consistency couples all generators together to model the whole denoising process, while the local cycle-consistency imposes effective supervision on the process between adjacent domains. Experiments show that both local and global cycle-consistency are important for the success of MCCAN, which outperforms the state-of-the-art.

AB Energy Consumption has been continuously increasing due to the rapid expansion of high-density cities, and growth in the industrial and commercial sectors. To reduce the negative impact on the environment and improve sustainability, it is crucial to efficiently manage energy consumption. Internet of Things (IoT) devices, including widely used smart meters, have created possibilities for energy monitoring as well as for sensor based energy forecasting. Machine learning algorithms commonly used for energy forecasting such as feedforward neural networks are not well-suited for interpreting the time dimensionality of a signal. Consequently, this paper uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to capture time dependencies and proposes a novel energy load forecasting methodology based on sample generation and Sequence-to-Sequence (S2S) deep learning algorithm. The S2S architecture that is commonly used for language translation was adapted for energy load forecasting. Experiments focus on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) based S2S models and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based S2S models. All models were trained and tested on one building-level electrical consumption dataset, with five-minute incremental data. Results showed that, on average, the GRU S2S models outperformed LSTM S2S, RNN S2S, and Deep Neural Network models, for short, medium, and long-term forecasting lengths.

TI Brain-Computer Interfaces for Augmentative and Alternative
   Communication: A Tutorial
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY
AB Purpose: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have the potential to improve communication for people who require but are unable to use traditional augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices. As BCIs move toward clinical practice, speech-language pathologists (SLPs) will need to consider their appropriateness for AAC intervention.
   Method: This tutorial provides a background on BCI approaches to provide AAC specialists foundational knowledge necessary for clinical application of BCI. Tutorial descriptions were generated based on a literature review of BCIs for restoring communication.
   Results: The tutorial responses directly address 4 major areas of interest for SLPs who specialize in AAC: (a) the current state of BCI with emphasis on SLP scope of practice (including the subareas: the way in which individuals access AAC with BCI, the efficacy of BCI for AAC, and the effects of fatigue), (b) populations for whom BCI is best suited, (c) the future of BCI as an addition to AAC access strategies, and (d) limitations of BCI.
   Conclusion: Current BCIs have been designed as access methods for AAC rather than a replacement; therefore, SLPs can use existing knowledge in AAC as a starting point for clinical application. Additional training is recommended to stay updated with rapid advances in BCI.

TI Kinematic/dynamic analysis and optimization of a 2-URR-RRU parallel
   manipulator
SO NONLINEAR DYNAMICS
AB A 2-URR-RRU parallel manipulator has two rotational degrees of freedom (DOF) and one translational DOF, where U denotes a universal joint and R a revolute joint. The 2-URR-RRU parallel manipulator has promising engineering potentials. However, investigations on its kinematics, dynamics and optimal design are deficient, which tremendously hinders its application. This paper presents the kinematic/dynamic modeling and motion/force performance-based optimization of the 2-URR-RRU parallel manipulator. Firstly two rotation axes and one translation direction are found by mobility analysis based on screw theory. Then forward/inverse kinematic models are constructed for position analysis. Based on the kinematics, dynamics modeling is established through the Newton-Euler method. The Jacobian matrix, which relates the velocity of actuators and that of the end-effector, is deduced to investigate the singularity of the parallel manipulator. Analysis reveals that this manipulator only has inverse singularities, with no forward or combined singularities. In addition, its workspace is obtained with a compromise of main practical limitations. Furthermore, force/motion performance indices are employed for optimization of geometrical parameters. This study brings valuable kinematic/dynamic insights of the 2-URR-RRU parallel manipulator and is fundamental to further research in stiffness analysis and control system design.

TI Designing the structure and folding pathway of modular topological
   bionanostructures
SO CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB Polypeptides and polynucleotides are programmable natural polymers whose linear sequence can be easily designed and synthesized by the cellular transcription/translation machinery. Nature primarily uses proteins as the molecular machines and nucleic acids as the medium for the manipulation of heritable information. A protein's tertiary structure and function is defined by multiple cooperative weak long-range interactions that have been optimized through evolution. DNA nanotechnology uses orthogonal pairwise interacting modules of complementary nucleic acids as a strategy to construct defined complex 3D structures. A similar approach has recently been applied to protein design, using orthogonal dimerizing coiled-coil segments as interacting modules. When concatenated into a single polypeptide chain, they self-assemble into the 3D structure defined by the topology of interacting modules within the chain. This approach allows the construction of geometric polypeptide scaffolds, bypassing the folding problem of compact proteins by relying on decoupled pairwise interactions. However, the folding pathway still needs to be optimized in order to allow rapid self-assembly under physiological conditions. Again the modularity of designed topological structures can be used to define the rules that guide the folding pathway of long polymers, such as DNA, based on the stability and topology of connected building modules. This approach opens the way towards incorporation of designed foldamers in biological systems and their functionalization.

AB Model Driven Development (NOD) is rapidly becoming a mainstream practice for the development of complex aerospace systems. UML has emerged as the de facto standard for modeling languages, supporting a wide range of modeling aspects and refinement levels. As a consequence, models can easily become too complex for manual verification and simple static analysis(12).
   This paper describes an approach to using the Java (TM) Pathfmder (JPF) software model checker to systematically verify UML state charts. While state machines in general are amenable to model checking, embedded actions and guards in UML state charts are not, since they require execution and analysis of a full programming language to cover the whole model behavior. Many UML development systems can produce code from diagrams, but this code is usually aimed at production systems, and is not suitable for software model checkers.
   Our approach is based on a specific translation scheme from UML state charts into Java code that (a) is highly readable, (b) shows close correspondence between diagram and program, (c) provides a 1:1 mapping between model and program states, and (d) imposes no restrictions about aspects and actions that can be modeled.
   We have demonstrated scalability and efficiency of this approach on hierarchical state charts with up to 1000 states, including verification of incomplete models by means of guided model checking. This paper provides an overview of the method based on an exemplary spacecraft model.

TI Immunoinformatics designed T cell multi epitope dengue peptide vaccine
   derived from non structural proteome
SO MICROBIAL PATHOGENESIS
AB Dengue viral disease has been reported as an Aedes aegypti mosquito-borne human disease and causing a severe global public health concern. In this study, immunoinformatics methods was deployed for crafting CTL T-cell epitopes as dengue vaccine candidates. The NS1 protein sequence of dengue serotype 1 strain retrieved from the protein database and T-cell epitopes (n = 85) were predicted by the artificial neural network. The conserved epitopes (n = 10) were predicted and selected for intensive computational analysis. The machine learning technique and quantitative matrix-based toxicity analysis assured nontoxic peptide selection. Hidden Markov Model derived Structural Alphabet (SA) based algorithm predicted the 3D molecular structure and all-atom structure of peptide ligand validated by Ramachandran-plot. Three-tier molecular docking approaches were used to predictthe peptide - HLA docking complex. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study confirmed the docking complex was stable in the time frame of 100ns. Population coverage analysis predicted the interaction epitope interaction with a particular population of HLA. These results concluded that the computationally designed HTLWSNGVL and FTTNIWLKL epitope peptides could be used as putative agents for the multi CTL T cell epitope vaccine. The vaccine protein sequence expression and translation were analyzed in the prokaryotic vector adapted by codon usage. Such in silica formulated CTL T-cell-based prophylactic vaccines could encourage the commercial development of dengue vaccines.

TI Artificial intelligence in the interpretation of breast cancer on MRI
SO JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
AB Advances in both imaging and computers have led to the rise in the potential use of artificial intelligence (AI) in various tasks in breast imaging, going beyond the current use in computer-aided detection to include diagnosis, prognosis, response to therapy, and risk assessment. The automated capabilities of AI offer the potential to enhance the diagnostic expertise of clinicians, including accurate demarcation of tumor volume, extraction of characteristic cancer phenotypes, translation of tumoral phenotype features to clinical genotype implications, and risk prediction. The combination of image-specific findings with the underlying genomic, pathologic, and clinical features is becoming of increasing value in breast cancer. The concurrent emergence of newer imaging techniques has provided radiologists with greater diagnostic tools and image datasets to analyze and interpret. Integrating an AI-based workflow within breast imaging enables the integration of multiple data streams into powerful multidisciplinary applications that may lead the path to personalized patient-specific medicine. In this article we describe the goals of AI in breast cancer imaging, in particular MRI, and review the literature as it relates to the current application, potential, and limitations in breast cancer.

AB Recently, neural machine translation (NMT) has made a remarkable achievement. However, performance of NMT is highly influenced by the size of training parallel text. The required amount of parallel text is not available for low-resource languages. The issue of low-resource NMT exacerbated if at least one of paired languages is morphologically rich. Inspired by the capabilities of pre-trained word embedding models, we propose simple yet effective word embedding based parallel text augmentation technique. The proposed technique is vital to enlarge size of limited parallel text for low-resource NMT. To this end, we adopt publicly available pre-trained word embedding models that favor morphologically rich languages. Accordingly, we replace each word in the original text with the n most similar words in the vector space (in this study n=3). For experimental analysis, we simulate low-resource languages by using publicly available parallel texts for German <-> English, Turkish <-> English and Finnish <-> English language pairs. We use the original parallel texts as a seed for generating synthetic parallel texts and for training character-level NMT that deemed as baseline models. The obtained results show that our augmentation techniques improve performance of baseline and dummy source sentence based NMT models by up to 5.9 cHRF scores.

AB Deep Learning-based Text Understanding (DLTU) is the backbone technique behind various applications, including question answering, machine translation, and text classification. Despite its tremendous popularity, the security vulnerabilities of DLTU are still largely unknown, which is highly concerning given its increasing use in security-sensitive applications such as sentiment analysis and toxic content detection. In this paper, we show that DLTU is inherently vulnerable to adversarial text attacks, in which maliciously crafted texts trigger target DLTU systems and services to misbehave. Specifically, we present TEXTBUGGER, a general attack framework for generating adversarial texts. In contrast to prior works, TEXTBUGGER differs in significant ways: (i) effective - it outperforms state-of-the-art attacks in terms of attack success rate; (ii) evasive - it preserves the utility of benign text, with 94.9% of the adversarial text correctly recognized by human readers; and (iii) efficient - it generates adversarial text with computational complexity sub-linear to the text length. We empirically evaluate TEXTBUGGER on a set of real-world DLTU systems and services used for sentiment analysis and toxic content detection, demonstrating its effectiveness, evasiveness, and efficiency. For instance, TEXTBUGGER achieves 100% success rate on the IMDB dataset based on Amazon AWS Comprehend within 4.61 seconds and preserves 97% semantic similarity. We further discuss possible defense mechanisms to mitigate such attack and the adversary's potential countermeasures, which leads to promising directions for further research.

TI Selective Surface Sintering Using a Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy
   System
SO JOURNAL OF SPECTROSCOPY
AB Titanium metal injection molding allows creation of complex metal parts that are lightweight and biocompatible with reduced cost in comparison with machining titanium. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) can be used to create plasma on the surface of a sample to analyze its elemental composition. Repetitive ablation on the same site has been shown to create differences from the original sample. This study investigates the potential of LIBS for selective surface sintering of injection-molded titanium metal. The temperature created throughout the LIBS process on the surface of the injection-molded titanium is high enough to fuse together the titanium particles. Using the ratio of the Ti II 282.81 nm and the C I 247.86 nm lines, the effectiveness of repetitive plasma formation to produce sintering can be monitored during the process. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy on the ablation craters confirms sintering through the reduction in carbon from 20.29 Wt.% to 2.13 Wt.%. Scanning electron microscope images confirm sintering. A conventional LIBS system, with a fixed distance, investigated laser parameters on injection-molded and injection-sintered titanium. To prove the feasibility of using this technique on a production line, a second LIBS system, with an autofocus and 3-axis translation stage, successfully sintered a sample with a nonplanar surface.

TI Stemming Hausa text: using affix-stripping rules and reference look-up
SO LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
AB Stemming is a process of reducing a derivational or inflectional word to its root or stem by stripping all its affixes. It is been used in applications such as information retrieval, machine translation, and text summarization, as their preprocessing step to increase efficiency. Currently, there are a few stemming algorithms which have been developed for languages such as English, Arabic, Turkish, Malay and Amharic. Unfortunately, no algorithm has been used to stem text in Hausa, a Chadic language spoken in West Africa. To address this need, we propose stemming Hausa text using affix-stripping rules and reference lookup. We stemmed Hausa text, using 78 affix stripping rules applied in 4 steps and a reference look-up consisting of 1500 Hausa root words. The over-stemming index, under-stemming index, stemmer weight, word stemmed factor, correctly stemmed words factor and average words conflation factor were calculated to determine the effect of reference look-up on the strength and accuracy of the stemmer. It was observed that reference look-up aided in reducing both over-stemming and under-stemming errors, increased accuracy and has a tendency to reduce the strength of an affix stripping stemmer. The rationality behind the approach used is discussed and directions for future research are identified.

AB The accuracy of actual motion of the spindle of a machine tool, a key performance index, is measured at a series of positions, and evaluated using a discrete kinematic geometry model. The kinematic geometry model, or more precisely a novel mechanism, is presented for the first time in this paper and validated using an apparatus consisting of a spindle, an artifact with double master ball and five displacement sensors as per ASME codes and standards [1]. The six kinematic parameters of the spindle with a single rotor - three translations and three rotations are obtained using the novel mechanism and the measurements. The theory of discrete kinematic geometry is employed to reveal the intrinsic properties of the trajectories traced by the characteristic lines of the rotor. In order to avoid the influences caused by the locations and directions of the measuring coordinate systems, the invariants of a discrete line trajectory, particularly the spherical image curve and the striction curve [2], are introduced to deal with the discrete measurements. The global invariants, the approximated moving axis and the approximated fixed axis of the rotor in the error motion, independent of the assembling position of the double master balls on the rotor, are proposed to evaluate the rotational accuracy of spindles. The discrete kinematic geometry provides a new perspective and a theoretical base for assessing the accuracy of the spindle motion.

TI A Survey of Arabic Named Entity Recognition and Classification
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB As more and more Arabic textual information becomes available through the Web in homes and businesses, via Internet and Intranet services, there is an urgent need for technologies and tools to process the relevant information. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an Information Extraction task that has become an integral part of many other Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as Machine Translation and Information Retrieval. Arabic NER has begun to receive attention in recent years. The characteristics and peculiarities of Arabic, a member of the Semitic languages family, make dealing with NER a challenge. The performance of an Arabic NER component affects the overall performance of the NLP system in a positive manner. This article attempts to describe and detail the recent increase in interest and progress made in Arabic NER research. The importance of the NER task is demonstrated, the main characteristics of the Arabic language are highlighted, and the aspects of standardization in annotating named entities are illustrated. Moreover, the different Arabic linguistic resources are presented and the approaches used in Arabic NER field are explained. The features of common tools used in Arabic NER are described, and standard evaluation metrics are illustrated. In addition, a review of the state of the art of Arabic NER research is discussed. Finally, we present our conclusions. Throughout the presentation, illustrative examples are used for clarification.

TI An elitist strategy genetic algorithm for integrated layout design
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB While designing the layout of any manufacturing organizations, the primary objective is to decide an optimal arrangement of their departments (machines or cells) in a two-dimensional shop floor (facility) satisfying desired objectives, which is termed facility layout problem (FLP). In traditional layout design philosophy, the inter-cell layout and flow path layout design of material handling system (MHS) was carried out step by step in a sequential manner. This results in sub-optimal solutions for FLP. In this paper, an integrated approach is adopted to design the inter-cell layout and the flow path layout of MHS simultaneously. The quality of the final layout is evaluated by minimizing the weighted sum of two distance-based cost objectives namely, (1) total material handling cost. (2) Distance-weighted cost of total closeness rating score. Sequence-pair (SP) representation is used for layout encoding. The translation from SP to layout is efficiently done by longest common subsequence methodology. Due to NP-hard nature of the proposed problem, an elitist strategy genetic algorithm (ESGA) is developed and tested with three test problem instances available in the literature. It is found that the proposed ESGA algorithm is able to produce the best solutions consistently, twice faster than the standard GA for the test problem instances.

AB There are several methods to assess the capability of a test suite to detect faults in a potentially wrong system. We explore two methods based on considering some probabilistic information. In the first one, we assume that we are provided with a probabilistic user model. This is a model denoting the probability that the entity interacting with the system takes each available choice. In the second one, we suppose that we have a probabilistic implementer model, that is. a model denoting the probability that the implementer makes each possible fault while constructing the system. We show that both testing scenarios are strongly related. In particular, we prove that any user can be translated into an implementer model in such a way that the optimality of tests is preserved, that is. a test suite is optimal for the user if and only if it is optimal for the resulting implementer. Another translation, working in the opposite direction, fulfills the reciprocal property. Thus, we conclude that any test selection criterium designed for one of these testing problems can be used for the other one, once the model has been properly translated. Besides, I he applicability of user models to other kinds of testing approaches is considered. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Design of memory Alias Table based on the SRAM 8T-Cell
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIRCUIT THEORY AND APPLICATIONS
AB A memory Alias Table holds a major role in Register Renaming Unit (RRU), which is responsible for maintaining the translation between logical registers to physical registers under the given instruction(s). This work presents the design of the memory Alias Table based on the SRAM-based 8T-Cell with multiport write, read, and content-address operations for two-way three operands machine cycle. The design of the memory Alias Table of size 32-row x 6-bit has SRAM-based CAM cell of type 21T-Cell that comprises four-read ports, two-write ports, and two-content-address ports. The content-address examines the register under-test against all contents of the memory Alias Table in parallel and releases the associated match index address. Results show that the four read ports operate simultaneously within the half-cycle, while the two write ports operate simultaneously within the other half-cycle. The operation of the two content-address ports is managed during the half-cycle of the read phase. Thus, the three operations occur within a single cycle without latency. HSPICE simulations using 90 nm/1 V CMOS process reveal that the memory Alias Table provides the three operations within a one-cycle of 1 GHz consuming an average power of 0.13 mW.

TI SubFeat: Feature subspacing ensemble classifier for function prediction
   of DNA, RNA and protein sequences
SO COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
AB The information of a cell is primarily contained in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). There is a flow of DNA information to protein sequences via ribonucleic acids (RNA) through transcription and translation. These entities are vital for the genetic process. Recent epigenetics developments also show the importance of the genetic material and knowledge of their attributes and functions. However, the growth in these entities' available features or functionalities is still slow due to the time-consuming and expensive in vitro experimental methods. In this paper, we have proposed an ensemble classification algorithm called SubFeat to predict biological entities' functionalities from different types of datasets. Our model uses a feature subspace-based novel ensemble method. It divides the feature space into sub-spaces, which are then passed to learn individual classifier models. The ensemble is built on these base classifiers that use a weighted majority voting mechanism. SubFeat tested on four datasets comprising two DNA, one RNA, and one protein dataset, and it outperformed all the existing single classifiers and the ensemble classifiers. SubFeat is made available as a Python-based tool. We have made the package SubFeat available online along with a user manual. It is freely accessible from here: https://github. com/fazlulhaquejony/SubFeat.

AB Syntactic complexity is an important feature of any text, both written and oral. The information about syntactic complexity is crucial for successful solution of many practical NLP tasks starting from intellectual understanding of texts and ending with automatic machine translation. Because of this, syntactic complexity and its measures are in the center of attention of NLP developers. Thus far, quite a series of different measures of syntactic complexity have been developed; in this paper, it is proposed to consider 10 syntactic measures that have been proposed for syntactic stylometric analysis. The pilot experiment described in this paper was made on automatic syntactic text annotation made by UDPipe syntactic parser, which was manually corrected. In our approach, particular attention is paid to the analysis of stability of certain measures of syntactic complexity and the analysis of their variation. Thus, we try to evaluate, which syntactic properties of Russian texts may be considered as inherent for the language as a whole, and which of them undergo some changes. To achieve this task, we analyze the corpus of Russian literary texts for three decades. Due to their high stylistic variability, texts of fiction may be considered as excellent data for assessing different levels of complexity. The obtained results show the effectiveness of different measures for estimating text syntactic complexity and revealing their correlation.

TI Exact Task Execution in Highly Under-Actuated Soft Limbs: An Operational
   Space Based Approach
SO IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS
AB Recently, the development of soft robots is imposing a change of prospective in several aspects of design and control, moving the robotic field closer to the natural world. Soft robots, like many animals, are often built of continuously deformable elements, and are consequently characterized by a highly under-actuated input space. In this letter we prove that given a generic nonlinear task to he accomplished by a soft robot-as e.g., the positioning of its end effector in space-a linear actuation space with the size of the task itself is already sufficient to achieve the goal. We then introduce the dynamically consistent projector into synergistic space, which can be used to convert controllers designed in operational space, to work in the under-actuated case. This enables a direct translation of control strategies from classic to soft robotics. Leveraging on this result, we present the first dynamic feedback controller for trunk-like soft robots taking in account nonconstant deformations of the soft body. We present simulations showing that using this controller it is passible to track a prescribed dynamic evolution of the robot's tip with zero error at steady state, both in planar and 3-D case with gravity.

TI Improving lexical coverage of text simplification systems for Spanish
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB The current bottleneck of all data-driven lexical simplification (LS) systems is scarcity and small size of parallel corpora (original sentences and their manually simplified versions) used for training. This is especially pronounced for languages other than English. We address this problem, taking Spanish as an example of such a language, by building new simplification-specific datasets of synonyms and paraphrases using freely available resources. We test their usefulness in the LS task by adding them, in various combinations, to the existing text simplification (TS) training dataset in a phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBSMT) approach. Our best systems significantly outperform the state-of-the-art LS systems for Spanish, by the number of transformations performed and the grammaticality, simplicity and meaning preservation of the output sentences. The results of a detailed manual analysis show that some of the newly built TS resources, although they have a good lexical coverage and lead to a high number of transformations, often change the original meaning and do not generate simpler output when used in this PBSMT setup. The good combinations of these additional resources with the TS training dataset and a good choice of language model, in contrast, improve the lexical coverage and produce sentences which are grammatical, simpler than the original, and preserve the original meaning well.

AB Since Bahdanau et al. [1] first introduced attention for neural machine translation, most sequence-to-sequence models made use of attention mechanisms [2, 3, 4]. While they produce soft-alignment matrices that could be interpreted as alignment between target and source languages, we lack metrics to quantify their quality, being unclear which approach produces the best alignments. This paper presents an empirical evaluation of 3 of the main sequence-to-sequence models for word discovery from unsegmented phoneme sequences: CNN, RNN and Transformer-based. This task consists in aligning word sequences in a source language with phoneme sequences in a target language, inferring from it word segmentation on the target side [5]. Evaluating word segmentation quality can be seen as an extrinsic evaluation of the soft-alignment matrices produced during training. Our experiments in a low-resource scenario on Mboshi and English languages (both aligned to French) show that RNNs surprisingly outperform CNNs and Transformer for this task. Our results are confirmed by an intrinsic evaluation of alignment quality through the use Average Normalized Entropy (ANE). Lastly, we improve our best word discovery model by using an alignment entropy confidence measure that accumulates ANE over all the occurrences of a given alignment pair in the collection.

AB This report summarizes the findings of an exploratory team of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Information Systems Technology panel into Content-Based Analytics (CBA). The team carried out a technical review into the current status of theoretical and practical developments of methods, tools and techniques supporting joint exploitation of multimedia data sources. In particular, content-based information retrieval and analytics was considered as a means to allow military experts to exploit multiple data sources in a rapid fashion for sensemaking and knowledge generation. Elements included contextual understanding of complex events through computational/human processing techniques, event prediction through the automated extraction of network features, temporal trends, hidden clusters and resource flows, and the use of machine processing for automated translation, parsing, information extraction, and summarization of unstructured and semistructured data. The main conclusions of the study are that important research gaps exist in all the technical areas covered in this report. Though the research areas and developments are being advanced in the military sector and the civil sector, in particular, they remain at low levels of technical maturity for defense and security system applications. It is recommended that NATO collaborative research effort be expanded to advance those approaches that are most pertinent to our overall aim of enhancing the contextual understanding of complex events through CBA of heterogeneous multimedia streams.

TI In silico characterization and prediction of global protein-mRNA
   interactions in yeast
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Post-transcriptional gene regulation is mediated through complex networks of protein-RNA interactions. The targets of only a few RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are known, even in the well-characterized budding yeast. In silico prediction of protein-RNA interactions is therefore useful to guide experiments and to provide insight into regulatory networks. Computational approaches have identified RBP targets based on sequence binding preferences. We investigate here to what extent RBP-RNA interactions can be predicted based on RBP and mRNA features other than sequence motifs. We analyze global relationships between gene and protein properties in general and between selected RBPs and known mRNA targets in particular. Highly translated RBPs tend to bind to shorter transcripts, and transcripts bound by the same RBP show high expression correlation across different biological conditions. Surprisingly, a given RBP preferentially binds to mRNAs that encode interaction partners for this RBP, suggesting coordinated post-transcriptional auto-regulation of protein complexes. We apply a machine-learning approach to predict specific RBP targets in yeast. Although this approach performs well for RBPs with known targets, predictions for uncharacterized RBPs remain challenging due to limiting experimental data. We also predict targets of fission yeast RBPs, indicating that the suggested framework could be applied to other species once more experimental data are available.

AB High-T-c superconducting levitation systems achieve, under no contact support, stable levitation without control. This feature can be applied to flywheels, magnetically levitated trains, and so on. But no contact support has small damping. So these mechanisms can show complicated phenomena of dynamics due to nonlinearity in their magnetic force. For application to large-scale machines, we need to analyze dynamics of a large levitated body supported at multiple points. This research deals with nonlinearly coupled oscillation of a homogeneous and symmetric rigid bar supported at its both ends by equal electromagnetic forces between superconductors and permanent magnets. In our past study, using a rigid bar, we found combination resonance. Combination resonance happens owing to the asymmetry of the system. But, even if support forces are symmetric, parametric resonance can happen. With a simple symmetric model, this research focuses on especially the parametric resonance, and evaluates nonlinear effect of the symmetric support forces by experiment and numerical analysis. Obtained results show that two modes, caused by coupling of horizontal translation and roll motion, can be excited nonlinearly when the superconductor is excited vertically in the neighborhood of twice the natural frequencies of those modes. We confirmed these resonances have nonlinear characteristics of soft-spring, hysteresis and so on. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI On self-propulsion of micro-machines at low Reynolds number: Purcell's
   three-link swimmer
SO JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS
AB Using slender-body hydrodynamics in the inertialess limit, we examine the motion of Purcell's swimmer, a planar, fore-aft-symmetric three-link flagellum or propulsive mechanism that translates by alternately moving its front and rear segments. Purcell (1976) concluded via symmetry arguments that the net displacement of such a swimmer must follow a straight line, but the direction and other details of the motion have never been investigated. Numerical results indicate that the direction of net translation and the speed of Purcell's swimmer depend on the angular amplitude of the swimming strokes as well as on the relative length of the links. Analytical results are presented for small rotations about the straightened configuration, and physical arguments are given to qualitatively explain the propulsive dynamics. The optimal swimmer configurations under the conditions of constant forcing and of minimum mechanical work are determined. We use a definition of efficiency based on the straightened configuration as a reference state to compare Purcell's swimmer with the previously treated swimming motions of an undulating rod and a rotating helix. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of the anisotropy in the local hydrodynamic slender-body drag to swimming motions at low Reynolds number by showing that, in general, any inextensible swimmer in an otherwise quiescent fluid cannot alter its average position under conditions of locally isotropic drag.

TI Rigidity and Flexibility in Rotaxanes and Their Relatives; On Being
   Stubborn and Easy-Going
SO FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY
AB Rotaxanes are an emerging class of molecules composed of two building blocks: macrocycles and threads. Rotaxanes, and their pseudorotaxane and polyrotaxane relatives, serve as prototypes for molecular-level switches and machines and as components in materials like elastic polymers and 3D printing inks. The rigidity and flexibility of these molecules is a characteristic feature of their design. However, the mechanical properties of the assembled rotaxane and its components are rarely examined directly, and the translation of these properties from molecules to bulk materials is understudied. In this Review, we consider the mechanical properties of rotaxanes by making use of concepts borrowed from physical organic chemistry. Rigid molecules have fewer accessible conformations with higher energy barriers while flexible molecules have more accessible conformations and lower energy barriers. The macrocycles and threads become rigidified when threaded together as rotaxanes in which the formation of intermolecular interactions and increased steric contacts collectively reduce the conformational space and raise barriers. Conversely, rotational and translational isomerism in rotaxanes adds novel modes of flexibility. We find that rigidification in rotaxanes is almost universal, but novel degrees of flexibility can be introduced. Both have roles to play in the function of rotaxanes.

TI A Novel Method for Person Re-Identification: Conditional Translated
   Network Based on GANs
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The main challenge of person re-identification (re-id) lies in the strikingly discrepancy between different camera views, including illumination, background and human pose. Existing person re-id methods rely mostly on implicit solutions, such as seeking robust features or designing discriminative distance metrics. Compared to these methods, human solutions are more straightforward. That is, imagine the appearance of the target person under different camera views before matching target person. The key idea is that human can intuitively implement viewpoint transfer, noting the association of the target person under different camera views but the machine failed. In this paper, we attempt to imitate such human behavior that transfer person image to certain camera views before matching. In practice, we propose a conditional transfer network (cTransNet) that conditionally implement viewpoint transfer, which transfers image to the viewpoint with the biggest domain gap through a variant of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). After that, we obtain hybrid person representation by fusing the feature of original image with the transferred image then perform similarity ranking according to cosine distance. Compared with former methods, we propose a human-like approach and obtains consistent improvement of the rank-1 precision over the baseline in Market-1501, DukeMTMC-ReID and MSMT17 dataset by 3%, 4%, 4%, respectively.

AB Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) is a flourishing line of research in the language resource community, so far mostly adopted for selected aspects of linguistics, natural language processing and the semantic web, as well as for practical applications in localization and lexicography. Yet, computational philology seems to be somewhat decoupled from the recent progress in this area: even though LOD as a concept is gaining significant popularity in Digital Humanities, existing LLOD standards and vocabularies are not widely used in this community, and philological resources are underrepresented in the LLOD cloud diagram (http://linguistic-lod.org/llod-cloud).
   In this paper, we present an application of Linguistic Linked Open Data in Assyriology. We describe the LLOD edition of a linguistically annotated corpus of Sumerian, as well as its linking with lexical resources, repositories of annotation terminology, and the museum collections in which the artifacts bearing these texts are kept. The chosen corpus is the Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Royal Inscriptions, a well curated and linguistically annotated archive of Sumerian text, in preparation for the creating and linking of other corpora of cuneiform texts, such as the corpus of Ur III administrative and legal Sumerian texts, as part of the Machine Translation and Automated Analysis of Cuneiform Languages project (https://cdli-gh.github.io/mtaac/).

Furthermore, supervised training of gait classifiers can require large subject-specific amputee data sets which are difficult to obtain. Mechanomyography (MMG) has shown less dependence on environmental conditions than EMG yet has seen limited use in this realm. In this investigation we introduce an MMG gait classifier targeting improved control of prosthetic (robotic) legs. We compare the accuracy of subject specific classifiers to those trained using subject-independent pooling. Additionally, we quantify the effect of introducing a small amount of data from individual test subjects to the training pool. Experiments were performed on 12 participants and 5 gait modes. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier achieved 65% accuracy with subject-specific data, 92% with pooled training data, and 94% with pooled plus limited user-specific data. The results show the promise of MMG gait classifiers with increased robustness and reduced subject-specific training in prosthetic control.

TI Interference of a speB 5 untranslated region partial deletion with mRNA
   degradation in Streptococcus pyogenes
SO MOLECULAR ORAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB The 5 untranslated region (5 UTR) of an mRNA molecule embeds important determinants that modify its stability and translation efficiency. In Streptococcus pyogenes, a strict human pathogen, a gene encoding a secreted protease (speB) has a large 5 UTR with unknown functions. Here we describe that a partial deletion of the speB 5 UTR caused a general accumulation of mRNA in the stationary phase, and that the mRNA accumulation was due to retarded mRNA degradation. The phenotype was observed in several M serotypes harboring the partial deletion of the speB 5 UTR. The phenotype was triggered by the production of the truncated speB 5 UTR, but not by the disruption of the intact speB 5 UTR. RNase Y, a major endoribonuclease, was previously shown to play a central role in bulk mRNA turnover in stationary phase. However, in contrast to our expectations, we observed a weaker interaction between the truncated speB 5 UTR and RNase Y compared with the wild-type, which suggests that other unidentified RNA degrading components are required for the pleiotropic effects observed from the speB UTR truncation. Our study demonstrates how S.pyogenes uses distinct mRNA degradation schemes in exponential and stationary growth phases.

TI High-speed roll-to-roll manufacturing of graphene using a concentric
   tube CVD reactor
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We present the design of a concentric tube (CT) reactor for roll-to-roll chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on flexible substrates, and its application to continuous production of graphene on copper foil. In the CTCVD reactor, the thin foil substrate is helically wrapped around the inner tube, and translates through the gap between the concentric tubes. We use a bench-scale prototype machine to synthesize graphene on copper substrates at translation speeds varying from 25 mm/min to 500 mm/min, and investigate the influence of process parameters on the uniformity and coverage of graphene on a continuously moving foil. At lower speeds, high-quality monolayer graphene is formed; at higher speeds, rapid nucleation of small graphene domains is observed, yet coalescence is prevented by the limited residence time in the CTCVD system. We show that a smooth isothermal transition between the reducing and carbon-containing atmospheres, enabled by injection of the carbon feedstock via radial holes in the inner tube, is essential to high-quality roll-to-roll graphene CVD. We discuss how the foil quality and microstructure limit the uniformity of graphene over macroscopic dimensions. We conclude by discussing means of scaling and reconfiguring the CTCVD design based on general requirements for 2-D materials manufacturing.

AB Given the increasingly available machine translation (MT) services nowadays, one efficient strategy for cross-lingual spoken language understanding (SLU) is to first translate the input utterance from the second language into the primary language, and then call the primary language SLU system to decode the semantic knowledge. However, errors introduced in the MT process create a condition similar to the "mismatch" condition encountered in robust speech recognition. Such mismatch makes the performance of cross-lingual SLU far from acceptable. Motivated by successful solutions developed in robust speech recognition, we in this paper propose a multi-style adaptive training method to improve the robustness of the SLU system for cross-lingual SLU tasks. For evaluation, we created an English-Chinese bilingual ATIS database, and then carried out a series of experiments on that database to experimentally assess the proposed methods. Experimental results show that, without relying on any data in the second language, the proposed method significantly improves the performance on a cross-lingual SLU task while producing no degradation for input in the primary language. This greatly facilitates porting SLU to as many languages as there are MT systems without any human effort. We further study the robustness of this approach to another type of mismatch condition, caused by speech recognition errors, and demonstrate its success also.

TI Temperature dependent expression of cdc2 and cyclin B1 in spermatogenic
   cells during spermatogenesis
SO CELL RESEARCH
AB p34(cdc2) and Cyclin B1 are key components of cell cycle controlling machine and are believed to play a fundamental role in gametogenesis. It is also well known that, in scrotal mammals, spermatogenesis depends greatly on the maintenance of comparatively low temperature in the scrotum. To investigate whether the expression of cdc2 and cyclin B1 in spermatogenic cells during spermatogenesis is actually a temperature dependent event, in situ hybridization, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry analysis were used to study the expression of cdc2 and cyclin B1 in normal and cryptorchid testis. Results showed that the abdominal temperature had no significant influence on the transcription of cdc2 and cyclin B1 in the spermatogonia and pachytene/diplotene primary spermatocytes, but it blocked the translation of them. Due to the deficiency of p34(cdc2) and Cyclin B1, the spermatogonia and pachytene/diplotene primary spermatocytes were unable to form MPF, hence, they couldn't undergo karyokinesis. The development of primary spermatocytes was arrested at the G2 to M phase transition. We also found that testosterone could regulate the Cyclin B1 expression in spermatogenic cells. Muscular injection of testosterone could recover spermatogenesis in the unilateral scrotal testis which was influenced by the contralateral cryptorchid testis, but it could not salvage the spermatogenesis block in the cryptorchid testis.

TI From Pluralistic Normative Principles to Autonomous-Agent Rules
SO MINDS AND MACHINES
AB With recent advancements in systems engineering and artificial intelligence, autonomous agents are increasingly being called upon to execute tasks that have normative relevance. These are tasks that directly-and potentially adversely-affect human well-being and demand of the agent a degree of normative-sensitivity and -compliance. Such norms and normative principles are typically of a social, legal, ethical, empathetic, or cultural ('SLEEC') nature. Whereas norms of this type are often framed in the abstract, or as high-level principles, addressing normative concerns in concrete applications of autonomous agents requires the refinement of normative principles into explicitly formulated practical rules. This paper develops a process for deriving specification rules from a set of high-level norms, thereby bridging the gap between normative principles and operational practice. This enables autonomous agents to select and execute the most normatively favourable action in the intended context premised on a range of underlying relevant normative principles. In the translation and reduction of normative principles to SLEEC rules, we present an iterative process that uncovers normative principles, addresses SLEEC concerns, identifies and resolves SLEEC conflicts, and generates both preliminary and complex normatively-relevant rules, thereby guiding the development of autonomous agents and better positioning them as normatively SLEEC-sensitive or SLEEC-compliant.

It also reports on ELRA's involvement in several national and international projects, as well as in the organization of events for the support of LRs and related Language Technologies, including for under-resourced languages. Over the past few years, ELRA, together with its operational agency ELDA, has continued to increase its catalogue offer of LRs, establishing worldwide partnerships for the production of various types of LRs (SMS, tweets, crawled data, MT aligned data, speech LRs, sentiment-based data, etc.). Through their consistent involvement in EU-funded projects, ELRA and ELDA have contributed to improve the access to multilingual information in the context of the pandemic, develop tools for the de-identification of texts in the legal and medical domains, support the EU eTranslation Machine Translation system, and set up a European platform providing access to both resources and services. In December 2019, ELRA co-organized the LT4All conference, whose main topics were Language Technologies for enabling linguistic diversity and multilingualism worldwide. Moreover, although LREC was cancelled in 2020, ELRA published the LREC 2020 proceedings for the Main conference and Workshops papers, and carried on its dissemination activities while targeting the new LREC edition for 2022.

AB Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are machine learning networks based around creating synthetic data. Voice Conversion (VC) is a subset of voice translation that involves translating the paralinguistic features of a source speaker to a target speaker while preserving the linguistic information. The aim of non-parallel conditional GANs for VC is to translate an acoustic speech feature sequence from one domain to another without the use of paired data. In the study reported here, we investigated the interpretability of state-of-the-art implementations of non-parallel GANs in the domain of VC. We show that the learned representations in the repeating layers of a particular GAN architecture remain close to their original random initialised parameters, demonstrating that it is the number of repeating layers that is more responsible for the quality of the output. We also analysed the learned representations of a model trained on one particular dataset when used during transfer learning on another dataset. This also showed high levels of similarity in the repeating layers. Together, these results provide new insight into how the learned representations of deep generative networks change during learning and the importance of the number of layers, which would help build better GAN-based speech conversion models.(3)

TI Parallelization of the inverse fast multipole method with an application
   to boundary element method
SO COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB We present an algorithm to parallelize the inverse fast multipole method (IFMM), which is an approximate direct solver for dense linear systems. The parallel scheme is based on a greedy coloring algorithm, where two nodes in the hierarchy with the same color are separated by at least a nodes. We proved that when sigma >= 6, the workload associated with one color is embarrassingly parallel. However, the number of nodes in a group (color) may be small when sigma = 6. Therefore, we also explored sigma = 3, where a small fraction of the algorithm needs to be serialized, and the overall parallel efficiency was improved. We implemented the parallel IFMM using OpenMP for shared-memory machines. Successively, we applied it to a fast-multipole accelerated boundary element method (FMBEM) as a preconditioner, and compared its efficiency with (a) the original IFMM parallelized by linking a multithreaded linear algebra library and (b) the commonly used parallel block-diagonal preconditioner. Our results showed that our parallel 1FMM achieved at most 4x and 11 x speedups over the reference method (a) and (b), respectively, in realistic examples involving more than one million variables.

AB These improvements open many possibilities in solving Natural Language Processing downstream tasks. Such tasks include machine translation, speech recognition, information retrieval, sentiment analysis, summarization, question answering, multilingual dialogue systems development, and many more. Language models are one of the most important components in solving each of the mentioned tasks. This paper is devoted to research and analysis of the most adopted techniques and designs for building and training language models that show a state of the art results. Techniques and components applied in the creation of language models and its parts are observed in this paper, paying attention to neural networks, embedding mechanisms, bidirectionality, encoder and decoder architecture, attention, and self-attention, as well as parallelization through using transformer. As a result, the most promising techniques imply pre-training and fine-tuning of a language model, attention-based neural network as a part of model design, and a complex ensemble of multidimensional embedding to build deep context understanding. The latest offered architectures based on these approaches require a lot of computational power for training language models, and it is a direction of further improvement.

AB News recommender systems are aimed to personalize users experiences and help them discover relevant articles from a large and dynamic search space. Therefore, news domain is a challenging scenario for recommendations, due to its sparse user profiling, fast growing number of items, accelerated item's value decay, and users preferences dynamic shift.
   Deep Learning (DL) have achieved a great success in complex domains, such as computer vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine translation, speech recognition, and reinforcement learning. Therefore, it became a mainstream approach in Recommender Systems research only since 2016.
   The main objective of this research is the investigation, design, implementation and evaluation of a Meta-Architecture for personalized news recommendations using deep neural networks.
   As information about users' past interactions is scarce in such cold-start scenario, user context and session information are explicitly modeled, as well as past user sessions, when available. Users' past behaviors and item features are both considered in an hybrid session-aware recommendation approach. The recommendation task addressed in this work is next-item prediction for user sessions: "what is the next most likely article a user might read in a session?"
   This paper presents the research methodology for this Doctoral research, the proposed Meta-Architecture and some preliminary results, as well as the next research challenges.

TI Java-to-JavaScript Translation via Structured Control Flow
   Reconstruction of Compiler IR
SO ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES
AB We present an approach to cross-compile Java bytecodes to JavaScript, building on existing Java optimizing compiler technology. Static analysis determines which Java classes and methods are reachable. These are then translated to JavaScript using a re-configured Java just-in-time compiler with a new back end that generates JavaScript instead of machine code. Standard compiler optimizations such as method inlining and global value numbering, as well as advanced optimizations such as escape analysis, lead to compact and optimized JavaScript code. Compiler IR is unstructured, so structured control flow needs to be reconstructed before code generation is possible. We present details of our control flow reconstruction algorithm.
   Our system is based on Graal, an open-source optimizing compiler for the Java HotSpot VM and other VMs. The modular and VM-independent architecture of Graal allows us to reuse the intermediate representation, the bytecode parser, and the high-level optimizations. Our custom back end first performs control flow reconstruction and then JavaScript code generation. The generated JavaScript undergoes a set of optimizations to increase readability and performance. Static analysis is performed on the Graal intermediate representation as well. Benchmark results for medium-sized Java benchmarks such as SPECjbb2005 run with acceptable performance on the V8 JavaScript VM.

AB Using social mobile application for communication is common in this generation and development is driving innovation. Social mobile applications take many social forms depending on a particular application. In addition to Facebook, WhatsApp, WeChat is one of the most popular social mobile applications nowadays especially in China and Hong Kong. WeChat is a mobile text and voice messaging communication service developed by Tencent in China, which was released in 2011. It can exchange contacts with people nearby via Bluetooth, as well as providing various features for contacting people at random if desired, next to integration with social networking services such as those run by Facebook. Photographs may also be embellished with filters and captions, and a machine translation service is available. It is now very common in both China and Hong Kong. This study is to investigate the differences in academic performance and learning interest between students who used WeChat and who did not and we focused on accounting students as samples in this study. Academic performance was examined by their scores in continuous assessments, while accounting students' learning interest was indicated by questionnaires. The aim of this research is to evaluate the impact of social mobile application on students' learning interest so as to their performance.

AB We cannot evoke the discovery of lightning without telling briefly that of electricity. Started in the seventeenth century with the design of the first electrostatic machines, the characterisation of the "electric fluid" is given a boost in the first half of the eighteenth century with an alternation of competition and collaboration between European and American scientists. The demonstration of the analogy between lightning and electricity reaches its maturity with the personal involvement of Benjamin Franklin in 1746 and the epistolary publication of his innovating ideas through his friend Peter Collinson.
   A first wave of experiments on lightning is triggered by the translation into French of the ideas of Franklin (Dalibard, Delor, Buffon and Jacques de Romas). The famous kite experiment is invented by Franklin and Romas independently. Romas produces very long sparks in front of enthusiastic crowds (first success in 1753). Franklin and Romas will argue about the priority of invention which prefigures the modern conception of the lightning rod. The "Universal History" retained only the name of Franklin, what is justified as regards to his great talent but rather inequitable for the memory of Romas which led with obstinacy research works on the nature and effects of lightning.

TI Initial stability of press-fit acetabular cups. In vitro lever-out

SO BIOMEDIZINISCHE TECHNIK
AB The initial stability of 6 different hemispherical press-fit titanium acetabular cups was investigated by lever-out tests using a foam model.
   Each cup was implanted in a standardised manner into machined PVC-foam blocks with an underreaming of 1/2/3 mm, and levered out 5 times. A computer recorded the load-displacement curves.
   Both insertion forces and lever-out forces increased with increasing press-fit from 1 to 2 mm. With underreaming of 2 mm, insertion forces varied between 9 and 34 Nm, and lever-out torques between 13 and 23 Nm. The cup made up of multi-layer irregular titanium wire mesh had the highest initial stability of all the cups tested. 3 mm underreaming was associated with insertion difficulties, so that lever-out is difficult to compare with that with 1 and 2 mm.
   The amount of contact on the equatorial rim, where we saw the most attrition after lever-out, is the most important factor for determining the lever-out torque.
   The quality of the PVC foam blocks, the accuracy of reaming, and the definition of cup insertion are very important parameters for test reproduction.
   Since the trials were conducted under laboratory conditions, translation of the results to the intraoperative situation should be undertaken only with certain reservations.

TI Structural basis for the inability of chloramphenicol to inhibit peptide
   bond formation in the presence of A-site glycine
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Ribosome serves as a universal molecular machine capable of synthesis of all the proteins in a cell. Small-molecule inhibitors, such as ribosome-targeting antibiotics, can compromise the catalytic versatility of the ribosome in a context-dependent fashion, preventing transpeptidation only between particular combinations of substrates. Classic peptidyl transferase center inhibitor chloramphenicol (CHL) fails to inhibit transpeptidation reaction when the incoming A site acceptor substrate is glycine, and the molecular basis for this phenomenon is unknown. Here, we present a set of high-resolution X-ray crystal structures that explain why CHL is unable to inhibit peptide bond formation between the incoming glycyl-tRNA and a nascent peptide that otherwise is conducive to the drug action. Our structures reveal that fully accommodated glycine residue can co-exist in the A site with the ribosome-bound CHL. Moreover, binding of CHL to a ribosome complex carrying glycyl-tRNA does not affect the positions of the reacting substrates, leaving the peptide bond formation reaction unperturbed. These data exemplify how small-molecule inhibitors can reshape the A-site amino acid binding pocket rendering it permissive only for specific amino acid residues and rejective for the other substrates extending our detailed understanding of the modes of action of ribosomal antibiotics.

TI Radiological tumour classification across imaging modality and histology
SO NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Radiomics refers to the high-throughput extraction of quantitative features from radiological scans and is widely used to search for imaging biomarkers for the prediction of clinical outcomes. Current radiomic signatures suffer from limited reproducibility and generalizability, because most features are dependent on imaging modality and tumour histology, making them sensitive to variations in scan protocol. Here, we propose novel radiological features that are specially designed to ensure compatibility across diverse tissues and imaging contrast. These features provide systematic characterization of tumour morphology and spatial heterogeneity. In an international multi-institution study of 1,682 patients, we discover and validate four unifying imaging subtypes across three malignancies and two major imaging modalities. These tumour subtypes demonstrate distinct molecular characteristics and prognoses after conventional therapies. In advanced lung cancer treated with immunotherapy, one subtype is associated with improved survival and increased tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes compared with the others. Deep learning enables automatic tumour segmentation and reproducible subtype identification, which can facilitate practical implementation. The unifying radiological tumour classification may inform prognosis and treatment response for precision medicine.
   Radiomics has been used to discover imaging signatures that predict therapy response and outcomes, but clinical translation has been slow. Using machine learning methods, the authors report tumour subtypes that are applicable across major imaging modalities and three cancer types. The tumour subtypes have distinct radiological and molecular features, as well as survival outcomes after conventional therapies.

TI A modular testbed for mechanized spreading of powder layers for additive
   manufacturing
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB Powder bed additive manufacturing (AM) processes, including binder jetting (BJAM) and powder bed fusion (PBF), can manufacture complex three-dimensional components from a variety of materials. A fundamental understanding of the spreading of thin powder layers is essential to develop robust process parameters for powder bed AM and to assess the influence of powder feedstock characteristics on the subsequent process outcomes. Toward meeting these needs, this work presents the design, fabrication, and qualification of a testbed for modular, mechanized, multi-layer powder spreading. The testbed is designed to replicate the operating conditions of commercial AM equipment, yet features full control over motion parameters including the translation and rotation of a roller spreading tool and precision motion of a feed piston and the build platform. The powder spreading mechanism is interchangeable and therefore can be customized, including the capability for dispensing of fine, cohesive powders using a vibrating hopper. Validation of the resolution and accuracy of the machine and its subsystems, as well as the spreading of exemplary layers from a range of powder sizes typical of BJAM and PBF processes, are described. The precision engineered testbed can therefore enable the optimization of powder spreading parameters for AM and correlation to build process parameters in future work, as well as exploration of spreading of specialized powders for AM and other techniques.

AB We propose a novel domain-specific generative pre-training (DS-GPT) method for text generation and apply it to the product title and review summarization problems on E-commerce mobile display. First, we adopt a decoder-only transformer architecture, which fits well for fine-tuning tasks by combining input and output all together. Second, we demonstrate utilizing only small amount of pre-training data in related domains is powerful. Pre-training a language model from a general corpus such as Wikipedia or the Common Crawl requires tremendous time and resource commitment, and can be wasteful if the downstream tasks are limited in variety. Our DSGPT is pre-trained on a limited dataset, the Chinese short text summarization dataset (LCSTS). Third, our model does not require product-related human-labeled data. For title summarization task, the state of art explicitly uses additional background knowledge in training and predicting stages. In contrast, our model implicitly captures this knowledge and achieves significant improvement over other methods, after fine-tuning on the public Taobao.com dataset. For review summarization task, we utilize JD.com in-house dataset, and observe similar improvement over standard machine translation methods which lack the flexibility of fine-tuning. Our proposed work can be simply extended to other domains for a wide range of text generation tasks.

TI Orthotopic Kidney Auto-Transplantation in a Porcine Model Using 24 Hours
   Organ Preservation And Continuous Telemetry
SO JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS
AB In the present era of organ transplantation with critical organ shortage, various strategies are employed to expand the pool of available allografts for kidney transplantation (KT). Even though, the use of allografts from extended criteria donors (ECD) could partially ease the shortage of organ donors, ECD organs carry a potentially higher risk for inferior outcomes and postoperative complications. Dynamic organ preservation techniques, modulation of ischemia-reperfusion and preservation injury, and allograft therapies are in the spotlight of scientific interest in an effort to improve allograft utilization and patient outcomes in KT.
   Preclinical animal experiments are playing an essential role in translational research, especially in the medical device and drug development. The major advantage of the porcine orthotopic auto-transplantation model over ex vivo or small animal studies lies within the surgical-anatomical and physiological similarities to the clinical setting. This allows the investigation of new therapeutic methods and techniques and ensures a facilitated clinical translation of the findings. This protocol provides a comprehensive and problem-oriented description of the porcine orthotopic kidney auto-transplantation model, using a preservation time of 24 hours and telemetry monitoring. The combination of sophisticated surgical techniques with highly standardized and state-of-the-art methods of anesthesia, animal housing, perioperative follow up, and monitoring ensure the reproducibility and success of this model.

TI Toward any-language zero-shot topic classification of textual documents
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB In this paper, we present a zero-shot classification approach to document classification in any language into topics which can be described by English keywords. This is done by embedding both labels and documents into a shared semantic space that allows one to compute meaningful semantic similarity between a document and a potential label. The embedding space can be created by either mapping into a Wikipedia-based semantic representation or learning cross-lingual embeddings. But if the Wikipedia in the target language is small or there is not enough training corpus to train a good embedding space for low-resource languages, then performance can suffer. Thus, for low-resource languages, we further use a word-level dictionary to convert documents into a high-resource language, and then perform classification based on the high-resource language. This approach can be applied to thousands of languages, which can be contrasted with machine translation, which is a supervision-heavy approach feasible for about 100 languages. We also develop a ranking algorithm that makes use of language similarity metrics to automatically select a good pivot or bridging high-resource language, and show that this significantly improves classification of low-resource language documents, performing comparably to the best bridge possible.

AB Deep neural networks have become the compelling solution for the applications such as image classification, object detection, speech recognition, and machine translation. However, the great success comes at the cost of excessive computation due to the over-provisioned parameter space. To improve the computation efficiency of neural networks, many pruning techniques have been proposed to reduce the amount of multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations, which results in high sparsity in the networks.
   Unfortunately, the sparse neural networks often run slower than their dense counterparts on modern GPUs due to their poor device utilization rate. In particular, as the sophisticated hardware primitives (e.g., Tensor Core) have been deployed to boost the performance of dense matrix multiplication by an order of magnitude, the performance of sparse neural networks lags behind significantly.
   In this work, we propose an algorithm and hardware co-design methodology to accelerate the sparse neural networks. A novel pruning algorithm is devised to improve the workload balance and reduce the decoding overhead of the sparse neural networks. Meanwhile, new instructions and micro-architecture optimization are proposed in Tensor Core to adapt to the structurally sparse neural networks. Our experimental results show that the pruning algorithm can achieve 63% performance gain with model accuracy sustained. Furthermore, the hardware optimization gives an additional 58% performance gain with negligible area overhead.

AB The development of tools and techniques for automatic processing of natural language texts at different levels for various applications including machine translation needs to be addressed with at most priority. Sandhi splitter is one such automated tool which acts as a preprocessing tool for morphological analyzer that identifies the morpheme boundaries in a compound word based on the Sandhi rules defined in reverse direction. Due to highly agglutinative and morphologically rich nature of Kannada - one of the Dravidian languages of South India, complex compound words are formed by combining more than one morpheme / word based on the Sandhi rules. In this paper, as a preliminary work we have presented a rule based Kannada Agama Sandhi splitter, which identifies two flavors of Agama Sandhi namely, Yakaragama and Vakaragama and splits the compound word according to the rules of these two Agama Sandhis. Syllables are extracted from the word to identify the split point of the word. Our model uses a dictionary of root words and suffixes to check the validity of split words and rules to identify the split point. The problems of romanization and transliteration are overcome by using Unicode with UTF-8 representation for Kannada. Our model is tested on a large list of words extracted from Prajavani - a popular Kannada daily newspaper and other online resources, and the results are illustrated.

TI Factors affecting friction in the pre-adjusted appliance
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ORTHODONTICS
AB A jig was constructed to measure the frictional forces created by various tip and torque values in association with two types of straightwire bracket moving along stainless steel (SS) archwires. Forces were measured during translation of the bracket using an Instron machine. Steel and cobalt chromium brackets were tested in association with 0.019 x 0.025 and 0.021 x 0.025 inch steel archwires at tips from 0 to 3 degrees and torque values in 2 degree increments from 0 to 6 degrees.
   The mean values for static (2.2 N) and kinetic (2.1 N) friction were very similar (P = 0.71), as were the overall friction values for stainless steel (2.1 N) and chromium cobalt (2.2 N) brackets of similar dimensions (P = 0.44). Use of 0.021 x 0.025 inch wire produced three times as much friction as 0.019 x 0.025 inch wire, 3.0 N against 1.2 N (P < 0.01). Increased tip and torque were associated with highly significant increases in friction (P < 0.01). Every degree of tip produced approximately twice as much friction as comparable torque. The main conclusion of the study was that space closure should be completed on a 0.019 x 0.025 inch archwire before a 0.021 x 0.025 inch wire is used to complete tooth alignment.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The power quality and efficiency of the hydro-power station depend on the stable operation of the hydro-generator unit, which needs to continue to operate and it is prone to axis failure. Therefore, to adopt effective axis adjustment technology to eliminate faults. This paper proposes a new method for axis adjustment of hydro-generator unit based on an improved grey prediction model and swarms intelligence optimization neural network. First of all, it proposes a sequence acceleration translation and mean value transformation method, which is used to pre-process the axis net total swing sequence that exhibits oscillating fluctuations. It uses e(1) and e(2) factor transformation to establish an improved axis net total swing gray prediction model. Then, the advanced flamingo search algorithm is used to search the maximum value of the sine function of the net total pendulum of the axis, and the axis adjustment orientation is obtained. This method solves the problem that GM(1, 1) can only be predicted by monotone sequence in the past and the problem that the search algorithm is easy to fall into local optimum, effectively improves the calculation efficiency of axis and shorts the search time. Simulation examples show that the proposed method can significantly improve accuracy of axis adjustment. This method greatly improves the efficiency of azimuth search for axis adjustment.

AB In a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, channel state information (CSI) is essential for the base station (BS) to achieve high performance gain. The user equipment (UE) needs to estimate CSI and then feeds it back to the BS in the frequency division duplexing (FDD) mode. Effective compression of CSI will significantly reduce the cost of channel feedback, and many deep learning (DL) based channel compression schemes have been proposed to achieve this goal. In this paper, rather than viewing CSI as images as in most existing works, we propose a new perspective of viewing CSI as an information sequence and analogize CSI feedback to a machine translation task. Further, we propose a novel sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) model for CSI feedback composed of only recurrent neural networks and a small-scale fully connected layer, avoiding the convolution and pooling structure commonly used in current DL-based works. The advantage of this scheme is that it fully integrates the physical characteristics of the MIMO channel in the spatial domain into the structure of the neural network and avoids the loss of some prominent unsmooth or discontinuous features caused by the inappropriate convolution and pooling operation. Simulation results show that the proposed Seq2Seq model outperforms other DL-based CSI compression techniques under various communication scenarios.

AB The work concerning with natural language processing covers a wide range of topics, including machine translation, sentiment analysis, and automatic text generation. Among them, automatic text generation is very important for specific projects such as automatic summarization and automatic question and answer. In addition, different from the general automatic text generation work, poems have certain requirements in semantic expression and syllable coordination. Completing this work can further improve the semantic expression ability of automatic text generation projects and render the generated text an aesthetic feeling. This article wants to explore the effect of various recurrent neural network structures, such as basic recurrent network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent units (GRU), in handling this work. Within the model, a word embedding layer, a recurrent neural network layer and a fully connected layer are used. Comparing the loss value decline curve and the generated verses under the same data set, loss function and parameter update method finally came to the conclusion: in the training process, the models with LSTM and GRU as the core module can effectively reduce the loss value and generate verses with rhyme satisfying the poetry requirement, and the semantics is basically reasonable; as for the model with RNN as the core module, the loss value fluctuates, and the generated verses elementarily meet the standard of rhyme and semantics.

AB Natural language generation (NLG) is an important task with various applications like neural machine translation (NMT) and image captioning. Since deep-learning-based methods have issues of exposure bias and loss inconsistency, reinforcement learning (RL) is widely adopted in NLG tasks recently. But most RL-based methods ignore the deviation ignorance issue, which means the model fails to understand the extent of token-level deviation well. It leads to semantic incorrectness and hampers the agent to perform well. To address the issue, we propose a technique called adaptive prior-dependent correction (APDC) to enhance RL. It leverages the distribution generated by computing the distances between the ground truth and all other words to correct the agent's stochastic policy. Additionally, some techniques on RL are explored to coordinate RL with APDC, which requires a reward estimation at every time step. We find that the RL-based NLG tasks are a special case in RL, where the state transition is deterministic and the afterstate value equals the Q-value at every time step. To utilize such prior knowledge, we estimate the advantage function with the difference of the Q-values which can be estimated by Monte Carlo rollouts. Experiments show that, on three tasks of NLG (NMT, image captioning, abstractive text summarization), our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art RL-based approaches on different frequently-used metrics.

TI Fast Spherical Near-Field to Far-Field Transformation for Offset-Mounted
   Antenna Measurements
SO IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS
AB In spherical near-field measurements, the number of measured samples grows with the radius of the minimum sphere enclosing the antenna under test (AUT). This leads to unnecessary long acquisition times for antennas mounted in offset positions with respect to the measurement sphere. In this letter, a general technique is proposed to reduce the sampling rate requirements of offset mounted antennas. The approach is based on centering the spherical wave expansion (SWE) over the AUT by a shift in the coordinate system to compensate for the offset. The purpose of this shift is to reduce the number of significant spherical waves required to represent the AUT field. In the subsequent steps of the algorithm, the coordinate system is brought to its original location to preserve the efficiency and probe-correction capabilities of the traditional spherical near-field to far-field transformation technique. This is performed by a proper translation of the SWE coefficients between both coordinate systems. Higher order probe correction is also supported intrinsically. The proposed algorithm is numerically tested to assess its performance. Electromagnetic simulation and anechoic chamber tests are used to validate it, showing reductions in measurement times with low transformation errors.

AB The research presented in this paper concerns zero copulas in Hungarian, i.e. the phenomenon that nominal predicates lack an explicit verbal copula in the default present tense 3rd person indicative case. We created a tool based on the state-of-the-art transformer architecture implemented in Marian NMT framework that can identify and mark the location of zero copulas, i.e. the position where an overt copula would appear in the non-default cases. Our primary aim was to support quantitative corpus-based linguistic research by creating a tool that can be used to compile a corpus of significant size containing examples of nominal predicates including the location of the zero copulas. We created the training corpus for our system transforming sentences containing overt copulas into ones containing zero copula labels. However, we first needed to disambiguate occurrences of the massively ambiguous verb van 'exist/be/have'. We performed this using a rule-base classifier relying on English translations in the English-Hungarian parallel subcorpus of the OpenSubtitles corpus. We created several NMT-based models using different sampling methods and optionally using our baseline model to synthesize additional training data. Our best model obtains almost 90% precision and 80% recall on an in-domain test set.

AB Source code summarization aims to automatically generate concise summaries of source code in natural language texts, in order to help developers better understand and maintain source code. Traditional work generates a source code summary by utilizing information retrieval techniques, which select terms from original source code or adapt summaries of similar code snippets. Recent studies adopt Neural Machine Translation techniques and generate summaries from code snippets using encoder-decoder neural networks. The neural-based approaches prefer the high-frequency words in the corpus and have trouble with the low-frequency ones. In this paper, we propose a retrieval-based neural source code summarization approach where we enhance the neural model with the most similar code snippets retrieved from the training set. Our approach can take advantages of both neural and retrieval-based techniques. Specifically, we first train an attentional encoder-decoder model based on the code snippets and the summaries in the training set; Second, given one input code snippet for testing, we retrieve its two most similar code snippets in the training set from the aspects of syntax and semantics, respectively; Third, we encode the input and two retrieved code snippets, and predict the summary by fusing them during decoding. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our approach and the experimental results show that our proposed approach can improve the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Lojban, a constructed interlingua, has a small number of predicates-totaling 1342. In our prior independent work, involving lojban for machine translation in parallel, when converting English into lojbanic English (our extensions), the number of test cases was too small, because of the lack of a rich lojban vocabulary. There is a procedure for creating new, composite, lojban predicates in terms of existing predicates. Although workable, it lacks an architectural framework that is consistent with English word-sense usage, and enables efficient production of thousands of new predicates.
   To address lojban's insufficient vocabulary, we developed an interactive algorithm which will recast WordNet synonym sets' (synset) definitions into existing lojban primitive predicates. The output is in terms of our lojbanic English. The final output is a new dictionary of synset definitions, with lojban semantics, but using lojbanic English. The linguistic engineer, interactively, lojbanizes a synset's definition. Thus, the synsets are well defined, unambiguous, and there are no circular definitions-no confusion-because lojban primitives have these properties.
   If a relevant subset, e.g., 1/10, of the unique synset definitions-totaling 116718, are converted into lojban predicates, then 1.945 man years would be required for this effort. This algorithm can be run in parallel on distinct subsets, employing many users.

AB This paper presents a video based system for recognizing different continuous human activities in real time using a single stationary camera. The proposed system has a motion descriptor that contains shape moments as well as normalized Fourier descriptors. The main idea of this system is to detect moving objects in each frame and associate the detections to the same object over time. We employ an efficient thresholding technique to segment the objects of interest. The second stage of the proposed system is to extract the object features. The first feature part is constructed by extracting the object contour and estimate its normalized Fourier descriptors. The other part is extracted by the shape moments. We combined the shape moments to produce an invariant feature that is invariant to rotation, translation and scaling. We adopt the multi-class support vector machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes classifiers. The multi-class SVM shows better performance than the other method with a recognition rate up to 94.46%. We evaluated activity recognition on 325 videos of thirteen distinct Human activities (e.g., Walking, Running, Jumping, Hand-waving, Bending and some suspicious activities like Kicking, Punching, Fall floor and shooting gun, etc.) recorded for 260 different persons. Experimental results on three data set Weizman, KTH and HMDB validate the proposed system reliability and efficiency.

TI Constructing and utilizing wordnets using statistical methods
SO LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
AB Lexical databases following the wordnet paradigm capture information about words, word senses, and their relationships. A large number of existing tools and datasets are based on the original WordNet, so extending the landscape of resources aligned with WordNet leads to great potential for interoperability and to substantial synergies. Wordnets are being compiled for a considerable number of languages, however most have yet to reach a comparable level of coverage. We propose a method for automatically producing such resources for new languages based on WordNet, and analyse the implications of this approach both from a linguistic perspective as well as by considering natural language processing tasks. Our approach takes advantage of the original WordNet in conjunction with translation dictionaries. A small set of training associations is used to learn a statistical model for predicting associations between terms and senses. The associations are represented using a variety of scores that take into account structural properties as well as semantic relatedness and corpus frequency information. Although the resulting wordnets are imperfect in terms of their quality and coverage of language-specific phenomena, we show that they constitute a cheap and suitable alternative for many applications, both for monolingual tasks as well as for cross-lingual interoperability. Apart from analysing the resources directly, we conducted tests on semantic relatedness assessment and cross-lingual text classification with very promising results.

TI Adaptive control of synaptic plasticity integrates micro- and
   macroscopic network function
SO NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Synaptic plasticity configures interactions between neurons and is therefore likely to be a primary driver of behavioral learning and development. How this microscopic-macroscopic interaction occurs is poorly understood, as researchers frequently examine models within particular ranges of abstraction and scale. Computational neuroscience and machine learning models offer theoretically powerful analyses of plasticity in neural networks, but results are often siloed and only coarsely linked to biology. In this review, we examine connections between these areas, asking how network computations change as a function of diverse features of plasticity and vice versa. We review how plasticity can be controlled at synapses by calcium dynamics and neuromodulatory signals, the manifestation of these changes in networks, and their impacts in specialized circuits. We conclude that metaplasticity-defined broadly as the adaptive control of plasticity-forges connections across scales by governing what groups of synapses can and can't learn about, when, and to what ends. The metaplasticity we discuss acts by co-opting Hebbian mechanisms, shifting network properties, and routing activity within and across brain systems. Asking how these operations can go awry should also be useful for understanding pathology, which we address in the context of autism, schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease.

TI Natural language modeling with syntactic structure dependency
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB In natural language, the relationship among the constituents of a sentence is usually tree-like: words, phrases, and clauses constitute a sentence hierarchically, and the dependency between different constituents induces the syntactic structure. Such a complex tree-like structure is vital for understanding natural languages. However, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) model languages sequentially and fail to encode a hierarchical syntactic dependency comprehensively, therefore causing the networks to underperform on comprehension-based tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel neural language model, called relative syntactic distance LSTM (RSD-LSTM), to capture the syntactic structure dependency dynamically. RSD-LSTM employs a convolutional neural network to compute the relative syntactic distance between sentences to represent the degree of dependency between words and modifies the gating mechanism of LSTM through the relative syntactic distance. Furthermore, we add a direct connection between hidden states to fuse high-level and low-level syntactic features. We conducted extensive experiments on language modeling. The results suggest that RSD-LSTM achieves improvements of 1.82 and 2.03 in perplexity compared with current top methods on the Penn Treebank and WikiText-2 datasets, respectively. Moreover, we conducted experiments on a machine translation application task. Experimental results of this task also show significant improvements of RSD-LSTM compared with baseline models.

TI Composition Proposal Generation for Manga Creation Support
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB In recent years, cognition and use of manga pervade, and people who use manga for various purposes such as entertainment, study, marketing are increasing more and more. However, when people who do not specialize in it create it for these purposes, they can write plots expressing what they want to convey but the technique of the composition which arranges elements in manga such as characters or balloons corresponding to the plot create obstacles to using its merits for comprehensibility based on high flexibility of its expression. Therefore, we consider that support of this composition technique is necessary for amateurs to use manga while taking advantage of its benefits. We propose a method of generating composition proposal to support manga creation by amateurs. For the method, we also define new manga metadata model which summarize and extend metadata models by earlier studies. It represents the compostion and the plot in manga. We apply a neural machine translation mechanism for learing the relation between the composition and the plot. It considers that the plot annotation is the source of the composition annotation that is the target, and learns from the annotation dataset based on the metadata model. We conducted experiments to evaluate how the composition proposal generated by our method helps amateur manga creation, and demonstrated that it is useful.

TI Stage-Wise Magnitude-Based Pruning for Recurrent Neural Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
AB A recurrent neural network (RNN) has shown powerful performance in tackling various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, resulting in numerous powerful models containing both RNN neurons and feedforward neurons. On the other hand, the deep structure of RNN has heavily restricted its implementation on mobile devices, where quite a few applications involve NLP tasks. Magnitude-based pruning (MP) is a promising way to address such a challenge. However, the existing MP methods are mostly designed for feedforward neural networks that do not involve a recurrent structure, and, thus, have performed less satisfactorily on pruning models containing RNN layers. In this article, a novel stage-wise MP method is proposed by explicitly taking the featured recurrent structure of RNN into account, which can effectively prune feedforward layers and RNN layers, simultaneously. The connections of neural networks are first grouped into three types according to how they are intersected with recurrent neurons. Then, an optimization-based pruning method is applied to compress each group of connections, respectively. Empirical studies show that the proposed method performs significantly better than the commonly used RNN pruning methods; i.e., up to 96.84% connections are pruned with little or even no degradation of precision indicators on the testing datasets.

TI Radiomics and Artificial Intelligence in Uterine Sarcomas: A Systematic
   Review
SO JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE
AB Background: Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) with computerized imaging analysis is attracting the attention of clinicians, in particular for its potential applications in improving cancer diagnosis. This review aims to investigate the contribution of radiomics and AI on the radiological preoperative assessment of patients with uterine sarcomas (USs). Methods: Our literature review involved a systematic search conducted in the last ten years about diagnosis, staging and treatments with radiomics and AI in USs. The protocol was drafted according to the systematic review and meta-analysis preferred reporting project (PRISMA-P) and was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42021253535). Results: The initial search identified 754 articles; of these, six papers responded to the characteristics required for the revision and were included in the final analysis. The predominant technique tested was magnetic resonance imaging. The analyzed studies revealed that even though sometimes complex models included AI-related algorithms, they are still too complex for translation into clinical practice. Furthermore, since these results are extracted by retrospective series and do not include external validations, currently it is hard to predict the chances of their application in different study groups. Conclusion: To date, insufficient evidence supports the benefit of radiomics in USs. Nevertheless, this field is promising but the quality of studies should be a priority in these new technologies.

TI Improving Visual Reasoning Through Semantic Representation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In visual reasoning, the achievement of deep learning significantly improved the accuracy of results. Image features are primarily used as input to get answers. However, the image features are too redundant to learn accurate characterizations within a limited complexity and time. While in the process of human reasoning, abstract description of an image is usually to avoid irrelevant details. Inspired by this, a higher-level representation named semantic representation is introduced. In this paper, a detailed visual reasoning model is proposed. This new model contains an image understanding model based on semantic representation, feature extraction and process model refined with watershed and u-distance method, a feature vector learning model using pyramidal pooling and residual network, and a question understanding model combining problem embedding coding method and machine translation decoding method. The feature vector could better represent the whole image instead of overly focused on specific characteristics. The model using semantic representation as input verifies that more accurate results can be obtained by introducing a high-level semantic representation. The result also shows that it is feasible and effective to introduce high-level and abstract forms of knowledge representation into deep learning tasks. This study lays a theoretical and experimental foundation for introducing different levels of knowledge representation into deep learning in the future.

TI On the feasibility of AISI 304 stainless steel laser welding with metal
   powder
SO JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES
AB Laser welding is a manufacturing process that allows the joining of metallic parts even if accurate positioning and preparation of the welding edges are mandatory for successful welding. The use of a filler material in the form either of wire or powder can mitigate the drawback entangled with that preparation. In this work, bead-on-plates were performed on of AISI 304 stainless steel plate with AISI 316 L powder as filler material. Tests were carried out using different combinations of process parameters. The influence of process parameters like laser power, translation speed, powder feed rate, carrier gas flow rate and laser spot diameter on geometry, on microstructure and on porosity of the weld seams were investigated. The transition between conduction to keyhole regime was detected, both with and without powder addition during welding. It was found that the variation of laser spot diameter is fundamental in generating the different welding regimes. Moreover, porosity was detected only in the keyhole regime with a maximum value of 5.5%. Finally, "V-shaped" grooves were machined on AISI 304 substrate and filled by two overlapped tracks. The results of the study demonstrated the feasibility of the laser welding of AISI 304 stainless steel with AISI 316 L powder as filler material.

   Whole exome sequencing (WES) is a popular and successful technology which is widely used in both research and clinical settings. However, there is a paucity of reference data for Aboriginal Australians to underpin the translation of health-based genomic research. Here we provide a catalogue of variants called after sequencing the exomes of 50 Aboriginal individuals from the Northern Territory (NT) of Australia and compare these to 72 previously published exomes from a Western Australian (WA) population of Martu origin. Sequence data for both NT and WA samples were processed using an 'intersect-then-combine' (ITC) approach, using GATK and SAMtools to call variants. A total of 289,829 variants were identified in at least one individual in the NT cohort and 248,374 variants in at least one individual in the WA cohort. Of these, 166,719 variants were present in both cohorts, whilst 123,110 variants were private to the NT cohort and 81,655 were private to the WA cohort. Our data set provides a useful reference point for genomic studies on Aboriginal Australians.

AB Automatically generating coherent and semantically meaningful text has many applications in machine translation, dialogue systems, image captioning, etc. Recently, by combining with policy gradient, Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) that use a discriminative model to guide the training of the generative model as a reinforcement learning policy has shown promising results in text generation. However, the scalar guiding signal is only available after the entire text has been generated and lacks intermediate information about text structure during the generative process. As such, it limits its success when the length of the generated text samples is long (more than 20 words). In this paper, we propose a new framework, called LeakGAN, to address the problem for long text generation. We allow the discriminative net to leak its own high-level extracted features to the generative net to further help the guidance. The generator incorporates such informative signals into all generation steps through an additional MANAGER module, which takes the extracted features of current generated words and outputs a latent vector to guide the WORKER module for next-word generation. Our extensive experiments on synthetic data and various real world tasks with Turing test demonstrate that LeakGAN is highly effective in long text generation and also improves the performance in short text generation scenarios. More importantly, without any supervision, LeakGAN would be able to implicitly learn sentence structures only through the interaction between MANAGER and WORKER.

TI Discontinuous grammar as a foreign language
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
AB In order to achieve deep natural language understanding, syntactic constituent parsing is a vital step, highly demanded by many artificial intelligence systems to process both text and speech. One of the most recent proposals is the use of standard sequence-to-sequence models to perform constituent parsing as a machine translation task, instead of applying task-specific parsers. While they show a competitive performance, these text-to-parse transducers are still lagging behind classic techniques in terms of accuracy, coverage and speed. To close the gap, we here extend the framework of sequence-to-sequence models for constituent parsing, not only by providing a more powerful neural architecture for improving their performance, but also by enlarging their coverage to handle the most complex syntactic phenomena: discontinuous structures. To that end, we design several novel linearizations that can fully produce discontinuities and, for the first time, we test a sequence-to-sequence model on the main discontinuous benchmarks, obtaining competitive results on par with task-specific discontinuous constituent parsers and achieving state-of-the-art scores on the (discontinuous) English Penn Treebank.

TI Correlation Assessment of the Performance of Associative Classifiers on
   Credit Datasets Based on Data Complexity Measures
SO MATHEMATICS
AB One of the four basic machine learning tasks is pattern classification. The selection of the proper learning algorithm for a given problem is a challenging task, formally known as the algorithm selection problem (ASP). In particular, we are interested in the behavior of the associative classifiers derived from Alpha-Beta models applied to the financial field. In this paper, the behavior of four associative classifiers was studied: the One-Hot version of the Hybrid Associative Classifier with Translation (CHAT-OHM), the Extended Gamma (EG), the Naive Associative Classifier (NAC), and the Assisted Classification for Imbalanced Datasets (ACID). To establish the performance, we used the area under the curve (AUC), F-score, and geometric mean measures. The four classifiers were applied over 11 datasets from the financial area. Then, the performance of each one was analyzed, considering their correlation with the measures of data complexity, corresponding to six categories based on specific aspects of the datasets: feature, linearity, neighborhood, network, dimensionality, and class imbalance. The correlations that arise between the measures of complexity of the datasets and the measures of performance of the associative classifiers are established; these results are expressed with Spearman's Rho coefficient. The experimental results correctly indicated correlations between data complexity measures and the performance of the associative classifiers.

TI Hierarchical multimodal transformer to summarize videos
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
AB Although video summarization has achieved tremendous success benefiting from Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), RNN-based methods neglect the global dependencies and multi-hop relationships among video frames, which limits the performance. Transformer is an effective model to deal with this problem, and surpasses RNN-based methods in several sequence modeling tasks, such as machine translation, video captioning, etc. Motivated by the great success of transformer and the natural structure of video (frame-shot-video), a hierarchical transformer is developed for video summarization, which can capture the dependencies among frame and shots, and summarize the video by exploiting the scene information formed by shots. Furthermore, we argue that both the audio and visual information are essential for the video summarization task. To integrate the two kinds of information, they are encoded in a two-stream scheme, and a multimodal fusion mechanism is developed based on the hierarchical transformer. In this paper, the proposed method is denoted as Hierarchical Multimodal Transformer (HMT). Practically, extensive experiments show that HMT achieves (F-measure: 0.441, Kendall's s: 0.079, Spearman's q: 0.080) and (F-measure: 0.601, Kendall's s: 0.096, Spearman's q: 0.107) on SumMe and TVsum, respectively. It surpasses most of the traditional, RNN-based and attention-based video summarization methods. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Single cell transcriptomics of primate sensory neurons identifies cell
   types associated with chronic pain
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Distinct types of dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons may have unique contributions to chronic pain. Identification of primate sensory neuron types is critical for understanding the cellular origin and heritability of chronic pain. However, molecular insights into the primate sensory neurons are missing. Here we classify non-human primate dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons based on their transcriptome and map human pain heritability to neuronal types. First, we identified cell correlates between two major datasets for mouse sensory neuron types. Machine learning exposes an overall cross-species conservation of somatosensory neurons between primate and mouse, although with differences at individual gene level, highlighting the importance of primate data for clinical translation. We map genomic loci associated with chronic pain in human onto primate sensory neuron types to identify the cellular origin of chronic pain. Genome-wide associations for chronic pain converge on two different neuronal types distributed between pain disorders that display different genetic susceptibilities, suggesting both unique and shared mechanisms between different pain conditions. The contribution of distinct types of dorsal root ganglion neurons to chronic pain is unclear. Here, the authors molecularly profile non-human primate sensory neurons and show that genome-wide associations converge on two neuronal types with different genetic susceptibilities for chronic pain.

TI Number Entities Recognition in Multiple Rounds of Dialogue Systems
SO CMES-COMPUTER MODELING IN ENGINEERING & SCIENCES
AB As a representative technique in natural language processing (NLP), named entity recognition is used in many tasks, such as dialogue systems, machine translation and information extraction. In dialogue systems, there is a common case for named entity recognition, where a lot of entities are composed of numbers, and are segmented to be located in different places. For example, in multiple rounds of dialogue systems, a phone number is likely to be divided into several parts, because the phone number is usually long and is emphasized. In this paper, the entity consisting of numbers is named as number entity. The discontinuous positions of number entities result from many reasons. We find two reasons from real-world dialogue systems. The first reason is the repetitive confirmation of different components of a number entity, and the second reason is the interception of mood words. The extraction of number entities is quite useful in many tasks, such as user information completion and service requests correction. However, the existing entity extraction methods cannot extract entities consisting of discontinuous entity blocks. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a comprehensive method for number entity recognition, which is capable of extracting number entities in multiple rounds of dialogues systems. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate the high performance of our method.

TI The Comparison of Diffeomorphic Images based on the Construction of
   Persistent Homology
SO AUTOMATIC CONTROL AND COMPUTER SCIENCES
AB An object shape analysis is a problem that is related to such areas as geometry, topology, image processing and machine learning. For analyzing the form, the deformation between the source and terminal form of the object is estimated. The most used form analysis model is the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) model. The LDDMM model can be supplemented with functional non-geometric information about objects (volume, color, formation time). The paper considers algorithms for constructing sets of barcodes for comparing diffeomorphic images, which are real values taken by persistent homology. A distinctive feature of the use of persistent homology with respect to methods of algebraic topology is to obtain more information about the shape of the object. An important direction of the application of persistent homology is the study invariants of big data. A method based on persistent cohomology is proposed that combines persistent homology technologies with embedded non-geometric information presented as functions of simplicial complexes. The proposed structure of extended barcodes using cohomology increases the effectiveness of persistent homology methods. A modification of the Wasserstein method for finding the distance between images by introducing non-geometric information was proposed. The possibility of the formation of barcodes of images invariant to transformations of rotation, translation and similarity is considered.

TI A Review of Data Analytic Applications in Road Traffic Safety. Part 1:
   Descriptive and Predictive Modeling
SO SENSORS
AB This part of the review aims to reduce the start-up burden of data collection and descriptive analytics for statistical modeling and route optimization of risk associated with motor vehicles. From a data-driven bibliometric analysis, we show that the literature is divided into two disparate research streams: (a) predictive or explanatory models that attempt to understand and quantify crash risk based on different driving conditions, and (b) optimization techniques that focus on minimizing crash risk through route/path-selection and rest-break scheduling. Translation of research outcomes between these two streams is limited. To overcome this issue, we present publicly available high-quality data sources (different study designs, outcome variables, and predictor variables) and descriptive analytic techniques (data summarization, visualization, and dimension reduction) that can be used to achieve safer-routing and provide code to facilitate data collection/exploration by practitioners/researchers. Then, we review the statistical and machine learning models used for crash risk modeling. We show that (near) real-time crash risk is rarely considered, which might explain why the optimization models (reviewed in Part 2) have not capitalized on the research outcomes from the first stream.

AB Globally normalized neural sequence models are considered superior to their locally normalized equivalents because they may ameliorate the effects of label bias. However, when considering high-capacity neural parametrizations that condition on the whole input sequence, both model classes are theoretically equivalent in terms of the distributions they are capable of representing. Thus, the practical advantage of global normalization in the context of modern neural methods remains unclear. In this paper, we attempt to shed light on this problem through an empirical study. We extend an approach for search-aware training via a continuous relaxation of beam search (Goyal et al., 2017b) in order to enable training of globally normalized recurrent sequence models through simple backpropagation. We then use this technique to conduct an empirical study of the interaction between global normalization, high-capacity encoders, and search-aware optimization. We observe that in the context of inexact search, globally normalized neural models are still more effective than their locally normalized counterparts. Further, since our training approach is sensitive to warm-starting with pre-trained models, we also propose a novel initialization strategy based on self-normalization for pretraining globally normalized models. We perform analysis of our approach on two tasks: CCG supertagging and Machine Translation, and demonstrate the importance of global normalization under different conditions while using search-aware training.

AB Social Media sites have changed the way people communicate. They are now the world's largest virtual communities. People use social media to make friends, communicate with each other and express their preferences and opinions about various things. As such, every day, massive number of pieces of textual information is gathered into Social Media, and such information can be leveraged for many uses. However, the limited character length for these texts has caused people to communicate unconventionally with a mixture of formal and slang words. This has created problems on two levels, The first is that social media text is often unsuitable as data for Natural Language Processing tasks such as Machine Translation, Information Retrieval and Opinion Mining, due to the its unconventionality and the irregularity of the language featured. The second is that non-native speakers of English, older Internet users and non-members of the "in-group" often find such texts difficult to understand. The normalization of these slang words is by generating plain text from the slang words. This study therefore develops a system to normalize social media texts that can be deployed as either a preprocessing step for Natural Language Processing tasks or to bridge the generational-gap when handling social media text. The system is then tested and its performance evaluated.

TI Structural signatures of antibiotic binding sites on the ribosome
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB The ribosome represents a major target for antibacterial drugs. Being a complex molecular machine, it offers many potential sites for functional interference. The high-resolution structures of ribosome in complex with various antibiotics provide a unique data set for understanding the universal features of drug-binding pockets on the ribosome. In this work, we have analyzed the structural and evolutionary properties of 65 antibiotic binding sites (ABSs) in the ribosome. We compared these sites to similar-size computed pockets extracted from the small and large ribosomal subunits. Based on this analysis, we defined properties of the known drug-binding sites, which constitute the signature of a 'druggable' site. The most noticeable properties of the ABSs are prevalence of non-paired bases, a strong bias in favor of unusual syn conformation of the RNA bases and an unusual sugar pucker. We propose that despite the different geometric and chemical properties of diverse antibiotics, their binding sites tend to have common attributes that possibly reflect the potency of the pocket for binding small molecules. Finally, we utilized the ensemble of properties to derive a druggability index, which can be used in conjunction with site functionality information to identify new drug-binding sites on the ribosome.

TI Black-box attacks on image classification model with advantage
   actor-critic algorithm in latent space
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem that integrates a wide variety of intelligent multi-media applications and services has undergone a tremendous transformation over the years. As an essential approach for securing IoT-based multimedia services, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been in innovation at a rapid pace. However, many machine learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples, including advanced deep neural networks. By making imperceptible modifications to real examples, the prediction will deviate far from the correct value. A deep reinforcement learning-based black-box attacker on the image classification model is introduced in our research. Different from the existing black-box attacks, which require massive queries and trials in the pixel space, the proposed method compresses the images into latent space through variational inference, querying the optimal examples efficiently with actor-critic networks. Rather than patch-to-patch translation with generative adversarial networks in related works, the fake examples are generated by gradually superimposing the perturbations into the latent space at each step through the Markov decision process (MDP) to high stability and good astringency of the attacker. Experiments evaluated on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that the proposed attacker can generate adversarial images for most samples in limited steps, greatly reduc-ing the accuracy of the model.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Arabic natural language processing: An overview
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Arabic is recognised as the 4th most used language of the Internet. Arabic has three main varieties: (1) classical Arabic (CA), (2) Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), (3) Arabic Dialect (AD). MSA and AD could be written either in Arabic or in Roman script (Arabizi), which corresponds to Arabic written with Latin letters, numerals and punctuation. Due to the complexity of this language and the number of corresponding challenges for NLP, many surveys have been conducted, in order to synthesise the work done on Arabic. However these surveys principally focus on two varieties of Arabic (MSA and AD, written in Arabic letters only), they are slightly old (no such survey since 2015) and therefore do not cover recent resources and tools. To bridge the gap, we propose a survey focusing on 90 recent research papers (74% of which were published after 2015). Our study presents and classifies the work done on the three varieties of Arabic, by concentrating on both Arabic and Arabizi, and associates each work to its publicly available resources whenever available.

AB Lexically constrained sentence generation allows the incorporation of prior knowledge such as lexical constraints into the output. This technique has been applied to machine translation, and dialog response generation. Previous work usually used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to generate lexically constrained sentences, but they randomly determined the position to be edited and the action to be taken, resulting in many invalid refinements. To overcome this challenge, we used a classifier to instruct the MCMC-based models where and how to refine the candidate sentences. First, we developed two methods to create synthetic data on which the pre-trained model is fine-tuned to obtain a reliable classifier. Next, we proposed a two-step approach, "Predict and Revise", for constrained sentence generation. During the predict step, we leveraged the classifier to compute the learned prior for the candidate sentence. During the revise step, we resorted to MCMC sampling to revise the candidate sentence by conducting a sampled action at a sampled position drawn from the learned prior. We compared our proposed models with many strong baselines on two tasks, generating sentences with lexical constraints and text infilling. Experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed model performs much better than the previous work in terms of sentence fluency and diversity. Our code, pre-trained models and Appendix are available at https://github.com/NLPCode/MCMCXLNet.
