TI Stain color translation of multi-domain OSCC histopathology images using
   attention gated cGAN
SO COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL IMAGING AND GRAPHICS
AB Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) is the most prevalent type of oral cancer across the globe. Histopathol-ogy examination is the gold standard for OSCC examination, where stained histopathology slides help in studying and analyzing the cell structures under a microscope to determine the stages and grading of OSCC. One of the staining methods popularly known as H&E staining is used to produce differential coloration, highlight key tissue features, and improve contrast, which makes cell analysis easier. However, the stained H&E histopathology images exhibit inter and intra-variation due to staining techniques, incubation times, and staining reagents. These variations negatively impact computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and Machine learning algorithm's accuracy and development. A pre-processing procedure called stain normalization must be employed to reduce stain variance's negative impacts. Numerous state-of-the-art stain normalization methods are introduced. However, a robust multi-domain stain normalization approach is still required because, in a real-world situation, the OSCC histopathology images will include more than two color variations involving several domains. In this paper, a multi-domain stain translation method is proposed. The proposed method is an attention gated generator based on a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) with a novel objective function to enforce color distribution and the perpetual resemblance between the source and target domains. Instead of using WSI scanner images like previous techniques, the proposed method is experimented on OSCC histopathology images obtained by several conventional microscopes coupled with cameras. The proposed method receives the L* channel from the L*a*b* color space in inference mode and generates the G(a*b*) channel, which are color-adapted. The proposed technique uses mappings learned during training phases to translate the source domain to the target domain; mapping are learned using the whole color distribution of the target domain instead of one reference image. The suggested technique outperforms the four state-of-the-art methods in multi-domain OSCC histopathological translation, the claim is supported by results obtained after assessment in both quantitative and qualitative ways.

TI From Word Embeddings to Pre-Trained Language Models: A State-of-the-Art
   Walkthrough
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB With the recent advances in deep learning, different approaches to improving pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been proposed. PLMs have advanced state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on various natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as machine translation, text classification, question answering, text summarization, information retrieval, recommendation systems, named entity recognition, etc. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of prior embedding models as well as current breakthroughs in the field of PLMs. Then, we analyse and contrast the various models and provide an analysis of the way they have been built (number of parameters, compression techniques, etc.). Finally, we discuss the major issues and future directions for each of the main points.

AB We propose a method to distil language-agnostic meaning embedding using a multilingual sentence encoder. By removing languagespecific information from the original embedding, we retrieve an embedding that fully represents the meaning of the sentence. The proposed method relies only on parallel corpora without any human annotations. Our meaning embedding allows for efficient cross-lingual sentence similarity estimation using a simple cosine similarity calculation. Experimental results of both the quality estimation of machine translation and cross-lingual semantic textual similarity tasks reveal that our method consistently outperforms the strong baselines using the original multilingual embeddings. The method also consistently improves the performance of any pre-trained multilingual sentence encoder, even in low-resource language pairs, where only tens of thousands of parallel sentence pairs are available.(1)

Such approaches, however, require extensive labor and expertise to morphologically analyze the sentences and create the NLP framework. Our works aim to simplify these labors. We conduct a contrastive experiment between two types of sequence learning: statistical-based machine translation and attention-based sequence neural network. These models can be trained end-to-end, and it can capture the pattern between the input sequence and output sequence, thus diminishing the need to prepare a sophisticated NLP pipeline. Automatic evaluation results show that our system outperforms the state-of-the-art rule-based system, and also excels in terms of content quality and fluency according to a subjective human test.

TI Relative specificity as an important consideration in the big data era
SO FRONTIERS IN GENETICS
AB Technological breakthroughs such as high-throughput methods, genomics, single-cell studies, and machine learning have fundamentally transformed research and ushered in the big data era of biology. Nevertheless, current data collections, analyses, and modeling frequently overlook relative specificity, a crucial property of molecular interactions in biochemical systems. Relative specificity describes how, for example, an enzyme reacts with its many substrates at different rates, and how this discriminatory action alone is sufficient to modulate the substrates and downstream events. As a corollary, it is not only important to comprehensively identify an enzyme's substrates, but also critical to quantitatively determine how the enzyme interacts with the substrates and to evaluate how it shapes subsequent biological outcomes. Genomics and high-throughput techniques have greatly facilitated the studies of relative specificity in the 21st century, and its functional significance has been demonstrated in complex biochemical systems including transcription, translation, protein kinases, RNA-binding proteins, and animal microRNAs (miRNAs), although it remains ignored in most work. Here we analyze recent findings in big data and relative specificity studies and explain how the incorporation of relative specificity concept might enhance our mechanistic understanding of gene functions, biological phenomena, and human diseases.

TI Sequence-to-Sequence Learning-Based Conversion of Pseudo-Code to Source
   Code Using Neural Translation Approach
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Pseudo-code refers to an informal means of representing algorithms that do not require the exact syntax of a computer programming language. Pseudo-code helps developers and researchers represent their algorithms using human-readable language. Generally, researchers can convert the pseudo-code into computer source code using different conversion techniques. The efficiency of such conversion methods is measured based on the converted algorithm's correctness. Researchers have already explored diverse technologies to devise conversion methods with higher accuracy. This paper proposes a novel pseudo-code conversion learning method that includes natural language processing-based text preprocessing and a sequence-to-sequence deep learning-based model trained with the SPoC dataset. We conducted an extensive experiment on our designed algorithm using descriptive bilingual understudy scoring and compared our results with state-of-the-art techniques. Result analysis shows that our approach is more accurate and efficient than other existing conversion methods in terms of several performances metrics. Furthermore, the proposed method outperforms the existing approaches because our method utilizes two Long-Short-Term-Memory networks that might increase the accuracy.

TI CsrA-FliW interaction governs flagellin homeostasis and a checkpoint on
   flagellar morphogenesis in Bacillus subtilis
SO MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY
AB CsrA is a widely distributed RNA binding protein that regulates translation initiation and/or mRNA stability of target transcripts. CsrA activity is antagonized by sRNA(s) containing multiple CsrA binding sites in several Gram-negative bacterial species. Here we discover FliW, the first protein antagonist of CsrA activity that constitutes a partner switching mechanism to control flagellin synthesis in the Gram-positive organism Bacillus subtilis. Following the flagellar assembly checkpoint of hook completion, secretion of flagellin ( Hag) releases FliW protein from a FliW-Hag complex. FliW then binds to CsrA and relieves CsrA-mediated translational repression of hag for flagellin synthesis concurrent with filament assembly. Thus, flagellin homeostatically restricts its own translation. Homeostatic autoregulation may be a general mechanism to precisely control structural subunits required at specific times and in finite amounts such as those involved in the assembly of flagella, type III secretion machines and pili. Finally, phylogenetic analysis suggests that CsrA, a highly pleiotropic virulence regulator in many bacterial pathogens, had an ancestral role in flagellar assembly and evolved to co-regulate various cellular processes with motility.

AB Exact 3D tracking of facial feature points is appealing for many applications in human-machine interaction. In this work a 3D Active Shape Model (ASM) that can be shifted, scaled, and rotated is used to track the points. The efficient Gauss-Newton method is applied to estimate the 3D ASM, rotation, translation, and scale parameters. If the head turns to one side, some points might be occluded but they are still considered for the estimation of the parameters. A robust error norm that reduces (or ideally cancels) the influence of occluded points is applied. With some algebraic transformations the computational cost per frame can be further reduced. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on the basis of the Airplane Behavior Corpus.

CL Sapporo, JAPAN
AB We propose new methods to take advantage of text in resource-rich languages to sharpen statistical language models in resource-deficient languages. We achieve this through an extension of the method of lexical triggers to the cross-language problem, and by developing a likelihood-based adaptation scheme for combining a trigger model with an N-gram model. We describe the application of such language models for automatic speech recognition. By exploiting a side-corpus of contemporaneous English news articles for adapting a static Chinese language model to transcribe Mandarin news stories, we demonstrate significant reductions in both perplexity and recognition errors. We also compare our cross-lingual adaptation scheme to monolingual language model adaptation, and to an alternate method for exploiting cross-lingual cues, via cross-lingual information retrieval and machine translation, proposed elsewhere.

AB This paper develops suitable procedures for translating high-order networks into conventional stability constants. The approach is computer-oriented and imposes no restriction on the number of equivalent damper windings per axis, Optimum order reduction is used to demonstrate that second-order networks have a bandwidth limited to between 1 and 5 Hz while third-order models may extend this bandwidth beyond 100 Hz, The latter are therefore mandatory for subsynchronous resonance and harmonic studies. In the course of this investigation, the need for a precise definition of the so-called stability constants arises and it is concluded that only a second-order SSFR-based model yields constants that are consistent with the latest, short-circuit test bound, IEEE standard definitions.

TI MECHANICAL VERIFICATION OF DISTRIBUTED ALGORITHMS IN HIGHER-ORDER LOGIC
SO COMPUTER JOURNAL
AB The only practical way to verify the correctness of distributed algorithms with a high degree of confidence is to construct machine-checked, formal correctness proofs. In this paper we explain how to do so using HOG-an interactive proof assistant for higher-order logic developed by Gordon and others. First, we describe how to build an infrastructure in HOL that supports reasoning about distributed algorithms, including formal theories of predicates, temporal logic, labeled transition systems, simulation of programs, translation of properties, and graphs. Then we demonstrate, via an example, how to use the powerful intuition about events and causality to guide and structure correctness proofs of distributed algorithms. The example used is the verification of PIF (propagation of information with feedback), which is a simple but typical distributed algorithm due to Segall.

Increasing the predictive power of in vitro human assays and using them earlier in discovery would refocus resources on more successful research strategies and reduce animal studies. Increasing laboratory automation enables effective social distancing for researchers, while allowing integrated data capture from remote laboratory networks.

AB Recent studies have shown that a hybrid of self-attention networks (SANs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) outperforms both individual architectures, while not much is known about why the hybrid models work. With the belief that modeling hierarchical structure is an essential complementary between SANs and RNNs, we propose to further enhance the strength of hybrid models with an advanced variant of RNNs - Ordered Neurons LSTM (ON-LSTM, Shen et al., 2019), which introduces a syntax-oriented inductive bias to perform tree-like composition. Experimental results on the benchmark machine translation task show that the proposed approach outperforms both individual architectures and a standard hybrid model. Further analyses on targeted linguistic evaluation and logical inference tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach indeed benefits from a better modeling of hierarchical structure.

In particular, we introduce two character-level methods for the abbreviation modeling aspect of the noisy channel model: a statistical classifier using language-based features to decide whether a character is likely to be removed from a word, and a character-level machine translation model. A two-phase approach is used; in the first stage the possible candidates are generated using the selected abbreviation model and in the second stage we choose the best candidate by decoding using a language model. Overall we find that this approach works well and is on par with current research in the field. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Rather than simply shorten a sentence by deleting words or constituents, as in previous work, we rewrite it using additional operations such as substitution, reordering, and insertion. We present an experimental study showing that humans can naturally create abstractive sentences using a variety of rewrite operations, not just deletion. We next create a new corpus that is suited to the abstractive compression task and formulate a discriminative tree-to-tree transduction model that can account for structural and lexical mismatches. The model incorporates a grammar extraction method, uses a language model for coherent output, and can be easily tuned to a wide range of compression-specific loss functions.

AB This paper proposes a novel approach to improve the kernel-based Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). We first explain why linear kernels are more suitable to WSD and many other natural language processing problems than translation-invariant kernels. Based on the linear kernel, two external knowledge sources are integrated. One comprises a set of linguistic rules to find the crucial features. For the other, a distributional similarity thesaurus is used to alleviate data sparseness by generalizing crucial features when they do not match the word-form exactly. The experiments show that we have outperformed the state-of-the-art system on the benchmark data from English lexical sample task of SemEval-2007 and the improvement is statistically significant.

AB This document presents a new kind of grammars: the Generative Dependency Grammar (GDG) and GDG with Feature Structure (FS) represented as Attribute Value Tree (AVT). This type of grammars is based on dependency trees (DT) and a generative process. GDG will eliminate some issues of Dependency Grammars DG (for example the missing of phrasal categories) and Generative Grammars GG (the problem of discontinuous structures) and will merge the advantages of the two types of grammar (GG - the representation of phrasal categories; GDG - the handling of discontinuous structures as gaps and non projective constructions). We present the generation process and the unification in GDG. Some properties of AVT and a logical representation of AVT are presented too. GDG is useful in grammar representations for natural language understanding, machine translation and data retrieval.

AB We consider retrosynthesis to be a machine translation problem. Accordingly, we apply an attention-based and completely data-driven model named Tensor2Tensor to a data set comprising approximately 50 000 diverse reactions extracted from the United States patent literature. The model significantly outperforms the seq2seq model (37.4%), with top-1 accuracy reaching 54.1%. We also offer a novel insight into the causes of grammatically invalid SMILES, and conduct a test in which experienced chemists select and analyze the "wrong" predictions that may be chemically plausible but differ from the ground truth. The effectiveness of our model is found to be underestimated and the "true" top-1 accuracy reaches as high as 64.6%.

AB Applications such as machine translation, speech recognition, and information retrieval require efficient handling of noun compounds as they are one of the possible sources for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. In-depth processing of noun compounds requires not only splitting them into smaller components (or even roots) but also the identification of instances that should remain unsplitted as they are of idiomatic nature. We develop a two-fold deep learning-based approach of noun compound splitting and idiomatic compound detection for the German language that we train using a newly collected corpus of annotated German compounds. Our neural noun compound splitter operates on a sub-word level and outperforms the current state of the art by about 5%.

AB Electromyography (EMG) is well suited for capturing static hand features involving relatively long and stable muscle activations. At the same time, inertial sensing can inherently capture dynamic features related to hand rotation and translation. This paper introduces a hand gesture recognition wristband based on combined EMG and IMU signals. Preliminary testing was performed on four healthy subjects to evaluate a classification algorithm for identifying four surface pressing gestures at two force levels and eight air gestures. Average classification accuracy across all subjects was 88% for surface gestures and 96% for air gestures. Classification accuracy was significantly improved when both EMG and inertial sensing was used in combination as compared to results based on either single sensing modality.

AB As an important linguistic resource, collocation represents a significant relation between words. Automatic collocation extraction is very important for many natural language processing applications, such as word sense disambiguation, machine translation and information retrieval etc. While traditional collocation extraction approaches use only one single statistical measure, they may not be optimal in that they can not take advantage of multiple statistical measures. In this paper, we propose a logistic linear regression model (LLRM) that combines five classical lexical association measures: chi(2)-test, t-test, co-occurrence frequency, log-likelihood ratio and mutual information. Experiments show that our approach leads to a significant performance improvement in comparison with individual basic methods in both precision and recall.

Due to the prevalence of cross-language categorial variation in multilingual applications, our categorial-variation resource may serve as an integral part of a diverse range of natural language applications. Thus, the research reported herein overlaps heavily with that of the machine-translation, lexicon-construction, and information-retrieval communities.
   We apply the information-retrieval metrics of precision and recall to evaluate the accuracy and coverage of our database with respect to a human-produced gold standard. This evaluation reveals that the categorial database achieves a high degree of precision and recall. Additionally, we demonstrate that the database improves on the linkability of Porter stemmer by over 30%.

AB We introduce a Unified Disentanglement Network (UFDN) trained on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which we refer to as UFDN-TCGA. We demonstrate that UFDN-TCGA learns a biologically relevant, low-dimensional latent space of high-dimensional gene expression data by applying our network to two classification tasks of cancer status and cancer type. UFDN-TCGA performs comparably to random forest methods. The UFDN allows for continuous, partial interpolation between distinct cancer types. Furthermore, we perform an analysis of differentially expressed genes between skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) samples and the same samples interpolated into glioblastoma (GBM). We demonstrate that our interpolations consist of relevant metagenes that recapitulate known glioblastorna mechanisms.

AB Human generates responses relying on semantic and functional dependencies, including coreference relation, among dialogue elements and their context. In this paper, we investigate matching a response with its multi-turn context using dependency information based entirely on attention. Our solution is inspired by the recently proposed Transformer in machine translation (Vaswani et al., 2017) and we extend the attention mechanism in two ways. First, we construct representations of text segments at different granularities solely with stacked self-attention. Second, we try to extract the truly matched segment pairs with attention across the context and response. We jointly introduce those two kinds of attention in one uniform neural network. Experiments on two large-scale multi-turn response selection tasks show that our proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models.

These include a novel hybrid data acquisition strategy to sequence cross-links at both MS2 and MS3 level and a new algorithmic design XlinkX v2.0 for data analysis. As proof-of-concept we investigated proteome-wide protein interactions in E. coli and HeLa cell lysates, respectively, identifying 1,158 and 3,301 unique cross-links at similar to 1% false discovery rate. These protein interaction repositories provide meaningful structural information on many endogenous macromolecular assemblies, as we showcase on several protein complexes involved in translation, protein folding and carbohydrate metabolism.

TI A Survey of Paraphrasing and Textual Entailment Methods
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
AB Paraphrasing methods recognize, generate, or extract phrases, sentences, or longer natural language expressions that convey almost the same information. Textual entailment methods, on the other hand, recognize, generate, or extract pairs of natural language expressions, such that a human who reads (and trusts) the first element of a pair would most likely infer that the other element is also true. Paraphrasing can be seen as bidirectional textual entailment and methods from the two areas are often similar. Both kinds of methods are useful, at least in principle, in a wide range of natural language processing applications, including question answering, summarization, text generation, and machine translation. We summarize key ideas from the two areas by considering in turn recognition, generation, and extraction methods, also pointing to prominent articles and resources.

AB Most previous corpus-based approaches to word-sense disambiguation (WSD) collect salient words from the context of a target word. However, they suffer from the problem of data sparseness. To overcome the problem, this paper proposes a concept-based WSD method that uses an automatically generated sense-tagged corpus. Grammatical similarities between Korean and Japanese enable the construction of a sense-tagged Korean corpus through an existing high-quality Japanese-to-Korean machine translation system. The sense-tagged corpus can serve as a knowledge source to extract useful clues for word sense disambiguation, such as concept co-occurrence information. In an evaluation, a weighted voting model achieved the best average precision of 77.22%, with an improvement over the baseline by 14.47%, which shows that our proposed method is very promising for practical NIT systems.

This paper describes a multi-modal eye position tracker in dark/bright pupil image sequences. The tracking algorithm consists of detecting meaningful particles that correspond to IR-Pupil responses and eye motion, filtering of particles through appearance models in the local invariant descriptor space, and matching of eye neighbors. Experimental validations have shown satisfactory performance in term of precision of eye position estimation, and robustness to 2D head rotations, translations, closed eye states, and reasonable out-of-plane rotations.

AB Text prediction is a form of interactive machine translation that is well suited to skilled translators. In principle it can assist in the production of a target text with minimal disruption to a translator's normal routine. However, recent evaluations of a prototype prediction system showed that it significantly decreased the productivity of most translators who used it. In this paper, we analyze the reasons for this and propose a solution which consists in seeking predictions that maximize the expected benefit to the translator, rather than just trying to anticipate some amount of upcoming text. Using a model of a "typical translator" constructed from data collected in the evaluations of the prediction prototype, we show that this approach has the potential to turn text prediction into a help rather than a hindrance to a translator.

In this paper, we distill an ensemble of multiple models trained with different initialization into a single model. In addition to learning to match the ensemble's probability output on the reference states, we also use the ensemble to explore the search space and learn from the encountered states in the exploration. Experimental results on two typical search-based structured prediction tasks - transition-based dependency parsing and neural machine translation show that distillation can effectively improve the single model's performance and the final model achieves improvements of 1.32 in LAS and 2.65 in BLEU score on these two tasks respectively over strong baselines and it outperforms the greedy structured prediction models in previous literatures.

The experiments shows an improvement in Bleu-Score for Factored MT system against Baseline MT system for English to Kannada SMT. Kannada fonts can take ten different forms in representing a word any change of a font variant in word leads to change in meaning of the word. We model these morphological variants of Kannada lemma words, their variants and PoS as Factors in our MT System.

AB Unsupervised word segmentation (UWS) can provide domain-adaptive segmentation for statistical machine translation (SMT) without annotated data, and bilingual UWS can even optimize segmentation for alignment. Monolingual UWS approaches of explicitly modeling the probabilities of words through Dirichlet process (DP) models or Pitman-Yor process (PYP) models have achieved high accuracy, but their bilingual counterparts have only been carried out on small corpora such as basic travel expression corpus (BTEC) due to the computational complexity. This paper proposes an efficient unified PYP-based monolingual and bilingual UWS method. Experimental results show that the proposed method is comparable to supervised segmenters on the in-domain NIST OpenMT corpus, and yields a 0.96 BLEU relative increase on NTCIR PatentMT corpus which is out-of-domain.

AB Recurrent neural network language models have solved the problems of data sparseness and dimensionality disaster which exist in traditional N-gram models. RNNLMs have recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in speech recognition, machine translation and other tasks. In this paper, we improve the model performance by providing contextual word vectors in association with RNNLMs. This method can reinforce the ability of learning long-distance information using vectors training from Skip-gram model. The experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the perplexity performance significantly on Penn Treebank data. And we further apply the models to speech recognition task on the Wall Street Journal corpora, where we achieve obvious improvements in word-error-rate.

AB Enterprise models cover all aspects of modern enterprises, from accounting, through management of custom orders and invoicing, to operational data such as records on machines and workers. In other words, all data necessary for running the company are available in enterprise models. However, these data are not in the proper format for some tasks such as scheduling and optimization. Namely, the concepts and terminology used in enterprise models are different from what is traditionally used in scheduling and optimization software. This paper deals with the automated translation of data from the enterprise model to a scheduling model and back. In particular, we describe how to extract data from the enterprise model for solving the scheduling problem using constraint-based solvers.

AB Software log analysis helps to maintain the health of software solutions and ensure compliance and security. Existing software systems consist of heterogeneous components emitting logs in various formats. A typical solution is to unify the logs using manually built parsers, which is laborious.
   Instead, we explore the possibility of automating the parsing task by employing machine translation (MT). We create a tool that generates synthetic Apache log records which we used to train recurrent-neural-network-based MT models. Models' evaluation on real-world logs shows that the models can learn Apache log format and parse individual log records. The median relative edit distance between an actual real-world log record and the MT prediction is less than or equal to 28%. Thus, we show that log parsing using an MT approach is promising.

TI Instrument Logic Increases Identifications during Mutliplexed
   Translatome Measurements
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Pulsed Stable Isotope Labeling in Cell culture (SILAC) approaches allow measurement of protein dynamics, including protein translation and degradation. However, its use for quantifying acute changes has been limited due to low labeled peptide stoichiometry. Here, we describe the use of instrument logic to select peaks of interest via targeted mass differences (TMD) for overcoming this limitation. Comparing peptides artificially mixed at low heavy-to-light stoichiometry measured using standard data dependent acquisition with or without TMD revealed 2-3-fold increases in identification without significant loss in quantification precision for both MS2 and MS3 methods. Our benchmarked method approach increased throughput by reducing the necessary machine time. We anticipate that all pulsed SILAC measurements, combined with tandem mass tagging (TMT) or not, would greatly benefit from instrument logic based approaches.

TI Cohomological periodicities of crystallographic groups
SO JOURNAL OF ALGEBRA
AB We observe that an n-dimensional crystallographic group G has periodic cohomology in degrees greater than n if it contains a torsion free finite index normal subgroup S (sic) G whose quotient G/S has periodic cohomology. We then consider a different type of periodicity. Namely, we provide hypotheses on a crystallographic group G that imply isomorphisms H-i(G/gamma T-c, F) congruent to H-i(G/gamma Tc+d,F) for F the field of p elements and gamma T-c a term in the relative lower central series of the translation subgroup T <= G. The latter periodicity provides a means of calculating the mod-p homology of certain infinite families of finite p-groups using a finite (machine) computation. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB In hospitals, the doctors at sonography department often need to examine many patients every day. To alleviate the working burden, an automatic examination using some machines is needed. In this paper, by using the depth data captured by Kinect, the 3-D scene could be reconstructed with Visualization Toolkit, then the scan path could be automatically acquired with our method based on the 3-D scene. At last, the 3-D translation device, based on the scan path, is adopted to control the movement of ultrasound probe to scan the tissue surface. And the experimental results show that the method is available for planning an appropriate scan path and making the ultrasound probe touch the tissue surface accurately in the mechanical scanning.

AB Conditional neural text generation models generate high-quality outputs, but often concentrate around a mode when what we really want is a diverse set of options. We present a search algorithm to construct lattices encoding a massive number of generation options. First, we restructure decoding as a best-first search, which explores the space differently than beam search and improves efficiency by avoiding pruning paths. Second, we revisit the idea of hypothesis recombination: we can identify pairs of similar generation candidates during search and merge them as an approximation. On both summarization and machine translation, we show that our algorithm encodes thousands of diverse options that remain grammatical and high-quality into one lattice. This algorithm provides a foundation for building downstream generation applications on top of massive-scale diverse outputs.(1)

AB We propose Future Discriminators for Generation (FUDGE), a flexible and modular method for controlled text generation. Given a preexisting model g for generating text from a distribution of interest, FUDGE enables conditioning on a desired attribute a (for example, formality) while requiring access only to G's output logits. FUDGE learns an attribute predictor operating on a partial sequence, and uses this predictor's outputs to adjust G's original probabilities. We show that FUDGE models terms corresponding to a Bayesian decomposition of the conditional distribution of I given attribute a. Moreover, FUDGE can easily compose predictors for multiple desired attributes. We evaluate FUDGE on three tasks - couplet completion in poetry, topic control in language generation, and formality change in machine translation - and observe gains in all three tasks.

AB Label smoothing has been shown to be an effective regularization strategy in classification, that prevents overfitting and helps in label denoising. However, extending such methods directly to seq2seq settings, such as Machine Translation, is challenging: the large target output space of such problems makes it intractable to apply label smoothing over all possible outputs. Most existing approaches for seq2seq settings either do token level smoothing, or smooth over sequences generated by randomly substituting tokens in the target sequence. Unlike these works, in this paper, we propose a technique that smooths over well formed relevant sequences that not only have sufficient n-gram overlap with the target sequence, but are also semantically similar. Our method shows a consistent and significant improvement over the state-of-the-art techniques on different datasets.

AB Self-attention networks have received increasing research attention. By default, the hidden states of each word are hierarchically calculated by attending to all words in the sentence, which assembles global information. However, several studies pointed out that taking all signals into account may lead to overlooking neighboring information (e.g. phrase pattern). To address this argument, we propose a hybrid attention mechanism to dynamically leverage both of the local and global information. Specifically, our approach uses a gating scalar for integrating both sources of the information, which is also convenient for quantifying their contributions. Experiments on various neural machine translation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The extensive analyses verify that the two types of contexts are complementary to each other, and our method gives highly effective improvements in their integration.

AB The word-aligned bilingual corpus is an important knowledge source for many tasks in NLP especially in machine translation. Among the existing word alignment methods, the unknown word problem, the synonym problem and the global optimization problem are very important factors impacting the recall and precision of alignment results. In this paper, we proposed a word alignment model between Chinese and Japanese which measures similarity in terms of morphological similarity, semantic distance, part of speech and co-occurrence, and matches words by maximum weight matching on bipartite graph. The model can partly solve the problems mentioned above. The model was proved to be effective by experiments. It achieved 80% as F-Score than 72% of GIZA++.

The production of a series of robotically controlled extruder experiments explore integrating material volition with the rigid order of machine control. Specifically this paper outlines the development of tooling procedures that harness emergent conditions in the automation of qualitative material effects. A key question for the research asks, how might architects imagine a design and construction scenario, which is no longer confined to prescriptive material dimensions, but is instead driven by digitally calibrated stochastic material processes? What opportunities might arise from developing an automated system, which does not rely on direct translation, but instead operates and predicts outcomes within a range of potential results?

Joey NMT provides many popular NMT features in a small and simple code base, so that novices can easily and quickly learn to use it and adapt it to their needs. Despite its focus on simplicity, Joey NMT supports classic architectures (RNNs, transformers), fast beam search, weight tying, and more, and achieves performance comparable to more complex toolkits on standard benchmarks. We evaluate the accessibility of our toolkit in a user study where novices with general knowledge about Pytorch and NMT and experts work through a self-contained Joey NMT tutorial, showing that novices perform almost as well as experts in a subsequent code quiz.

AB Neural language models are a critical component of state-of-the-art systems for machine translation, summarization, audio transcription, and other tasks. These language models are almost universally autoregressive in nature, generating sentences one token at a time from left to right. This paper studies the influence of token generation order on model quality via a novel two-pass language model that produces partially-filled sentence "templates" and then fills in missing tokens. We compare various strategies for structuring these two passes and observe a surprisingly large variation in model quality. We find the most effective strategy generates function words in the first pass followed by content words in the second. We believe these experimental results justify a more extensive investigation of generation order for neural language models.

AB Recent work has shown that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can implicitly capture and exploit hierarchical information when trained to solve common natural language processing tasks (Blevins et al., 2018) such as language modeling (Linzen et al., 2016; Gulordava et al., 2018) and neural machine translation (Shi et al., 2016). In contrast, the ability to model structured data with non-recurrent neural networks has received little attention despite their success in many NLP tasks (Gehring et al., 2017; Vaswani et al., 2017). In this work, we compare the two architectures-recurrent versus non-recurrent-with respect to their ability to model hierarchical structure and find that recurrency is indeed important for this purpose.

AB In recent times, topic modeling approaches for adaptive language modeling have been extensively explored for Natural Language Processing applications such as machine translation, speech recognition etc. Language model is extremely fragile in adapting towards the required domain, so it needs to be channeled towards an area or a topic for producing optimal results. This paves the need to investigate various topic modeling approaches which are used to infer knowledge from a large corpora. In this paper, we mileage various topic modeling techniques which include Latent Semantic Indexing, Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Hierarchical Dirichlet Process. In this process, the baseline language model is dynamically adapted to different topics and the results are analyzed for these three topic modeling approaches.

AB MapReduce query processing systems translate a query statement into a query plan, consisting of a set of MapReduce jobs to be executed in distributed machines. During query translation, these query systems uniformly allocate computing resources to each job by delegating the same tuning to the entire query plan. However, jobs may implement their own collection of operators, which lead to different usage of computing resources. In this paper we propose an adaptive tuning mechanism that enables setting specific resources to each job within a query plan. Our adaptive mechanism relies on a data structure that maps jobs to tuning codes by analyzing source code and log files. This adaptive mechanism allows delegating specific resources to the query plan at runtime as the data structure hosts specific pre-computed tuning codes.

AB Recent work on the transfer of semantic information across languages has been recently applied to the development of resources annotated with Frame information for different non-English European languages. These works are based on the assumption that parallel corpora annotated for English can be used to transfer the semantic information to the other target languages. In this paper, a robust method based on a statistical machine translation step augmented with simple rule-based post-processing is presented. It alleviates problems related to preprocessing errors and the complex optimization required by syntax-dependent models of the cross-lingual mapping. Different alignment strategies are here investigated against the Europarl corpus. Results suggest that the quality of the derived annotations is surprisingly good and well suited for training semantic role labeling systems.

AB Applying Model Driven Architecture (MDA) concept is very complex because of large number of problems arising from the nature of tools to automate the translation of platform independent models (PIM) in a model dependent on the platform (PSM). This paper proposes how to overcome the above mentioned problems by designing and implementing an environment that would be able to execute a model independent of platform, rather than transforming it. The proposed design involves intensive use of the OCL language and formal specifications in the execution environment, the interception of OCL statements contained in the annotated classes and the implementation of state machines that implement the application. At the end of the paper, the strategic computer game TexasHoldem which implemented the proposed approach is given as an example.

AB In view of the successful application of planar parallelogram in the Delta robot and its variants, we are interested to investigate mechanisms consisting of spatial parallelograms. The spatial parallelogram, denoted by P-a*, is a 2-SS (S stands for a spherical joint) parallel mechanism having identical length for opposite links. We show that a 3-PPa* mechanism is generically undergoes 3-dimensional purely translational motion. Based on the 3-PPa* topology, an integrated optimal design on both architecture and geometry design is carried out. Using the formulation of maximizing effective cubic workspace, the Orthopod, which has three orthogonally arranged linear joint axes, is found to be the best in our settings. A prototype machine of the Orthopod is thus designed and manufactured.

TI Early estimation model for 3D-discrete indian sign language recognition
   using graph matching
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Machine translation of sign language is a critical task of computer vision. In this work, we propose to use 3D motion capture technology for sign capture and graph matching for sign recognition. Two problems related to 3D sign matching are addressed in this work: (1) how to identify same signs with different number of motion frames and (2) sign extraction from a clutter of non-sign hand motions. These two problems make the 2D or 3D sign language machine translation a challenging task. We propose graph matching with early estimation model to address these problems in two phases. The first phase consists of intra graph matching for motion frame extraction, which retains motion intensive frames in database and query 3D videos. The second phase applies inter graph matching with early estimation model on motion extracted query and dataset 3D videos. The proposed model increases the speed of the graph matching algorithm in estimating a sign with fewer frames. To test the graph matching model, we recorded 350 words of Indian sign language with 3D motion capture technology. For testing 4 variations per sign are captured for all signs with 5 different signers at same, slower, faster hand speeds and sign mixed cluttered hand motions. The early estimation graph matching model is tested for accuracy and efficiency in classifying 3D signs with the two induced real time constraints. In addition to 3D sign language dataset, the proposed method is validated on five benchmark datasets and against the state-of-the-art graph matching methods. (c) 2018 The Authors.

TI Learning policy scheduling for text augmentation
SO NEURAL NETWORKS
AB When training deep learning models, data augmentation is an important technique to improve the performance and alleviate overfitting. In natural language processing (NLP), existing augmentation methods often use fixed strategies. However, it might be preferred to use different augmentation policies in different stage of training, and different datasets may require different augmentation policies. In this paper, we take dynamic policy scheduling into consideration. We design a search space over augmentation policies by integrating several common augmentation operations. Then, we adopt a population based training method to search the best augmentation schedule. We conduct extensive experiments on five text classification and two machine translation tasks. The results show that the optimized dynamic augmentation schedules achieve significant improvements against previous methods. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Leveraging Pre-trained Checkpoints for Sequence Generation Tasks
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Unsupervised pre-training of large neural models has recently revolutionized Natural Language Processing. By warm-starting from the publicly released checkpoints, NLP practitioners have pushed the state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks while saving significant amounts of compute time. So far the focus has been mainly on the Natural Language Understanding tasks. In this paper, we demonstrate the efficacy of pre-trained checkpoints for Sequence Generation. We developed a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model that is compatible with publicly available pre-trained BERT, GPT-2, and RoBERTa checkpoints and conducted an extensive empirical study on the utility of initializing our model, both encoder and decoder, with these checkpoints. Our models result in new state-of-the-art results on Machine Translation, Text Summarization, Sentence Splitting, and Sentence Fusion.

TI Quantum teleportation through time-shifted AdS wormholes
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Based on the work of Gao-Jafferis-Wall and Maldacena-Stanford-Yang, we observe that the time-shifted thermofield states of two entangled CFTs can be made traversable by an appropriate coupling of the two CFTs, or alternatively by the application of a modified quantum teleportation protocol. This provides evidence for the smoothness of the horizon for a large class of entangled states related to the thermofield by time-translations. The smoothness of these states has some relevance for the firewall paradox and the proposal that some observables in quantum gravity may be state-dependent. We notice that quantum teleportation through these entangled states could be used in a laboratory setup to implement a "time-machine", which allows the observer to travel far in the future.

The mobility study and inverse kinematic analysis are conducted, and a CAD model is presented showing the design features. The optimization techniques based on artificial intelligence approaches are investigated to improve the system stiffness of the proposed 3-DOF parallel manipulator. Genetic algorithms and artificial neural networks are implemented as the intelligent optimization methods for the stiffness synthesis. The mean value and the standard deviation of the global stiffness distribution are proposed as the design indices. Both the single objective and multi-objective optimization issues are addressed. The effectiveness of this methodology is validated with Matlab.

TI Mechanical processes in biochemistry
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Mechanical processes are involved in nearly every facet of the cell cycle. Mechanical forces are generated in the cell during processes as diverse as chromosomal segregation, replication, transcription, translation, translocation of proteins across membranes, cell locomotion, and catalyzed protein and nucleic acid folding and unfolding, among others. Because force is a product of all these reactions, biochemists are beginning to directly apply external forces to these processes to alter the extent or even the fate of these reactions hoping to reveal their underlying molecular mechanisms. This review provides the conceptual framework to understand the role of mechanical force in biochemistry.

AB Current solutions for balancing load among Internet servers are based on the use of network address translation (NAT) and virtual Internet protocol (IP) addresses. In this work, we describe the design and implementation of an intelligent load-management prototype that is not based on the traditional approaches mentioned above, but can be efficiently built into existing high-end switch offerings from Lucent Technologies, such as the Cajun(TM) P550(TM) Gigabit Routing Switch. The key features of this prototype are (1) IP packets are not modified in any way-only Ethernet addresses are manipulated; (2) each machine that is a member of a server farm uses a shared IP address, in addition to unique IP addresses; and (3) a sophisticated tunable algorithm is used to select a server for the next incoming request.

AB Semantic similarity is an area of Natural Language Processing that is useful for several downstream applications, such as machine translation, natural language generation, information retrieval, or question answering. The task consists in assessing the extent to which two sentences express or do not express the same meaning. To do so, corpora with graded pairs of sentences are required. The grade is positioned on a given scale, usually going from 0 (completely unrelated) to 5 (equivalent semantics). In this work, we introduce such a corpus for French, the first that we know of. It is comprised of 1,010 sentence pairs with grades from five annotators. We describe the annotation process, analyse these data, and perform a few experiments for the automatic grading of semantic similarity.

AB Hearing impaired people uses signs to communicate with others. Just like verbally spoken languages, there is no universal language as every country has its own spoken language so every country has their own dialect of sign language and in India they uses Indian Sign Language (ISL). In the last few years, researchers take interest in the automation of ISL. Some attempts have been made in India and other countries. In this study we try to explore and analyze the work have been made with automation of sign language and gesture recognition. We tried to explore the challenges comes in the real time sign recognition system. This review also includes the progress of standard corpus creation of the ISL.

The structure of geometric and dynamic constraints of reference tasks is analyzed using screw theory. End-effector and the reference frame are elastically coupled by virtual screw springs, which slides along the reference sequences. An allowable motion screw set is constructed, from which the desired spatial compliance and stiffness matrices are synthesized from an allowable motion screw set. The presented virtual fixture are implemented dynamic contour tracking experiment, the effects of control parameters on system performance are also analyzed. The proposed virtual fixtures unites rotation and translation motions, and filter out task-unrelated components from the manual input while augmenting task-related components.

AB In this paper, we present a systems approach for channel modeling of an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system. This can have implications in improving speech recognition components, such as through discriminative language modeling. We simulate the ASR corruption using a phrase-based machine translation system trained between the reference phoneme and output phoneme sequences of a real ASR. We demonstrate that local optimization on the quality of phoneme-to-phoneme mappings does not directly translate to overall improvement of the entire model. However, we are still able to capitalize on contextual information of the phonemes which a simple acoustic distance model is not able to accomplish. Hence we show that the use of longer context results in a significantly improved model of the ASR channel.

With natural language watermarking, we mean embedding the watermark into a text document, using the natural language components as the carrier, in such a way that the modifications are imperceptible to the readers and the embedded information is robust against possible attacks. Of particular interest is using the structure of the sentences in natural language text in order to insert the watermark. We evaluated the quality of the watermarked text using an objective evaluation metric, the BLEU score. BLEU scoring is commonly used in the statistical machine translation community. Our current system prototype achieves 0.45 BLEU score on a scale [0,1].

TI Colorless green ideas do sleep furiously: gradient acceptability and the
   nature of the grammar
SO LINGUISTIC REVIEW
AB In their recent paper, Lau, Clark, and Lappin explore the idea that the probability of the occurrence of word strings can form the basis of an adequate theory of grammar (Lau, Jey H., Alexander Clark & 15 Shalom Lappin. 2017. Grammaticality, acceptability, and probability: A prob-abilistic view of linguistic knowledge. Cognitive Science 41(5): 1201-1241). To make their case, they present the results of correlating the output of several probabilistic models trained solely on naturally occurring sentences with the gradient acceptability judgments that humans report for ungrammatical sentences derived from roundtrip machine translation errors. In this paper, we first explore the logic of the Lau et al. argument, both in terms of the choice of evaluation metric (gradient acceptability), and in the choice of test data set (machine translation errors on random sentences from a corpus). We then present our own series of studies intended to allow for a better comparison between LCL's models and existing grammatical theories. We evaluate two of LCL's probabilistic models (trigrams and recurrent neural network) against three data sets (taken from journal articles, a textbook, and Chomsky's famous colorless-green-ideas sentence), using three evaluation metrics (LCL's gradience metric, a categorical version of the metric, and the experimental-logic metric used in the syntax literature). Our results suggest there are very real, measurable cost-benefit tradeoffs inherent in LCL's models across the three evaluation metrics. The gain in explanation of gradience (between 13% and 31% of gradience) is offset by losses in the other two metrics: a 43%-49% loss in coverage based on a categorical metric of explaining acceptability, and a loss of 12%-35% in explaining experimentally-defined phenomena. This suggests that anyone wishing to pursue LCL's models as competitors with existing syntactic theories must either be satisfied with this tradeoff, or modify the models to capture the phenomena that are not currently captured.

AB Orthogonality constraints encourage matrices to be orthogonal for numerical stability. These plug-and-play constraints, which can be conveniently incorporated into model training, have been studied for popular architectures in natural language processing, such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. However, a dedicated study on such constraints for transformers has been absent. To fill this gap, this paper studies orthogonality constraints for transformers, showing the effectiveness with empirical evidence from ten machine translation tasks and two dialogue generation tasks. For example, on the large-scale WMT'16 En -> De benchmark, simply plugging-and-playing orthogonality constraints on the original transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) increases the BLEU from 28.4 to 29.6, coming close to the 29.7 BLEU achieved by the very competitive dynamic convolution (Wu et al., 2019).

AB This paper presents the systems developed by Beijing Jiaotong University for the CCMT 2020 quality estimation task. In this paper, we propose an effective method to utilize pretrained language models to improve the performance of QE. Our model combines three popular pretrained models, which are Bert, XLM and XLM-R, to create a very strong baseline for both sentence-level and word-level QE. We tried different strategies, including further pretraining for bilingual input, multi-task learning for multi-granularities and weighted loss for unbalanced word labels. To generate more accurate prediction, we performed model ensemble for both granularities. Experiment results show high accuracy on both directions, and outperform the winning system of last year on sentence level, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method.

AB Ensuring correctness of smart contracts is paramount to ensuring trust in blockchain-based systems. This paper studies the safety and security of smart contracts in the Azure Blockchain Workbench, an enterprise Blockchain-as-a-Service offering from Microsoft. In particular, we formalize semantic conformance of smart contracts against a state machine workflow with access-control policy and propose an approach to reducing semantic conformance checking to safety verification using program instrumentation. We develop a new Solidity program verifier VERISOL that is based on translation to Boogie, and have applied it to analyze all application contracts shipped with the Azure Blockchain Workbench and found previously unknown bugs in these published smart contracts. After fixing these bugs, VERISOL was able to successfully perform full verification for all of these contracts.

AB Collocation Extraction plays an important role in machine translation, information retrieval, secondary language learning, etc., and has obtained significant achievements in other languages, e.g. English and Chinese. There are some studies for Arabic collocation extraction using POS annotation to extract Arabic collocation. We used a hybrid method that included POS patterns and syntactic dependency relations as linguistics information and statistical methods for extracting the collocation from Arabic corpus. The experiment results showed that using this hybrid method for extracting Arabic words can guarantee a higher precision rate, which heightens even more after dependency relations are added as linguistic rules for filtering, having achieved 85.11%. This method also achieved a higher precision rate rather than only resorting to syntactic dependency analysis as a collocation extraction method.

AB The translation of brain activity into user command, through Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), is a very active topic in machine learning and signal processing. As commercial applications and out-of-the-lab solutions are proposed, there is an increased pressure to provide online algorithms and real-time implementations. Electroencephalography (EEG) systems offer lightweight and wearable solutions, at the expense of signal quality. Approaches based on covariance matrices have demonstrated good robustness to noise and provide a suitable representation for classification tasks, relying on advances in Riemannian geometry. We propose to equip the minimum distance to mean (MDM) classifier with a new family of means, based on the inductive mean, for block-online classification tasks and to embed the inductive mean in an incremental learning algorithm for online classification of EEG.

AB Traditionally, imperative programming uses a series of state-based operands to model control-flow and, as a result, suffers from the well-known von Neumann bottleneck. In contrast, dataflow programs are driven only by the availability of instruction operands. However, the lack of mainstream dataflow hardware hinders direct dataflow instruction execution. On the other hand, direct execution of dataflow programs on von Neumann machines incurs a high performance cost. In this paper, we present preliminary results on the direct execution of dataflow programs on multicore systems through emulation of tagged-tokens mechanism. Compared with direct translation of SISAL programs to C code, we achieved a speedup of 44 for CPU-intensive applications and 22 for memory-bounded applications on a 48-cores AMD NUMA system.

AB Automatic Domain Term Extraction (ADTE) has an important significance in natural language processing, and it is widely applied in information retrieval, information extraction, data mining, machine translation and other information processing fields. In this paper, an automatic domain term extraction method is proposed based on condition random fields (CRF). We treat domain terms extraction as a sequence labeling problem, and terms' distribution characteristics as features of the CRF model. Then we used the CRF tool to train a template for the term extraction. Experimental results showed that the method is simple, with common domains, and good results were achieved. In the open test, the precision rate achieved was 73.24 %, recall rate was 69.57%, and F-measure was 71.36%.

AB Ubiquitous computing environments accrete slowly over time rather than. springing into existence all at once. Mechanisms are needed for incremental integration-the problem of how to incrementally add or modify behaviors in existing ubicomp environments. Examples include adding new input modalities and choreographing the behavior of existing independent applications. The iROS Event Heap, via its publish-subscribe coordination mechanism. provides the foundation for interoperation through event intermediation, but does not directly provide facilities for expressing these intermediations. The Patch Panel provides a general facility for retargeting event flow. Intermediations can be expressed as simple event translation mappings or as more complex finite-state machines. We describe an implemented prototype of the Patch Panel, including examples of its use drawn from real life applications in production use in the iRoom ubiquitous computing environment.

AB Virtualization is a key technique for supporting cloud services and memory virtualization is a major component of virtualization technology. Common memory virtualization mechanisms include shadow paging and hardware-assisted paging. The shadow paging model needs to synchronize shadow/guest page tables whenever there is a guest page table update. In the design of traditional shadow paging (TSP), the guest page table pages are write-protected so the updates can be intercepted by the hypervisor to ensure synchronization. Frequent page table updates cause lots of VM_Exits. Researchers have developed hardware-assisted paging to eliminate this overhead. However, address translation needs to walk a two-dimensional page table. This design significantly increases the overhead of page walk. This paper proposes SSP, a Swift Shadow Paging model which leverages the privileged hardware mode. In this design, the write protection mechanism is no longer needed. Rather, SSP accomplishes lazy page table synchronization by intercepting TLB flushing, which must be initiated by the guest OS when there is a page table update. The hardware mode, such as RISC-V's machine mode and Sunway's hardware mode, with the highest privilege, opens a new door for communication between the host OS and a guest OS. In addition, by using a shadow page table base address buffer, SSP eliminates the VM_Exits generated by guest process context switching. SSP inherits the advantage of TSP as it remains as a software-only solution and does not incur the excessive overhead of page walk when compared to hardware-assisted paging. We implement SSP in a Sunway machine. Our evaluation demonstrates SSP's advantage for multiple workloads. Compared with TSP, SSP reduces VM_Exits caused by memory virtualization by 23%-56%. And the virtualization overhead of SSP is less than 5.5% for all workloads.

AB Automatic summarization captures the most relevant information and condenses it into an understandable text in natural language. Such a task can be classified as either extractive or abstractive summarization. Research on Brazilian Portuguese-based abstractive summarization is still scarce. This work explores abstractive summarization in Portuguese-based texts using a deep learning-based approach. The results are relatively satisfactory considering the ROUGE measurements and the quality of the generated summaries. Still, there are some problems regarding coherence, readability, and grammar. We strongly believe they are linked to the inherent complexity of generating an abstract and the degradation of text quality by the translation steps. These results should be seen as preliminary, serving as a basis for future research.

TI Template Based Affix Stemmer for a Morphologically Rich Language
SO INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Word stemming is one of the most significant factors that affect the performance of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) application such as Information Retrieval (IR) system, part of speech tagging, machine translation system and syntactic parsing. Urdu language raises several challenges to NLP largely due to its rich morphology. In Urdu language, stemming process is different as compared to that for other languages, as it not only depends on removing prefixes and suffixes but also on removing infixes. In this paper, we introduce a template based stemmer that eliminates all kinds of affixes i.e., prefixes, infixes and suffixes, depending on the morphological pattern of the word. The presented results are excellent and this stemmer can prove to be very affective for a morphologically rich language.

AB The rapid development of such natural language processing tasks as style transfer, paraphrase, and machine translation often calls for the use of semantic similarity metrics. In recent years a lot of methods to measure the semantic similarity of two short texts were developed. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis for more than a dozen of such methods. Using a new dataset of fourteen thousand sentence pairs human-labeled according to their semantic similarity, we demonstrate that none of the metrics widely used in the literature is close enough to human judgment in these tasks. A number of recently proposed metrics provide comparable results, yet Word Mover Distance is shown to be the most reasonable solution to measure semantic similarity in reformulated texts at the moment.

AB In this paper we continue the line of work where neural machine translation training is used to produce joint cross-lingual fixed-dimensional sentence embeddings. In this framework we introduce a simple method of adding a loss to the learning objective which penalizes distance between representations of bilingually aligned sentences. We evaluate cross-lingual transfer using two approaches, cross-lingual similarity search on an aligned corpus (Europarl) and cross-lingual document classification on a recently published benchmark Reuters corpus, and we find the similarity loss significantly improves performance on both. Our cross-lingual transfer performance is competitive with state-of-the-art, even while there is potential to further improve by investing in a better in-language baseline. Our results are based on a set of 6 European languages.

In addition, growing evidence suggests that RPs can function in other cellular roles. In the present review, we summarize several potential extra-ribosomal functions of RPs in ribosomal biogenesis, transcription activity, translation process, DNA repair, replicative life span, adhesive growth, and morphological transformation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the future in-depth studies are needed to identify these novel secondary functions of RPs in S. cerevisiae. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

TI A Machine Learning Platform to Optimize the Translation of Personalized
   Network Models to the Clinic
SO JCO CLINICAL CANCER INFORMATICS
AB PURPOSE Dynamic network models predict clinical prognosis and inform therapeutic intervention by elucidating disease-driven aberrations at the systems level. However, the personalization of model predictions requires the profiling of multiple model inputs, which hampers clinical translation.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS We applied APOPTO-CELL, a prognostic model of a poptosis signaling, to showcase the establishment of computational platforms that require a reduced set of inputs. We designed two distinct and complementary pipelines: a probabilistic approach to exploit a consistent subpanel of inputs across the whole cohort (Ensemble) and a machine learning approach to identify a reduced protein set tailored for individual patients (Tree). Development was performed on a virtual cohort of 3,200,000 patients, with inputs estimated from clinically relevant protein profiles. Validation was carried out in an in-house stage III colorectal cancer cohort, with inputs profiled in surgical resections by reverse phase protein array (n = 120) and/or immuno-histochemistry (n = 117).
   RESULT Ensemble and Tree reproduced APOPTO-CELL predictions in the virtual patient cohort with 92% and 99% accuracy while decreasing the number of inputs to a consistent subset of three proteins (40% reduction) or a personalized subset of 2.7 proteins on average (46% reduction), respectively. Ensemble and Tree retained prognostic utility in the in-house colorectal cancer cohort. The association between the Ensemble accuracy and prognostic value (Spearman rho = 0.43; P= .02) provided a rationale to optimize the input composition for specific clinical settings. Comparison between profiling by reverse phase protein array (gold standard) and immuno-histochemistry (clinical routine) revealed that the latter is a suitable technology to quantify model inputs.
   CONCLUSION This study provides a generalizable framework to optimize the development of network-based prognostic assays and, ultimately, to facilitate their integration in the routine clinical workflow. (C) 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology

TI Detection of iron deficiency anemia by medical images: a comparative
   study of machine learning algorithms
SO BIODATA MINING
AB BackgroundAnemia is one of the global public health problems that affect children and pregnant women. Anemia occurs when the level of red blood cells within the body decreases or when the structure of the red blood cells is destroyed or when the Hb level in the red blood cell is below the normal threshold, which results from one or more increased red cell destructions, blood loss, defective cell production or a depleted sum of Red Blood Cells.MethodsThe method used in this study is divided into three phases: the datasets were gathered, which is the palm, pre-processed the image, which comprised; Extracted images, and augmented images, segmented the Region of Interest of the images and acquired their various components of the CIE L*a*b* colour space (also referred to as the CIELAB), and finally developed the proposed models for the detection of anemia using the various algorithms, which include CNN, k-NN, Nave Bayes, SVM, and Decision Tree. The experiment utilized 527 initial datasets, rotation, flipping and translation were utilized and augmented the dataset to 2635. We randomly divided the augmented dataset into 70%, 10%, and 20% and trained, validated and tested the models respectively.ResultsThe results of the study justify that the models performed appropriately when the palm is used to detect anemia, with the Naive Bayes achieving a 99.96% accuracy while the SVM achieved the lowest accuracy of 96.34%, as the CNN also performed better with an accuracy of 99.92% in detecting anemia.ConclusionsThe invasive method of detecting anemia is expensive and time-consuming; however, anemia can be detected through the use of non-invasive methods such as machine learning algorithms which is efficient, cost-effective and takes less time. In this work, we compared machine learning models such as CNN, k-NN, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and SVM to detect anemia using images of the palm. Finally, the study supports other similar studies on the potency of the Machine Learning Algorithm as a non-invasive method in detecting iron deficiency anemia.

AB We introduce Texar, an open-source toolkit aiming to support the broad set of text generation tasks. Different from many existing toolkits that are specialized for specific applications (e.g., neural machine translation), Texar is designed to be highly flexible and versatile. This is achieved by abstracting the common patterns underlying the diverse tasks and methodologies, creating a library of highly reusable modules and functionalities, and enabling arbitrary model architectures and various algorithmic paradigms. The features make Texar particularly suitable for technique sharing and generalization across different text generation applications. The toolkit emphasizes heavily on extensibility and modularized system design, so that components can be freely plugged in or swapped out. We conduct extensive experiments and case studies to demonstrate the use and advantage of the toolkit.

AB In this paper we propose a method for person identification. The proposed method is invariant to illumination, scale, pose, camera exposure and translation of the head. In order to make the model illumination invariant, a linear transfonn is applied. Binary aftine features are used to extract facial features from each image. The facial features obtained are compressed to form a vector which is then passed to a Bayesian classifier. This method was tested on three benchmark datasets to show as to how the method overcomes of all the hurdles such as variation of illumination, change of scale, motion of head, change in expression and more. The error rate obtained is in the neighbourhood of 18%. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

SO JOURNAL OF LOGIC AND ALGEBRAIC PROGRAMMING
AB This paper discusses a case study in formal verification and development of secure smart card applications. An elementary Java Card electronic purse applet is presented whose specification can be simply formulated as "in normal operation, the applet's balance field can only be decreased, never increased". The applet features a challenge-response mechanism which allows legitimate terminals to increase the balance by putting the applet into a special operation mode. A systematic approach is used to guarantee a secure flow of control within the applet: appropriate transition properties are first formalized as a finite state machine, then incorporated in the specification, and finally formally verified using the Loop translation tool and the PVS theorem prover.

AB Spelling normalisation is a useful step in the study and analysis of historical language texts, whether it is manual analysis by experts or automatic analysis using downstream natural language processing (NLP) tools. Not only does it help to homogenise the variable spelling that often exists in historical texts, but it also facilitates the use of off-the-shelf contemporary NLP tools, if contemporary spelling conventions are used for normalisation. We present FREEMnorm, a new benchmark for the normalisation of Early Modern French (from the 17th century) into contemporary French and provide a thorough comparison of three different normalisation methods: ABA, an alignment-based approach and MT-approaches, (both statistical and neural), including extensive parameter searching, which is often missing in the normalisation literature.

AB This paper analyses how much context span is necessary to solve different context-related issues, namely, reference, ellipsis, gender, number, lexical ambiguity, and terminology when translating from English into Portuguese. We use the DELA corpus, which consists of 60 documents and six different domains (subtitles, literary, news, reviews, medical, and legislation). We find that the shortest context span to disambiguate issues can appear in different positions in the document including preceding, following, global, world knowledge; and that the average length depends on the issue types as well as the domain. Additionally, we show that the standard approach of relying on only two preceding sentences as context might not be enough depending on the domain and issue types.

AB Semantic textual similarity detection is one of the research field in Natural Language Processing. The proposed solutions for this problem have different application areas such as machine translation, semantic relatedness at sentence level, paraphrase detection or question-type classification. In this work, an application was proposed that applies Fisher encoding with using one of the distributed word representation method named as Word2Vec to find semantically similar sentences. This method was tested with a large test set of sentences to find similar sentences. The results show that the proposed method provides an effective solution to sentence similarity problem. In addition to this, it was aimed to be able to make benchmark tests for new methods by sharing Turkish corpus which is rich in text diversity.

AB Recurrent neural network models with an attention mechanism have proven to be extremely effective on a wide variety of sequence-to-sequence problems. However, the fact that soft attention mechanisms perform a pass over the entire input sequence when producing each element in the output sequence precludes their use in online settings and results in a quadratic time complexity. Based on the insight that the alignment between input and output sequence elements is monotonic in many problems of interest, we propose an end-to-end differentiable method for learning monotonic alignments which, at test time, enables computing attention online and in linear time. We validate our approach on sentence summarization, machine translation, and online speech recognition problems and achieve results competitive with existing sequence-to-sequence models.

AB Dalvik VM is the core part of the Android platform, its performance determines the overall performance of Android. Executing code is done by interpreter. And in order to improve its efficiency, JIT compiler is supported in Dalvik VM, a technique also know as dynamic translation which is an effective method to improve the runtime performance. After analyzing the overall framework of Dalvik JIT, we propose a optimizing strategy to eliminate redundant compilation. Then we test the performance of Dalvik JIT before and after optimization, and under its different mode, using test cases such as benchmark like Linpack and Scimark2, etc. The results of tests show that program execution efficiency is higher and its performance is improved after eliminate redundant compiled.

TI A LINGUA FRANCA FOR CONCURRENT LOGIC PROGRAMMING
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
AB Two of the more important concurrent logic programming languages with nonflat guards are GHC and Parlog. They balance the requirements of having clean semantics and providing good control facilities rather differently, and their respective merits are compared and contrasted. Since concurrent logic programming would benefit from both, but neither language is able to express all the programs expressible in the other language, a lingua franca of these languages is defined and justified. A method is given for translating GHC and Parlog to and from it. The method preserves the arities and execution conditions of each clause. It enables a lingua franca implementation to support both languages transparently, and to provide a simple concurrent logic programming language suitable for programming in its own right.

Several ongoing international research projects are described which take on this challenge aiming at providing proofs of principle for the feasibility of this approach. This advance is supported by successes in the application of computational approaches, such as machine learning in clinical diagnostics and treatment.

AB Despite the impressive progress of artificial intelligence, performance of many systems has shown severe bias, horrible discrimination, and fatal errors. These immoral flaws have triggered philosophers, roboticists, futurists who have flooded the community with a proliferation of ethical principles for disciplining these systems. Regardless of the ambiguity and lack of consensus on these principles, the missing block is the translation of suggested normative principles into best practices, measures, regulations, policies, and research agenda. The first objective of this study is to introduce this emerging landscape of ethics to the information system community. The second objective is to reshuffle suggested principles, summarize them, and reproduce them in a form of ten grand research challenges and subfields that may guide future endeavors.

AB A flash translation layer (FTL) of NAND flash-based storage occasionally conducts a garbage collection causing long-wait situations to a host system. To avert that long latency, the host system using a black-box model has chased the storage performance. On the other hand, other storage systems have required expensive storage hardware or depended on idle timing. This paper proposes an FTL-aware host system extracting the FTL metadata from the storage during runtime to overcome these constraints. Furthermore, this novel host system predicts the garbage collection and directs the storage to lower the long latency in advance. The experiment results show the alleviation of the long latency against the legacy host system.

AB Code switching is a prevalent phenomenon in the multilingual community and social media interaction. In the past ten years, we have witnessed an explosion of code switched data in the social media that brings together languages from low resourced languages to high resourced languages in the same text, sometimes written in a non-native script. This increases the demand for processing code-switched data to assist users in various natural language processing tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, conversational systems, and machine translation, etc. The available corpora for code switching research played a major role in advancing this area of research. In this paper, we propose a set of quality metrics to evaluate the dataset and categorize them accordingly.

TI Molecular Transformer unifies reaction prediction and retrosynthesis
   across pharma chemical space
SO CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB Predicting how a complex molecule reacts with different reagents, and how to synthesise complex molecules from simpler starting materials, are fundamental to organic chemistry. We show that an attention-based machine translation model - Molecular Transformer - tackles both reaction prediction and retrosynthesis by learning from the same dataset. Reagents, reactants and products are represented as SMILES text strings. For reaction prediction, the model "translates" the SMILES of reactants and reagents to product SMILES, and the converse for retrosynthesis. Moreover, a model trained on publicly available data is able to make accurate predictions on proprietary molecules extracted from pharma electronic lab notebooks, demonstrating generalisability across chemical space. We expect our versatile framework to be broadly applicable to problems such as reaction condition prediction, reagent prediction and yield prediction.

AB In this paper we present an English-German Automatic Post-Editing (APE) system called transference, submitted to the APE Task organized at WMT 2019. Our transference model is based on a multi-encoder transformer architecture. Unlike previous approaches, it (i) uses a transformer encoder block for src, (ii) followed by a transformer decoder block, but without masking, for self-attention on mt, which effectively acts as second encoder combining src -> mt, and (iii) feeds this representation into a final decoder block generating pe. This model improves over the raw black-box neural machine translation system by 0.9 and 1.0 absolute BLEU points on the WMT 2019 APE development and test set. Our submission ranked 3rd, however compared to the two top systems, performance differences are not statistically significant.

AB Arabic WordNet (AWN) is a lexical database, freely available, and useful resource to Natural Language Processing (NLP) research and applications (Information Retrieval, Machine Translation...). This project is built following the methods developed for Princeton WordNet (PWN) and EuroWordNet (EWN). However, this database needs more intention to improve NLP applications. Compared with others wordnets, AWN has a very poor content in both, quantity and quality levels. This paper concentrate on the quality plan, especially on the antonym relations. Therefore, the authors propose a pattern-based approach to extend these relations, using Arabic Corpus and a corpus analysis tool. This proposed method relies on two steps: patterns definition and automatic antonym pair extraction. The evaluation of this approach has given good results.

A combination of process mining techniques and business process ontologies is evaluated on simulated data in order to identify the auditing/monitoring capability of PROM plug-in's. The initial evaluation revealed that rule based audit is successful on machine-crafted data in PROM tool. Moreover, this paper also highlights lack of automated rule translation in LTL-checker (PROM plug-in) for smart audit framework's evaluations.

We evaluate our approach by applying morpheme segmentation to the training data of a statistical machine translation (SMT) system. Experiments show that our approach is less sensitive to the availability of annotated stems than a previous rule-based approach and learns 12% more segmentations on our Iraqi Arabic data. When applied in an SMT system, our approach yields a 8% relative reduction in the training vocabulary size and a 0.8% relative reduction in the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate on the test set, again as compared to the rule-based approach. Finally, our approach also results in a modest increase in BLEU scores.

TI AN OPERATIONAL SYSTEM FOR SUBJECT SWITCHING BETWEEN CONTROLLED
   VOCABULARIES
SO INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT
AB The NASA system of automatically converting sets of terms assigned by Department of Defense indexers to sets of NASA's authorized terms is described. This little-touted system, which has been operating successfully since 1983, matches concepts, rather than words. Subject Switching uses a translation table, known as the Lexical Dictionary, accessed by a program that determines which rules to follow in making the transition from DTIC's to NASA's authorized terms. The authors describe the four phases of development of Subject Switching, changes that have been made, evaluating the system, and benefits. Benefits to NASA include saving indexers' time, the addition of access points for documents indexed, the utilization of other government indexing, and a contribution towards the now-operational NASA, online, interactive, machine aided indexing.

AB Named Entity Recognition or NER is one of the sub-research field of Information Extraction which can be used for machine translation, question answering, semantic web, etc. One of the biggest challenge of NER is the adversity to construct a manually labeled training data. In this work, we present a semi-supervised approach for Indonesian language NER which is capable of creating high quality training data automatically. Semi-supervised approach works by utilizing unlabeled data made from Wikipedia and DBPedia to form high accuracy and non-redundant additional training data for each iteration of semi-supervised process. We show that our system manages to generate new training data and gain an increasing F1 score as the iteration of semi-supervised process goes.

TI The Compreno Semantic Model: The Universality Problem
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LEXICOGRAPHY
AB This paper is devoted to the Compreno multilingual lexical database - an integral model of natural language description designed for the semantic analysis of texts and the various tasks based on such an analysis, for example machine translation or fact extraction. Semantic data is stored in the form of the universal semantic hierarchy, which is currently filled with English, Russian, and, partly, French, German and Chinese contents. The description of each word meaning includes its positioning in the semantic hierarchy, definition, all the necessary semantic and grammatical information, collocations, and all possible semantic links for the word, both actant and circumstantial.
   The paper gives a detailed description of the Compreno semantic pattern and focuses especially on the universality problem, namely, on the difficulties that arise when creating a semantic model appropriate for processing different languages.

AB Cross-machine fibre orientation and basis weight profiles depend on the headbox design and operation. The objective of this paper is to examine the relationship between the headbox flow characteristics and the fibre orientation by systematically analyzing different headbox flow control devices. To correlate the headbox flow characteristics to the measured fibre orientation, the computational fluid dynamics method was employed. The measured fibre orientation data were record and compared to computed results. The comparison indicated that the fibre orientation mimicked the computed flow angle, and both showed consistent response to the adjustments of headbox control devices. The present work also identified three basic transformation modes between the flow angle and the fibre orientation, namely translation, linear augmentation and rotation modes.

TI The dynamics and self-assembly of chemically self-propelled sphere
   dimers
SO NANOSCALE
AB The dynamics of chemically powered sphere dimers at the micro- and nano-scales confined in a quasi-two-dimensional geometry are investigated. The dimer consists of a Janus particle and a non-catalytic sphere. A chemical reaction taking place on the catalytic surface of the Janus particle creates asymmetric concentration gradients that give rise to the self-propulsion of both rotation and translation of the dimer. Due to the chemical interactions, ensembles of dimers spontaneously form anti-parallel aligned doublets that exhibit the same rotation direction and lose translational motion. The chirality of the dimer plays an important role in the process of doublet formation. The study displays new collective dynamics and structures when both translational and rotational self-propulsion occur.

TI A survey of automatic Arabic diacritization techniques
SO NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING
AB In Modern Standard Arabic texts are typically written without diacritical markings. The diacritics are important to clarify the sense and meaning of words. Lack of these markings may lead to ambiguity even for the natives. Often the natives successfully disambiguate the meaning through the context; however, many Arabic applications, such as machine translation, text-to-speech, and information retrieval, are vulnerable due to lack of diacritics. The process of automatically restoring diacritical marks is called diacritization or diacritic restoration. In this paper we discuss the properties of the Arabic language and the issues that are related to the lack of the diacritical marking. It will be followed by a survey of the recent algorithms that were developed to solve the diacritization problem. We also look into the future trend for researchers working in this area.

TI A Minimal Recursion Semantic Analysis of Locatives
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB The article describes a pilot implementation of a grammar containing different types of locative PPs. In particular, we investigate the distinction between static and directional locatives, and between different types of directional locatives. Locatives may act as modifiers as well as referring expressions depending on the syntactic context. We handle this with a single lexical entry. The implementation is of Norwegian locatives, but English locatives are both discussed and compared to Norwegian locatives. The semantic analysis is based on a proposal by Markus Kracht ( 2002), and we show how this analysis can be incorporated into Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) (Copestake et al. 2005). We discuss how the resulting system may be applied in a transfer-based machine translation system, and how we can map from a shallow MRS representation to a deeper semantic representation.

TI Insertion-based Decoding with Automatically Inferred Generation Order
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Conventional neural autoregressive decoding commonly assumes a fixed left-to-right generation order, which may be sub-optimal. In this work, wepropose a novel decoding algorithm-InDIGO-which supports flexible sequence generation in arbitrary orders through insertion operations. We extend Transformer, a state-of-the-art sequence generation model, to efficiently implement the proposed approach, enabling it to be trained with either a predefined generation order or adaptive orders obtained from beam-search. Experiments on four real-world tasks, including word order recovery, machine translation, image caption, and code generation, demonstrate that our algorithm can generate sequences following arbitrary orders, while achieving competitive or even better performance compared with the conventional left-to-right generation. The generated sequences show that InDIGO adopts adaptive generation orders based on input information.

AB Sentiment analysis has a range of corpora available across multiple languages. For emotion analysis, the situation is more limited, which hinders potential research on cross-lingual modeling and the development of predictive models for other languages. In this paper, we fill this gap for German by constructing deISEAR, a corpus designed in analogy to the well-established English ISEAR emotion dataset. Motivated by Scherer's appraisal theory, we implement a crowdsourcing experiment which consists of two steps. In step 1, participants create descriptions of emotional events for a given emotion. In step 2, five annotators assess the emotion expressed by the texts. We show that transferring an emotion classification model from the original English ISEAR to the German crowdsourced deISEAR via machine translation does not, on average, cause a performance drop.

AB In the model-centric approach to model-driven development, the models used are sufficiently detailed to be executed. Being able to execute the model directly, without any intermediate model-to-code translation, has a number of advantages. The model is always up-to-date and runtime updates of the model are possible. This paper presents a model interpreter for timed automata, a formalism often used for modeling and verification of real-time systems. The model interpreter supports real-time system features like simultaneous execution, system wide signals, a ticking clock, and time constraints. Many existing formal representations can be verified, and many existing DSMLs can be executed. It is the combination of being both verifiable and executable that makes our approach rather unique.

AB Vocabulary restrictions in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) systems mean that out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words are lost in the output. However, OOV words tend to be information rich terms (often named entities) and their omission from the transcript negatively affects both usability and downstream NLP technologies, such as machine translation or knowledge distillation. We propose a novel approach to OOV recovery that uses a spoken term detection (STD) framework. Given an identified OOV region in the LVCSR output, we recover the uttered OOVs by utilizing contextual information and the vast and constantly updated vocabulary on the Web. Discovered words are integrated into system output, recovering up to 40% of OOVs and resulting in a reduction in system error.

TI Confusion2Vec: towards enriching vector space word representations with
   representational ambiguities
SO PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Word vector representations are a crucial part of natural language processing (NLP) and human computer interaction. In this paper, we propose a novel word vector representation, Confusion2Vec, motivated from the human speech production and perception that encodes representational ambiguity. Humans employ both acoustic similarity cues and contextual cues to decode information and we focus on a model that incorporates both sources of information. The representational ambiguity of acoustics, which manifests itself in word confusions, is often resolved by both humans and machines through contextual cues. A range of representational ambiguities can emerge in various domains further to acoustic perception, such as morphological transformations, word segmentation, paraphrasing for NLP tasks like machine translation, etc. In this work, we present a case study in application to automatic speech recognition (ASR) task, where the word representational ambiguities/confusions are related to acoustic similarity. We present several techniques to train an acoustic perceptual similarity representation ambiguity. We term this Confusion2Vec and learn on unsupervised-generated data from ASR confusion networks or lattice-like structures. Appropriate evaluations for the Confusion2Vec are formulated for gauging acoustic similarity in addition to semantic-syntactic and word similarity evaluations. The Confusion2Vec is able to model word confusions efficiently, without compromising on the semantic-syntactic word relations, thus effectively enriching the word vector space with extra task relevant ambiguity information. We provide an intuitive exploration of the two-dimensional Confusion2Vec space using principal component analysis of the embedding and relate to semantic relationships, syntactic relationships, and acoustic relationships. We show through this that the new space preserves the semantic/syntactic relationships while robustly encoding acoustic similarities. The potential of the new vector representation and its ability in the utilization of uncertainty information associated with the lattice is demonstrated through small examples relating to the task of ASR error correction.

AB The growing usage of Network Address Translation (NAT) over the past couple of years has become a double-edged sword. On one hand, it provides an added measure of security for legitimate users. On the other hand, the anonymity provided by NAT could undoubtedly be leveraged by malicious actors. To this end, the objective of fingerprinting devices behind a NAT aims at properly comprehending the nature of such devices while aiding in proper network and security provisioning and characterization. While the problem scope is certainly not new, it has been evolving quite rapidly given the wide macroscopic and microscopic deployments of IoT devices, and have recently attracted significant attention from the research community. Throughout this paper, we revisit the task of classifying IoT devices deployed within a localized IoT realm. In contrast to the state-of-the-art, we explore the capabilities of unsupervised and semi-supervised shallow and deep learning methodologies in capturing the nature of such NATed devices. Initial results using empirical data indicate the failure of clustering methods in fingerprinting both IoT and non-IoT nodes behind a NAT. Further, and knowing that IoT devices typically possess relatively consistent traffic patterns, the results shed light on the unexpected capability of autoencoders in better capturing non-IoT devices (in contrast to IoT nodes) behind a NAT. In an effort to comprehend such results, we implement and evaluate an explainable mechanism that provides preliminary insights into this phenomena. Additionally, the developed semi-supervised Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) approach generated comparative results to the state-of-the-art, without relying on the stringent and adhoc process of features' engineering, with relatively very good algorithm complexity and scalability. Results from this work put forward interesting future work in the area of network traffic analysis of NATed IoT devices, while highlighting the need for addressing the notions of explainability and concept drift.

TI Utilizing Human-to-Human Conversation Examples for a Multi Domain
   Chat-Oriented Dialog System
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB This paper describes the design and evaluation of a method for developing a chat-oriented dialog system by utilizing real human-to-human conversation examples from movie scripts and Twitter conversations. The aim of the proposed method is to build a conversational agent that can interact with users in as natural a fashion as possible, while reducing the time requirement for database design and collection. A number of the challenging design issues we faced are described, including (1) constructing an appropriate dialog corpora from raw movie scripts and Twitter data, and (2) developing an multi domain chat-oriented dialog management system which can retrieve a proper system response based on the current user query. To build a dialog corpus, we propose a unit of conversation called a tri-turn (a trigram conversation turn), as well as extraction and semantic similarity analysis techniques to help ensure that the content extracted from raw movie/drama script files forms appropriate dialog-pair (query-response) examples. The constructed dialog corpora are then utilized in a data-driven dialog management system. Here, various approaches are investigated including example-based (EBDM) and response generation using phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT). In particular, we use two EBDM: syntactic-semantic similarity retrieval and TF-IDF based cosine similarity retrieval. Experiments are conducted to compare and contrast EBDM and SMT approaches in building a chat-oriented dialog system, and we investigate a combined method that addresses the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches. System performance was evaluated based on objective metrics (semantic similarity and cosine similarity) and human subjective evaluation from a small user study. Experimental results show that the proposed filtering approach effectively improve the performance. Furthermore, the results also show that by combing both EBDM and SMT approaches, we could overcome the shortcomings of each.

The Cordis SUITE is a low-code development platform that adopts the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to design complex machine-control applications. In this paper we introduce Cordis models and their semantics. To enable formal verification, we define an automatic translation of Cordis models to the process algebraic specification language mCRL2. As a proof of concept, we describe requirements of the control software of an industrial cylinder model developed by Cordis, and show how these can be verified using model checking. We show that our verification approach is effective to uncover subtle issues in the industrial model and its implementation.

AB Interactivity in language processing plays a pivotal role to allow models to better understand how to build the appropriate output. In the task of Natural Language to SQL, the fact of including the users' interactivity can be one of the practical solutions that haven't been studied deeply in the existing works published in the last decade. Using databases by users with limited familiarity in SQL will create an additional obstacle for these users to better exploit the content stored in the database systems. In this paper we present the already published studies and we discuss the utility of using the interactivity to definitely improve the query generation process in order to construct a model that generalize for unseen and complex sentences and to automatically generate the appropriate outputs.

AB Stylometry techniques such as authorship recognition, machine translation detection and pedophile identification are daily used in applications for the most widely used languages. But under-represented languages lack data sources usable for stylometry research. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to build corpora containing meta-information required for stylometry experiments (author information, publication time, document heading, document borders) and introduce our tool Authorship Corpora Builder (ACB). We modify crawling and data-cleaning techniques for purposes of stylometry field and add heuristic layer to detect and extract meta-information.
   The system was used on Czech and Slovak web domains to build a Slavonic corpus for stylometry research. Collected data have been published and we are planning to build collections for other languages and gradually extend existing ones.

AB The word level system combination, which is better than phrase level and sentence level, has emerged as a powerful post-processing method for statistical machine translation (SMT). This paper first give the definition of HyperGraph(HG) as a kind of compact data structure in SMT, and then introduce simple bracket transduction grammar(SBTG) for hypergraph decoding. To optimize the more feature weights, we introduce minimum risk (MR) with deterministic annealing (DA) into the training criterion, and compare two classic training procedures in experiment. The deoding approaches of n-gram model based on hypergraph are shown to be superior to conventional cube pruning in the setting of the Chinese-to-English track of the 2008 NIST Open MT evaluation.

AB We propose Bilingual Tree Kernels (BTKs) to capture the structural similarities across a pair of syntactic translational equivalences and apply BTKs to sub-tree alignment along with some plain features. Our study reveals that the structural features embedded in a bilingual parse tree pair are very effective for sub-tree alignment and the bilingual tree kernels can well capture such features. The experimental results show that our approach achieves a significant improvement on both gold standard tree bank and automatically parsed tree pairs against a heuristic similarity based method. We further apply the sub-tree alignment in machine translation with two methods. It is suggested that the subtree alignment benefits both phrase and syntax based systems by relaxing the constraint of the word alignment.

AB Compiling Java Card applets is based on the assumption that export files used to translate Java class item to Java Card CAP tokens are legitimate. Bouffard et al. [2] reversed the translation mechanism. Based on malicious Application Programming Interface (API) embedded in a target, they succeeded in making a man-in-the-middle attack where cryptographic keys can leak.
   In this article, we disclose that, on a pool of legitimate export files, Java Card Virtual Machine (JCVM) implementations can be confused by a CAP file verified by the Java Card Bytecode Verifier (BCV). The disclosed vulnerability leads to Java Card class hierarchy rewriting. The introduced vulnerability is exploitable up to Java Card 3.0.5. Recently, Java Card 3.1.0 provides a new export file format which prevents this vulnerability.

AB A massively parallel CRAY T3D computer with 128 processors has been installed at CEA/Centre d'Etudes de Limeil-Valenton in December 1993. We present performances obtained on our machine, first on elementary kernels (single PE computations, basic communications), then on a few parallel test programs. Single PE performances range typically from 5 to 20 Mflops and are highly dependent on cache utilization. The T3D communication network is quite fast (up to 130 Mbytes/s between two PEs and a latency of a few micro-seconds using CRAY proprietary communication libraries). On some well suited parallel applications, a 128 PEs CRAY T3D can be 20 times faster than one YMP processor. This paper is a partial translation of the CEA report CEA-N-2777, October 1994.

AB The linear translation stages play an important role in computer numerical control machine tools, coordinate measuring machines and semiconductor lithograph equipment. Six geometric motion errors are associated with a precision linear stage. High precision simultaneous measurement of multiple degrees of freedom is essential for the multiple-dimension motion calibration of the ultra-precision linear translation stage. In this paper, a laser heterodyne interferometer for simultaneous measurement of displacement and roll angle based on the acousto-optic modulator is proposed. In this optical configuration, a stabilize single-frequency laser (f(0)) and two acousto-optic modulators are used to generate the laser source. The frequency shifts of the two AOMs are f(1) and f(2), respectively. The positive first order diffraction beams of two AOMs, f(0)+f(1) and f(0)+f(2), are merged into one orthogonally and linearly polarized beam with a frequency offset of (f(1)-f(2)) as the laser source for the roll measurement-unit. A half wave plate (HWP) is utilized as the roll sensing plate to magnify the tiny roll angle into an observable phase shift based on the change of polarization state. The resolution of the roll measurement system is determined by the amplification factor which can be enhanced by a multi-reflection cavity made of a specifically arranged assembly square pyramidal mirror and a folding mirror. The zeroth beam f(0) and the positive first order beam f(0)+f(1) provided by two AOMs forms two space separated beams for the displacement measurement, which can eliminate the periodic nonlinearity error. The optical system of the simultaneous measurement of displacement and roll angle were setup. The experimental results showed good repeatability and good consistency.

AB Fiber specklegram sensors (FSSs) traditionally use statistical methods to analyze specklegrams obtained from fibers for sensing purposes, but can suffer from limitations such as vulnerability to noise and lack of dynamic range. In this paper we demonstrate that deep learning improves the analysis of specklegrams for sensing, which we show here for both air temperature and water immersion length measurements. 'Pwo deep neural networks (DNNs); a convolutional neural network and a multi-layer perceptron network, are used and compared to a traditional correlation technique on data obtained from a multimode fiber exposed-core fiber. The ability for the DNNs to be trained against a random noise source such as specklegram translations is also demonstrated.

AB A new metric BaryScore to evaluate text generation based on deep contextualized embeddings (e.g., BERT, Roberta, ELMo) is introduced. This metric is motivated by a new framework relying on optimal transport tools, i.e., Wasserstein distance and barycenter. By modelling the layer output of deep contextualized embeddings as a probability distribution rather than by a vector embedding; this framework provides a natural way to aggregate the different outputs through the Wasserstein space topology. In addition, it provides theoretical grounds to our metric and offers an alternative to available solutions (e.g., MoverScore and BertScore). Numerical evaluation is performed on four different tasks: machine translation, summarization, data2text generation and image captioning. Our results show that BaryScore outperforms other BERT based metrics and exhibits more consistent behaviour in particular for text summarization.

AB Nanomedicine represents an important class of cancer therapy. Clinical translation of cancer nanomedicine has significantly reduced the toxicity and adverse consequences of standard-of-care chemotherapy. Recent advances in new cancer treatment modalities (e.g., gene and immune therapies) are profoundly changing the oncology landscape, bringing with them new requirements and challenges for next-generation cancer nanomedicines. We present an overview of cancer nanomedicines in four emerging oncology-associated fields: (i) gene therapy, (ii) immunotherapy, (iii) extracellular vesicle (EV) therapy, and (iv) machine learning-assisted therapy. We discuss the incorporation of nanomedicine into these emerging disciplines, present prominent examples, and evaluate their advantages and challenges. Finally, we discuss future opportunities for next-generation cancer nanomedicines.

AB Simulation can be a powerful tool for understanding machine learning systems and designing methods to solve real-world problems. Training and evaluating methods purely in simulation is often "doomed to succeed" at the desired task in a simulated environment, but the resulting models are incapable of operation in the real world. Here we present and evaluate a method for transferring a vision-based lane following driving policy from simulation to operation on a rural road without any real-world labels. Our approach leverages recent advances in image-to-image translation to achieve domain transfer while jointly learning a single-camera control policy from simulation control labels. We assess the driving performance of this method using both open-loop regression metrics, and closed-loop performance operating an autonomous vehicle on rural and urban roads.

AB The use of wavelets in the image processing domain is still in its infancy, and largely associated with image compression. With the advent of the dual-tree hypercomplex wavelet transform (D-HWT) and its improved shift invariance and directional selectivity, applications in other areas of image processing are more conceivable. This paper discusses the problems and solutions in developing the DHWT and its inverse. It also offers a practical implementation of the algorithms involved. The aim of this work is to apply the DHWT in machine vision.
   Tentative work on a possible new way of feature extraction is presented. The paper shows that 2-D hypercomplex basis wavelets can be used to generate steerable filters which allow rotation as well as translation.

AB Human conversations contain many types of information, e.g., knowledge, common sense, and language habits. In this paper, we propose a conversational word embedding method named PR-Embedding, which utilizes the conversation pairs < post, reply > (1) to learn word embedding. Different from previous works, PR-Embedding uses the vectors from two different semantic spaces to represent the words in post and reply. To catch the information among the pair, we first introduce the word alignment model from statistical machine translation to generate the cross-sentence window, then train the embedding on word-level and sentence-level. We evaluate the method on single-turn and multi-turn response selection tasks for retrieval-based dialog systems. The experiment results show that PR-Embedding can improve the quality of the selected response.(2)

Most existing text plagiarism detection methods are not capable of dealing with the increasing number of plagiarism sources and the increasingly ambiguous plagiarized texts. In this paper, we pay attention to the task of large-scale text deduplication, and propose a multi-level distributed text computing model, which improves the checking speed through multi-level latent semantic analysis, and combines BERT to judge plagiarized text more accurately. In order to further verify the model, we also combined the latest fuzzy plagiarism technology to construct a three-level data set. The experimental results show that our model performs well when plagiarism data increases and plagiarism ambiguity increases.

TI Question Answering Systems With Deep Learning-Based Symbolic Processing
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The authors propose methods to learn symbolic processing with deep learning and to build question answering systems by means of learned models. Symbolic processing, performed by the Prolog processing systems which execute unification, resolution, and list operations, is learned by a combination of deep learning models, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Word2Vec training. To our knowledge, the implementation of a Prolog-like processing system using deep learning is a new experiment that has not been conducted in the past. The results of their experiments revealed that the proposed methods are superior to the conventional methods because symbolic processing (1) has rich representations, (2) can interpret inputs even if they include unknown symbols, and (3) can be learned with a small amount of training data. In particular (2), handling of unknown data, which is a major task in artificial intelligence research, is solved using Word2Vec. Furthermore, question answering systems can be built from knowledge bases written in Prolog with learned symbolic processing, which, with conventional methods, is extremely difficult to accomplish. Their proposed systems can not only answer questions through powerful inferences by utilizing facts that harbor unknown data but also have the potential to build knowledge bases from a large amount of data, including unknown data, on the Web. The proposed systems are a completely new trial, there is no state-of-the-art methods in the sense of newest. Therefore, to evaluate their efficiency, they are compared with the most traditional and robust system i.e., the Prolog system. This is new research that encompasses the subjects of conventional artificial intelligence and neural network, and their systems have higher potential to build applications such as FAQ chatbots, decision support systems and energy-efficient estimation using a large amount of information on the Web. Mining hidden information through these applications will provide great value.

AB We present META-MT, a meta-learning approach to adapt Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems in a few-shot setting. META-MT provides a new approach to make NMT models easily adaptable to many target domains with the minimal amount of in-domain data. We frame the adaptation of NMT systems as a meta-learning problem, where we learn to adapt to new unseen domains based on simulated offline meta-training domain adaptation tasks. We evaluate the proposed meta-learning strategy on ten domains with general large scale NMT systems. We show that META-MT significantly outperforms classical domain adaptation when very few in-domain examples are available. Our experiments shows that META-MT can outperform classical fine-tuning by up to 2.5 BLEU points after seeing only 4, 000 translated words (300 parallel sentences).

TI On the features of translationese
SO DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP IN THE HUMANITIES
AB Much research in translation studies indicates that translated texts are ontologically different from original non-translated ones. Translated texts, in any language, can be considered a dialect of that language, known as 'translationese'. Several characteristics of translationese have been proposed as universal in a series of hypotheses. In this work, we test these hypotheses using a computational methodology that is based on supervised machine learning. We define several classifiers that implement various linguistically informed features, and assess the degree to which different sets of features can distinguish between translated and original texts. We demonstrate that some feature sets are indeed good indicators of translationese, thereby corroborating some hypotheses, whereas others perform much worse (sometimes at chance level), indicating that some 'universal' assumptions have to be reconsidered.

Even though we train the large POS tagged corpus we still have a large number of the OOV words and this directly leads to a degradation of the system performance. To resolve the problem we propose a syllable lattice model and we are able to reduce the number of 00V words. We improve accuracy up to 96.6% on the Sejong Corpus and up to 97.5% on the MATEC test corpus.

AB The last six years have been very important for research and development of language technologies in Latvia. Several large projects have been funded by the government of Latvia, important tools and resources have been created by the industry, and since 2006 Latvia has participated in the CLARIN initiative. Although there is still a gap in language resources and technology (LRT) for Latvian and the more widely used languages, the current LRT for Latvian can already serve as a basic research infrastructure for the Humanities. The paper presents an overview and the current status of LRT in Latvia. Special attention is paid to the CLARIN project and its role for the humanities in Latvia.

TI Compiling affine nested loops: How to optimize the residual
   communications after the alignment phase
SO JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING
AB Minimizing communication overhead when mapping affine loop nests onto distributed memory parallel computers (DMPCs) is a key problem with regard to performance, and many authors have dealt with it. All communications are not equivalent. Local communications (translation), simple communications (horizontal or vertical ones), or structured communications (broadcasts, gathers, scatters, or reductions) are performed much faster than general affine communications onto DMPCs. In this paper, we recall the mapping heuristic given by Dion and Robert which consists in minimizing the number of nonlocal communications and we focus on the next step; as it is generally impossible to obtain a communication local mapping, we show how to optimize residual general communications using structured communications or decompositions into small sequences of simple communications.

TI Toward a Period-specific Optimized Neural Network for OCR Error
   Correction of Historical Hebrew Texts
SO ACM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING AND CULTURAL HERITAGE
AB Over the past few decades, large archives of paper-based historical documents, such as books and newspapers, have been digitized using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. Unfortunately, this broadly used technology is error-prone, especially when an OCRed document was written hundreds of years ago. Neural networks have shown great success in solving various text processing tasks, including OCR post-correction. The main disadvantage of using neural networks for historical corpora is the lack of sufficiently large training datasets they require to learn from, especially for morphologically rich languages like Hebrew. Moreover, it is not clear what are the optimal structure and values of hyperparameters (predefined parameters) of neural networks for OCR error correction in Hebrew due to its unique features. Furthermore, languages change across genres and periods. These changes may affect the accuracy of OCR post-correction neural network models. To overcome these challenges, we developed a new multi-phase method for generating artificial training datasets with OCR errors and hyperparameters' optimization for building an effective neural network for OCR post-correction in Hebrew. To evaluate the proposed approach, a series of experiments using several literary Hebrew corpora from various periods and genres were conducted. The obtained results demonstrate that (1) training a network on texts from a similar period dramatically improves the network's ability to fix OCR errors, (2) using the proposed error injection algorithm, based on character-level period-specific errors, minimizes the need for manually corrected data and improves the network accuracy by 9%, (3) the optimized network design improves the accuracy by 3% compared to the state-of-the-art network, and (4) the constructed optimized network outperforms neural machine translation models and industry-leading spellcheckers. The proposed methodology may have practical implications for digital humanities projects that aim to search and analyze OCRed documents in Hebrew and potentially other morphologically rich languages.

TI Glenoid retroversion is an important factor for humeral head centration
   and the biomechanics of posterior shoulder stability
SO KNEE SURGERY SPORTS TRAUMATOLOGY ARTHROSCOPY
AB Purpose Glenoid retroversion is a known independent risk factor for recurrent posterior instability. The purpose was to investigate progressive angles of glenoid retroversion and their influence on humeral head centration and posterior translation with intact, detached, and repaired posterior labrum in a cadaveric human shoulder model.
   Methods A total of 10 fresh-frozen human cadaveric shoulders were investigated for this study. After CT- canning, the glenoids were aligned parallel to the floor, with the capsule intact, and the humerus was fixed in 60 degrees of abduction and neutral rotation. Version of the glenoid was created after wedge resection from posterior and fixed with an external fixator throughout the testing. Specimens underwent three conditions: intact, detached, and repaired posterior labrum, while version of the glenoid was set from +5 degrees anteversion to -25 degrees retroversion by 5 degrees increments. Within the biomechanical setup, the glenohumeral joint was axially loaded (22 N) to center the joint. At 0 degrees of glenoid version and intact labrum, the initial position was used as baseline and served as point zero of centerization. After cyclic preloading, posterior translation force (20 N) was then applied by a material testing machine, while start and endpoints of the scapula placed on an X-Y table were measured.
   Results The decentralization of the humeral head at glenoid version angles of 5 degrees, 10 degrees, 15 degrees, and 20 degrees of retroversion and 5 degrees of anteversion was significantly different (P<0.001). Every increment of 5 degrees of retroversion led to an additional decentralization of the humeral head overall by (averageSD) 2.0 mm +/- 0.3 in the intact and 2.0 mm +/- 0.7 in the detached labrum condition. The repaired showed significantly lower posterior translation compared to the intact condition at 10 degrees (P=0.012) and 15 degrees (P<0.01) of retroversion. In addition, CT measured parameters (depth, diameter, and native version) of the glenoid showed no correlation with angle of dislocation of each specimen.
   Conclusion Bony alignment in terms of glenoid retroversion angle plays an important role in joint centration and posterior translation, especially in retroversion angles greater than 10 degrees. Isolated posterior labrum repair has a significant effect on posterior translation in glenoid retroversion angles of 5 degrees and 10 degrees. Bony correction of glenoid version may be considered to address posterior shoulder instability with retroversion>15 degrees.

TI Simulating the Behavior of Reservoirs with Convolutional and Recurrent
   Neural Networks
SO SPE RESERVOIR EVALUATION & ENGINEERING
CT International Petroleum Technology Conference
CY JAN 13-15, 2020
CL Dhahran, SAUDI ARABIA
AB Recent experience in applying recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to interpreting permanent downhole gauge records has highlighted the potential utility of machine learning algorithms to learn reservoir behavior from data. The power of the RNN resides in its ability to retain information in a form of memory of previous patterns and information contained in the previous behavior of phenomena being modeled. This memory plays a role of informing the decision at the present time by using what happened in the past. This property suggests the RNN as a suitable choice to model sequences of reservoir information, even when the reservoir modeler is faced with incomplete knowledge of the underlying physical system.
   Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are another variant of the machine learning algorithm that have shown promise in sequence modeling domains, such as audio synthesis and machine translation. In this study, RNNs and CNNs were applied to tasks that traditionally would be modeled by a reservoir simulator. This was achieved by formulating the relationship between physical quantities of interest from subsurface reservoirs as a sequence mapping problem. In addition, the performance of a CNN layer as compared with an RNN was evaluated systematically to investigate their capabilities in a variety of tasks of interest to the reservoir engineer.
   Preliminary results suggest that CNNs, with specific design modifications, are as capable as RNNs in modeling sequences of information, and as reliable when making inferences to cases that have not been seen by the algorithm during training. Design details and reasons pertaining to the way these two seemingly different architectures process information and handle memory are also discussed.

AB Several years of research have shown that machinelearning systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples, both in theory and in practice. Until now, such attacks have primarily targeted visual models, exploiting the gap between human and machine perception. Although text-based models have also been attacked with adversarial examples, such attacks struggled to preserve semantic meaning and indistinguishability. In this paper, we explore a large class of adversarial examples that can be used to attack text-based models in a black-box setting without making any human-perceptible visual modification to inputs. We use encoding-specific perturbations that are imperceptible to the human eye to manipulate the outputs of a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems from neural machine-translation pipelines to web search engines. We find that with a single imperceptible encoding injection - representing one invisible character, homoglyph, reordering, or deletion - an attacker can significantly reduce the performance of vulnerable models, and with three injections most models can be functionally broken. Our attacks work against currently-deployed commercial systems, including those produced by Microsoft and Google, in addition to open source models published by Facebook, IBM, and HuggingFace. This novel series of attacks presents a significant threat to many language processing systems: an attacker can affect systems in a targeted manner without any assumptions about the underlying model. We conclude that text-based NLP systems require careful input sanitization, just like conventional applications, and that given such systems are now being deployed rapidly at scale, the urgent attention of architects and operators is required.

TI Classifying and analyzing small-angle scattering data using weighted k
   nearest neighbors machine learning techniques
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED CRYSTALLOGRAPHY
AB A consistent challenge for both new and expert practitioners of small-angle scattering (SAS) lies in determining how to analyze the data, given the limited information content of said data and the large number of models that can be employed. Machine learning (ML) methods are powerful tools for classifying data that have found diverse applications in many fields of science. Here, ML methods are applied to the problem of classifying SAS data for the most appropriate model to use for data analysis. The approach employed is built around the method of weighted k nearest neighbors (wKNN), and utilizes a subset of the models implemented in the SasView package (https://www. sasview.org/) for generating a well defined set of training and testing data. The prediction rate of the wKNN method implemented here using a subset of SasView models is reasonably good for many of the models, but has difficulty with others, notably those based on spherical structures. A novel expansion of the wKNN method was also developed, which uses Gaussian processes to produce local surrogate models for the classification, and this significantly improves the classification accuracy. Further, by integrating a stochastic gradient descent method during post-processing, it is possible to leverage the local surrogate model both to classify the SAS data with high accuracy and to predict the structural parameters that best describe the data. The linking of data classification and model fitting has the potential to facilitate the translation of measured data into results for both novice and expert practitioners of SAS.

TI Live modeling in the context of state machine models and code generation
SO SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS MODELING
AB Live modeling has been recognized as an important technique to edit behavioral models while being executed and helps in better understanding the impact of a design choice. In the context of model-driven development, models can be executed by interpretation or by the translation of models into existing programming languages, often by code generation. This work is concerned with the support of live modeling in the context of state machine models when they are executed by code generation. To this end, we propose an approach that is completely independent of any live programming support offered by the target language. This independence is achieved with the help of a model transformation which equips the model with support for features which are required for live modeling. A subsequent code generation then produces a self-reflective program that allows changes to the model elements at runtime (through synchronization of design and runtime models). We have applied the approach in the context of UML-RT and created a prototype (Live-UMLRT) that provides a full set of services for live modeling of UML-RT state machines such as re-execution, adding/removing states and transitions, and adding/removing action code. We have evaluated the prototype on several use cases. The evaluation shows that (1) generation of a self-reflective and model instrumentation can be carried out with reasonable performance, and (2) our approach can apply model changes to the running execution faster than the standard approach that depends on the live programming support of the target language.

TI Natural Language Processing of Radiology Reports in Patients With
   Hepatocellular Carcinoma to Predict Radiology Resource Utilization
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RADIOLOGY
AB Objective: Radiology is a finite health care resource in high demand at most health centers. However, anticipating fluctuations in demand is a challenge because of the inherent uncertainty in disease prognosis. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of natural language processing (NLP) to predict downstream radiology resource utilization in patients undergoing surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
   Materials and Methods: All HCC surveillance CT examinations performed at our institution from January 1, 2010, to October 31, 2017 were selected from our departmental radiology information system. We used open source NLP and machine learning software to parse radiology report text into bag-of-words and term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) representations. Three machine learning models-logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), and random forest-were used to predict future utilization of radiology department resources. A test data set was used to calculate accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in addition to the area under the curve (AUC).
   Results: As a group, the bag-of-word models were slightly inferior to the TF-IDF feature extraction approach. The TF-IDF + SVM model outperformed all other models with an accuracy of 92%, a sensitivity of 83%, and a specificity of 96%, with an AUC of 0.971.
   Conclusions: NLP-based models can accurately predict downstream radiology resource utilization from narrative HCC surveillance reports and has potential for translation to health care management where it may improve decision making, reduce costs, and broaden access to care.

AB Electrohydrodynamic ink-jet printing (e-jet printing) is one of micro/nano scale 3D printing techniques that automatically deposit functional materials to form 3D structures on the substrate. Unlike traditional thermal or acoustic inkjet printing, e-jet printing utilizes high electrical forces that enable the ink to overcome surface tension at the tip of micro needles. The filaments/droplets coming out from the needle have dimensions much smaller than the dimensions of the nozzle, thus printing geometries in micro and nano scale. Process parameters in e-jet printing could affect the fmal quality attributes of fabricated constructs. Currently, assessment of these critical geometries and attributes must be performed offline using optical microscopy or scanning electron microscopy. This drawback affected the efficiency of micro/nano printing from translation into industrial practice. The research in this paper focused on fundamental research to enable in-situ monitoring of e-jet printing using a real-time image characterization technique. In conclusion, the study in this paper investigated using machine vision for real-time monitoring of micro scale 3D printing. The method worked well for characterization of micro-filaments, and may be further implemented into feedback control system of complicated e-jet printing. However, the optical machine vision was limited to micro scale detection. One of the future research topic is to develop nano scale in-situ characterization mechanism for e-j et printing.

TI Bimodal Gene Expression in Patients with Cancer Provides Interpretable
   Biomarkers for Drug Sensitivity
SO CANCER RESEARCH
AB Identifying biomarkers predictive of cancer cell response to drug treatment constitutes one of the main challenges in precision oncology. Recent large-scale cancer pharmacogenomic studies have opened new avenues of research to develop predictive biomarkers by profiling thousands of human cancer cell lines at the molecular level and screening them with hundreds of approved drugs and experimental chemical compounds. Many studies have leveraged these data to build predictive models of response using various statistical and machine learning methods. However, a common pitfall to these methods is the lack of interpretability as to how they make predictions, hindering the clinical translation of these models. To alleviate this issue, we used the recent logic modeling approach to develop a new machine learning pipeline that explores the space of bimodally expressed genes in multiple large in vitro pharmacogenomic studies and builds multivariate, nonlinear, yet interpretable logic-based models predictive of drug response. The performance of this approach was showcased in a compendium of the three largest in vitro pharmacogenomic datasets to build robust and interpretable models for 101 drugs that span 17 drug classes with high validation rates in independent datasets. These results along with in vivo and clinical validation support a better trans-lation of gene expression biomarkers between model systems using bimodal gene expression. Significance: A new machine learning pipeline exploits the bimodality of gene expression to provide a reliable set of candidate predictive biomarkers with a high potential for clinical translatability.

TI An ALE approach for the chip formation process in high speed machining
   with transient cutting conditions: Modeling and experimental validation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES
AB The Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian approach (ALE) presents a lot of advantages. However, its use is limited to the cutting with a constant uncut chip thickness h. On the one hand, the previous numerical studies were focused on the prediction of the quasi-stationary response for cutting forces and heat transfer along the tool rake face. But on the other hand, in the industrial machining processes, as milling operations, the removal of the material from the workpiece varies with time. The aim of the present work is to extend the use of the ALE approach to the milling processes where the cutting conditions are transient: h varies with time. A new strategy combining the ALE approach and the tool translation is presented. In the present model, the out flow surface of the chip is assimilated to an Eulerian surface with a vertical moving direction of the mesh. This strategy allows to consider the increase of the tool-chip contact length with h as in up milling. The limitations of the conventional use of the ALE were also discussed in this study. The experimental study was focused on dry machining of the aluminum alloy AA2024-T351 at very high speed 51.5 and 66.2 m/s. The predicted cutting forces have been compared with the experimental results. The cutting forces are not proportional to h especially for the feed force. This tendency, reproduced by the model, is directly related to the thermal softening of the work material in the secondary shear zone. At the tool rake face, the variation of the local parameters in function of time is also discussed: tool-chip contact length, sticking zone and temperature. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB As bilateral relation between Indonesia and Japan strengthens, the need of consistent term usage for both languages becomes important. In this paper, a new method for Indonesian-Japanese term extraction is presented. In general, this is done in 3 steps: (1) n-gram extraction for each language, (2) n-gram cross-pairing between both languages, and (3) classification. This method is aimed to be able to handle term extraction from both parallel corpora and comparable corpora. In order to use this method, we have to build a classification model first using machine learning. There are 4 types of feature we take into consideration. They are dictionary based features, cognate based features, combined features, and statistic features. The first three features are linguistic features. Dictionary based features consider word-pair existence in a predefined dictionary, cognate based features consider morpheme level similarity, combined features consider both dictionary and cognate based features altogether, and statistic features is used in case the first 3 features fail. The only statistic feature we use is context heterogeneity similarity, which consider the variety of words that can precede or follow a term. For learning algorithm, we use SVM (Support Vector Machine). In the experiment, we compared several scenarios: only linguistic features, only statistic features, or both features combined. The classification model was built from parallel corpora since plenty of term pairs can be extracted from parallel corpora. The size of training data was 5,000 term pairs. The best result was achieved by using only linguistic features and without the preprocessing step. The accuracy was up to 90.98% and recall 92.14%. A testing from comparable corpora was also done with size of 37,392 term pairs where 94 were equivalent translation and 37,298 were not. Evaluation using test set gave accuracy of 98.63% precision, but with low recall score of 24.47%.

TI Prediction of lncRNA-Protein Interactions via the Multiple Information
   Integration
SO FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-protein interaction plays an important role in the post-transcriptional gene regulation, such as RNA splicing, translation, signaling, and the development of complex diseases. The related research on the prediction of lncRNA-protein interaction relationship is beneficial in the excavation and the discovery of the mechanism of lncRNA function and action occurrence, which are important. Traditional experimental methods for detecting lncRNA-protein interactions are expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, computational methods provide many effective strategies to deal with this problem. In recent years, most computational methods only use the information of the lncRNA-lncRNA or the protein-protein similarity and cannot fully capture all features to identify their interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel computational model for the lncRNA-protein prediction on the basis of machine learning methods. First, a feature method is proposed for representing the information of the network topological properties of lncRNA and protein interactions. The basic composition feature information and evolutionary information based on protein, the lncRNA sequence feature information, and the lncRNA expression profile information are extracted. Finally, the above feature information is fused, and the optimized feature vector is used with the recursive feature elimination algorithm. The optimized feature vectors are input to the support vector machine (SVM) model. Experimental results show that the proposed method has good effectiveness and accuracy in the lncRNA-protein interaction prediction.

TI Hand gesture recognition using DWT and F-ratio based feature descriptor
SO IET IMAGE PROCESSING
AB This study demonstrates the development of vision based static hand gesture recognition system using web camera in real-time applications. The vision based static hand gesture recognition system is developed using the following steps: preprocessing, feature extraction and classification. The preprocessing stage consists of illumination compensation, segmentation, filtering, hand region detection and image resize. This study proposes a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and Fisher ratio (F-ratio) based feature extraction technique to classify the hand gestures in an uncontrolled environment. This method is not only robust towards distortion and gesture vocabulary, but also invariant to translation and rotation of hand gestures. A linear support vector machine is used as a classifier to recognise the hand gestures. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on two standard public datasets and one indigenously developed complex background dataset for recognition of hand gestures. All above three datasets are developed based on American Sign Language (ASL) hand alphabets. The experimental result is evaluated in terms of mean accuracy. Two possible real-time applications are conducted, one is for interpretation of ASL sign alphabets and another is for image browsing.

TI Many-Body Descriptors for Predicting Molecular Properties with Machine
   Learning: Analysis of Pairwise and Three-Body Interactions in Molecules
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Machine learning (ML) based prediction of molecular properties across chemical compound space is an important and alternative approach to efficiently estimate the solutions of highly complex many-electron problems in chemistry and physics. Statistical methods represent molecules as descriptors that should encode molecular symmetries and interactions between atoms. Many such descriptors have been proposed; all of them have advantages and limitations. Here, we propose a set of general two-body and three-body interaction descriptors which are invariant to translation, rotation, and atomic indexing. By adapting the successfully used kernel ridge regression methods of machine learning, we evaluate our descriptors on predicting several properties of small organic molecules calculated using density-functional theory. We use two data sets. The GDB-7 set contains 6868 molecules with up to 7 heavy atoms of type CNO. The GDB-9 set is composed of 131722 molecules with up to 9 heavy atoms containing CNO. When trained on 5000 random molecules, our best model achieves an accuracy of 0.8 kcal/mol (on the remaining 1868 molecules of GDB-7) and 1.5 kcal/mol (on the remaining 126722 molecules of GDB-9) respectively. Applying a linear regression model on our novel many-body descriptors performs almost equal to a nonlinear kernelized model. Linear models are readily interpretable: a feature importance ranking measure helps to obtain qualitative and quantitative insights on the importance of two- and three-body molecular interactions for predicting molecular properties computed with quantum-mechanical methods.

AB Jet engine impeller blades are flank-milled with tapered, helical, ball-end mills on five-axis machining centers. The impellers are made from difficult-to-cut titanium or nickel alloys, and the blades must be machined within tight tolerances. As a consequence, deflections of the tool and flexible workpiece can jeopardize the precision of the impellers during milling. This work is the first of a two part paper on cutting force prediction and feed optimization for the five-axis flank milling of an impeller. In Part 1, a mathematical model for predicting cutting forces is presented for five-axis machining with tapered, helical, ball-end mills with variable pitch and serrated flutes. The cutter is divided axially into a number of differential elements, each with its own feed coordinate system due to five-axis motion. At each element, the total velocity due to translation and rotation is split into horizontal and vertical feed components, which are used to calculate total chip thickness along the cutting edge. The cutting forces for each element are calculated by transforming friction angle, shear stress and shear angle from an orthogonal cutting database to the oblique cutting plane. The distributed cutting load is digitally summed to obtain the total forces acting on the cutter and blade. The model can be used for general five-axis flank milling processes, and supports a variety of cutting tools. Predicted cutting force measurements are shown to be in reasonable agreement with those collected during a roughing operation on a prototype integrally bladed rotor (IBR).

TI From Mathematical Morphology to machine learning of image operators
SO SAO PAULO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES
AB Morphological image operators are a class of non-linear image mappings studied in Mathematical Morphology. Many significant theoretical results regarding the characterization of families of image operators, their properties, and representations are derived from lattice theory, the underlying foundation of Mathematical Morphology. A fundamental representation result is a pair of canonical decompositions for any translation-invariant operator as a union of sup-generating or an intersection of inf-generating operators, which in turn can be written in terms of two basic operators, erosions and dilations. Thus, in practice, a toolbox with functional operators can be built by composing erosions and dilations, and then operators of the toolbox can be further combined to solve image processing problems. However, designing image operators by hand may become a daunting task for complex image processing tasks, and this motivated the development of machine learning based approaches. This paper reviews the main contributions around this theme made by the authors and their collaborators over the years. The review covers the relevant theoretical elements, particularly the canonical decomposition theorem, a formulation of the learning problem, some methods to solve it, and algorithms for finding computationally efficient representations. More recent contributions included in this review are related to families of operators (hypothesis spaces) organized as lattice structures where a suitable subfamily of operators is searched through the minimization of U-curve cost functions. A brief account of the connections between morphological image operator learning and deep learning is also included.

TI MicroRNA categorization using sequence motifs and k-mers
SO BMC BIOINFORMATICS
AB Background: Post-transcriptional gene dysregulation can be a hallmark of diseases like cancer and microRNAs ( miRNAs) play a key role in the modulation of translation efficiency. Known pre-miRNAs are listed in miRBase, and they have been discovered in a variety of organisms ranging from viruses and microbes to eukaryotic organisms. The computational detection of pre-miRNAs is of great interest, and such approaches usually employ machine learning to discriminate between miRNAs and other sequences. Many features have been proposed describing pre-miRNAs, and we have previously introduced the use of sequence motifs and k-mers as useful ones. There have been reports of xeno-miRNAs detected via next generation sequencing. However, they may be contaminations and to aid that important decisionmaking process, we aimed to establish a means to differentiate pre-miRNAs from different species.
   Results: To achieve distinction into species, we used one species' pre-miRNAs as the positive and another species' premiRNAs as the negative training and test data for the establishment of machine learned models based on sequence motifs and k-mers as features. This approach resulted in higher accuracy values between distantly related species while species with closer relation produced lower accuracy values.
   Conclusions: We were able to differentiate among species with increasing success when the evolutionary distance increases. This conclusion is supported by previous reports of fast evolutionary changes in miRNAs since even in relatively closely related species a fairly good discrimination was possible.

AB Structural annotation of genomes is one of major goals of genomics research. Most popular tools for structural annotation of genomes are determined by computational pipelines. It is well-known that these computational methods have a number of shortcomings including false identifications and incorrect identification of gene boundaries. Proteomic data can used to confirm the identification of genes identified by computational methods and correct mistakes. A Proteogenomic mapping method has been developed, which uses peptides identified from mass spectrometry for structural annotation of genomes. Spectra are matched against both a protein database and the genome database translated in all six reading frames. Those peptides that match the genome but not the protein database potentially represent novel protein coding genes, annotation errors. These short experimentally derived peptides are used to discover potential novel protein coding genes called expressed Protein Sequence Tags (ePSTs) by aligning the peptides to the genomic DNA and extending the translation in the 3 ' and 5 ' direction. In the paper, an enhanced pipeline, has been designed and developed for discovering and evaluating of potential novel protein coding genes: 1) a distance-based outlier detection method for validating peptides identified from MS/MS, 2) a proteogenomic mapping for discovery of potential novel protein coding genes, 3) collection of evidence front a number of sources and automatically evaluate potential novel protein coding genes by using machine learning techniques, such as Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes etc.

TI Novel tools and methods for designing and wrangling multifunctional,
   machine-readable evidence synthesis databases
SO ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE
AB One of the most important steps in the process of conducting a systematic review or map is data extraction and the production of a database of coding, metadata and study data. There are many ways to structure these data, but to date, no guidelines or standards have been produced for the evidence synthesis community to support their production. Furthermore, there is little adoption of easily machine-readable, readily reusable and adaptable databases: these databases would be easier to translate into different formats by review authors, for example for tabulation, visualisation and analysis, and also by readers of the review/map. As a result, it is common for systematic review and map authors to produce bespoke, complex data structures that, although typically provided digitally, require considerable efforts to understand, verify and reuse. Here, we report on an analysis of systematic reviews and maps published by the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence, and discuss major issues that hamper machine readability and data reuse or verification. We highlight different justifications for the alternative data formats found: condensed databases; long databases; and wide databases. We describe these challenges in the context of data science principles that can support curation and publication of machine-readable, Open Data. We then go on to make recommendations to review and map authors on how to plan and structure their data, and we provide a suite of novel R-based functions to support efficient and reliable translation of databases between formats that are useful for presentation (condensed, human readable tables), filtering and visualisation (wide databases), and analysis (long databases). We hope that our recommendations for adoption of standard practices in database formatting, and the tools necessary to rapidly move between formats will provide a step-change in transparency and replicability of Open Data in evidence synthesis.

TI Individualized Diagnostic and Prognostic Models for Patients With
   Psychosis Risk Syndromes: A Meta View on the State of the Art
SO BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY
AB BACKGROUND: The clinical high risk (CHR) paradigm has facilitated research into the underpinnings of help-seeking individuals at risk for developing psychosis, aiming at predicting and possibly preventing transition to the overt disorder. Statistical methods such as machine learning and Cox regression have provided the methodological basis for this research by enabling the construction of diagnostic models (i.e., distinguishing CHR individuals from healthy individuals) and prognostic models (i.e., predicting a future outcome) based on different data modalities, including clinical, neurocognitive, and neurobiological data. However, their translation to clinical practice is still hindered by the high heterogeneity of both CHR populations and methodologies applied.
   METHODS: We systematically reviewed the literature on diagnostic and prognostic models built on Cox regression and machine learning. Furthermore, we conducted a meta-analysis on prediction performances investigating heterogeneity of methodological approaches and data modality.
   RESULTS: A total of 44 articles were included, covering 3707 individuals for prognostic studies and 1052 individuals for diagnostic studies (572 CHR patients and 480 healthy control subjects). CHR patients could be classified against healthy control subjects with 78% sensitivity and 77% specificity. Across prognostic models, sensitivity reached 67% and specificity reached 78%. Machine learning models outperformed those applying Cox regression by 10% sensitivity. There was a publication bias for prognostic studies yet no other moderator effects.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results may be driven by substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity currently affecting several aspects of the CHR field and limiting the clinical implementability of the proposed models. We discuss conceptual and methodological harmonization strategies to facilitate more reliable and generalizable models for future clinical practice.

AB The vulnerability of software and the Internet and the accumulation of unprocessed information in big data are serious problems in informatics. Both are human-related. The former was traced to flaws caused by human interventions in development. In the latter case, humans also intervene to connect the dots, find meaningful patterns, and make sense of the information. The proposed solutions are based on more human interventions, which tend to aggravate the problems rather than solving them. I propose the complete elimination of human interventions in both cases. This goal is conceptually easy to achieve. The approach, however, is radical and theoretical. It considers the causal set, a mathematical object, as the universal language underlying all information in nature and, hence, also all computation. This assumption is recognized as the fundamental principle of causality, that effects follow their causes. The new theory is based solely on the causal set, its metric, and its vast array of algebraic properties. The consequences are unexpected, fascinating, and totally new. Since translations between causal sets and programming languages are easy, I also propose to confine the use of programming languages to the human interface, and create an inner layer of mathematical code expressed as a causal set. Machines talk only to mathematically verified, bug-free, secure code. Included in this paper are experimental and computational verifications of the theory, proposed applications to Internet vulnerability, science and technology, machine learning, computer intelligence, and details for building a first prototype.

TI An Improved Word Representation for Deep Learning Based NER in Indian
   Languages
SO INFORMATION
AB Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the process of identifying the elementary units in a text document and classifying them into predefined categories such as person, location, organization and so forth. NER plays an important role in many Natural Language Processing applications like information retrieval, question answering, machine translation and so forth. Resolving the ambiguities of lexical items involved in a text document is a challenging task. NER in Indian languages is always a complex task due to their morphological richness and agglutinative nature. Even though different solutions were proposed for NER, it is still an unsolved problem. Traditional approaches to Named Entity Recognition were based on the application of hand-crafted features to classical machine learning techniques such as Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Conditional Random Field (CRF) and so forth. But the introduction of deep learning techniques to the NER problem changed the scenario, where the state of art results have been achieved using deep learning architectures. In this paper, we address the problem of effective word representation for NER in Indian languages by capturing the syntactic, semantic and morphological information. We propose a deep learning based entity extraction system for Indian languages using a novel combined word representation, including character-level, word-level and affix-level embeddings. We have used ARNEKT-IECSIL 2018' shared data for training and testing. Our results highlight the improvement that we obtained over the existing pre-trained word representations.

TI Prediction of Chinese word-formation patterns using the layer-weighted
   semantic graph-based KFP-MCO classifier
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB Nowadays natural language processing plays an important and critical role in the domain of intelligent computing, pattern recognition, semantic analysis and machine intelligence. For Chinese information processing, to construct the predictive models of different semantic word-formation patterns with a large-scale corpus can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of the paraphrase of the unregistered or new word, ambiguities elimination, automatic lexicography, machine translation and other applications. Therefore it is required to find the relationship between word-formation patterns and different influential factors, which can be denoted as a classification problem. However, due to noise, anomalies, imprecision, polysemy, ambiguity, nonlinear structure, and class-imbalance in semantic word-formation data, multi-criteria optimization classifier (MCOC), support vector machines (SVM) and other traditional classification approaches will give the poor predictive performance. In this paper, according to the characteristic analysis of Chinese word-formations, we firstly proposed a novel layered semantic graph of each disyllabic word, the layer-weighted graph edit distance (GED) and its similarity kernel embedded into a new vector space, then on the normalized data MCOC with kernel, fuzzification and penalty factors (KFP-MCOC) and SVM are employed to predict Chinese semantic word-formation patterns. Our experimental results and comparison with SVM show that KFP-MCOC based on the layer-weighted semantic graphs can increase the separation of different patterns, the predictive accuracy of target patterns and the generalization of semantic pattern classification on new compound words.

TI Effect of machine stiffness on interpreting contact force-indentation
   depth curves in adhesive elastic contact experiments
SO JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS
AB Dry adhesion plays a critical role in many fields, including the locomotion of some insects and failure of microelectromechanical systems. The Dupre's work of adhesion of a contact interface is an important metric of dry adhesion. It is often measured by applying the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) theory [1] to contact force-indentation depth curves that are measured using an atomic force microscope (AFM), or an instrument modeled after it. The JKR theory has been exceptionally successful in interpreting contact force-indentation depth measurements and explaining adhesive, elastic contact phenomena, such as the pull in and pull-off instabilities. However, in many cases the JKR theory predicts a lower magnitude for the pull-off force than what is experimentally measured, and it does not capture the finite changes in the indentation depth that occur during the pull-in and pull-off instabilities. In those cases, applying the JKR theory to calculate the work of adhesion from only the measured pull-off force is likely to give highly inaccurate results. We believe that these discrepancies occur because the classical JKR theory ignores the machine stiffness which, in the case of AFM-type instruments, is the stiffness of the mechanical structure that connects the tip to the translation stage, which moves the tip towards and away from the substrate. In this paper, we present a model that is related to, but more general than, the JKR theory that accounts for the machine stiffness. This model explains the experimental data better than the JKR theory in the cases where the JKR theory displays the aforementioned discrepancies. We consider both the first order necessary and the higher order sufficiency conditions while deriving the solutions in our model. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Semantic Web technology is being increasingly applied in a large spectrum of applications in which domain knowledge is conceptualized and formalized (e.g., by means of an ontology) in order to support diversified and automated knowledge processing (e.g., reasoning) performed by a machine. Moreover, through an optimal combination of (cognitive) human reasoning and (automated) machine reasoning and processing, it is possible for humans and machines to share complementary tasks. The spectrum of applications is extremely large and to name a few: corporate portals and knowledge management, e-commerce, e-work, e-business, healthcare, e-government, natural language understanding and automated translation, information search, data and services integration, social networks and collaborative filtering, knowledge mining, business intelligence and so on. From a social and economic perspective, this emerging technology should contribute to growth in economic wealth, but it must also show clear cut value for everyday activities through technological transparency and efficiency. The penetration of Semantic Web technology in industry and in services is progressing slowly but accelerating as new success stories are reported. In this paper and lecture we present ongoing work in the cross-fertilization between industry and academia. In particular, we present a collection of application fields and use cases from enterprises which are interested in the promises of Semantic Web technology. The use cases are detailed and focused on the key knowledge processing components that will unlock the deployment of the technology in the selected application field. The paper ends with the presentation of the current technology roadmap designed by a team of Academic and Industry researchers.

TI NLP-Based Approach for Predicting HMI State Sequences Towards Monitoring
   Operator Situational Awareness
SO SENSORS
AB A novel approach presented herein transforms the Human Machine Interface (HMI) states, as a pattern of visual feedback states that encompass both operator actions and process states, from a multi-variate time-series to a natural language processing (NLP) modeling domain. The goal of this approach is to predict operator response patterns for n-ahead time-step window given k-lagged past HMI state patterns. The NLP approach offers the possibility of encoding (semantic) contextual relations within HMI state patterns. Towards which, a technique for framing raw HMI data for supervised training using sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) deep-learning machine translation algorithms is presented. In addition, a custom Seq2Seq convolutional neural network (CNN) NLP model based on current state-of-the-art design elements such as attention, is compared against a standard recurrent neural network (RNN) based NLP model. Results demonstrate comparable effectiveness of both the designs of NLP models evaluated for modeling HMI states. RNN NLP models showed higher (approximate to 26%) forecast accuracy, in general for both in-sample and out-of-sample test datasets. However, custom CNN NLP model showed higher (approximate to 53%) validation accuracy indicative of less over-fitting with the same amount of available training data. The real-world application of the proposed NLP modeling of industrial HMIs, such as in power generating stations control rooms, aviation (cockpits), and so forth, is towards the realization of a non-intrusive operator situational awareness monitoring framework through prediction of HMI states.

TI LSMCore: A 69k-Synapse/mm(2) Single-Core Digital Neuromorphic Processor
   for Liquid State Machine
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS I-REGULAR PAPERS
AB Neuromorphic processors have gained momentum recently due to their high energy efficiency in artificial intelligence applications compared to DNN accelerators. Most neuromorphic processors are executing SNNs (Spiking Neural Networks). Liquid State Machine (LSM), as the spiking version of reservoir computing, shows advantages and great potential in image classification, speech recognition, language translation, etc.. Comparing with other SNN models, LSM has the characteristics of easy to train and low resource utilization, which is suitable for low-power and resource-constrained edge computing scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel design of a neuromorphic processor, LSMCore, aiming at LSM acceleration. LSMCore supports both training and inference of LSM. It consists of 256 input neurons, 1024 liquid neurons, and 1.31M synapses. Besides, multiple optimization techniques, including weight quantization for reducing storage, zero-skipping for decreasing dynamic sparsity, and mini-batch training are adopted in this processor. The experimental results show that the frequency of LSMCore achieves 400 MHz, the power is 4.9W and the area is 18.49 mm(2) with a 40nm library. Comparing with the baseline, LSMCore achieves up to 80.7x(49.6x), 91.3x(56.3x), and 83.1x(56.8x) speedup on MNIST, N-MNIST, and Free Spoken Digital Dataset (FSDD) respectively for training (inference), while the accuracy of LSMCore on these three datasets are 96.8%, 97.6%, and 90% respectively.

TI Deep neural networks in hydrology: the new generation of universal and
   efficient models
SO VESTNIK OF SAINT PETERSBURG UNIVERSITY EARTH SCIENCES
AB For around a decade, deep learning - the sub-field of machine learning that refers to artificial neural networks comprised of many computational layers - modifies the landscape of statistical model development in many research areas, such as image classification, machine translation, and speech recognition. Geoscientific disciplines in general and the field of hydrology in particular, also do not stand aside from this movement. Recently, the proliferation of modern deep learning-based techniques and methods has been actively gaining popularity for solving a wide range of hydrological problems: modeling and forecasting of river runoff, hydrological model parameters regionalization, assessment of available water resources. identification of the main drivers of the recent change in water balance components. This growing popularity of deep neural networks is primarily due to their high universality and efficiency. The presented qualities, together with the rapidly growing amount of accumulated environmental information, as well as increasing availability of computing facilities and resources, allow us to speak about deep neural networks as a new generation of mathematical models designed to, if not to replace existing solutions, but significantly enrich the field of geophysical processes modeling. This paper provides a brief overview of the current state of the field of development and application of deep neural networks in hydrology. Also in the following study, the qualitative long-term forecast regarding the development of deep learning technology for managing the corresponding hydrological modeling challenges is provided based on the use of "Gartner Hype Curve", which in the general details describes a life cycle of modern technologies.

TI An overview on the evolution and adoption of deep learning applications
   used in the industry
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY
AB With continuous improvements in performance of microprocessors over the years, they now possess capabilities of supercomputers of earlier decade. Further with the continuous increase in the packaging density on the silicon and General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) enhancements, has led to utilization the deep learning (DL) techniques, which had lost steam during the last decade. A GPGPU is a parallel programming setup using a combination of GPUs and CPUs that can manipulate large matrices. Interestingly, GPUs were created for faster graphic processing, but found its way into relevant scientific computing. DL is a subset of the artificial intelligence (AI) domain and falls specifically under the set of machine learning (ML) techniques which are based on learning data representations rather than task-specific algorithms. It has been observed that the accuracy and the pragmatism of deploying DL at massive level was restricted by technological issues of executing DL based AI models, with extremely large training sessions running into weeks. DL applications can solve problems of very large order and areas like computer vision/image processing is one of the early successes and becoming quite a sensation in many areas such as natural language processing (NLP) with state of the art real-time translation capabilities, automatic game playing, optical character recognition especially handwritten text, and so on. This overview traverses the evolution and successful adoption in the various industry verticals. This article is categorized under:

TI Risks and benefits of dermatological machine learning health care
   applications-an overview and ethical analysis
SO JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY
AB Background Visual data are particularly amenable for machine learning techniques. With clinical photography established for skin surveillance and documentation purposes as well as progress checks, dermatology is an ideal field for the development and application of emerging machine learning health care applications (ML-HCAs). To date, several ML-HCAs have detected malignant skin lesions on par with experts or found overlooked visual patterns that correlate with certain dermatological diseases. However, it is well established that ML-HCAs come with ethical and social implications. Objectives Currently, there is a lack of research that establishes model design, training, usage and regulation of such technologies sufficient to ensure ethically and socially responsible development and clinical translation, specifically within the field of dermatology. With this paper, we aim to give an overview of currently discussed ethical issues relating to dermatological ML-HCAs. Methods On the basis of a thematic, keyword-based literature search, we performed an ethical analysis against established frameworks of biomedical ethics. We combined our results with current, relevant normative machine learning ethics literature to identify the status quo of the ethics of ML-HCAs in dermatology. We describe the benefits and risks of dermatological ML-HCAs that are currently being developed for clinical purposes. Results The potential benefits range from better patient outcomes to better knowledge accessibility to decreasing health care disparities, that is, standards of care between different population groups. The risks associated with ML-HCAs range from confidentiality issues to individual patient outcomes as well as the exacerbation of prevalent health care disparities. We discuss the practical implications for all stages of dermatological ML-HCA development. Conclusion We found that ML-HCAs present stakeholder-specific risks for patients, health care professionals and society, which need to be considered separately. The discipline lacks sufficient biomedical ethics research that could standardize the approach to ML-HCA model design, training, use and regulation of such technologies.

TI Using clinical information to make individualized prognostic predictions
   in people at ultra high risk for psychosis
SO SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH
AB Recent studies have reported an association between psychopathology and subsequent clinical and functional outcomes in people at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis. This has led to the suggestion that psychopathological information could be used to make prognostic predictions in this population. However, because the current literature is based on inferences at group level, the translational value of the findings for everyday clinical practice is unclear. Here we examined whether psychopathological information could be used to make individualized predictions about clinical and functional outcomes in people at UHR. Participants included 416 people at UHR followed prospectively at the Personal Assessment and Crisis Evaluation (PACE) Clinic in Melbourne, Australia. The data were analysed using Support Vector Machine (SVM), a supervised machine learning technique that allows inferences at the individual level. SVM predicted transition to psychosis with a specificity of 60.6%, a sensitivity of 68.6% and an accuracy of 64.6% (p < 0.001). In addition, SVM predicted functioning with a specificity of 62.5%, a sensitivity of 62.5% and an accuracy of 62.5% (p = 0.008). Prediction of transition was driven by disorder of thought content, attenuated positive symptoms and functioning, whereas functioning was best predicted by attention disturbances, anhedonia-asociality and disorder of thought content. These results indicate that psychopathological information allows individualized prognostic predictions with statistically significant accuracy. However, this level of accuracy may not be sufficient for clinical translation in real-world clinical practice. Accuracy might be improved by combining psychopathological information with other types of data using a multivariate machine learning framework. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Swept Mechanism of Micro-Milling Tool Geometry Effect on Machined Oxygen
   Free High Conductivity Copper (OFHC) Surface Roughness
SO MATERIALS
AB Cutting tool geometry should be very much considered in micro-cutting because it has a significant effect on the topography and accuracy of the machined surface, particularly considering the uncut chip thickness is comparable to the cutting edge radius. The objective of this paper was to clarify the influence of the mechanism of the cutting tool geometry on the surface topography in the micro-milling process. Four different cutting tools including two two-fluted end milling tools with different helix angles of 15 degrees and 30 degrees cutting tools, as well as two three-fluted end milling tools with different helix angles of 15 degrees and 30 degrees were investigated by combining theoretical modeling analysis with experimental research. The tool geometry was mathematically modeled through coordinate translation and transformation to make all three cutting edges at the cutting tool tip into the same coordinate system. Swept mechanisms, minimum uncut chip thickness, and cutting tool run-out were considered on modeling surface roughness parameters (the height of surface roughness R-z and average surface roughness R-a) based on the established mathematical model. A set of cutting experiments was carried out using four different shaped cutting tools. It was found that the sweeping volume of the cutting tool increases with the decrease of both the cutting tool helix angle and the flute number. Great coarse machined surface roughness and more non-uniform surface topography are generated when the sweeping volume increases. The outcome of this research should bring about new methodologies for micro-end milling tool design and manufacturing. The machined surface roughness can be improved by appropriately selecting the tool geometrical parameters.

TI Meeting in the middle: Hybrid clay three-dimensional fabrication
   processes for bio-reef structures
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL COMPUTING
AB Despite the relative accessibility of clay, its low cost and reputation as a robust and sustainable building material, clay three-dimensional printing remains an under-utilized digital fabrication technique in the production of architectural artefacts. Given this, numerous research projects have sought to extend the viability of clay three-dimensional digital fabrication by streamlining and automating workflows through computational methods and robotic technologies in ways that afford agency to the digital and machinic processes over human bodily skill. Three-dimensional printed clay has also gained prominence as a resilient material well suited to the design and fabrication of artificial reef and habitat-enhancing seawall structures for coastal marine environments depleted and disrupted by human activity, climate change and pollution. Still, these projects face similar challenges when three-dimensional printing complex forms from the highly plastic and somewhat unpredictable feed material of clay. In response, this article outlines a research project that seeks to improve the translation of complex geometries into physical clay artefacts through additive three-dimensional printing processes by drawing on the notion of digital craft and giving focus to human-machine interaction as a collaborative practice. Through the case study of the 1:1 scale fabrication of a computationally generated bio-reef structure using clay as a feed material and a readily available Delta Potterbot XLS-2 ceramic printer, the research project documents how, by exploiting the human ability to intuitively handle clay and adapt, and the machine's ability to work efficiently and with precision, humans and machines can fabricate together. With the urgent need to develop more sustainable building practices and materials, this research contributes valuable knowledge of hybrid fabrication processes towards extending the accessibility and viability of clay three-dimensional printing as a resilient material and fabrication system.

AB The 'take-make-dispose' consumption model that remains shackled to the global economy, is also affecting production assets. Industry is promoting the transition to a circular economy (CE). Deployment of the evolving digital technologies and realisation of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) enhance machines automation, connectivity and provide large amounts of data that can be interpreted in a way that were not possible before. It offers to companies the opportunity to retrofit their legacy equipment that cannot meet the constantly increasing market demands. This helps to extend the useful lifetime of this equipment and accelerate the transition to a CE. However, Industry is still lacking an efficient systemic multi-level approach that enables a cost-effective, holistic, and integrated application of CE principles to the digital uplifting of factory 4.0 capital investments. Companies and particularly SMEs face diverse challenges for implementing I4.0 systems in their businesses due to lack of knowledge, expertise and investment. The translation of CE strategies into concrete actions will help professionals to consider circularity measures in a broad sense.
   This paper introduces the 10 Circularity Protocols for extending the useful life of large industrial equipment, addressing issues at product, machine, and process level. With guidance on the application of I4.0 technologies, the Protocols help to digitally re-engineer outdated machines to be more productive and energy-efficient, to decrease maintenance downtime, spare-parts storage and off-spec pieces. The Protocols also support on the End-of-Life (EoL) management of the different machine components that are not technically, economically and environmentally feasible to be reused or repaired. As a final step, the future research line and methodology focusing on the digital implementation of the Circularity Protocols guidelines for their deployment and validation in real industrial cases is introduced.

TI Hybrid tooling by a combination of high speed cutting and
   electrochemical milling with ultrashort voltage pulses
SO MICROSYSTEM TECHNOLOGIES-MICRO-AND NANOSYSTEMS-INFORMATION STORAGE AND
   PROCESSING SYSTEMS
AB Electrochemical machining with ultra short voltage pulses (ECF) is an innovative technique to machine electrochemically active materials at micrometer feature size, particularly hard materials like stainless steel. Because ECF is an electrochemical process the workpiece as well as the tool are submerged in an appropriate electrolyte. The workpiece is electrochemically etched by a galvanic current. Therefore no mechanical forces, no thermal load and no tool wear occurs. Due to the use of short voltage pulses in the range of 10-200 ns the electrochemical process is confined to a small area around the tool. The ability to manufacture microstructures even in stainless steel makes ECF the ideal technique for the processing of micro moulds. For a higher through-put and a reasonable size of the moulds it is useful to manufacture the micro moulds in two steps. First conventional high precision milling is used to manufacture the main structure. Afterwards the structure is finished by the ECF process. Since these two steps are carried out on two different machines, the workpiece has to be aligned in the ECF machine after the milling process. Using a matching strategy alignment errors like rotation to the xy-plane, errors in scaling of the length of the axis and translation in the xy-plane can be corrected automatically by transforming the CAD/CAM data in a way that they match the two co-ordinate systems. It is shown by test-pattern that this strategy works very accurately. There is almost no mismatch between the HSC pre-milled structure and the ECF added microstructure in the different examples shown here. This investigation shows that hybrid tooling with ECF is a time saving approach to add microstructures with the ECF-process into pre-milled moulds. Therefore hybrid tooling has a high potential to become one of the leading techniques to manufacture cavities, e.g. for micro moulds in stainless steel.

TI Flexible Scanning Method by Integrating Laser Line Sensors with
   Articulated Arm Coordinate Measuring Machines
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
AB Measuring and reconstructing the shape of workpieces have been considered as a fundamental step in both reverse engineering and product quality control. Owing to increasing structural complexity of recent products, measurements from multiple directions are typically required in current scanning techniques. Specifically, the plane structured light can be applied to measure one area of a part at a time, with an additional algorithm required to merge the collected data of each area. Alternatively, the line structured light sensor integrated on CNC machines or CMMs could also realize multi-view measurement. However, the system needs to be repeatedly calibrated at each new direction. This paper presents a flexible scanning method by integrating laser line sensors with articulated arm coordinate measuring machines (AACMM). Since the output of the laser line sensor is 2D raw data in the laser plane, our system model introduces an explicit transformation from the 2D sensor coordinate frame to the 3D base coordinate frame of the AACMM (i.e., the translation and rotation the of the 2D sensor coordinate in the sixth coordinate system of AACMM). To solve the model, the "conjugate pairs" are proposed and identified by measuring a fixed point (e.g., a sphere center). Moreover, a search algorithm is adopted to find the optimal solution, which noticeably boosts the model accuracy. The experimental results show that the error of the system is about 0.2 mm, which is caused by the error of the AACMM, the sensor error and the calibration error. By measuring a complicated part, the proposed system is proved to be flexible and facilitate, with the ability to measure a part expediently from any necessary direction. Furthermore, the proposed calibration method can also be used for robot hand-eye relationship calibration.

TI Normothermic Machine Perfusion (NMP) of the Liver as a Platform for
   Therapeutic Interventions during Ex-Vivo Liver Preservation: A Review
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB Liver transplantation is increasingly dependent on the use of extended criteria donors (ECD) to increase the organ donor pool and address rising demand. This has necessitated the adoption of innovative technologies and strategies to protect these higher-risk grafts from the deleterious effects of traditional preservation and ischaemia reperfusion injury (IRI). The advent of normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) and rapid growth in the clinical adoption of this technology has accelerated efforts to utilise NMP as a platform for therapeutic intervention to optimise donor livers. In this review we will explore the emerging preclinical data related to ameliorating the effects of IRI, protecting the microcirculation and reducing the immunogenicity of donor organs during NMP. Exploiting the window of opportunity afforded by NMP, whereby the liver can be continuously supported and functionally assessed while therapies are directly delivered during the preservation period, has clear logistical and theoretical advantages over current preservation methods. The clinical translation of many of the therapeutic agents and strategies we will describe is becoming more feasible with widespread adaptation of NMP devices and rapid advances in molecular biology and gene therapy, which have substantially improved the performance of these agents. The delivery of novel therapeutics during NMP represents one of the new frontiers in transplantation research and offers real potential for successfully tackling fundamental challenges in transplantation such as IRI.

TI Neuron-Type-Specific Utility in a Brain-Machine Interface: a Pilot Study
SO JOURNAL OF SPINAL CORD MEDICINE
CT 7th National Spinal Cord Injury Conference
CY NOV 09-11, 2017
CL Niagara Falls, CANADA
AB Context: Firing rates of single cortical neurons can be volitionally modulated through biofeedback (i.e. operant conditioning), and this information can be transformed to control external devices (i.e. brain-machine interfaces; BMIs). However, not all neurons respond to operant conditioning in BMI implementation. Establishing criteria that predict neuron utility will assist translation of BMI research to clinical applications.
   Findings: Single cortical neurons (n= 7) were recorded extracellularly from primary motor cortex of a Long-Evans rat. Recordings were incorporated into a BMI involving up-regulation of firing rate to control the brightness of a light-emitting-diode and subsequent reward. Neurons were classified as 'fast-spiking', 'bursting' or 'regular-spiking' according to waveform-width and intrinsic firing patterns. Fast-spiking and bursting neurons were found to up-regulate firing rate by a factor of 2.43 +/- 1.16, demonstrating high utility, while regular-spiking neurons decreased firing rates on average by a factor of 0.73 +/- 0.23, demonstrating low utility.
   Conclusion/Clinical Relevance: The ability to select neurons with high utility will be important to minimize training times and maximize information yield in future clinical BMI applications. The highly contrasting utility observed between fast-spiking and bursting neurons versus regular-spiking neurons allows for the hypothesis to be advanced that intrinsic electrophysiological properties may be useful criteria that predict neuron utility in BMI implementation.

TI Prediction of Bacterial sRNAs Using Sequence-Derived Features and
   Machine Learning
SO BIOINFORMATICS AND BIOLOGY INSIGHTS
AB Small ribonucleic acid (sRNA) sequences are 50-500 nucleotide long, noncoding RNA (ncRNA) sequences that play an important role in regulating transcription and translation within a bacterial cell. As such, identifying sRNA sequences within an organism's genome is essential to understand the impact of the RNA molecules on cellular processes. Recently, numerous machine learning models have been applied to predict sRNAs within bacterial genomes. In this study, we considered the sRNA prediction as an imbalanced binary classification problem to distinguish minor positive sRNAs from major negative ones within imbalanced data and then performed a comparative study with six learning algorithms and seven assessment metrics. First, we collected numerical feature groups extracted from known sRNAs previously identified in Salmonella typhimurium LT2 (SLT2) and Escherichia coli K12 (E. coli K12) genomes. Second, as a preliminary study, we characterized the sRNA-size distribution with the conformity test for Benford's law. Third, we applied six traditional classification algorithms to sRNA features and assessed classification performance with seven metrics, varying positive-to-negative instance ratios, and utilizing stratified 10-fold cross-validation. We revisited important individual features and feature groups and found that classification with combined features perform better than with either an individual feature or a single feature group in terms of Area Under Precision-Recall curve (AUPR). We reconfirmed that AUPR properly measures classification performance on imbalanced data with varying imbalance ratios, which is consistent with previous studies on classification metrics for imbalanced data. Overall, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), even without exploiting optimal hyperparameter values, performed better than the other five algorithms with specific optimal parameter settings. As a future work, we plan to extend XGBoost further to a large amount of published sRNAs in bacterial genomes and compare its classification performance with recent machine learning models' performance.

TI Radiomics analysis of EPID measurements for patient positioning error
   detection in thyroid associated ophthalmopathy radiotherapy
SO PHYSICA MEDICA-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PHYSICS
AB Purpose: Electronic portal imaging detector (EPID)-based patient positioning verification is an important component of safe radiotherapy treatment delivery. In computer simulation studies, learning-based approaches have proven to be superior to conventional gamma analysis in the detection of positioning errors. To approximate a clinical scenario, the detectability of positioning errors via EPID measurements was assessed using radiomics analysis for patients with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy. Methods: Treatment plans of 40 patients with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy were delivered to a solid anthropomorphic head phantom. To simulate positioning errors, combinations of 0-, 2-, and 4-mm translation errors in the left-right (LR), superior-inferior (SI), and anterior-posterior (AP) directions were introduced to the phantom. The positioning errors-induced dose differences between measured portal dose images were used to predict the magnitude and direction of positioning errors. The detectability of positioning errors was assessed via radiomics analysis of the dose differences. Three classification models-support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and XGBoost-were used for the detection of positioning errors (positioning errors larger or smaller than 3 mm in an arbitrary direction) and direction classification (positioning errors larger or smaller than 3 mm in a specific direction). The receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the performance of classification models. Results: For the detection of positioning errors, the AUC values of SVM, KNN, and XGBoost models were all above 0.90. For LR, SI, and AP direction classification, the highest AUC values were 0.76, 0.91, and 0.80, respectively. Conclusions: Combined radiomics and machine learning approaches are capable of detecting the magnitude and direction of positioning errors from EPID measurements. This study is a further step toward machine learningbased positioning error detection during treatment delivery with EPID measurements.

TI Math-word embedding in math search and semantic extraction
SO SCIENTOMETRICS
AB Word embedding, which represents individual words with semantically fixed-length vectors, has made it possible to successfully apply deep learning to natural language processing tasks such as semantic role-modeling, question answering, and machine translation. As math text consists of natural text, as well as math expressions that similarly exhibit linear correlation and contextual characteristics, word embedding techniques can also be applied to math documents. However, while mathematics is a precise and accurate science, it is usually expressed through imprecise and less accurate descriptions, contributing to the relative dearth of machine learning applications for information retrieval in this domain. Generally, mathematical documents communicate their knowledge with an ambiguous, context-dependent, and non-formal language. Given recent advances in word embedding, it is worthwhile to explore their use and effectiveness in math information retrieval tasks, such as math language processing and semantic knowledge extraction. In this paper, we explore math embedding by testing it on several different scenarios, namely, (1) math-term similarity, (2) analogy, (3) numerical concept-modeling based on the centroid of the keywords that characterize a concept, (4) math search using query expansions, and (5) semantic extraction, i.e., extracting descriptive phrases for math expressions. Due to the lack of benchmarks, our investigations were performed using the arXiv collection of STEM documents and carefully selected illustrations on the Digital Library of Mathematical Functions (DLMF: NIST digital library of mathematical functions. Release 1.0.20 of 2018-09-1, 2018). Our results show that math embedding holds much promise for similarity, analogy, and search tasks. However, we also observed the need for more robust math embedding approaches. Moreover, we explore and discuss fundamental issues that we believe thwart the progress in mathematical information retrieval in the direction of machine learning.

AB Retrieve-and-edit seq2seq methods typically retrieve an output from the training set and learn a model to edit it to produce the final output. We propose to extend this framework with a simple and effective post-generation ranking approach. Our framework (i) retrieves several potentially relevant outputs for each input, (ii) edits each candidate independently, and (iii) re-ranks the edited candidates to select the final output. We use a standard editing model with simple task-specific re-ranking approaches, and we show empirically that this approach outperforms existing, significantly more complex methodologies. Experiments on two machine translation (MT) datasets show new state-of-art results. We also achieve near state-of-art performance on the Gigaword summarization dataset, where our analyses show that there is significant room for performance improvement with better candidate output selection in future work.

This monstrous world is promising in that it is made of articulations that exhibit the interdependence where we are, animals, humans, machines; it substitutes for the "I" of "who am I ?" the question of a "we" necessarily more open and contingent. Answer the question "who are we ?" requires agreements, moves, translations and connections, but we are freeing from paranoia, segregation, borders and invaders, security policies and redeeming apocalypses.

The main objective has been the construction of an open, reusable and interoperable framework which can be improved in the next future combining it with the statistical model. The MT architecture reuses several open tools and it is based on an unique XML format for the flow between the different modules, which makes easer the interaction among different developers of tools and resources. Being Basque a resource-poor language this is a key feature in our aim for future improvements and extensions of the engine. The result is an open source software which can be downloaded from matxin.sourceforge.net, and we think it could be adapted to translating between other languages with few resources.

Firstly a probabilistic enhanced framework is used to represent sub-dialog, which consists of three parts, the input model for extracting features, the enhanced model for updating dialog state and the output model to give the tracking frame. Meanwhile, parallel language systems are proposed to overcome inaccuracy caused by machine translation for cross language testing. We also introduce a new iterative alignment method extended from our work in DSTC4. Furthermore, a slot-based score averaging method is introduced to build an ensemble by combining different trackers. Results of our DSTC5 system show that our method significantly improves tracking performance compared with baseline method.

AB Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is an essential task in computational linguistics for language understanding applications such as information retrieval, question answering, machine translation, text summarization etc. In this paper we propose an unsupervised WSD method for a Hindi sentence based on network agglomeration. First we create the sentence graph G for the given sentence. This sentence graph collectively represents all the interpretations of the sentence. Now from this sentence graph G we create the interpretation graph G' subset of G for each of the interpretation of the sentence. To identify the desired interpretation we compute network agglomeration for all the interpretation graphs. Thus the relevant interpretation having highest value of network agglomeration is identified. The results on the standard sense tagged corpus show better performance for the proposed method than the previous approaches.

The patterns in video are modeled with hierarchical hidden Markov models (HHMM), with efficient algorithms to learn the parameters. the model complexity, and the relevant features: the meanings are contained in words of the speech transcript of the video. The pattern-word association is obtained Via co-occurrence analysis and statistical machine translation models. Promising results are obtained through extensive experiments on 20+ hours of TRECVID news videos: video patterns that associate with distinct topics Such as el-nino and politics are identified: the HHMM temporal structure model compares favorably to a non-temporal clustering algorithm.

AB The quality and quantity of parallel sentences are known as very important training data for constructing neural machine translation (N-MT) systems. However, these resources are not available for many low-resource language pairs. Many existing methods need strong supervision and hence are not suitable. Although there have been several attempts at developing unsupervised models, they ignore the language-invariant between languages. In this paper, we propose an approach based on transfer learning to mine parallel sentences in an unsupervised setting. With the help of bilingual corpora of rich-resource language pairs, we can mine parallel sentences without bilingual supervision of low-resource language pairs. Experiments show that our approach improves the performance of mined parallel sentences compared with previous methods. In particular, we achieve good results at two real-world low-resource language pairs.

Computer-aided retrosynthesis can potentially assist chemists in designing synthetic routes; however, at present, it is cumbersome and cannot provide satisfactory results. In this study, we have developed a template-free self-corrected retrosynthesis predictor (SCROP) to predict retrosynthesis using transformer neural networks. In the method, the retrosynthesis planning was converted to a machine translation problem from the products to molecular linear notations of the reactants. By coupling with a neural network-based syntax corrector, our method achieved an accuracy of 59.0% on a standard benchmark data set, which outperformed other deep learning methods by >21% and template-based methods by >6%. More importantly, our method was 1.7 times more accurate than other state-of-the-art methods for compounds not appearing in the training set.

Parallel text alignment is important because linguistic information can be retrieved from the result of alignment which including bilingual dictionaries and grammars correspondence of each language. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach for standard Malay-dialectal Malay parallel text alignment. The Malay dialects in Malaysia can be grouped according to the states such as Perak dialect, Kedah dialect and Terengganu dialect. It is important to learn Malay dialects as it is still flourished and widely used in many areas especially for unofficial matters. Kelantanese Malay is used as an example for dialectal Malay in this research. The obtained precision and recall values of the proposed alignment methods are above 90%.

TI Img2Mol-accurate SMILES recognition from molecular graphical depictions
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB The automatic recognition of the molecular content of a molecule's graphical depiction is an extremely challenging problem that remains largely unsolved despite decades of research. Recent advances in neural machine translation enable the auto-encoding of molecular structures in a continuous vector space of fixed size (latent representation) with low reconstruction errors. In this paper, we present a fast and accurate model combining deep convolutional neural network learning from molecule depictions and a pre-trained decoder that translates the latent representation into the SMILES representation of the molecules. This combination allows us to precisely infer a molecular structure from an image.

TI Atlas of Subcellular RNA Localization Revealed by APEX-Seq
SO CELL
AB We introduce APEX-seq, a method for RNA sequencing based on direct proximity labeling of RNA using the peroxidase enzyme APEX2. APEX-seq in nine distinct subcellular locales produced a nanometer-resolution spatial map of the human transcriptome as a resource, revealing extensive patterns of localization for diverse RNA classes and transcript isoforms. We uncover a radial organization of the nuclear transcriptome, which is gated at the inner surface of the nuclear pore for cytoplasmic export of processed transcripts. We identify two distinct pathways of messenger RNA localization to mitochondria, each associated with specific sets of transcripts for building complementary macromolecular machines within the organelle. APEX-seq should be widely applicable to many systems, enabling comprehensive investigations of the spatial transcriptome.

AB Novel deep learning and machine translation techniques have greatly advanced the field of computational linguistics enabling us to find meaningful latent spaces for text analysis. While several embedding techniques exist for words, sentences, and entire documents, the potential applications are still being explored. In this paper we present the impact of top-performing sentence embedding methodologies on the accuracy of a neural model trained to assess the quality of English sentences. We focus our efforts in the methodologies called Language Agnostic SEntence Representation (LASER), Sentence to Vector (S2V), and Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) to observe their ability to capture information related to sentence quality. Our study suggests that these state-of-the-art sentence embeddings are unable to capture sufficient information regarding sentence correctness and quality in the English language.

AB A user of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) system must be able to control external computer devices with brain activity. Although the proof-of-concept was given decades ago, the reliable translation of user intent into device control commands is still a major challenge. There are problems associated with classification of different BCI tasks. In this paper we propose the use of chaotic indices of the BCI. We use largest Lyapunov exponent, mutual information, correlation dimension and minimum embedding dimension as the features for the classification of EEG signals which have been released by BCI Competition IV. A multi-layer Perceptron classifier and a KM-SVM(support vector machine classifier based on k-means clustering) is used for classification process, which lead us to an accuracy of 95.5%, for discrimination between two motor imagery tasks.

AB We suggest two approaches to incorporate syntactic information into transformer models encoding trees (e.g. abstract syntax trees) and generating sequences. First, we use self-attention with relative position representations to consider structural relationships between nodes using a representation that encodes movements between any pair of nodes in the tree, and demonstrate how those movements can be computed efficiently on the fly. Second, we suggest an auxiliary loss enforcing the network to predict the lowest common ancestor of node pairs. We apply both methods to source code summarization tasks, where we outperform the state-of-the-art by up to 6% F1. On natural language machine translation, our models yield competitive results. We also consistently outperform sequence-based transformers, and demonstrate that our method yields representations that are more closely aligned with the AST structure.

AB Transformer neural networks (TNN) demonstrated state-of-art performance on many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, replacing recurrent neural networks (RNNs), such as LSTMs or GRUs. However, TNNs did not perform well in speech enhancement, whose contextual nature is different than NLP tasks, like machine translation. Self-attention is a core building block of the Transformer, which not only enables parallelization of sequence computation, but also provides the constant path length between symbols that is essential to learning long-range dependencies. In this paper, we propose a Transformer with Gaussian-weighted self-attention (T-GSA), whose attention weights are attenuated according to the distance between target and context symbols. The experimental results show that the proposed T-GSA has significantly improved speech-enhancement performance, compared to the Transformer and RNNs.

AB A tree transducer with origin translates an input tree into a pair of output tree and origin info. The origin info maps each node in the output tree to the unique input node that created it. In this way, the implementation of the transducer becomes part of its semantics. We show that the landscape of decidable properties changes drastically when origin info is added. For instance, equivalence of nondeterministic top-down and MSO transducers with origin is decidable. Both problems are undecidable without origin. The equivalence of deterministic top-down tree-to-string transducers is decidable with origin, while without origin it is a long standing open problem. With origin, we can decide if a deterministic macro tree transducer can be realized by a deterministic top-down tree transducer; without origin this is an open problem.

AB Semantic Interoperability is a major issue for National Spatial data Infrastructures (NSDIs) and mapping across heterogeneous databases is essential for such interoperability. Mapping of schemas based on ontology mapping provides opportunities for semantic translation of schemas elements and hence for database queries across heterogeneous sources. Such semantics based mappings are usually human centered processes. This paper demonstrates semi-automatic mapping using semantic similarity values from an electronic lexicon. Lexical similarity of class names and class structures constitute knowledge base for mapping between two schemas. We employ semantic mapping based on synonym similarity matches from WordNet. We use heuristics based propagation of similarities using attribute mapping and superclass-subclass relations. The machine based similarity values are seen to be comparable to human generated values of mapping.

TI Unmanned machine vision system for automated recognition of mechanical
   parts
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT UNMANNED SYSTEMS
AB Purpose The field of machine vision, or computer vision, has been growing at fast pace. The growth in this field, unlike most established fields, has been both in breadth and depth of concepts and techniques. Machine vision techniques are being applied in areas ranging from medical imaging to remote sensing, industrial inspection to document processing and nanotechnology to multimedia databases. The goal of a machine vision system is to create a model of the real world from images. Computer vision recognition has attracted the attention of researchers in many application areas and has been used to solve many ranges of problems. The purpose of this paper is to consider recognition of objects manufactured in mechanical industry. Mechanically manufactured parts have recognition difficulties due to manufacturing process including machine malfunctioning, tool wear and variations in raw material. This paper considers the problem of recognizing and classifying the objects of such parts. RGB images of five objects are used as an input. The Fourier descriptor technique is used for recognition of objects. Artificial neural network (ANN) is used for classification of five different objects. These objects are kept in different orientations for invariant rotation, translation and scaling. The feed forward neural network with back-propagation learning algorithm is used to train the network. This paper shows the effect of different network architecture and numbers of hidden nodes on the classification accuracy of objects.
   Design/methodology/approach The overall goal of this research is to develop algorithms for feature-based recognition of 2D parts from intensity images. Most present industrial vision systems are custom-designed systems, which can only handle a specific application. This is not surprising, since different applications have different geometry, different reflectance properties of the parts.
   Findings Classification accuracy is affected by the changing network architecture. ANN is computationally demanding and slow. A total of 20 hidden nodes network structure produced the best results at 500 iterations (90 percent accuracy based on overall accuracy and 87.50 percent based on coefficient). So, 20 hidden nodes are selected for further analysis. The learning rate is set to 0.1, and momentum term used is 0.2 that give the best results architectures. The confusion matrix also shows the accuracy of the classifier. Hence, with these results the proposed system can be used efficiently for more objects.
   Originality/value After calculating the variation of overall accuracy with different network architectures, the results of different configuration of the sample size of 50 testing images are taken. Table II shows the results of the confusion matrix obtained on these testing samples of objects.

AB While frame-independent predictions with deep neural networks have become the prominent solutions to many computer vision tasks, the potential benefits of utilizing correlations between frames have received less attention. Even though probabilistic machine learning provides the ability to encode correlation as prior knowledge for inference, there is a tangible gap between the theory and practice of applying probabilistic methods to modern vision problems. For this, we derive a principled framework to combine information coupling between camera poses (translation and orientation) with deep models. We proposed a novel view kernel that generalizes the standard periodic kernel in SO (3). We show how this soft-prior knowledge can aid several pose-related vision tasks like novel view synthesis and predict arbitrary points in the latent space of generative models, pointing towards a range of new applications for inter-frame reasoning.

AB Text Normalization (TN) is an essential part in conversational systems like text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) and automatic speech recognition (ASR). It is a process of transforming non-standard words (NSW) into a representation of how the words are to be spoken. Existing approaches to TN are mainly rule-based or hybrid systems, which require abundant handcrafted rules. In this paper, we treat TN as a neural machine translation problem and present a pure data-driven TN system using Transformer framework. Partial Parameter Generator (PPG) and Pointer-Generator Network (PGN) are combined in our model to improve accuracy of normalization and act as auxiliary modules to reduce the number of simple errors. The experiments demonstrate that our proposed model reaches remarkable performance on various semiotic classes.

AB Multi-head attention is appealing for its ability to jointly extract different types of information from multiple representation subspaces. Concerning the information aggregation, a common practice is to use a concatenation followed by a linear transformation, which may not fully exploit the expressiveness of multi-head attention. In this work, we propose to improve the information aggregation for multi-head attention with a more powerful routing-by-agreement algorithm. Specifically, the routing algorithm iteratively updates the proportion of how much a part (i.e. the distinct information learned from a specific subspace) should be assigned to a whole (i.e. the final output representation), based on the agreement between parts and wholes. Experimental results on linguistic probing tasks and machine translation tasks prove the superiority of the advanced information aggregation over the standard linear transformation.

In this context our system is based on two main components: a lexicon including 2363 attested nouns, and a set of rules covering the morphotactic and morphological phenomena observed in standard amazigh texts. The choice of finite-state technology makes our system bidirectional (analyzer / generator) and able to cover all variations of amazigh noun (gender, number, state) and to realize an important accuracy (system recognition) which reaches about 77%. This system is an added value for the implementation for other applications like spellchecking, machine translation, and computer aided language learning. (C) 2017 The Authors.

This paper presents a new MDOF displacement measurement system that is composed of a laser diode (LD), two position-sensitive detectors (PSDs), and a conventional diffraction grating. It utilizes typical features of a diffraction grating to obtain the information of MDOF displacement. MDOF displacement is calculated from the independent coordinate values of the diffracted ray spots on the PSDs. Forward and inverse kinematic problems were solved to compute the MDOF displacement of an object. Experimental results show maximum absolute errors of less than +/-10 micrometers in translation and +/-30 arcsecs in rotation.

AB The number of people suffering from mental health issues like depression and anxiety have spiked enormously in recent times. Conversational agents like chatbots have emerged as an effective way for users to express their feelings and anxious thoughts and in turn obtain some empathetic reply that would relieve their anxiety. In our work, we construct two types of empathetic conversational agent models based on sequence-to-sequence modeling with and without attention mechanism. We implement the attention mechanism proposed by Bandanau et al for neural machine translation models. We train our model on the benchmark Facebook Empathetic Dialogue dataset and the BLEU scores are computed. Our empathetic conversational agent model incorporating attention mechanism generates better quality empathetic responses and is better in capturing human feelings and emotions in the conversation.

AB Detection of multiword expressions is an important pre-task in several research topics such as natural language understanding, automatic text summarization, and machine translation in the area of natural language processing.
   In this study, detection of multiword expressions in Turkish texts is accepted as a classification problem. 6 types of linguistic features are defined solving this problem in Turkish texts. The classification tests are performed by 10 different classifiers utilizing the prepared data set. The performance of classifiers is measured for different sizes of random train-test sets by running the tests 10 times. The test results showed that linguistic features can be used in identification of multiword expressions. And it is observed that SMO and J48 algorithms reached the highest classification performances based on different evaluation metrics.

TI English syntactic disambiguation using Parser's ambiguity type
   information
SO ETRI JOURNAL
AB This paper describes a rule-based approach for syntactic disambiguation used by the English sentence parser in E-TRAN 2001, an English-Korean machine translation system. We propose Parser's Ambiguity Type Information (PATI) to automatically identify the types of ambiguities observed in competing candidate trees produced by the parser and synthesize the types into a formal representation. PATI provides an efficient way of encoding knowledge into grammar rules and calculating rule preference scores from a relatively small training corpus. In the overall scoring scheme for sorting the candidate trees, the rule preference scores are combined with other preference functions that are based on statistical information. We compare the enhanced grammar with the initial one in terms of the amount of ambiguity. The experimental results show that the rule preference scores could significantly increase the accuracy of ambiguity resolution.

SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB The volume of electronic text in different languages, particularly on the World Wide Web, is growing significantly, and the problem of users who are restricted in the number of languages they read obtaining information from this text is becoming more widespread. This article investigates some of the issues involved in achieving multilingual information extraction (IE), describes the approach adopted in the M-LaSIE-II IE system, which addresses these problems, and presents the results of evaluating the approach against a small pal allel corpus ofEnglish/French newswire texts. The approach is based on the assumption that it is possible to construct a language independent representation of concepts relevant to the domain, at least for the small well-defined domains typical of IE tasks, allowing multilingual IE to be successfully carried out without requiring full machine translation.

   Recently, advances in wearable technologies, data science and machine learning have begun to transform evidence-based medicine, offering a tantalizing glimpse into a future of next-generation 'deep' medicine. Despite stunning advances in basic science and technology, clinical translations in major areas of medicine are lagging. While the COVID-19 pandemic exposed inherent systemic limitations of the clinical trial landscape, it also spurred some positive changes, including new trial designs and a shift toward a more patient-centric and intuitive evidence-generation system. In this Perspective, I share my heuristic vision of the future of clinical trials and evidence-based medicine.

AB Aspart of speech is a fundamental step in syntactic parsing and machine translation, this paper proposes an English part of speech tagging method based on maximum entropy, and this issue is very crucial for natural language processing. The proposed part of speech tagging system is made up of two steps, that is, (a) Training process and (b) Tagging process. Maximum Entropy estimation is able to compute Probability Density Function of the random variables, and in this paper, we solve the problem of tagging part of speech for English by tackling an optimization problem using maximum entropy. Using the ISO-639-1 code: EN dataset, a series of experiments are conducted. Finally, experimental results prove that the proposed method is very effective to tag part of speech for English.

SO INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT
AB Is Cross-Language answer finding harder than Monolingual answer finding for users? In this paper we provide initial quantitative and qualitative evidence to answer this question.
   In our study, which involves 16 users searching questions under four different system conditions, we find that interactive cross-language answer finding is not substantially harder (in terms of accuracy) than its monolingual counterpart, using general purpose Machine Translation systems and standard Information Retrieval machinery, although it takes more time. We have also seen that users need more context to provide accurate answers (full documents) than what is usually considered by systems (paragraphs or passages).
   Finally, we also discuss the limitations of standard evaluation methodologies for interactive Information Retrieval experiments in the case of cross-language question answering. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Incremental language modeling for automatic transcription of broadcast

SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB In this paper, we address the task of incremental language modeling for automatic transcription of broadcast news speech. Daily broadcast news naturally contains new words that are not in the lexicon of the speech recognition system but are important for downstream applications such as information retrieval or machine translation. To recognize those new words, the lexicon and the language model of the speech recognition system need to be updated periodically. We propose a method of estimating a list of words to be added to the lexicon based on some time-series text data. The experimental results on the RT04 Broadcast News data and other TV audio data showed that this method provided an impressive and stable reduction in both out-of-vocabulary rates and speech recognition word error rates.

AB Benchmarks can be a useful step toward the goals of the field (when the benchmark is on the critical path), as demonstrated by the GLUE benchmark, and deep nets such as BERT and ERNIE. The case for other benchmarks such as MUSE and WN18RR is less well established. Hopefully, these benchmarks are on a critical path toward progress on bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) and knowledge graph completion (KGC). Many KGC algorithms have been proposed such as Trans[DEHRM], but it remains to be seen how this work improves WordNet coverage. Given how much work is based on these benchmarks, the literature should have more to say than it does about the connection between benchmarks and goals. Is optimizing P@10 on WN18RR likely to produce more complete knowledge graphs? Is MUSE likely to improve Machine Translation?

AB ReFr (http://refr.googlecode.com) is a software architecture for specifying, training and using reranking models, which take the n-best output of some existing system and produce new scores for each of then hypotheses that potentially induce a different ranking, ideally yielding better results than the original system. The Reranker Framework has some special support for building discriminative language models, but can be applied to any reranking problem. The framework is designed with parallelism and scalability in mind, being able to run on any Hadoop cluster out of the box. While extremely efficient, ReFr is also quite flexible, allowing researchers to explore a wide variety of features and learning methods. ReFr has been used for building state-of-the-art discriminative LM's for both speech recognition and machine translation systems.

The Health Terminology/Ontology Portal (HeTOP) is a tool dedicated to both human beings and computers to access and browse biomedical terminologies or ontologies (T/O). The objective of this work was to integrate the HPO into HeTOP in order to enhance both works. This integration is a success and allows users to search and browse the HPO with a dedicated interface. Furthermore, the HPO has been enhanced with the addition of content such as new synonyms, translations, mappings. Integrating T/O such as the HPO into HeTOP is a benefit to vocabularies because it allows enrichment of them and it is also a benefit for HeTOP which provides a better service to both humans and machines.

The semantic similarity measure is proven to be very useful for many tasks in natural language processing like information, retrieval; information extraction., machine translation etc. Additionally, one of the main problems in natural language processing is data sparseness since no language sample is large enough to seize all possible language combinations. In our research we experiment with four different measures of association with context and eight different measures of Vector similarity. The results show that the Jensen-Shannon divergence and L1 and L2 norm outperform other measures of vector-similarity regardless of the measure of association with context used. Maximum likelihood estimate and West show better results than other measures of association with context.

AB Recent progress in the task of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) has been driven by addressing data sparsity, both through new methods for generating large and noisy pretraining data and through the publication of small and higher-quality finetuning data in the BEA-2019 shared task. Building upon recent work in Neural Machine Translation (NMT), we make use of both kinds of data by deriving example-level scores on our large pretraining data based on a smaller, higher-quality dataset. In this work, we perform an empirical study to discover how to best incorporate delta-log-perplexity, a type of example scoring, into a training schedule for GEC. In doing so, we perform experiments that shed light on the function and applicability of delta-log-perplexity. Models trained on scored data achieve state-of-the-art results on common GEC test sets.

In this paper, we propose using a cycle-consistent adversarial network (Cyc1eGAN) for nonparallel data-based VC training. A Cyc1eGAN is a generative adversarial network (GAN) originally developed for unpaired image-to-image translation. A subjective evaluation of inter-gender conversion demonstrated that the proposed method significantly outperformed a method based on the Merlin open source neural network speech synthesis system (a parallel VC system adapted for our setup) and a GAN-based parallel VC system. This is the first research to show that the performance of a nonparallel VC method can exceed that of state-of-the-art parallel VC methods.

However, the indexing and retrieving of large-scale corpora bring considerable computational cost. Surprisingly, we found that REtrieving from the traINing datA (REINA) only can lead to significant gains on multiple NLG and NLU tasks. We retrieve the labeled training instances most similar to the input text and then concatenate them with the input to feed into the model to generate the output. Experimental results show that this simple method can achieve significantly better performance on a variety of NLU and NLG tasks, including summarization, machine translation, language modeling, and question answering tasks. For instance, our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results on XSum, BigPatent, and CommonsenseQA. Our code is released.(1)

Through deep learning and RealSense SDK, skeleton data is achieved which helps augment the real world 3D object into a virtual environment in unity. The proposed system enables real-time augmentation of the real world objects in a virtual 3D environment created in unity game engine. Therefore, the system allows users developing mixed reality applications for real life problem solving.

AB Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely used to aid training in language generation. This is achieved by enhancing standard maximum likelihood objectives with user-specified reward functions that encourage global semantic consistency. We propose a principled approach to address the difficulties associated with RL-based solutions, namely, high-variance gradients, uninformative rewards and brittle training. By leveraging the optimal transport distance, we introduce a regularizer that significantly alleviates the above issues. Our formulation emphasizes the preservation of semantic features, enabling end-to-end training instead of ad-hoc fine-tuning, and when combined with RL, it controls the exploration space for more efficient model updates. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, we perform a comprehensive evaluation covering a wide variety of NLP tasks: machine translation. abstractive text summarization and image caption, with consistent improvements over competing solutions.

AB Codon bias, the usage patterns of synonymous codons for encoding a protein sequence as nucleotides, is a biological phenomenon that is not fully understood. Several methods exist to represent the codon bias of an organism: codon adaptation index (CAI) [1], individual codon usage (ICU), hidden stop codons (HSC) [2] and codon context (CC) [3]. These methods are often employed in the optimization of heterologous gene expression to increase the accuracy and rate of translation. They, however, have many shortcomings as they don't take into account the local and global context of a gene. We present a method for modeling global and local codon bias through deep language models that is more robust than current methods by providing more contextual information and long-range dependencies.

AB We propose a fast approximation method of a softmax function with a very large vocabulary using singular value decomposition (SVD). SVD-softmax targets fast and accurate probability estimation of the topmost probable words during inference of neural network language models. The proposed method transforms the weight matrix used in the calculation of the output vector by using SVD. The approximate probability of each word can be estimated with only a small part of the weight matrix by using a few large singular values and the corresponding elements for most of the words. We applied the technique to language modeling and neural machine translation and present a guideline for good approximation. The algorithm requires only approximately 20% of arithmetic operations for an 800K vocabulary case and shows more than a three-fold speedup on a GPU.

AB Clinical translation of stem cell research promises to revolutionize medicine. Challenges remain toward better understanding of stem cell biology and cost-effective strategies for stem cell manufacturing. These challenges call for novel engineering toolsets to study stem cell behaviors and the associated stemness. Towards this goal, we are developing a computer vision based system to automatically and reliably follow the behaviors of individual stem cells in expanding populations. This paper reports on significant progress in our development. In particular, we present a machine-learning approach for detecting spatiotemporal mitosis events without image segmentation. This approach not only improves tracking performance, but can also independently quantify mitoses and cellular divisions. We also employ bilateral filtering to improve cell detection performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this system on tracking C2C12 mouse myoblast stem cells.

TI Unsupervised statistical text simplification using pre-trained language
   modeling for initialization
SO FRONTIERS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Unsupervised text simplification has attracted much attention due to the scarcity of high-quality parallel text simplification corpora. Recent an unsupervised statistical text simplification based on phrase-based machine translation system (UnsupPBMT) achieved good performance, which initializes the phrase tables using the similar words obtained by word embedding modeling. Since word embedding modeling only considers the relevance between words, the phrase table in UnsupPBMT contains a lot of dissimilar words. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised statistical text simplification using pre-trained language modeling BERT for initialization. Specifically, we use BERT as a general linguistic knowledge base for predicting similar words. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised text simplification methods on three benchmarks, even outperforms some supervised baselines.

AB Focused ultrasound (FUS), being non-invasive and non-ionizing, has been postulated as a possible therapeutic for peripheral nerve modulation. Recently, the ability to use high intensity, short pulse FUS has been demonstrated in rodents. In order to adapt this technology for clinical translation, a technique for real-time imaging and validation of FUS neuromodulation is needed. In this study, we developed a technique to image FUS using a two probes, connected to a single Vantage research ultrasound machine for real-time elastography during FUS delivery without interleaved transmits. Using a custom transmit sequence, we can image displacements around 1 mu m. Validation of FUS delivery to the median nerve was performed in humans (n = 5). This technique allows for greater accuracy and confidence in applying neuromodulation to human peripheral nerves.

We focus on cases with periodic straight-line translation including object entry and exit. The periodic character of the motion is reflected in the method via a mapping of the physical domain onto a closed virtual ring. Therefore, we use an extended mesh, where unneeded portions are deactivated to control the computational overhead. We provide a validation case as well as examples for the applicability of the method to 2D and 3D models of packaging machines. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we present a parser to analyze simple Arabic nominal sentences using the NooJ platform. Hence, we propose a well-classified NooJ dictionary that includes most syntactic, and semantic features. We also present the rule describing the Arabic sentence. Then, we implement the parser that recognizes, and annotates all possible grammatical structures of simple Arabic nominal sentence. We implement a set of transducers modeling Arabic lexical, and syntactic constraints, these constraints reduce parsing ambiguity. Our parser is tested on many sentences extracted from real texts. These experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed parser for analyzing simple Arabic nominal sentences.

AB This paper deals with the problem of automated conversion of formal system specification to the executable implementation that preserves the reconfigurability of the original model within its runtime. Formal part of the work is based on Coloured Petri Nets formalism extended with the nets-within-nets structural paradigm introduced by Valk. This paradigm reduces the partitioning problem using multiple levels of abstraction within modeling. Described solution aims to produce the distributed control system using five levels of abstraction and a set of translation rules that produces the target prototype. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of mapping rules that are used for prototype generation and the concept of distributed virtual machine that interprets Petri Nets specifications and supports the reconfigurability of the system.

TI LED-phototransistor linear mechanical-electrical optoisolator transducer
SO OPTOELECTRONICS AND ADVANCED MATERIALS-RAPID COMMUNICATIONS
AB Mechanical-electrical optoisolator transducers are position transducers which use as a sensor, a Polaroid optocoupler specialized in converting rotation and/or translation movements into electrical signals. The used sensor is an analog device whose transfer characteristic is non-linear. In this article is presented a method of linearizing this new type sensors's characteristic. The method is based on the analysis of the physical processes which take place within the Polaroid optocoupler. The mechanical-electrical optoisolator transducer allows the extraction of the signals out of the areas with intense electromagnetic field. Being an analog linear transducer, the signal generated by it doesn't impose the use of a microprocessor. This thing permits to obtain some systems of checking the position of a machine-tool's components at a low cost price.

Due to the mentioned features of MapReduce above, researchers have also explored the use of MapReduce on other application domains, such as machine learning, textual retrieval and statistical translation, among others.
   In this paper. we study the feasibility of running typical supercomputing applications using the MapReduce framework. We port two applications (Water Spatial and Radix Sort) from the Stanford SPLASH-2 suite to MapReduce By completely evaluating them in Hadoop, an open-source MapReduce framework for clusters. we analyze the major performance bottleneck of them in the MapReduce framework. Based on this, we also provide several suggestions in enhancing the MapReduce framework to Suite these applications.

The proposed system couples a weakly constrained phone-recognizer with a phone-to-word decoder that was originally developed for phrase-based statistical machine translation. The decoder permits to efficiently decode confusion networks in input, and to exploit large scale unpruned language models. Preliminary experiments are reported on the transcription of speeches of the Italian parliament. The use of phone confusion networks as interface between the two decoding steps permits to reduce the WER by 28%, thus making the system perform relatively close to a state-of-the-art baseline using a comparable language model.

AB While publish-subscribe systems have good engineering properties, they are difficult to reason about and to test. Model checking such systems is an attractive alternative. However, in practice coming up with an appropriate state model for a pub-sub system can be a difficult and error-prone task. In this paper we address this problem by describing a generic pub-sub model checking framework. The key feature of this framework is a reusable, parameterized state machine model that captures pub-sub run-time event management and dispatch policy. Generation of models for specific pub-sub systems is then handled by a translation tool that accepts as input a set of pub-sub component descriptions together with a set of pub-sub properties, and maps them into the framework where they can be checked using off-the-shelf model checking tools.

They play vital roles in biological processes such as transcription and translation. Classification of ncRNAs is essential to our understanding of disease mechanisms and treatment design. Many approaches to ncRNA classification have been developed, several of which use machine learning and deep learning. In this paper, we construct a novel deep learning-based architecture, ncRDense, to effectively classify and distinguish ncRNA families. In a comparative study, our model produces comparable results with existing state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we built a freely accessible web server for the ncRDense tool, which is available at http://nsclbio.jbnu.ac.kr/tools/ncRDense/.

AB A major obstacle in reinforcement learningbased sentence generation is the large action space whose size is equal to the vocabulary size of the target-side language. To improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning, we present a novel approach for reducing the action space based on dynamic vocabulary prediction. Our method first predicts a fixedsize small vocabulary for each input to generate its target sentence. The input-specific vocabularies are then used at supervised and reinforcement learning steps, and also at test time. In our experiments on six machine translation and two image captioning datasets, our method achieves faster reinforcement learning ( similar to 2.7x faster) with less GPU memory ( similar to 2.3x less) than the full-vocabulary counterpart. We also show that our method more effectively receives rewards with fewer iterations of supervised pre-training.

AB Selectional preference, or SP, is an important lexical knowledge that can be applied to many natural language processing tasks, like semantic error detection, metaphor detection, word sense disambiguation, syntactic parsing, semantic role labeling, and machine translation. This paper studies semantic class level SP acquisition for knowledge base construction. Firstly, the noun taxonomy of SKCC, a Semantic Knowledge-base of Contemporary Chinese, is adjusted for SP acquisition. Secondly, a MDL-based tree cut model is implemented. Thirdly, SP in SKCC is introduced as the source of gold standard test set to evaluate SP acquisition performance. Three kinds of predicate-argument relations are investigated in the experiments, including verb-object, verb-subject, and adjective-noun relations. For the verb-object relation, the top1 strict accuracy is 24.74% while the top3 relaxed accuracy reaches 75.26%.

TI A Survey on Lexical Simplification
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
AB Lexical Simplification is the process of replacing complex words in a given sentence with simpler alternatives of equivalent meaning. This task has wide applicability both as an assistive technology for readers with cognitive impairments or disabilities, such as Dyslexia and Aphasia, and as a pre-processing tool for other Natural Language Processing tasks, such as machine translation and summarisation. The problem is commonly framed as a pipeline of four steps: the identification of complex words, the generation of substitution candidates, the selection of those candidates that fit the context, and the ranking of the selected substitutes according to their simplicity. In this survey we review the literature for each step in this typical Lexical Simplification pipeline and provide a benchmarking of existing approaches for these steps on publicly available datasets. We also provide pointers for datasets and resources available for the task.

TI A cellular automaton for the determination of the mean velocity of
   moving objects and its VLSI implementation
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION
AB A new algorithm for the determination of the mean velocity of a moving object, using the properties of Cellular Automata, is presented in this paper. The mean velocity is calculated along the central axis perpendicular to the lens of the vision system. The motion of the object is restricted to translation (angular velocity is zero) and to one moving object in the scene. Experimental results for the determination of the mean velocity and its computational error are also presented. The algorithm presented in this paper does not require the calculation or the extraction of image features, such as area and shape, line segments, characteristic points, corners, etc. The design and VLSI implementation of a Cellular Automaton architecture is also presented for the efficient realisation of the algorithm.

AB We propose a new functional definition and construction method for core vocabulary sets for multiple applications based on the relative coverage of a target concept in thousands of bilingual dictionaries. Our newly developed core concept vocabulary list derived from these dictionary consensus methods achieves high overlap with existing widely utilized core vocabulary lists targeted at applications such as first and second language learning or field linguistics. Our in-depth analysis illustrates multiple desirable properties of our newly proposed core vocabulary set, including their non-compositionality. We employ a cognate prediction method to recover missing coverage of this core vocabulary in massively multilingual dictionary construction, and we argue that this core vocabulary should be prioritized for elicitation when creating new dictionaries for low-resource languages for multiple downstream tasks including machine translation and language learning.

AB Nowadays, there is an increasing tendency for using acronyms in technical texts, which has led to ambiguous acronyms with different possible expansions. Diversity of expansions of a single acronym makes recognizing its expansion a challenging task. Replacing acronyms with incorrect expansions will lead to problems in text mining procedures, namely text normalization, summarization, machine translation, and tech-mining. Tech-mining involves exploring and analyzing technical texts to recognize the relations between technologies. This paper is aimed at proposing a method for building a dataset that meets the requirements for training acronym disambiguation models in technical texts. In this paper, challenges in automatic acronym disambiguation are presented. We have proposed a method for building the dataset and the accuracy of the acronym disambiguation model is 86%.

AB Recent work has shown that contextualized word representations derived from neural machine translation are a viable alternative to such from simple word predictions tasks. This is because the internal understanding that needs to be built in order to be able to translate from one language to another is much more comprehensive. Unfortunately, computational and memory limitations as of present prevent NMT models from using large word vocabularies, and thus alternatives such as subword units (BPE and morphological segmentations) and characters have been used. Here we study the impact of using different kinds of units on the quality of the resulting representations when used to model morphology, syntax, and semantics. We found that while representations derived from subwords are slightly better for modeling syntax, character-based representations are superior for modeling morphology and are also more robust to noisy input.

AB Controlled vocabularies are important resources used in several tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and text analysis. However, the development of such resources is expensive and time-consuming. On the other hand, the Wikipedia, a free collaborative encyclopedia, contains plenty of semi-structured information that can be used by an automatic process to create new resources. This paper proposes a method to extract semantic information from the Wikipedia in the form of a controlled vocabulary. The method combines keywords obtained for a specific Wikipedia article with three different strategies: using Wikipedia annotations called wikilinks, a ranking measure to obtain keywords from text, and a dependency parser. To evaluate the model, we performed an analysis in terms of coverage and performance of the acquired vocabulary using WordNet as a gold standard.

TI Zero anaphora resolution by case-based reasoning and pattern
   conceptualization
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB Effective anaphora resolution is helpful to many applications of natural language processing such as machine translation, summarization and question answering. In this paper, a novel resolution approach is proposed to tackle zero anaphora, which is the most frequent type of anaphora shown in Chinese texts. Unlike most of the previous approaches relying on hand-coded rules, our resolution is mainly constructed by employing case-based reasoning and pattern conceptualization. Moreover, the resolution is incorporated with the mechanisms to identify cataphora and non-antecedent instances so as to enhance the resolution performance. Compared to a general rule-based approach, the proposed approach indeed improves the resolution performance by achieves 78% recall and 79% precision on solving 1051 zero anaphora instances in 382 narrative texts.

AB This contribution reviews state-of-the approaches for chromatographic fingerprinting of 2D peak patterns. Concepts of sample's fingerprint and profile, as established in metabolomics, are conceptually translated to comprehensive two-dimensional chromatography (C2DC) separations embracing the principles of biometric fingerprinting.
   Approaches founded on this principle referred to as chromatographic fingerprinting are described and discussed for their information potential and limitations for providing a higher level of information about sample composition. The different type of features (i.e., datapoint, region, peak, and peak-region) are discussed and insights on processing tools and advances in the development of new algorithms are provided. Selected examples cover the most relevant application fields of GC x GC. Challenging scenarios with severe chromatographic misalignment, parallel detection, and translation of methods from thermal to differential-flow modulated GC x GC are also considered for their relevance in specific applications. Machine learning/chemometrics tools are briefly introduced, highlighting their fundamental role in supporting fingerprinting workflows. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI From Seizure Detection to Smart and Fully Embedded Seizure Prediction
   Engine: A Review
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS
AB Recent review papers have investigated seizure prediction, creating the possibility of preempting epileptic seizures. Correct seizure prediction can significantly improve the standard of living for the majority of epileptic patients, as the unpredictability of seizures is a major concern for them. Today, the development of algorithms, particularly in the field of machine learning, enables reliable and accurate seizure prediction using desktop computers. However, despite extensive research effort being devoted to developing seizure detection integrated circuits (ICs), dedicated seizure prediction ICs have not been developed yet. We believe that interdisciplinary study of system architecture, analog and digital ICs, and machine learning algorithms can promote the translation of scientific theory to a more realistic intelligent, integrated, and low-power system that can truly improve the standard of living for epileptic patients. This review explores topics ranging from signal acquisition analog circuits to classification algorithms and dedicated digital signal processing circuits for detection and prediction purposes, to provide a comprehensive and useful guideline for the construction, implementation and optimization of wearable and integrated smart seizure prediction systems.

AB Pushdown systems (PDSs) and recursive state machines (RSMs), which are linearly equivalent, are standard models for interprocedural analysis. Yet RSMs are more convenient as they (a) explicitly model function calls and returns, and (b) specify many natural parameters for algorithmic analysis, e.g., the number of entries and exits. We consider a general framework where RSM transitions are labeled from a semiring and path properties are algebraic with semiring operations, which can model, e.g., interprocedural reachability and dataflow analysis problems.
   Our main contributions are new algorithms for several fundamental problems. As compared to a direct translation of RSMs to PDSs and the best-known existing bounds of PDSs, our analysis algorithm improves the complexity for finite-height semirings (that subsumes reachability and standard dataflow properties). We further consider the problem of extracting distance values from the representation structures computed by our algorithm, and give efficient algorithms that distinguish the complexity of a one-time preprocessing from the complexity of each individual query. Another advantage of our algorithm is that our improvements carry over to the concurrent setting, where we improve the best-known complexity for the context-bounded analysis of concurrent RSMs. Finally, we provide a prototype implementation that gives a significant speed-up on several benchmarks from the SLAM/SDV project.

AB Forensic analyst skills are at stake for processing of growing data from IoT based environment platforms. Tangible sources often have the size limits, but that's not the case for communication traffic source. Hence, increasing the thirst for an efficient benchmarking for big data analysis. Available solutions to date have used an anomaly-based approach or have proposed approaches based on the deviation from a regular pattern. To tackle the seized bytes, authors have proposed an approach for big data forensics, with efficient sensitivity and precision. In the presented work, a generalized forensic framework has been proposed that use Google's programming model, MapReduce as the backbone for traffic translation, extraction, and analysis of dynamic traffic features. For the proposed technique, authors have used open source tools like Hadoop, Hive, and Mahout and R. Apart from being open source, these tools support scalability and parallel processing. Also, comparative analysis of globally accepted machine learning models of P2P malware analysis in mocked real-time is presented. Dataset from CAIDA was taken and executed in parallel to validate the proposed model. Finally, the forensic performance metrics of the model shows the results with the sensitivity of 99%.

AB The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a lightweight application layer protocol for the Internet of Things. CoAP is based on HTTP mechanisms to build RESTful web services. In contrast to HTTP, CoAP was designed for machine-to-machine (M2M) communication and uses a binary representation. This allows efficient transport and processing in resource-constrained networks such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). Due to the analogy to REST, a mapping between CoAP and HTTP is possible.
   In this paper one of the first translating CoAP-HTTP proxies is presented, that provides HTTP clients transparent access to CoAP resources and vice versa. Furthermore, caching relieves CoAP servers, which solves a key challenge for the Internet of Things: to allow a constant/ permanent availability of resources from a network of constrained devices, which are required to minimize data transmissions due to their noticeable restrictions in power consumption. We describe, which issues of the translation we found during the time of implementation and testing, and explain how the proxy handles these issues. Finally, an evaluation, using real WSN hardware, is given, and an approximation scheme on how much transmissions can be saved by caching resources is provided.

Its application lies in many different areas including sentiment analysis, Information Retrieval (IR), machine translation and knowledge graph construction. Solutions to WSD are mostly categorized into supervised and knowledge-based approaches. In this paper, a knowledge-based method is proposed, modeling the problem with semantic space and semantic path hidden behind a given sentence. The approach relies on the well-known Knowledge Base (KB) named WordNet and models the semantic space and semantic path by Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and PageRank respectively.

In recent years, there has been a significant amount of work done involving English and European text. However, somewhat less attention has been paid to Asia languages. We compared a number of different strategies for Chinese-English bilingual plagiarism detection. We present methods for candidate document retrieval and compare four methods: (i) document keywords based, (ii) intrinsic plagiarism based, (iii) headers based, and (iv) machine translation queries. The results of our evaluation indicated that keywords based queries, the simplest and most efficient approach, gives acceptable results for newspaper articles. We also compared different percentage of keywords based query, and the results indicated that putting 50% keywords into queries can obtain the satisfied candidate documents set.

AB Subject and object identification denotes the process of identifying the syntactic subject and object in a sentence while tagging. Identification of subject/object turned out as very effective for many natural language applications such as machine translation, anaphora resolution, relationship extraction etc. For languages with rigid word order, the subject, object and verb in a sentence can be identified by their position. But for languages like Malayalam with relatively free word order the subject/object identification task is more complex and is significant. This paper presents a method for subject and object identification in Malayalam text using statistical tagging approach using HMM and Viterbi algorithm. In this approach, the tagset for part of speech tagging is modified to include tags that distinguish between the subject and object in a sentence.

AB In machining process, the workpiece is subject to cutting forces and torques. To resist these external loads, a fixture can supply clamping forces to completely restrain the workpiece. However, insufficient clamping forces cannot prevent the workpiece from translation and rotations, whereas excessive clamping forces may cause strongly the improper workpiece-fixture system deformations. Therefore, how to effectively determine the optimum clamping forces is the main objective of this paper. Firstly, a mechanistic model is proposed to measure the stability of clamping forces against these external loads. Secondly, a relaxation method is further established to true obtain the optimum clamping forces by solving the proposed model. The presented approach is conceptually simple and computationally efficient. It is particularly useful in the early stages of fixture design and process planning.

AB This paper addresses the problem of the unknown light verb construction in Korean in the context of Korean-to-English patent machine translation. The light verb construction in Korean is composed of a light verb 'ha' and a predicative noun. The predicative nouns are generally sino-Korean words or loan words mostly from English in deverbal form. Previous researches on the light verb construction were mostly focused on the linguistic explanation about the thematic role assignment and the argument realization. In this paper, we will present a method for treating the LVC words that are not in the dictionary of Korean-to-English patent MT system. We introduce 4 types of unknown LVCs and present a method for generating the target word automatically. The evaluation of the automatically translated unknown words by professional translators showed 70.06% accuracy.

We prove that the Green's Functions associated with regularization operators are suitable support vector kernels with equivalent regularization properties. Moreover, the paper provides an analysis of currently used support vector kernels in the view of regularization theory and corresponding operators associated with the classes of both polynomial kernels and translation invariant kernels. The latter are also analyzed on periodical domains. As a by-product we show that a large number of radial basis functions, namely conditionally positive definite functions, may be used as support vector kernels. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB We demonstrate that, hidden within one-layer randomly weighted neural networks, there exist subnetworks that can achieve impressive performance, without ever modifying the weight initializations, on machine translation tasks. To find subnetworks for one-layer randomly weighted neural networks, we apply different binary masks to the same weight matrix to generate different layers. Hidden within a one-layer randomly weighted Transformer, we find that subnetworks that can achieve 29.45/17.29 BLEU on IWSLT14/WMT14. Using a fixed pretrained embedding layer, the previously found subnetworks are smaller than, but can match 98%/92% (34.14/25.24 BLEU) of the performance of, a trained Transformer(small/base) on IWSLT14/WMT14. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of larger and deeper transformers in this setting, as well as the impact of different initialization methods.(1)

AB Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks are usually performed word by word on textual inputs. We can use arbitrary symbols to represent the linguistic meaning of a word and use these symbols as inputs. As "alternatives" to a text representation, we introduce Soundex, MetaPhone, NYSIIS, logogram to NLP, and develop fixed-output-length coding and its extension using Huffman coding. Each of those codings combines different character/digital sequences and constructs a new vocabulary based on codewords. We find that the integration of those codewords with text provides more reliable inputs to Neural-Network-based NLP systems through redundancy than text-alone inputs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art models on the application of machine translation, language modeling, and part-of-speech tagging.

AB The fabrication of microscale polyethylene glycol diacrylate(PEGDA) hydrogel particles was demonstrated via magnetic property ultraviolet(UV) lithography techniques, polydimethylsiloxane(PDMS) soft stamp preparation techniques and micro-nano imprint technology in this paper. The results of compositional and morphological characterizations of magnetic microparticles show that the Fe3O4 nanoparticles with an average diameter of 100 nm are uniformly dispersed in hydrogel. Owing to the excellent magnetism of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, the fabricated hydrogel microparticles with different sizes and shapes were manipulated in water via applying an external magnetic fields. Three types of motions, translation, rotation and flip, were demonstrated with the manipulator. These microscale magnetic PEGDA hydrogel particles have a great application potential in manufacturing process, micro/nanomotors, and machines.

AB We describe an unconventional line of attack in our quest to teach machines how to rap battle by improvising hip hop lyrics on the fly, in which a novel recursive bilingual neural network, TRAAM, implicitly learns soft, context-dependent generalizations over the structural relationships between associated parts of challenge and response raps, while avoiding the exponential complexity costs that symbolic models would require. TRAAM learns feature vectors simultaneously using context from both the challenge and the response, such that challenge-response association patterns with similar structure tend to have similar vectors. Improvisation is modeled as a quasi-translation learning problem, where TRAAM is trained to improvise fluent and rhyming responses to challenge lyrics. The soft structural relationships learned by our TRAAM model are used to improve the probabilistic responses generated by our improvisational response component.

AB BioCaster was launched in 2008 to provide an ontology-based text mining system for early disease detection from open news sources. Following a 6-year break, we have re-launched the system in 2021. Our goal is to systematically upgrade the methodology using state-of-the-art neural network language models, whilst retaining the original benefits that the system provided in terms of logical reasoning and automated early detection of infectious disease outbreaks. Here, we present recent extensions such as neural machine translation in 10 languages, neural classification of disease outbreak reports and a new cloud-based visualization dashboard. Furthermore, we discuss our vision for further improvements, including combining risk assessment with event semantics and assessing the risk of outbreaks with multi-granularity. We hope that these efforts will benefit the global public health community.

SO PHYSICS OF FLUIDS
AB This article deals with approximating steady-state particle-resolved fluid flow around a fixed particle of interest under the influence of randomly distributed stationary particles in a dispersed multiphase setup using convolutional neural network (CNN). The considered problem involves rotational symmetry about the mean velocity (streamwise) direction. Thus, this work enforces this symmetry using SE(3)-equivariant, special Euclidean group of dimension 3, CNN architecture, which is translation and three-dimensional rotation equivariant. This study mainly explores the generalization capabilities and benefits of a SE(3)-equivariant network. Accurate synthetic flow fields for Reynolds number and particle volume fraction combinations spanning over a range of [86.22, 172.96] and [0.11, 0.45], respectively, are produced with careful application of symmetry-aware data-driven approach.</p>

TI Evaluating a Pivot-Based Approach for Bilingual Lexicon Extraction
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB A pivot-based approach for bilingual lexicon extraction is based on the similarity of context vectors represented by words in a pivot language like English. In this paper, in order to show validity and usability of the pivot-based approach, we evaluate the approach in company with two different methods for estimating context vectors: one estimates them from two parallel corpora based on word association between source words (resp., target words) and pivot words and the other estimates them from two parallel corpora based on word alignment tools for statistical machine translation. Empirical results on two language pairs (e.g., Korean-Spanish and Korean-French) have shown that the pivot-based approach is very promising for resource-poor languages and this approach observes its validity and usability. Furthermore, for words with low frequency, our method is also well performed.

Then it studies further the key techniques during the application of VRML in NC simulation. The first problems to be solved are simulation modeling and related VRML nodes that are bases of realistic graphic simulation. The identification and translation of NC code are the second important issues. They involve the determination of tool path and VRML nodes being related to the tool-axis position as well as the implementation of dynamic simulation and interference checking. Based on the solutions to the key problems, it presents the existing difficulties in the VRML application of simulation that are interactive ability and the simplification of VRML files. Finally, the attempt of NC verification has been completed through the combination of AutoCAD and VRML2.0.

In particular, we review techniques for high-level block-diagram-based modeling of DSP applications; the translation of block-diagram specifications into efficient C programs using global target-independent optimization techniques; and the compilation of C programs into streamlined machine code for programmable DSP processors using architecture-specific and retargetable back-end optimizations. We also point out important directions for further investigation.

The review reveals the advances in the techniques used for the detection and recognition of MEs for online and offline modalities. Systems have evolved from the use of domain-specific crafted modules to architectures learned in a completely data-driven manner. Learning tasks and datasets have been standardized, thus allowing performance comparison of the systems. With automated learning of improved feature representations and guided by the related fields such as machine translation and captioning, the systems have progressed to demonstrate improved robustness to the variability in the inputs.

AB Sequence-to-sequence models are a powerful workhorse of NLP. Most variants employ a softmax transformation in both their attention mechanism and output layer, leading to dense alignments and strictly positive output probabilities. This density is wasteful, making models less interpretable and assigning probability mass to many implausible outputs. In this paper, we propose sparse sequence-to-sequence models, rooted in a new family of alpha-entmax transformations, which includes softmax and sparsemax as particular cases, and is sparse for any alpha > 1. We provide fast algorithms to evaluate these transformations and their gradients, which scale well for large vocabulary sizes. Our models are able to produce sparse alignments and to assign nonzero probability to a short list of plausible outputs, sometimes rendering beam search exact. Experiments on morphological inflection and machine translation reveal consistent gains over dense models.

AB Domain Name Service (DNS) is an important service generally used by other application layer protocols of TCP/IP protocol stack. These protocols use DNS to translate human readable web address to machine readable IP address which is then used by other protocols of network stack for communication between computers over the network. The correctness of DNS translation cannot be compromised as it may lead to unsecure transactions with in the network. Because of this, DNS is generally a soft target for attackers and is vulnerable to different security threats including DNS spoofing, DNS cache poisoning, etc. Many solutions for such threats are proposed for traditional IP network. In this paper we talk about security loops in DNS and propose a solution for it in Software Defined Network (SDN) environment.

TI Artificial intelligence and neuropsychological measures: The case of
   Alzheimer's disease
SO NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
AB One of the current challenges in the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is to identify patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that will convert to AD. Artificial intelligence, in particular machine learning (ML), has established as one of more powerful approach to extract reliable predictors and to automatically classify different AD phenotypes. It is time to accelerate the translation of this knowledge in clinical practice, mainly by using low-cost features originating from the neuropsychological assessment.
   We performed a meta-analysis to assess the contribution of ML and neuropsychological measures for the automated classification of MCI patients and the prediction of their conversion to AD. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of patients' classifications was obtained by means of a quantitative bivariate random-effect meta-analytic approach. Although a high heterogeneity was observed, the results of meta-analysis show that ML applied to neuropsychological measures can lead to a successful automatic classification, being more specific as screening rather than prognosis tool. Relevant categories of neuropsychological tests can be extracted by ML that maximize the classification accuracy.

TI Convolutional Neural Network for Driving Maneuver Identification Based
   on Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and Global Positioning System (GPS)
SO FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE CITIES
AB Identification and translation of different driving maneuver are some of the key elements to analysis driving risky behavior. However, the major obstacles to maneuver identification are the wide variety of styles of driving maneuver which are performed during driving. The objective in this contribution through the paper is to automatic identification of driver maneuver e.g., driving in roundabouts, left and right turns, breaks, etc. based on Inertia Measurement Unit (IMU) and Global Positioning System (GPS). Here, several machine learning (ML) algorithms i.e., Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), K-nearest neighbor (k-NN), Hidden Markov Model (HMM), RandomForest (RF), and Support VectorMachine (SVM) have been applied for automatic feature extraction and classification on the IMU and GPS data sets collected through a Naturalistic Driving Studies (NDS) under an H2020 project called SimuSafe(1). The CNN is further compared with HMM, RF, ANN, k-NN and SVM to observe the ability to identify a car maneuver through roundabouts. According to the results, CNN outperforms (i.e., average F-1-score of 0.88 both roundabout and not roundabout) among the other ML classifiers and RF presents better correlation than CNN, i.e., MCC = -0.022.

TI MULTI-FEATURE FUSION EMOTION RECOGNITION BASED ON RESTING EEG
SO JOURNAL OF MECHANICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
AB An important task of brain-computer interface (BCI) research is to read or decode mental content from a large number of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, which is an exciting, attractive, and challenging goal. In this paper, resting EEG data are collected from spontaneous EEG, and 16 random features such as correlation coefficient, covariance, and brainpower spectrum are extracted as reference vectors. In the subsequent emotion recognition experiment, the same feature information is extracted and separated from the EEG signal, and the translation and normalization processing are carried out based on the resting-state features. Finally, with the machine learning methods such as k-means clustering and multi-feature fusion, the positive, negative, and neutral emotional characteristic parameters were correctly separated. In a group of 12 subjects, the correct recognition rate of visual evoked positive, negative, and neutral emotions reached 83.9%, which was better than the literature mentioned in this paper. Another highlight of this method is that it can quickly, accurately, and efficiently select the number of features with the best matching and the least resource consumption from multiple features and multiple potential acquisition points. Further analysis and comparison of EEG characteristics can find the relationship between specific stimuli and corresponding EEG characteristic signals.

TI Design and analysis of novel 2R1T generalized parallel mechanisms with
   large rotational angles
SO MECHANISM AND MACHINE THEORY
AB Limited rotational angles caused by the interference between the moving platform and kinematic chains of parallel mechanisms (PMs) has always been an issue. Hence a class of two-rotation and one-translation (2R1T) generalized parallel mechanisms (GPMs) with a high rotational capability, where the end effector is placed on the joint to avoid the problem, is presented. This type of GPM consists a multiple joint element and binary links connected by kinematic pairs. Hence the GPM can offer advantages in terms of a simple structure, high machining accuracy, and low machining cost. By combining the Grubler criterion and Euler's equation, the acceptable number of links and kinematic pairs is derived. Depending on the number synthesis results, joint arrangements are considered in each kinematic chain. Then the structure of kinematic chains is synthesized by virtual work. Examples of the 2R1T GPMs constructed by enumerated chains are shown. Finally, a kinematic analysis is performed on an example. The rotational performance and the singularity conditions are investigated. According to the above analyses, the rotational performance of 2R1T GPMs is excellent. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Multi-omic integration by machine learning (MIMaL)
SO BIOINFORMATICS
AB Motivation: Cells respond to environments by regulating gene expression to exploit resources optimally. Recent advances in technologies allow for measuring the abundances of RNA, proteins, lipids and metabolites. These highly complex datasets reflect the states of the different layers in a biological system. Multi-omics is the integration of these disparate methods and data to gain a clearer picture of the biological state. Multi-omic studies of the proteome and metabolome are becoming more common as mass spectrometry technology continues to be democratized. However, knowledge extraction through the integration of these data remains challenging.
   Results: Connections between molecules in different omic layers were discovered through a combination of machine learning and model interpretation. Discovered connections reflected protein control (ProC) over metabolites. Proteins discovered to control citrate were mapped onto known genetic and metabolic networks, revealing that these protein regulators are novel. Further, clustering the magnitudes of ProC over all metabolites enabled the prediction of five gene functions, each of which was validated experimentally. Two uncharacterized genes, YJR120W and YDL157C, were accurately predicted to modulate mitochondrial translation. Functions for three incompletely characterized genes were also predicted and validated, including SDH9, ISC1 and FMP52. A website enables results exploration and also MIMaL analysis of user-supplied multi-omic data.

AB Optical Character Recognition (OCR) can be used in many applications such as machine translation, postal processing, script recognition, text-to-speech, reading aid for blind, etc. Myanmar OCR system is essential to convert numerous published books, newspapers and journals of Myanmar into editable computer text files. It is a challenge for recognizing Myanmar old printed document in case of bad quality, absence of standard alphabets, absence of known fonts, ink through page, uneven background, broken characters, overlapped scripts and mixed scripts. This paper presents a new proposed block definition method for isolation printed Myanmar historical text. The proposed Myanmar optical character recognition (MOCR) system consists of local adaptive thresholding method for binarization and skew-slant correction, thinning algorithm is applied to obtain separation lines and words. For isolation of characters, block definition method is applied and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is matched the features in the trained database as machine readable text. Myanmar alphabets include consonants, vowels, medials and digits. By using block definition method, consonants and vowels are isolated easily and we obtained more accuracy rate of the OCR. The efficient experimental results are presented by using different Myanmar old documents in our proposed algorithms.

AB We investigate the problem of verifying the strategic properties of multi-agent systems equipped with machine learning-based perception units. We introduce a novel model of agents comprising both a perception system implemented via feed-forward neural networks and an action selection mechanism implemented via traditional control logic. We define the verification problem for these systems against a bounded fragment of alternating-time temporal logic. We translate the verification problem on bounded traces into the feasibility problem of mixed integer linear programs and show the soundness and completeness of the translation. We show that the lower bound of the verification problem is PSPACE and the upper bound is coNEXPTIME. We present a tool implementing the compilation and evaluate the experimental results obtained on a complex scenario of multiple aircraft operating a recently proposed prototype for air-traffic collision avoidance.

AB Recent developments in the area of deep learning have been proved extremely beneficial for several natural language processing tasks, such as sentiment analysis, question answering, and machine translation. In this paper we exploit such advances by tailoring the ontology learning problem as a transductive reasoning task that learns to convert knowledge from natural language to a logic-based specification. More precisely, using a sample of definitory sentences generated starting by a synthetic grammar, we trained Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based architectures to extract OWL formulae from text. In addition to the low feature engineering costs, our system shows good generalisation capabilities over the lexicon and the syntactic structure. The encouraging results obtained in the paper provide a first evidence of the potential of deep learning techniques towards long term ontology learning challenges such as improving domain independence, reducing engineering costs, and dealing with variable language forms.

However the computational complexity of accurately identifying the most likely substitutes for a word has made large scale experiments difficult. In this letter we introduce a new search algorithm, FASTSUBS, that is guaranteed to find the K most likely lexical substitutes for a given word in a sentence based on an n-gram language model. The computation is sublinear in both K and the vocabulary size V.

TI On learning vector-valued functions
SO NEURAL COMPUTATION
AB In this letter, we provide a study of learning in a Hilbert space of vector-valued functions. We motivate the need for extending learning theory of scalar-valued functions by practical considerations and establish some basic results for learning vector-valued functions that should prove useful in applications. Specifically, we allow an output space gamma to be a Hilbert space, and we consider a reproducing kernel Hilbert space of functions whose values lie in gamma. In this setting, we derive the form of the minimal norm interpolant to a finite set of data and apply it to study some regularization functionals that are important in learning theory. We consider specific examples of such functionals corresponding to multiple-output regularization networks and support vector machines, for both regression and classification. Finally, we provide classes of operator-valued kernels of the dot product and translation-invariant type.

TI THE TREATMENT OF PLURALITY IN (L)LILOG
SO LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB This paper summarizes research concerning the incorporation of plural constructions into the LILOG text understanding system. The treatment of plurality is based on the first order system LP, first presented in [Link 1983]. The paper consists of two parts. After a very short review of the system LP, a translation is given from a version of LILOG's discourse representation language L(Dis), containing plural constructions, into the formal language L(LILOG), which, in turn, is extended by LP. This shows how it is possible for LILOG's inference machine, modified along the lines indicated, to deal with pluralic bits of knowledge that are realistic representations of a wide array of plural constructions in language. Since in the field of plural phenomena there seems to be some danger of proliferation of readings, particular emphasis has been laid on questions of vagueness and ambiguity.

AB Transliteration is generally a phonetically based transcription across different writing systems. It is a crucial task for various downstream natural language processing applications. For the Myanmar (Burmese) language, robust automatic transliteration for borrowed English words is a challenging task because of the complex Myanmar writing system and the lack of data. In this study, we constructed a Myanmar-English named entity dictionary containing more than eighty thousand transliteration instances. The data have been released under a CC BY-NC-SA license. We evaluated the automatic transliteration performance using statistical and neural network-based approaches based on the prepared data. The neural network model outperformed the statistical model significantly in terms of the BLEU score on the character level. Different units used in the Myanmar script for processing were also compared and discussed.

AB A robust evaluation metric has a profound impact on the development of text generation systems. A desirable metric compares system output against references based on their semantics rather than surface forms. In this paper we investigate strategies to encode system and reference texts to devise a metric that shows a high correlation with human judgment of text quality. We validate our new metric, namely MoverScore, on a number of text generation tasks including summarization, machine translation, image captioning, and data-to-text generation, where the outputs are produced by a variety of neural and non-neural systems. Our findings suggest that metrics combining contextualized representations with a distance measure perform the best. Such metrics also demonstrate strong generalization capability across tasks. For ease-of-use we make our metrics available as web service.(1)

Our system has three parts: a convolution neural network for feature extraction, a bidirectional LSTM for encoding extracted features, and an LSTM and an attention model for generating target LaTex. For recognizing complex structures, our system needs large data for training. We propose local and global distortion models for generating OHMEs from the CROHME database. We evaluate the end-to-end system on the CROHME database and the generated databases. The experiential results show that the end-to-end system achieves 28.09% and 35.19% recognition rates on CROHME without and with the generated data, respectively.

AB Motivated by great performance gained by Recurrent neural network applied on machine translation, people began to pay attention to image describing with related deep learning methods. Recurrent neural network can not remember long term information but Long-Short Term Memory(LSTM) can handle this well. However, the LSTM applied on image describing to predict sentences in previous literature [1] can only train and inference in the single direction. In fact, the words in a sentence not only relates to the context before but also later. In the paper, we propose a Bidirectional LSTM, it can generate sentences in both forward and backward direction with more richer information. Besides, we also improved sampling sentences. We conducted experiment on three datasets: Flickr8K, Flickr30K and MSCOCO datasets and our proposed models outperform related models.

AB This paper presents a novel oversampling technique that addresses highly imbalanced data distribution. At present, the imbalanced data that have anomalous class distribution and underrepresented data are difficult to deal with through a variety of conventional machine learning technologies. In order to balance class distributions, an adaptive subspace self-organizing map (ASSOM) that combines the local mapping scheme and globally competitive rule is proposed to artificially generate synthetic samples focusing on minority class samples. The ASSOM is conformed with feature-invariant characteristics, including translation, scaling and rotation, and it retains the independence of basis vectors in each module. Specifically, basis vectors generated via each ASSOM module can avoid generating repeated representative features that offer nothing but heavy computational load. Several experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ASSOM method with supervised learning manner is superior to other existing oversampling techniques.

AB Mixing of two or more materials (i. e. heavy density metal powder in the fluid or fluid in another jelly fluid) is very difficult. In conventional method of mixing the metal powder and fluid mixing is carried out on unidirectional stirring machine. This paper investigates the limitations of the conventional mixer. This paper also discussed about the Schatz geometry shaker-mixer is used for a homogeneous mixing of powdery substances with differing specific weights and particle sizes. The product is mixed in its own closed container. The mixing container is set into a three-dimensional movement that use of rotation, translation and inversion according to the Schatz geometric theory. The results fulfil the highest requirements and are achieved in a minimum of time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
AB A two dimensional image recognition method using spectral analysis and hybrid network classifiers was developed. The feature vectors using spectral analysis on normalized centroidal distance sequences of each image were extracted. The hybrid network classifiers using the advantages of conventional methods which are gradient-descent-searching backpropagation network (BPN), global searching genetic algorithm (GA), and fuzzy c-means algorithm (FCMA) were developed. The proposed method is applied to the recognition of aircraft, letters (Arabic numerals and English alphabet) and machine tools. The experimental results show that the proposed method has a higher accuracy, averaging 3.2% than BPN at a noise rate of 13 dB-25 dB, and the training times can be shortened by half of BPN while maintaining the same performance.

AB Energy and Process control systems were once conveniently separated. Tighter integration is now required because of more widespread use of higher efficiency motors and variable frequency drives as well as faster dynamic load management schemes for plants with a minimal spinning reserve capability. Digital age IIoT interactions between the ANSI/ISA95 and IEC61850 Bus Architectures present challenges for security, data flow, equipment life-cycle, translation and decision making. The paper reviews how these newer technologies and design drivers can be arranged to provide better quality decision making at the operational level. In addition the various challenges of exposing high availability critical plant subsystems to the various components of an IIoT based architecture for better analytic and machine learning purposes are explored.

AB This paper presents a unique 3-DOF micro-motion parallel kinematic manipulator (PKM) with actuation redundancy. The 3-DOF PKM has four identical linear-motion driving units and a passive link in the centre of the structure. The purpose of this passive link is to restrain the movement of the manipulator and to improve the stiffness of the structure. As a result, the PKM has one translation on the Z-axis and two rotations around the X and Y axes. The manipulator with actuator redundancy is designed to prevent singularity and to improve stiffness. In this paper, the inverse kinematic, Jacobian matrix and stiffness analysis have been conducted. Finally, the dynamic analysis has also been performed.

SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Optimization of biological networks is often limited by wet lab labor and cost, and the lack of convenient computational tools. Here, we describe METIS, a versatile active machine learning workflow with a simple online interface for the data-driven optimization of biological targets with minimal experiments. We demonstrate our workflow for various applications, including cell-free transcription and translation, genetic circuits, and a 27-variable synthetic CO2-fixation cycle (CETCH cycle), improving these systems between one and two orders of magnitude. For the CETCH cycle, we explore 10(25) conditions with only 1,000 experiments to yield the most efficient CO2-fixation cascade described to date. Beyond optimization, our workflow also quantifies the relative importance of individual factors to the performance of a system identifying unknown interactions and bottlenecks. Overall, our workflow opens the way for convenient optimization and prototyping of genetic and metabolic networks with customizable adjustments according to user experience, experimental setup, and laboratory facilities.

TI K-Complex Detection Using a Hybrid-Synergic Machine Learning Method
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART C-APPLICATIONS AND
   REVIEWS
AB Sleep stage identification is the first step in modern sleep disorder diagnostics process. K-complex is an indicator for the sleep stage 2. However, due to the ambiguity of the translation of the medical standards into a computer-based procedure, reliability of automated K-complex detection from the EEG wave is still far from expectation. More specifically, there are some significant barriers to the research of automatic K-complex detection. First, there is no adequate description of K-complex that makes it difficult to develop automatic detection algorithm. Second, human experts only provided the label for whether a whole EEG segment contains K-complex or not, rather than individual labels for each subsegment. These barriers render most pattern recognition algorithms inapplicable in detecting K-complex. In this paper, we attempt to address these two challenges, by designing a new feature extraction method that can transform visual features of the EEG wave with any length into mathematical representation and proposing a hybrid-synergic machine learning method to build a K-complex classifier. The tenfold cross-validation results indicate that both the accuracy and the precision of this proposed model are at least as good as a human expert in K-complex detection.

TI A copper-based shuttling [2]rotaxane with two bidentate chelates in the
   axis: steric control of the motion
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Contrary to most of the other molecular machines based on copper-complexed catenanes or rotaxanes made and investigated in Strasbourg, the present report is dealing with a molecular shuttle for which the copper centre is complexed to two bidentate chelates, regardless of the state of the shuttle. In other words, the axis contains a sterically hindering bidentate chelate, namely a 2,9-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (dpp) derivative, and another but less hindering bidentate chelate, 2,2'-bipyridine (bipy). The synthesis of the [2]rotaxane involves 15 individual chemical steps, excluding the preparation of the macrocyclic component of the [2] rotaxane. The threaded macrocycle is a 39-membered ring which incorporates an endocyclic but non sterically hindering chelate of the 8,8'-diphenyl-3,3'-biisoquinoline family (dpbiiq). The electrochemically-induced gliding motion of the copper-complexed ring from the dpp "station'' to the bipy "station'' and vice versa is fast on the cyclic voltammetry timescale (milliseconds). The copper(I) state is preferably located on the dpp unit whereas, by oxidising the copper(I) centre to its divalent state, the translation motion takes place to afford the thermodynamically most stable state now involving the bipy chelate.

TI COORDINATION SPECIFICATION FOR CIRSSE ROBOTIC PLATFORM SYSTEM USING
   PETRI-NET TRANSDUCERS
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & ROBOTIC SYSTEMS
AB A formal model based on Petri net transducers has been developed to specify the coordination and communication among the various task units in the CIRSSE platform system for robotic construction in space stations. The specification guarantees a mechanism of coherent control and communication for the effective cooperation among the different task units, and outlines the major steps toward the integration of the robotic platform system. The model is based on a coordination structure consisting of one dispatcher and three coordinators representing, respectively, the motion, vision, and gripper units of the platform system. The coordination structure insures some desired process properties for the system, such as boundedness, liveness, and reversibility, and easier translation from the formal specifications to the program codes based on Petri net transducer models. The model also assists with the system development in many ways, including (i) reducing the number of errors introduced while converting specifications to codes; (ii) assisting the developers in program implementation and verification (iii) allowing quicker adaptation to changed specifications; and (iv) allowing easier testing of the results for specification modifications. Therefore, it provides a useful tool for the design, simulation, performance evaluation, and implementation verification of the CIRSSE robotic platform system.

AB Transformers' quadratic complexity with respect to the input sequence length has motivated a body of work on efficient sparse approximations to softmax. An alternative path, used by entmax transformers, consists of having built-in exact sparse attention; however this approach still requires quadratic computation. In this paper, we propose Sparsefinder, a simple model trained to identify the sparsity pattern of entmax attention before computing it. We experiment with three variants of our method, based on distances, quantization, and clustering, on two tasks: machine translation (attention in the decoder) and masked language modeling (encoder-only). Our work provides a new angle to study model efficiency by doing extensive analysis of the tradeoff between the sparsity and recall of the predicted attention graph. This allows for detailed comparison between different models along their Pareto curves, important to guide future benchmarks for sparse attention models.

TI Revisiting Dropout: Escaping Pressure for Training Neural Networks with
   Multiple Costs
SO ELECTRONICS
AB A common approach to jointly learn multiple tasks with a shared structure is to optimize the model with a combined landscape of multiple sub-costs. However, gradients derived from each sub-cost often conflicts in cost plateaus, resulting in a subpar optimum. In this work, we shed light on such gradient conflict challenges and suggest a solution named Cost-Out, which randomly drops the sub-costs for each iteration. We provide the theoretical and empirical evidence of the existence of escaping pressure induced by the Cost-Out mechanism. While simple, the empirical results indicate that the proposed method can enhance the performance of multi-task learning problems, including two-digit image classification sampled from MNIST dataset and machine translation tasks for English from and to French, Spanish, and German WMT14 datasets.

AB Multi-head self-attention is a key component of the Transformer, a state-of-the-art architecture for neural machine translation. In this work we evaluate the contribution made by individual attention heads in the encoder to the overall performance of the model and analyze the roles played by them. We find that the most important and confident heads play consistent and often linguistically-interpretable roles. When pruning heads using a method based on stochastic gates and a differentiable relaxation of the L-0 penalty, we observe that specialized heads are last to be pruned. Our novel pruning method removes the vast majority of heads without seriously affecting performance. For example, on the English-Russian WMT dataset, pruning 38 out of 48 encoder heads results in a drop of only 0.15 BLEU.(1)

AB Language models are essential for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as machine translation and text summarization. Remarkable performance has been demonstrated recently across many NLP domains via a Transformer-based language model with over a billion parameters, verifying the benefits of model size. Model parallelism is required if a model is too large to fit in a single computing device. Current methods for model parallelism either suffer from backward locking in backpropagation or are not applicable to language models. We propose the first model-parallel algorithm that speeds the training of Transformer-based language models. We also prove that our proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge to critical points for non-convex problems. Extensive experiments on Transformer and Transformer-XL language models demonstrate that the proposed algorithm obtains a much faster speedup beyond data parallelism, with comparable or better accuracy.

AB Local covariant feature detection, namely the problem of extracting viewpoint invariant features from images, has so far largely resisted the application of machine learning techniques. In this paper, we propose the first fully general formulation for learning local covariant feature detectors. We propose to cast detection as a regression problem, enabling the use of powerful regressors such as deep neural networks. We then derive a covariance constraint that can be used to automatically learn which visual structures provide stable anchors for local feature detection. We support these ideas theoretically, proposing a novel analysis of local features in term of geometric transformations, and we show that all common and many uncommon detectors can be derived in this framework. Finally, we present empirical results on translation and rotation covariant detectors on standard feature benchmarks, showing the power and flexibility of the framework.

AB Probabilistic generative models have been applied successfully in a wide range of applications that range from speech recognition and part of speech tagging, to machine translation and information retrieval, but, traditionally, applications such as reasoning have been thought to fall outside the scope of the generative framework for both theoretical and practical reasons. Theoretically, it is difficult to imagine, for example, what a reasonable generative story for first-order logic inference might look like. Practically, even if we can conceive of such a story, it is unclear how one can obtain sufficient amounts of training data. In this paper, we discuss how by embracing a less restrictive notion of inference, one can build generative models of inference that can be trained on massive amounts of naturally occurring texts; and text-based deduction and abduction decoding algorithms.

TI SHIFT ERROR PROPAGATION IN 2, 7 MODULATION CODE
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS
AB In digital recording, the channel data errors that are caused by noise and distortion increase with temporal data rate and spatial storage density.  These channel data errors are essentially "shift" errors, i.e., translations in the time of occurrence of detected channel "ones."  As detected channel data are transformed to user data by the channel (modulation) decoder, an individual shift error can produce an error burst that is many user data bits in length.  The probability of occurrence of a noise/distortion related user data error burst of given length depends not only on the channel data error rate, but also on the channel (modulation) code and decoding implementation that are used.
   In this paper we analyze how shift errors propagate in a particular RLL modulation code that is widely used in modern high-density data storage machines.

AB Knowledge graphs applications, in industry and academia, motivate substantial research directions towards large-scale information extraction from various types of resources. Nowadays, most of the available knowledge graphs are either in English or multilingual. In this paper, we introduce RezoJDM16k, a French knowledge graph dataset based on RezoJDM (Lafourcade, 2007). With 16k nodes, 832k triplets and 53 relation types, RezoJDM16k can be employed in many NLP downstream tasks for the French language such as machine translation, question-answering and recommendation systems. In addition, we provide strong knowledge graph embedding baselines that are used in link prediction task for future benchmarking. Compared to the state-of-the-art English knowledge graph datasets used in link prediction, RezoJDM16k shows a similar promising predictive behavior.

AB In this overview article we describe an application designed to enable communication between health practitioners and patients who do not share a common language, in situations where professional interpreters are not available. Built on the principle of a fixed phrase translator, the application implements different natural language processing (NLP) technologies, such as speech recognition, neural machine translation and text-to-speech to improve usability. Its design allows easy portability to new domains and integration of different types of output for multiple target audiences. Even though BabelDr is far from solving the problem of miscommunication between patients and doctors, it is a clear example of NLP in a real world application designed to help minority groups to communicate in a medical context. It also gives some insights into the relevant criteria for the development of such an application.

TI Measurement of Text Similarity: A Survey
SO INFORMATION
AB Text similarity measurement is the basis of natural language processing tasks, which play an important role in information retrieval, automatic question answering, machine translation, dialogue systems, and document matching. This paper systematically combs the research status of similarity measurement, analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of current methods, develops a more comprehensive classification description system of text similarity measurement algorithms, and summarizes the future development direction. With the aim of providing reference for related research and application, the text similarity measurement method is described by two aspects: text distance and text representation. The text distance can be divided into length distance, distribution distance, and semantic distance; text representation is divided into string-based, corpus-based, single-semantic text, multi-semantic text, and graph-structure-based representation. Finally, the development of text similarity is also summarized in the discussion section.

AB Name Entity Recognition is the essential tool for machine translation. Traditional Named Entity Recognition focuses on the person, location and organization names. However, there is still a lack of data to identify travel-related named entities, especially in Mongolian. In this paper, we introduce a newly corpus for Mongolian Tourism Named Entity Recognition (MTNER), consisting of 16,000 sentences annotated with 18 entity types. We trained in-domain BERT representations with the 10 GB of unannotated Mongolian corpus, and trained a NER model based on the BERT tagging model with the newly corpus. Which achieves an overall 82.09 F1 score on Mongolian Tourism Named Entity Recognition and lead to an absolute increase of +3.54 F1 score over the traditional CRF Named Entity Recognition method.

AB Attention is a key component of Transformers, which have recently achieved considerable success in natural language processing. Hence, attention is being extensively studied to investigate various linguistic capabilities of Transformers, focusing on analyzing the parallels between attention weights and specific linguistic phenomena. This paper shows that attention weights alone are only one of the two factors that determine the output of attention and proposes a norm-based analysis that incorporates the second factor, the norm of the transformed input vectors. The findings of our norm-based analyses of BERT and a Transformer-based neural machine translation system include the following: (i) contrary to previous studies, BERT pays poor attention to special tokens, and (ii) reasonable word alignment can be extracted from attention mechanisms of Transformer. These findings provide insights into the inner workings of Transformers.

AB WordNets are useful resources for natural language processing. Various WordNets for different languages have been developed by different goups. Recently, World WordNet Database Structure (WWDS) was proposed by Redkar et. al (2015) as a common platform to store these different WordNets. However, it is undenitilized due to lack of programming interface. In this paper, we present WWDS APIs, which are designed to address this shortcoming. These WWDS APIs, in conjunction with WWDS, act as a wrapper that enables developers to utilize WordNets without worrying about the underlying storage structure. The APIs are developed in PHP, Java, and Python, as they are the preferred programming languages of most developers and researchers working in language technologies. These APIs can help in various applications like machine translation, word sense disambiguation, multilingual information retrieval, etc.

   processing
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW
AB Statistical natural language processing (NLP) and evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are two very active areas of research which have been combined many times. In general, statistical models applied to deal with NLP tasks require designing specific algorithms to be trained and applied to process new texts. The development of such algorithms may be hard. This makes EAs attractive since they offer a general design, yet providing a high performance in particular conditions of application. In this article, we present a survey of many works which apply EAs to different NLP problems, including syntactic and semantic analysis, grammar induction, summaries and text generation, document clustering and machine translation. This review finishes extracting conclusions about which are the best suited problems or particular aspects within those problems to be solved with an evolutionary algorithm.

AB The Dublin City University participation in the CLEF 2005 CL-SR task concentrated on exploring the application of our existing information retrieval methods based on the Okapi model to the conversational speech data set. This required an approach to determining approximate sentence boundaries within the free-flowing automatic transcription provided to enable us to use our summary-based pseudo relevance feedback (PRF). We also performed exploratory experiments on the use of the metadata provided with the document transcriptions for indexing and relevance feedback. Topics were translated into English using Systran V3.0 machine translation. In most cases Title field only topic statements performed better than combined Title and Description topics. PRF using our adapted method is shown to be affective, and absolute performance is improved by combining the automatic document transcriptions with additional metadata fields.

TI The effect of reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament on
   patellar tracking
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
AB We evaluated patellar tracking in six cadaveric knees with the medial restraints intact and then sectioned to determine their contribution to lateral translation of the patella with and without a lateral force on the patella. The medial patellofemoral ligament was then reconstructed with a gracilis tendon graft and patellar tracking was again evaluated. The knees were extended using a materials testing machine, and patellar tracking was measured with a position sensing system. With no lateral force applied to the patella, patellar tracking was unaffected by the presence or absence of the medial restraints or by reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament. With a lateral force applied to the patella, patellar tracking was changed significantly by the loss of the medial restraints. Normal patellar tracking was substantially restored by reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament.

TI Enhancing Microwave Sensor Performance With Ultrahigh Q Features Using
   CycleGAN
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES
AB In this work, a microwave planar sensor is used for liquid material characterization. Two identical complementary split ring resonators (CSRRs) operating at 3 GHz are coupled to create a highly sensitive capacitive region. The moderate quality factor of the sensor approximate to 230 is significantly improved up to approximate to 5040 with loss compensation using a regenerative amplifier. The moderate quality factor restrains the passive mode sensor from distinguishing low concentrations of 1%-4% water in ethanol, while considerably distinct profiles are achievable using the active-mode sensor. The measured passive mode sensor response is then processed using CycleGAN, a machine-learning algorithm conventionally used for image-to-image translation. This strongly enhances the quality factor of the responses, effectively translating them to the active domain. This improvement reduces the limit of water detection down to 1% for the water-inethanol mixture. In addition, the sensor is used for noninvasive monitoring of glucose levels, in both passive and active modes. The resolution of the CycleGAN-boosted response approaches that of the active sensor (approximate to 20 mg/dL), showing a considerable enhancement when compared to the resolution of the passive sensor (approximate to 70 mg/dL).

TI microRPM: a microRNA prediction model based only on plant small RNA
   sequencing data
SO BIOINFORMATICS
AB Motivation: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-coding small RNAs (of about 22 nucleotides), which play an important role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression via either mRNA cleavage or translation inhibition. Several machine learning-based approaches have been developed to identify novel miRNAs from next generation sequencing (NGS) data. Typically, precursor/genomic sequences are required as references for most methods. However, the non-availability of genomic sequences is often a limitation in miRNA discovery in non-model plants. A systematic approach to determine novel miRNAs without reference sequences is thus necessary. Results: In this study, an effective method was developed to identify miRNAs from non-model plants based only on NGS datasets. The miRNA prediction model was trained with several duplex structure-related features of mature miRNAs and their passenger strands using a support vector machine algorithm. The accuracy of the independent test reached 96.61% and 93.04% for dicots (Arabidopsis) and monocots (rice), respectively. Furthermore, true small RNA sequencing data from orchids was tested in this study. Twenty-one predicted orchid miRNAs were selected and experimentally validated. Significantly, 18 of them were confirmed in the qRT-PCR experiment. This novel approach was also compiled as a user-friendly program called microRPM (miRNA Prediction Model).

AB The text generation methods have witnessed great success in text summarization, machine translation, and synthetic news generation. However, these techniques may be abused to generate disinformation and fake news. To better understand the potential threats of synthetic news, we develop a novel generation method RLTG to generate topic-preserving news content. The majority of existing text generation methods are either controlled by specific attributes or lack topic consistency between the input claims and output news, making synthetic news less coherent and realistic. In this paper, we study the problem of topic-preserving synthetic news generation by proposing a novel deep reinforcement learning-based method to control the output of large pre-trained language models. Experiment results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the news contents generated by RLTG are topic-consistent and realistic.

AB Training deep neural networks is inherently subject to the predefined and fixed loss functions during optimizing. To improve learning efficiency, we develop Stochastic Loss Function (SLF) to dynamically and automatically generating appropriate gradients to train deep networks in the same round of back-propagation, while maintaining the completeness and differentiability of the training pipeline. In SLF, a generic loss function is formulated as a joint optimization problem of network weights and loss parameters. In order to guarantee the requisite efficiency, gradients with the respect to the generic differentiable loss are leveraged for selecting loss function and optimizing network weights. Extensive experiments on a variety of popular datasets strongly demonstrate that SLF is capable of obtaining appropriate gradients at different stages during training, and can significantly improve the performance of various deep models on real world tasks including classification, clustering, regression, neural machine translation, and objection detection.

AB Focused ultrasound (FUS), being non-invasive and non-ionizing, has been postulated as a possible therapeutic for peripheral nerve modulation. Recently, the ability to use high intensity, short pulse FUS has been demonstrated in rodents. In order to adapt this technology for clinical translation, a technique for real-time imaging and validation of FUS neuromodulation is needed. In this study, we developed a technique to image FUS using a two probes, connected to a single Vantage research ultrasound machine for real-time elastography during FUS delivery without interleaved transmits. Using a custom transmit sequence, we can image displacements around 1 mu m. Validation of FUS delivery to the median nerve was performed in humans (n = 5). This technique allows for greater accuracy and confidence in applying neuromodulation to human peripheral nerves.

AB Single-ISA heterogeneous systems (such as ARM big.LITTLE) are an attractive solution for embedded platforms as they expose performance/energy trade-offs directly to the operating system. Recent works have demonstrated the ability to increase their efficiency by using VLIW cores, supported through Dynamic Binary Translation (DBT) to maintain the illusion of a single-ISA system. However, VLIW cores cannot rival with Out-of-Order (OoO) cores when it comes to performance, mainly because they do not use speculative execution. In this work, we study how it is possible to use memory dependency speculation during the DBT process. Our approach enables fine-grained speculation optimizations thanks to a combination of hardware and software. Our results show that our approach leads to a geo-mean speed-up of 10% at the price of a 7% area overhead.

AB We present a set of experiments to demonstrate that deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs) learn internal representations that capture soft hierarchical notions of syntax from highly varied supervision. We consider four syntax tasks at different depths of the parse tree; for each word, we predict its part of speech as well as the first (parent), second (grandparent) and third level (great-grandparent) constituent labels that appear above it. These predictions are made from representations produced at different depths in networks that are pre-trained with one of four objectives: dependency parsing, semantic role labeling, machine translation, or language modeling. In every case, we find a correspondence between network depth and syntactic depth, suggesting that a soft syntactic hierarchy emerges. This effect is robust across all conditions, indicating that the models encode significant amounts of syntax even in the absence of an explicit syntactic training supervision.

Fuzzy cmeans algorithm was used for segmentation, which is a fuzzy classification algorithm in which a data can belong to multiple groups in different degree of membership. For feature extraction were used Hu moments as a geometrical descriptors, which are a mathematical tool that provides seven moments that identify geometric features of the objects, main characteristics of Hu moments is its invariance to rotation, scaling and translation. Finally, the geometric features that provide the seven moments are used as input to a classifier, delivering results: these moments are used to identify the signs of the alphabet of the Mexican Sign Language (LSM).

AB Arabic Natural Language Processing (ANLP) has known an important development during the last decade. Nowadays, several ANLP tools are already developed such as morphological analyzers. These analyzers are often used in more advanced applications such as syntactic parsers, search engines, machine translation systems, etc. However, the choice of a morphological analyzer to use, among others, can be difficult for researchers if they ignore its metrics. In this article, we present the challenges of the benchmark of Arabic morphological analyzers. We present also our solution developed in Java, which allows the benchmark by returning the most common metrics, namely the accuracy, precision, f-measure and execution time. This solution has the advantage of being cross-platform, flexible and allows to be extended to cover new morphological analyzers to compare.

AB Automatic identification of defects on solar cell modules is the key of improving components efficiency of power generation and achieving the maximum utilization of energy[1]. This paper took the debris defects as an example. Considered the fact that scale factor would have an impact on moment invariants in discrete state, this paper adopted an improved moment invariant for the image feature extraction of debris defects. The scale factor of the new moment invariants is eliminated by transformation. Therefore they have the properties of translation, rotation and scaling simultaneously. Meanwhile, SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier was used to identify the debris defects. The experimental results show that, compared with the traditional moment invariants, the identification rate of using the improved moment invariants for feature extraction is 96%.

TI Logarithmic based optical delay for time-resolved data collection
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB A method has been established that generates values spaced according to a mathematical function, specifically the logarithm function that can be applied to a stepper motor. Here, it is applied to yield logarithmically spaced time delay points for subnanosecond interferometric time-resolved experiments using a stepper motor controlled translation stage. Application of this method is discussed in terms of three input parameters: the optical delay stage time resolution, dt; the time of maximum delay, d(stop); and the desired number of data points, N. The method improves the efficiency of interferometric time-resolved data collection while providing data collection effective to determine decay parameters. In principle, this technique could be generalized to any mathematical function. (c) 2010 American Institute of Physics. [doi:10.1063/1.3474226]

TI Automatic lexical classification: bridging research and practice
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB Natural language processing (NLP)-the automatic analysis, understanding and generation of human language by computers-is vitally dependent on accurate knowledge about words. Because words change their behaviour between text types, domains and sub-languages, a fully accurate static lexical resource (e. g. a dictionary, word classification) is unattainable. Researchers are now developing techniques that could be used to automatically acquire or update lexical resources from textual data. If successful, the automatic approach could considerably enhance the accuracy and portability of language technologies, such as machine translation, text mining and summarization. This paper reviews the recent and on-going research in automatic lexical acquisition. Focusing on lexical classification, it discusses the many challenges that still need to be met before the approach can benefit NLP on a large scale.

AB Bi-text alignment is useful to many Natural Language Processing tasks such as machine translation, bilingual lexicography and word sense disambiguation. Most of previous researches are on different language pairs. Ibis paper presents a diachronic alignment of Ancient and Modem Chinese. Because of the long history of Chinese culture and Chinese writing, lots of Ancient Chinese texts are waiting to be translated into modern Chinese, especially, the comparative study of Ancient and Modem Chinese is a very important way to understand some characteristics in Modem Chinese. After describing some characteristics in Ancient-Modem Chinese bi-texts, we first investigate some statistical properties of Ancient-Modern bi-text corpus, including the correlation test of text lengths between two languages and the distribution test of length ratio data. We then pay more attention to n-m(n > 1 or m > 1) alignment modes which are prone to mismatch.

AB to this study, using a two camera setup, we designed a system that recognizes 3D gestures. When 3D reconstruction is not possible or infeasible, combining 2D hand trajectories at feature or decision level increases the system performance drastically. The trajectories are extracted by tracking the center-of-mass of the hand and the width, height, and orientation of the enclosing ellipse. Trajectories are then smoothed using a Kalman Filter. Following the translation and scale normalization, the trajectories are modelled using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and using Support Vector Machines (SVM) by converting the trajectories to fixed length using re-sampling. Trajectories extracted from different cameras are combined at different levels and the effect to the system performance is observed. The best resut is obtained by modelling the trajectories using HMMs and combining at decision level, with % 1 error in 210 test examples.

TI Equivariant representations for molecular Hamiltonians and N-center
   atomic-scale properties
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Symmetry considerations are at the core of the major frameworks used to provide an effective mathematical representation of atomic configurations that is then used in machine-learning models to predict the properties associated with each structure. In most cases, the models rely on a description of atom-centered environments and are suitable to learn atomic properties or global observables that can be decomposed into atomic contributions. Many quantities that are relevant for quantum mechanical calculations, however-most notably the single-particle Hamiltonian matrix when written in an atomic orbital basis-are not associated with a single center, but with two (or more) atoms in the structure. We discuss a family of structural descriptors that generalize the very successful atom-centered density correlation features to the N-center case and show, in particular, how this construction can be applied to efficiently learn the matrix elements of the (effective) single-particle Hamiltonian written in an atom-centered orbital basis. These N-center features are fully equivariant-not only in terms of translations and rotations but also in terms of permutations of the indices associated with the atoms-and are suitable to construct symmetry-adapted machine-learning models of new classes of properties of molecules and materials.

TI Survey on Style in 3D Human Body Motion: Taxonomy, Data, Recognition and
   Its Applications
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AFFECTIVE COMPUTING
AB The meaning of the word style depends on its context. While actions have already been quite studied for a while, style in human body motion is a growing topic of interest. In the context of animation, style is crucial as it brings realism and expressiveness to the motion of a character. Even though it is undoubtedly a key element in motions, its definition and the use of the word style in itself, among research works, lack consensus. Achieving realistic motions is tedious. It requires either a large motion capture dataset or the considerable work of artist animators. The lack of consistent style data is thus a challenge. Stylistic motion generation is quite studied in order to overcome this issue. This paper focuses on the study of style in human body motion from 3D human body skeletal data. It establishes a taxonomy of definitions of style, describes the data that have been used up until now, introduces key notions about motion capture data as well as machine learning, and presents approaches about style recognition, person identification through their style and motion style generation.

TI Agency plus automation: Designing artificial intelligence into
   interactive systems
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Much contemporary rhetoric regards the prospects and pitfalls of using artificial intelligence techniques to automate an increasing range of tasks, especially those once considered the purview of people alone. These accounts are often wildly optimistic, understating outstanding challenges while turning a blind eye to the human labor that undergirds and sustains ostensibly "automated" services. This long-standing focus on purely automated methods unnecessarily cedes a promising design space: one in which computational assistance augments and enriches, rather than replaces, people's intellectual work. This tension between human agency and machine automation poses vital challenges for design and engineering. In this work, we consider the design of systems that enable rich, adaptive interaction between people and algorithms. We seek to balance the often-complementary strengths and weaknesses of each, while promoting human control and skillful action. We share case studies of interactive systems we have developed in three arenasdata wrangling, exploratory analysis, and natural language translation-that integrate proactive computational support into interactive systems. To improve outcomes and support learning by both people and machines, we describe the use of shared representations of tasks augmented with predictive models of human capabilities and actions. We conclude with a discussion of future prospects and scientific frontiers for intelligence augmentation research.

TI A contractual approach for the verification of UML2.0 software
   architectures
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN TECHNOLOGY
AB The functional and qualitative properties are conventionally considered after software is completed. Currently, researchers consider treating those properties as soon as the architectural design phase. In this paper, the modelling and verification of the syntactic, behavioural and qualitative properties in UML2.0 software architectures are studied. To achieve this, a UML profile extending the UML2.0 component model by a set of qualitative concepts is proposed. The new profile, called CUMLQoS, is able to model the UML2.0 software architectures equipped with qualitative properties. Our verification approach suggests using the Acme/Armani ADL as a checking machine of syntactic and qualitative properties of UML2.0 software architectures deriving from our CUMLQoS profile. The choice of this ADL is justified by its ability of formal verification of different types of properties related to software architectures. As a second step of our verification approach, UML2.0, Port State Machine (PoSM), Wright and CSP are combined to check the behavioural consistency of UML2.0 software architecture. To achieve this, a set of systematic rules is proposed allowing the translation of UML2.0 source model to the Wright target model. Using Wr2fdr tool, the Wright specification can automatically be translated to a CSP specification acceptable by the FDR2 model-checker.

TI Rama: a machine learning approach for ribosomal protein prediction in
   plants
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Ribosomal proteins (RPs) play a fundamental role within all type of cells, as they are major components of ribosomes, which are essential for translation of mRNAs. Furthermore, these proteins are involved in various physiological and pathological processes. The intrinsic biological relevance of RPs motivated advanced studies for the identification of unrevealed RPs. In this work, we propose a new computational method, termed Rama, for the prediction of RPs, based on machine learning techniques, with a particular interest in plants. To perform an effective classification, Rama uses a set of fundamental attributes of the amino acid side chains and applies a two-step procedure to classify proteins with unknown function as RPs. The evaluation of the resultant predictive models showed that Rama could achieve mean sensitivity, precision, and specificity of 0.91, 0.91, and 0.82, respectively. Furthermore, a list of proteins that have no annotation in Phytozome v. 10, and are annotated as RPs in Phytozome v. 12, were correctly classified by our models. Additional computational experiments have also shown that Rama presents high accuracy to differentiate ribosomal proteins from RNA-binding proteins. Finally, two novel proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana were validated in biological experiments. Rama is freely available at http://inctipp.bioagro.ufv.br:8080/Rama.

AB Effective fusion of data from multiple modalities, such as video, speech, and text, is challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of multimodal data. In this paper, we propose adaptive fusion techniques that aim to model context from different modalities effectively. Instead of defining a deterministic fusion operation, such as concatenation, for the network, we let the network decide "how" to combine a given set of multimodal features more effectively. We propose two networks: 1) Auto-Fusion, which learns to compress information from different modalities while preserving the context, and 2) GAN-Fusion, which regularizes the learned latent space given context from complementing modalities. A quantitative evaluation on the tasks of multimodal machine translation and emotion recognition suggests that our lightweight, adaptive networks can better model context from other modalities than existing methods, many of which employ massive transformer-based networks.(1)

AB Bilingual documentation has become a common phenomenon in many official institutions and private companies. In this scenario, the categorization of bilingual text is a useful tool, that can be also applied in the machine translation field. To tackle this classification task, different approaches will be proposed. On the one hand, two finite-state transducer algorithms from the grammatical inference domain will be discussed. On the other hand, the well-known naive Bayes approximation will be presented along with a possible modelization based on n-gram language models. Experiments carried out on a bilingual corpus have demonstrated the adequacy of these methods and the relevance of a second information source in text classification, as supported by classification error rates. Relative reduction of 29% with respect to the best previous results on the monolingual version of the same task has been obtained.

AB Deep learning is the key technology used in a large variety of applications such as self-driving cars, image recognition, automatic machine translation, automatic handwriting generation. The success was fueled due to accessibility of huge datasets, GPUs, max pooling. Earlier machine learning techniques employed two phases: features extraction and classification. The performance of such algorithms was highly dependent on how well the features are extracted and that was the major bottleneck of these techniques. Deep learning techniques employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with numerous layers of non-linear processing for extracting the features automatically and classification that solves the previous problem. In the real time applications most of the time, either the dataset is unavailable or has less amount of data which makes it difficult to achieve accurate results for classifying the images. CNNs are hard to be trained using the small datasets. Transfer learning has emerged as a very powerful technique where in the knowledge gained from the larger dataset is transferred to the new dataset. Data augmentation and dropout are also powerful techniques that are useful for dealing with small datasets. In this paper, different techniques using the VGG16 pretrained model are compared on the small dataset.

TI Sequestration of Ribosome during Protein Aggregate Formation:
   Contribution of ribosomal RNA
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB An understanding of the mechanisms underlying protein aggregation and cytotoxicity of the protein aggregates is crucial in the prevention of several diseases in humans. Ribosome, the cellular protein synthesis machine is capable of acting as a protein folding modulator. The peptidyltransferase center residing in the domain V of large ribosomal subunit 23S rRNA is the centre for the protein folding ability of the ribosome and is also the cellular target of several antiprion compounds. Our in vitro studies unexpectedly reveal that the partial unfolding or aggregation of lysozyme under reducing conditions in presence of the ribosome can induce aggregation of ribosomal components. Electrostatic interactions complemented by specific rRNA-protein interaction drive the ribosome-protein aggregation process. Under similar conditions the rRNA, especially the large subunit rRNA and in vitro transcribed RNA corresponding to domain V of 23S rRNA (bDV RNA) stimulates lysozyme aggregation leading to RNA-protein aggregate formation. Protein aggregation during the refolding of non-disulfide containing protein BCAII at high concentrations also induces ribosome aggregation. BCAII aggregation was also stimulated in presence of the large subunit rRNA. Our observations imply that the specific sequestration of the translation machine by aggregating proteins might contribute to their cytotoxicity.

AB Laser welding is recognized as a high power density joining process. Unlike traditional welding processes where the heat penetration is limited due to the lower power density, laser welding offers a more accurate and less destructive joining method for even hard to weld metals like aluminum. However, distortion is still an issue for very thin structures. In order to optimize the welding parameters to obtain a less distorted shape, it is important to understand how the welding parameters influence the residual stresses and distortion. In this study finite element analysis and a set of experiments are performed to examine the distortional behavior. A thin aluminum plate subjected to autogenous laser welding is modeled using SYSWELD (a commercial finite element package), specifically developed for welding problems. Experimental welding is done using a LENS (Laser Engineering Net Shaping) machine. In this study, the LENS machine simply provides a precisely controlled laser heat source and programmable x - y translation table, to accurately laser weld small aluminum parts. Final displacements at certain locations in the welded plate are measured and compared with the predicted distortions from finite element analysis. Strategies for developing improved models for distortion predictions are discussed.

AB Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is a challenging task in natural language processing. In recent times, many large datasets and good models are public for this task, but most of them are for English only. Building a good MRC dataset always takes much effort, this paper proposes a method, called UtlTran, to improve the MRC quality for low-resource languages. In this method, all available MRC English datasets are collected and translated into the target language with some context-reducing strategies for better results. Tokens of question and context are initialized word representations using a word embedding model. They are then pre-trained with the MRC model with the translated dataset for the specific low-resource language. Finally, a small manual MRC dataset is used to continue fine-tuning the model to get the best results. The experimental results on the Vietnamese language show that the best word embedding model for this task is a multilingual one - XLM-R. Whereas, the best translation strategy is to reduce context by answer positions. The proposed model gives the best quality, i.e. F1 = 88.2% and Exact Match (EM) =71.8%, on the UIT-ViQuAD dataset, compared to the state-of-the-art models.

AB For many years now, understanding the brain mechanism has been a great research subject in many different fields. Brain signal processing and especially electroencephalogram (EEG) has recently known a growing interest both in academia and industry. One of the main examples is the increasing number of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) aiming to link brains and computers. In this paper, we present a novel framework allowing us to retrieve the attention state, i.e degree of attention given to a specific task, from EEG signals. While previous methods often consider the spatial relationship in EEG through electrodes and process them in recurrent or convolutional based architecture, we propose here to also exploit the time and frequency information with a transformer-based network that has already shown its supremacy in many machine-learning (ML) related studies, e.g. machine translation. In addition to this novel architecture, an extensive study on the feature extraction methods, frequential bands and temporal windows length has also been carried out. The proposed network has been trained and validated on two public datasets and achieves higher results compared to state-of-the-art models. As well as proposing better results, the framework could be used in real applications, e.g. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptoms or vigilance during a driving assessment.

TI From pattern classification to stratification: towards conceptualizing
   the heterogeneity of Autism Spectrum Disorder
SO NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
AB Pattern classification and stratification approaches have increasingly been used in research on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) over the last ten years with the goal of translation towards clinical applicability. Here, we present an extensive scoping literature review on those two approaches. We screened a total of 635 studies, of which 57 pattern classification and 19 stratification studies were included. We observed large variance across pattern classification studies in terms of predictive performance from about 60% to 98% accuracy, which is among other factors likely linked to sampling bias, different validation procedures across studies, the heterogeneity of ASD and differences in data quality. Stratification studies were less prevalent with only two studies reporting replications and just a few showing external validation. While some identified strata based on cognition and intelligence reappear across studies, biology as a stratification marker is clearly underexplored. In summary, mapping biological differences at the level of the individual with ASD is a major challenge for the field now. Conceptualizing those mappings and individual trajectories that lead to the diagnosis of ASD, will become a major challenge in the near future.

TI Application of computer vision and laser interferometer to
   two-dimensional inspection
SO OPTICAL ENGINEERING
AB A laser interferometer, vision system, and 2-D precision translation stage are used to develop a high precision measuring station with a working range of 18 x 18 mm. The vision system is installed at the z axis of a coordinate measuring machine (CMM), and the laser, the split and reflection mirrors, and the x-y stage are mounted on the platform of the CMM. The object inspected by the laser-and-vision system is moved using an x-y table so that the camera can take images of the feature points (such as corners) of the object at two different positions. Meanwhile, the displacement of the x-y table is measured using a laser interferometer. Putting these two feature points in one image, the distance between them can be evaluated under the image plane coordinate system. By adding the displacement measured by the laser interferometer, the real distance between these two feature points is obtained. The developed 2-D laser-and-vision measuring system is used to measure the geometric size of several Olympus specimens. Experimental results indicate that the measured values are in good agreement with the Olympus measurements. (c) 2008 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

TI Gender Bias in Online Language Translators: Visualization, Human
   Perception, and Bias/Accuracy Tradeoffs
SO IEEE INTERNET COMPUTING
AB Artificial intelligence(AI) systems that interact with humans, such as chatbots and language translators, have many useful applications. However, care must be put in addressing some concerns, such as the presence of bias, possible abusive language, and information leakage, that could hamper public trust in them. In this article, we focus on gender bias in online translators, as recognized and rated by a third-party assessment who does not have access to the training data, and we propose a visualization approach for such rating. We then conduct a survey of how users perceive bias in translators, whether they appreciate the proposed bias rating visualization, and how they may use it to reason about bias-accuracy trade-offs.

TI Grammatical Error Correction with Denoising Autoencoder
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB A denoising autoencoder sequence-to-sequence model based on transformer architecture proved to be useful for underlying tasks such as summarization, machine translation, or question answering. This paper investigates the possibilities of using this model type for grammatical error correction and introduces a novel method of remark-based model checkpoint output combining. This approach was evaluated by the BEA 2019 shared task. It was able to achieve state-of-the-art F-score results on the test set 73.90 and development set 56.58. This was done without any GEC-specific pre-training, but only by fine-tuning the autoencoder model and combining checkpoint outputs. This proves that an efficient model solving GEC might be trained in a matter of hours using a single GPU.

AB Parallel corpora are the basic resource for many multilingual natural language processing models. Recent advances in, e.g. neural machine translation have shown that the quality of the alignment in the corpus has a crucial impact on the quality of the resulting model, renewing interest in filtering automatically aligned corpora to increase their quality. In this contribution, we investigate the use of a fast change point detection method to detect possibly problematic parts of a parallel corpus. We demonstrate its performance on German-English corpora of 11k and 31k sentences, achieve a boundary identification performance above 80% and improve the detection of genuine parallel sentences up to 88%. To our knowledge this is the first application of change point detection to the problem of error detection in noisy corpora.

TI Dynamic ultrafast laser spatial tailoring for parallel micromachining of
   photonic devices in transparent materials
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Femtosecond laser processing of bulk transparent materials can generate localized positive changes of the refractive index. Thus, by translation of the laser spot, light-guiding structures are achievable in three dimensions. Increasing the number of laser processing spots can consequently reduce the machining effort. In this paper, we report on a procedure of dynamic ultrafast laser beam spatial tailoring for parallel photoinscription of photonic functions. Multispot operation is achieved by spatially modulating the wavefront of the beam with a time-evolutive periodical binary phase mask. The parallel longitudinal writing of multiple waveguides is demonstrated in fused silica. Using this technique, light dividers in three dimensions and wavelength-division demultiplexing (WDD) devices relying on evanescent wave coupling are demonstrated. (C) 2009 Optical Society of America

TI A Novel Approach to Creating Disambiguated Multilingual Dictionaries
SO APPLIED LINGUISTICS
AB Multilingual lexicons are needed in various applications, such as cross-lingual information retrieval, machine translation, and some others. Often, these applications suffer from the ambiguity of dictionary items, especially when an intermediate natural language is involved in the process of the dictionary construction, since this language adds its ambiguity to the ambiguity of working languages. This paper aims to propose a new method for producing multilingual dictionaries without the risk of introducing additional ambiguity. As a disambiguated intermediate language we use the so-called Universal Words. A set of more than 200,000 unambiguous Universal Words have been constructed automatically on the basis of the well-known English lexical database WordNet. This approach is being used for the construction of a five language-dictionary in the field of cultural heritage within the framework of the PATRILEX project sponsored by the Spanish Research Council.

AB Image captioning is an important task, applicable to virtual assistants, editing tools, image indexing, and support of the disabled. In recent years significant progress has been made in image captioning, using Recurrent Neural Networks powered by long- short-term-memory (LSTM) units. Despite mitigating the vanishing gradient problem, and despite their compelling ability to memorize dependencies, LSTM units are complex and inherently sequential across time. To address this issue, recent work has shown benefits of convolutional networks for machine translation and conditional image generation [9, 34, 35]. Inspired by their success, in this paper, we develop a convolutional image captioning technique. We demonstrate its efficacy on the challenging MSCOCO dataset and demonstrate performance on par with the LSTM baseline [16], while having a faster training time per number of parameters. We also perform a detailed analysis, providing compelling reasons in favor of convolutional language generation approaches.

TI Modelling in the Digital Humanities: Conceptual Data Models and
   Knowledge Organization in the Cultural Heritage Domain
SO HISTORICAL SOCIAL RESEARCH-HISTORISCHE SOZIALFORSCHUNG
AB This paper explores the role of model and modelling in the field of Digital Humanities, paying special attention to the cultural heritage domain. In detail, the approach here described adopts a bi-dimensional vision: considering the model as both a process of abstraction, an interpretation from a certain point of view, and a formal language to implement this abstraction in order to create something processable by a machine. The role of conceptual models - to be converted into ontologies - as a semantic deepening of controlled vocabularies, is the translation of this vision. Ontologies are the models used in domain communities in order to share classes and predicates for conceptual interoperability. Thinking of data models as a knowledge organization system is the core of this reflection on Digital Humanities domain.

AB Bilingual corpora play an essential role in Cross-lingual Natural Language Processing tasks such as Machine Translation, Information Extraction, and Information Retrieval. Nevertheless, manually building such corpora is a time-consuming and expensive task, especially for resource-limited languages like Vietnamese. In this paper, we propose a symmetric Named Entity Alignment method to automatically construct a named entity annotated bilingual English-Vietnamese corpus. Our system uses expansion heuristics for candidate generation and bilingual features for candidate selection. The proposed system outperforms the state-of-the-art method in English-Vietnamese Named Entity Alignment, increasing F1-score from 82.68% to 86.57%. Moreover, Vietnamese Named Entity Recognition performance improves by 23.41% in terms of F1-score compared to Conditional Random Field model ( StanfordNER). Our method can be generalized to develop corpora in other resource-limited languages.

AB The emergence of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) has resulted in the state-of-the-art efficiency and performance in many fields including language modeling, machine translation and speech recognition. RNNs are difficult to apply distributed training because of the communication bottleneck problem, which is caused by the large number of trainable weights. In this paper, a Gradient Truncated Stochastic Gradient Descent (GT-SGD) algorithm is proposed for distributed RNN training. This algorithm can aggressively reduce the communication workload across compute nodes, by truncating gradients that are below a certain threshold. We implement the GT-SGD algorithm on a cluster with multiple Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) for training a large-scale language modeling task. Experimental results demonstrate that the GT-SGD algorithm significantly improves the training efficiency with no performance loss in the obtained RNN model.

AB In this paper we present the task of unsupervised prediction of speakers' acceptability judgements. We use a test set generated from the British National Corpus (BNC) containing both grammatical sentences and sentences containing a variety of syntactic infelicities introduced by round trip machine translation. This set was annotated for acceptability judgements through crowd sourcing. We trained a variety of unsupervised language models on the original BNC, and tested them to see the extent to which they could predict mean speakers' judgements on the test set. To map probability to acceptability, we experimented with several normalisation functions to neutralise the effects of sentence length and word frequencies. We found encouraging results with the unsupervised models predicting acceptability across two different datasets. Our methodology is highly portable to other domains and languages, and the approach has potential implications for the representation and the acquisition of linguistic knowledge.

AB Previous works have used parallel corpora and alignment techniques from phrase-based statistical machine translation to extract and generate paraphrases. In Japanese, paraphrases for a number of paraphrase categories or domains have been extracted by this method. However, most of these resources focus on a particular phenomenon in Japanese, and there are still no Japanese paraphrase resources that cover all varieties of phrases from several domains, and are freely available. In addition, because Japanese and English vary in grammar and word ordering, we perform syntax-based preprocessing to reduce this mismatch and extract paraphrases similar in quality to those extracted using more similar language pairs. The data used in creating the Japanese paraphrases is either in the public domain, or available under the Creative Commons license, and spans a variety of genres for wide coverage.

Information regarding word using POS tagger, parser and other tool can be gathered. Hindi is language of free word order as compare to English. This enforces additional constraints on different NLP task. In this working paper we present an analysis of Hindi genre. We used ten tags from literature. Out of ten tags seven are annotated using Botley's annotation scheme manually. We annotated 1540 demonstrative pronoun from twelve files of EMILEE corpus. Input file is EMILEE file and output is fully annotated unicode file.

TI Structural characterization of mRNA-tRNA translocation intermediates
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Cryo-EM analysis of a wild-type Escherichia coli pretranslocational sample has revealed the presence of previously unseen intermediate substates of the bacterial ribosome during the first phase of translocation, characterized by intermediate intersubunit rotations, L1 stalk positions, and tRNA configurations. Furthermore, we describe the domain rearrangements in quantitative terms, which has allowed us to characterize the processivity and coordination of the conformational reorganization of the ribosome, along with the associated changes in tRNA ribosome-binding configuration. The results are consistent with the view of the ribosome as a molecular machine employing Brownian motion to reach a functionally productive state via a series of substates with incremental changes in conformation.

AB We have developed a hybrid system safety prover, implemented in Coq using the abstraction method introduced by [2]. The development includes: a formalisation of the structure of hybrid systems; a framework for the construction of an abstract system (consisting of decidable "over-estimators" of abstract transitions and initiality) faithfully representing a concrete hybrid system; a translation of abstract systems to graphs, enabling the decision of abstract state reachability using a certified graph reachability algorithm; a proof of the safety of an example hybrid system generated using this tool stack. To produce fully certified safety proofs without relying on floating point computations, the development critically relies on the computable real number implementation of the CoRN library of constructive mathematics formalised in Coq. The development also features a nice interplay between constructive and classical logic via the double negation monad.

AB In this paper the authors suggest an example-based method to analyze user queries in questions into conceptual graphs. As a novel point, functional conceptual graphs (FCGs) are introduced as all abstract layer for example annotation to catch the transformation between all example sentence and its correspondent graph. Concepts and relations in graphs are denoted as functions with arguments. Therefore the main task of semantic analysis is decomposed into two parts: to construct all FCG using example-based machine translation methods, and to instantiate the FCG by solve the values of functions. The second part could be implemented by a lot of existing methods for retrieving relations between concepts. Moreover, this paper rises an active example selection approach to case annotation work. Evaluation shows that this method is effective and call improve the labeling of relations.

TI M1ARegpred: Epitranscriptome Target Prediction of N1-methyladenosine
   (m1A) Regulators Based on Sequencing Features and Genomic Features
SO FRONTIERS IN BIOSCIENCE-LANDMARK
AB Background: N1-methyladenosine (m1A) is a reversible post-transcriptional modification in mRNA, which has been proved to play critical roles in various biological processes through interaction with different m1A regulators. There are several m1A regulators existing in the human genome, including YTHDF1-3 and YTHDC1. Methods: Several techniques have been developed to identify the substrates of m1A regulators, but their binding specificity and biological functions are not yet fully understood due to the limitations of wetlab approaches. Here, we submitted the framework m1ARegpred (m1A regulators substrate prediction), which is based on machine learning and the combination of sequence-derived and genome-derived features. Results: Our framework achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) scores of 0.92 in the full transcript model and 0.857 in the mature mRNA model, showing an improvement compared to the existing sequence-derived methods. In addition, motif search and gene ontology enrichment analysis were performed to explore the biological functions of each m1A regulator. Conclusions: Our work may facilitate the discovery of m1A regulators substrates of interest, and thereby provide new opportunities to understand their roles in human bodies.

TI High accuracy step gauge interferometer
SO MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Step gauges are convenient transfer standards for the calibration of coordinate measuring machines. A novel interferometer for step gauge calibrations implemented at VTT MIKES is described. The four-pass interferometer follows Abbe's principle and measures the position of the inductive probe attached to a measuring head. The measuring head of the instrument is connected to a balanced boom above the carriage by a piezo translation stage. A key part of the measuring head is an invar structure on which the inductive probe and the corner cubes of the measuring arm of the interferometer are attached. The invar structure can be elevated so that the probe is raised without breaking the laser beam. During probing, the bending of the probe and the interferometer readings are recorded and the measurement face position is extrapolated to zero force. The measurement process is fully automated and the face positions of the steps can be measured up to a length of 2 m. Ambient conditions are measured continuously and the refractive index of air is compensated for. Before measurements the step gauge is aligned with an integrated 2D coordinate measuring system. The expanded uncertainty of step gauge calibration is U = root(64 nm)(2) + (88 x 10(-9) L)(2).

AB Deep learning has achieved significant improvement in various machine learning tasks including image recognition, speech recognition, machine translation and etc. Inspired by the huge success of the paradigm, there have been lots of tries to apply deep learning algorithms to data analytics problems with big data including traffic flow prediction. However, there has been no attempt to apply the deep learning algorithms to the analysis of air traffic data. This paper investigates the effectiveness of the deep learning models in the air traffic delay prediction tasks. By combining multiple models based on the deep learning paradigm, an accurate and robust prediction model has been built which enables an elaborate analysis of the patterns in air traffic delays. In particular, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) has shown its great accuracy in modeling sequential data. Day-to-day sequences of the departure and arrival flight delays of an individual airport have been modeled by the Long Short-Term Memory RNN architecture. It has been shown that the accuracy of RNN improves with deeper architectures. In this study, four different ways of building deep RNN architecture are also discussed. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed prediction model was measured, analyzed and compared with previous prediction methods. It shows best accuracy compared with all other methods.

AB Hardware virtualization is a major challenge in embedded virtualization. The key to improving resource utilization in a virtualized system is to allow maximum possible resource access operations to perform natively with minimal intervention by the virtual machine monitor, while at the same time ensuring protected operation among different virtual machines' address space. An innovative I/O Memory Management Unit component (IOMMU) is architected to enable mapping of virtual addresses from multiple devices to the correct VM's physical memory locations, offering enhanced protection, scatter-gather functions on distributed memory organizations, high performance supported by a configurable TLB and an integrated lightweight hardware monitoring unit to facilitate dynamic system optimizations.
   This new IOMMU is designed in a modular way supporting address translation along with protection and security extensions. The principal objective is to ensure device isolation by safely mapping a device to a particular guest without risking the integrity of other guests. Additionally, the IOMMU is designed to provide an increased level of security in scenarios without virtualization; with the aid of the IOMMU, the operating system is able to protect itself from malicious device drivers by limiting a device's memory accesses and managing the permissions of peripheral devices.

TI How Does a Scanning Ribosomal Particle Move along the 5 '-Untranslated
   Region of Eukaryotic mRNA? Brownian Ratchet Model
SO BIOCHEMISTRY
AB A model of the ATP-dependent unidirectional movement of the 43S ribosomal initiation complex (=40S ribosomal subunit + eIF1 + eIF1A + eIF2.GTP.Met-tRNA(i) + eIF3) during scanning of the 5'-untranslated region of eukaryotic mRNA is proposed. The model is based on the principles of molecular Brownian ratchet machines and explains several enigmatic data concerning the scanning complex. In this model, the one-dimensional diffusion of the ribosomal initiation complex along the mRNA chain is rectified into the net-unidirectional 5'-to-3' movement by the Feynman ratchet-and-pawl mechanism. The proposed mechanism is organized by the heterotrimeric protein eIF4F (=eIF4A + eIF4F + eIF4G), attached to the scanning ribosomal particle via eIF3, and the RNA-binding protein eIF4B that is postulated to play the role of the pawl. The energy for the useful work of the ratchet-and-pawl mechanism is supplied from ATP hydrolysis induced by the eIF4A subunit: ATP binding and its hydrolysis alternately change the affinities of eIF4A for eIF4B and For mRNA, resulting in the restriction of backward diffusional sliding of the 43S ribosomal complex along the mRNA chain, while stochastic movements ahead are allowed.

AB Virtual reality (VR) is a high-end human computer interface that strives to immerse the designers and users completely in a virtual interactive environment for a simulation of real world. In order to meet the requirements of market competition, VR technologies can not only reduce effectively the time and cost, but also optimize complex products in the design process. PVAS (Products Virtual Analysis System) is developed in the paper. The system can realize three main functions. Firstly, products are displayed for the designers and users with stereo glasses. Secondly, products performance is analyzed and optimized in virtual environment. Thirdly, virtual machining and virtual assembly are realized. At present, the translation of data form CAD to virtual reality is often unidirectional and unsatisfactory. Since the limitation is the different data formats used for CAD and VR, two different approaches are proposed in the paper. Finally, the paper takes virtual reality applications in turn-milling centre an example. Using three-dimensional computer graphics, interactive devices, and stereo glasses, turn-milling centre machining simulation can be realized in a virtual world as if it were in the real world. Therefore the method that complex products based on VR are analyzed is significant and has application value.

AB We have investigated about machining of glass plates by a UV laser, a nanosecond FHG Nd:YAG laser. Laser wavelength was 266 nm and pulse width was about 4 - 6 ns. Repetition rate of the laser pulse was up to 30 Hz. Borosilicate glass plate of I mm thick was irradiated by laser pulse in air. An X-Y axis precision translation stage was used to chan(ye the laser irradiation spot on the -lass surface. The spot size of focusing beam at the glass surface was varied by changing the distance between the glass and a focal lens. Focal position of the focal lens was determined by measuring bum patterns on thermo-sensitive paper as a function of distance between the lens and the paper. When the Glass plate was placed at the focal point, radial cracks occurred on the surface. When the glass plate was moved toward the lens by 0.7 mm, ablation still took place and provided good quality groove on the surface with no significant cracks. The cross section of the groove was conical for slower scanning speed while it became shallow dip with rather flat bottom for faster scan speed. The grove depth increased linearly as the laser fluence increased.

AB Memory Management Units ( MMUs) for on-device address translation are widely used in modern devices. However, conventional solutions for on-device MMU virtualization, such as shadowpage table implemented in mediated pass-through, still suffer from high complexity and low performance.
   We present Demon, an efficient solution for on-DEvice MMU virtualizatiON in mediated pass-through. The key insight is that Demon takes advantage of IOMMU to construct a two-dimensional address translation and dynamically switches the 2(nd)-dimensional page table to a proper candidate when the device owner switches. In order to support fine-grained parallelism for the device with multiple engines, we put forward a hardware proposal that separates the address space of each engine and enables simultaneous device address remapping for multiple virtual machines (VMs). We implement Demon with a prototype named gDemon which virtualizes Intel GPU MMU. Nonetheless, Demon is not limited to this particular case. Evaluations show that gDemon provides up to 19.73x better performance in the media transcoding workloads and achieves performance improvement of up to 17.09% and 13.73% in the 2D benchmarks and 3D benchmarks, respectively, compared with gVirt. The current release of gDemon scales up to 6 VMs with moderate performance in our experiments. In addition, gDemon simplifies the implementation of GPU MMU virtualization with 37% code reduction.

AB This paper describes our work at CLEF 2006 Robust task. This is an ad-hoc task that explores methods for stable retrieval by focusing on poorly performing topics. We have participated in all subtasks: monolingual (English, French, Italian and Spanish), bilingual (Italian to Spanish) and multilingual (Spanish to [English, French, Italian and Spanish]). In monolingual retrieval we have focused our effort on local query expansion, i.e. using only the information from retrieved documents, not from the complete document collection or external corpora, such as the Web. Some local expansion techniques were applied for training topics. Regarding robustness the most effective one was the use of co-occurrence based thesauri, which were constructed using co-occurrence relations in windows of terms, not in complete documents. This is an effective technique that can be easily implemented by tuning only a few parameters. In bilingual and multilingual retrieval experiments several machine translation programs were used to translate topics. For each target language, translations were merged before performing a monolingual retrieval. We also applied the same local expansion technique. In multilingual retrieval, weighted max-min normalization was used to merge lists. In all the subtasks in which we participated our mandatory runs (using title and description fields of the topics) obtained very good rankings. Runs with short queries (only title field) also obtained high MAP and GMAP values using the same expansion technique.

AB The long-standing endeavor of relating the textual and the visual domain recently underwent a pivotal breakthrough, as OpenAI released CLIP. This model distinguishes how well an English text corresponds with a given image with unprecedented accuracy. Trained via a contrastive learning objective over a huge dataset of 400M of images and captions, it is a work that is not easily replicated, especially for low resource languages. Capitalizing on the modularization of the CLIP architecture, we propose to use cross-lingual teacher learning to re-train the textual encoder for various non-English languages. Our method requires no image data and relies entirely on machine translation which removes the need for data in the target language. We find that our method can efficiently train a new textual encoder with relatively low computational cost, whilst still outperforming previous baselines on multilingual image-text retrieval.

AB We propose an octree guided neural network architecture and spherical convolutional kernel for machine learning from arbitrary 3D point clouds. The network architecture capitalizes on the sparse nature of irregular point clouds, and hierarchically coarsens the data representation with space partitioning. At the same time, the proposed spherical kernels systematically quantize point neighborhoods to identify local geometric structures in the data, while maintaining the properties of translation-invariance and asymmetry. We specify spherical kernels with the help of network neurons that in turn are associated with spatial locations. We exploit this association to avert dynamic kernel generation during network training that enables efficient learning with high resolution point clouds. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is established on the benchmark tasks of 3D object classification and segmentation, achieving competetive performance on ShapeNet and RueMonge2014 datasets.

AB Linear motors are being used in a different application with a huge popularity in the use of transport industry. With the invention of maglev trains and other high-speed trains, linear motors are being used for the translation and braking applications for these systems. However, a huge drawback of the linear motor design is the cogging force, low thrust values, and voltage ripples. This paper aims to study the force analysis with change in taper/teeth width of the motor stator and mover to understand the best teeth ratio to obtain a high flux density and a high thrust. The analysis is conducted through JMAG software and it is found that the optimum teeth ratio for both the stator and mover gives an increase of 94.4% increases compared to the 0.5mm stator and mover width.

TI Synthetic Treebanking for Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
AB How do we parse the languages for which no treebanks are available? This contribution addresses the cross-lingual viewpoint on statistical dependency parsing, in which we attempt to make use of resource-rich source language treebanks to build and adapt models for the under-resourced target languages. We outline the benefits, and indicate the drawbacks of the current major approaches. We emphasize synthetic tree banking: the automatic creation of target language treebanks by means of annotation projection and machine translation. We present competitive results in cross-lingual dependency parsing using a combination of various techniques that contribute to the overall success of the method. We further include a detailed discussion about the impact of part-of-speech label accuracy on parsing results that provide guidance in practical applications of cross-lingual methods for truly under-resourced languages.

AB In this paper, we describe methods for handling multilingual non-compositional constructions in the framework of GF. We specifically look at methods to detect and extract non-compositional phrases from parallel texts and propose methods to handle such constructions in GF grammars. We expect that the methods to handle non-compositional constructions will enrich CNLs by providing more flexibility in the design of controlled languages. We look at two specific use cases of non-compositional constructions: a general-purpose method to detect and extract multilingual multiword expressions and a procedure to identify nominal compounds in German. We evaluate our procedure for multiword expressions by performing a qualitative analysis of the results. For the experiments on nominal compounds, we incorporate the detected compounds in a full SMT pipeline and evaluate the impact of our method in machine translation process.

TI Helix-Rod Host-Guest Complexes with Shuttling Rates Much Faster than
   Disassembly
SO SCIENCE
AB Dynamic assembly is a powerful fabrication method of complex, functionally diverse molecular architectures, but its use in synthetic nanomachines has been hampered by the difficulty of avoiding reversible attachments that result in the premature breaking apart of loosely held moving parts. We show that molecular motion can be controlled in dynamically assembled systems through segregation of the disassembly process and internal translation to time scales that differ by four orders of magnitude. Helical molecular tapes were designed to slowly wind around rod-like guests and then to rapidly slide along them. The winding process requires helix unfolding and refolding, as well as a strict match between helix length and anchor points on the rods. This modular design and dynamic assembly open up promising capabilities in molecular machinery.

TI Image Manipulation for High Temperature Plasmas
SO CONTRIBUTIONS TO PLASMA PHYSICS
AB In magnetic confinement Nuclear Fusion video cameras have become routine diagnostics, which can produce gigabytes of data per discharge. New tools and methods are required to manipulate the frames of these videos to obtain the required information. New algorithms have been developed, which implement pattern recognition methods to search the repositories of videos on the basis of their content and not on their address. Real time automatic analysis of videos has motivated the development of machine learning tools to classify objects in images. The identification and tracking of objects in the videos of Tokamak diagnostics requires the computation of image descriptors, which are insensitive to rotation, translation and rescaling. The Hu moments have proved to be quite effective in performing this image analysis task. (c) 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

TI Conceptual analysis of parallel corpus collected from the web
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB As illustrated by the World Wide Web, the volume of information in languages other than English has grown significantly in recent years. This highlights the importance of multilingual corpora. Much effort has been devoted to the compilation of multilingual corpora for the purpose of cross-lingual information retrieval and machine translation. Existing parallel corpora mostly involve European languages, such as English-French and English-Spanish. There is still a lack of parallel corpora between European languages and Asian languages. In the authors' previous work, an alignment method to identify one-to-one Chinese and English title pairs was developed to construct an English-Chinese parallel corpus that works automatically from the World Wide Web, and a 100% precision and 87% recall were obtained. Careful analysis of these results has helped the authors to understand how the alignment method can be improved. A conceptual analysis was conducted, which includes the analysis of conceptual equivalent and conceptual information alternation in the aligned and nonaligned English-Chinese title pairs that are obtained by the alignment method. The result of the analysis not only reflects the characteristics of parallel corpora, but also gives insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the alignment method. In particular, conceptual alternation, such as omission and addition, is found to have a significant impact on the performance of the alignment method.

AB The bio-inspired concept of deep learning has brought a revolution in artificial intelligence. It has challenged several areas including computer vision, signal processing, healthcare, transportation, security, robotics and machine translation. The core idea is to make learning algorithms efficient and convenient to use for solving daily life problems. This technology is still naive and facing multiple challenges like massive data availability, computation and infrastructural cost, resource dependency, efficient resource utilization, model production and platform procurement. Also it is found that most of the structured and unstructured data comes in the form of images, captured through different types of sensors. These images if utilized efficiently, can serve as an effective tool to solve numerous problems. To target above, a resource independent deep learning framework is proposed in this article. This work is an effort towards deploying deep neural network off-premises for medical image analysis to eliminate on-premises resource dependency and making efficient use of pay-as-per-demand paradigm offered by cloud services. This approach not only reduces the overall infrastructural cost but also enables a diverse range of need-based computational resource selection. The proposed work has shown promising results and considered as an effort to promote cloud-based resource independent machine intelligence.

AB Automatically generated fake restaurant reviews are a threat to online review systems. Recent research has shown that users have difficulties in detecting machine-generated fake reviews hiding among real restaurant reviews. The method used in this work (char-LSTM) has one drawback: it has difficulties staying in context, i.e. when it generates a review for specific target entity, the resulting review may contain phrases that are unrelated to the target, thus increasing its detectability. In this work, we present and evaluate a more sophisticated technique based on neural machine translation (NMT) with which we can generate reviews that stay on-topic. We test multiple variants of our technique using native English speakers on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We demonstrate that reviews generated by the best variant have almost optimal undetectability (class-averaged F-score 47%). We conduct a user study with experienced users and show that our method evades detection more frequently compared to the state-of-the-art (average evasion 3.2/4 vs 1.5/4) with statistical significance, at level alpha = 1% (Sect. 4.3). We develop very effective detection tools and reach average F-score of 97% in classifying these. Although fake reviews are very effective in fooling people, effective automatic detection is still feasible.

TI Predicting Second Language Proficiency Level Using Linguistic Cognitive
   Task and Machine Learning Techniques
SO WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB This paper proposes a novel method for predicting second language proficiency based on linguistic cognitive ability measured in linguistic cognitive response test. Our method is based on an assumption that there is a correlation between language aptitude test scores and linguistic cognitive ability. Our proposed method for predicting L2 language proficiency uses as input learner's linguistic cognition aptitude data. In our experiment, the method produced promising results with the predictive power as high as 70 %. Linguistic cognitive ability is measured through linguistic cognition tasks, which are: reading lexical decision tasks (LDT), listening LDT, translation recognition tasks, and semantic recognition tasks. Each type of the tasks is related to a different linguistic function in the brain. After measuring the learner's linguistic cognitive aptitude, the result is fed as input for a machine learning model, which makes predictions for the corresponding language proficiency level. In training the linguistic proficiency classifier, we used multi-layer perceptron, Naive Bayes, logistic regression, and random forest model. For input data set in our experiment, we had 42 participants take our cognitive aptitude tests and used the result. Our classifier showed an accuracy > 70 % in predicting proficiency level. Among the models, random forest model produced the best predictive power.

AB Alternative splicing is considered to be a key factor underlying increased cellular and functional complexity in higher eukaryotes. With the advance of high-throughput genomics technologies, it becomes critical to mine alternative splicing knowledge from biological research literature. Meanwhile, there have been many papers published on DNA splicing and translation and it is time-consuming to find papers specifically relevant to alternative splicing. Observing that documents reporting alternative splicing can be obtained from existing knowledge bases recording literature evidences and also that a large number of unlabeled documents are freely available, we investigated learning from positive and unlabeled data (LPU) for retrieving papers relevant to alternative splicing. The positive documents are from Literature Support for Alternative Transcripts (LSAT) and unlabeled documents are obtained from Gene Reference Into Function (GeneRIF). We generated nine unlabeled datasets different in size or the way documents were sampled, and compared the performance of document classifiers built using different unlabeled datasets and machine learning algorithms. The study shows that LPU is a viable strategy to build document filtering system, while the performance of trained classifiers is affected by the choice of the unlabeled data set. Selection of machine learning algorithms and that of unlabeled documents would be critical in constructing an effective LPU-based system.

TI The prediction of the porcine pre-microRNAs in genome-wide based on
   support vector machine (SVM) and homology searching
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by targeting mRNAs for translation repression or mRNA degradation. Although many miRNAs have been discovered and studied in human and mouse, few studies focused on porcine miRNAs, especially in genome wide.
   Results: Here, we adopted computational approaches including support vector machine (SVM) and homology searching to make a global scanning on the pre-miRNAs of pigs. In our study, we built the SVM-based porcine pre-miRNAs classifier with a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 91.2% and a total prediction accuracy of 95.6%, respectively. Moreover, 2204 novel porcine pre-miRNA candidates were found by using SVM-based pre-miRNAs classifier. Besides, 116 porcine pre-miRNA candidates were detected by homology searching.
   Conclusions: We identified the porcine pre-miRNA in genome-wide through computational approaches by utilizing the data sets of pigs and set up the porcine pre-miRNAs library which may provide us a global scanning on the pre-miRNAs of pigs in genome level and would benefit subsequent experimental research on porcine miRNA functional and expression analysis.

AB Phonetic transcription is an approach to represent speech sounds to specific symbols. The most common alphabet we used is the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), and the characters in the IPA are phonetic symbols. To support the phonetic transcription process in the phonetic exams of our linguistic E-learning system, we designed a machine translation tool that aims to translate English words to their phonetic formats. This progress can also be expressed as grapheme to phoneme (G2P). The Transformer model has been utilized to develop this G2P module. Also, to improve the functionality of the E-learning system, we trained multiple language models and generated a multilingual G2P translator. Moreover, we evaluated our G2P system by word error rate (WER) and phoneme error rate (PER) with edit distance.

AB Standard conversational semantic parsing maps a complete user utterance into an executable program, after which the program is executed to respond to the user. This could be slow when the program contains expensive function calls. We investigate the opportunity to reduce latency by predicting and executing function calls while the user is still speaking. We introduce the task of online semantic parsing for this purpose, with a formal latency reduction metric inspired by simultaneous machine translation. We propose a general framework with first a learned prefix-to-program prediction module, and then a simple yet effective thresholding heuristic for subprogram selection for early execution. Experiments on the SMCalFlow and TreeDST datasets show our approach achieves large latency reduction with good parsing quality, with a 30%-63% latency reduction depending on function execution time and allowed cost.

Automatic detection of traffic signs is also important for automated intelligent driving vehicle or driver assistance systems. In previous Traffic Sign Detection Systems, locations of the Traffic Signs are estimated using an object pose elimination problem and the problem is modelled using Convolution Neural Network (CNN). In this work, we are proposing a model using Capsule Network (CapsNet) which overcomes the limitations of CNN and provides training accuracy of 95 percent and training accuracy of 98 percent.

TI Changing gears to neutral in a polymorph of one-dimensional arrays of

SO CRYSTENGCOMM
AB We report on a polymorph (2) of an amphidynamic crystal of molecular rods with two helical 1,4-bis(ethynyl) bicyclo[2.2.2] octane rotators where half of the rod-like molecules appear to be shifted with respect to their closest neighbours. This translation takes cogwheel-like pairs of rotators apart in the lattice in such a way that their motion becomes uncorrelated. This property is to be contrasted with the highly correlated motion found to govern the rotators in a recently-published polymorph 1 of the same material. As with polymorph 1, this motion is shown to take place independently of mutations in the handedness of the rotators and of the 'mutamer'-induced second harmonic generation.

AB For language modeling of spontaneous speech, we propose a novel approach, based on the statistical machine translation framework, which transforms a document-style model to the spoken style. For better coverage and more reliable estimation, incorporation of POS (part-of-speech) information is explored in addition to lexical information. In this paper, we investigate several methods that combine POS-based model or integrate POS information in the ME (maximum entropy) scheme. They achieve significant reduction in perplexity and WER in a meeting transcription task. Moreover, the model is applied to different domains or committee meetings of different topics. As a result, even larger perplexity reduction is achieved compared with the case tested in the same domain. The result demonstrates the generality and portability of the model.

TI Advances in the use of cell penetrating peptides for respiratory drug
   delivery
SO EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG DELIVERY
AB Introduction: Respiratory diseases are leading causes of death in the world, still inhalation therapies are the largest fail in drug development. There is an evident need to develop new therapies. Biomolecules represent apotential therapeutic agent in this regard, however their translation to the clinic is hindered by the lack of tools to efficiently deliver molecules. Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) have arisen as apotential strategy for intracellular delivery that could theoretically enable the translation of new therapies. Areas covered: In this review, the use of CPPs as astrategy to deliver different molecules (cargoes) to treat lung-relateddiseases will be the focus. Abrief description of these molecules and the innovative methods in designing new CPPs is presented. The delivery of different cargoes (proteins, peptides, poorly soluble drugs and nucleic acids) using CPPs is discussed, focusing on benefits to treat different respiratory diseases like inflammatory disorders, cystic fibrosis and lung cancer. Expert opinion: The advantages of using CPPs to deliver biomolecules and poorly soluble drugs to the lungs is evident. This field has advanced in the past few years toward targeted intracellular delivery, although further studies are needed to fully understand its potential and limitations in vitro and in vivo.

TI Assessing and mitigating alignment defects of the pyramid wavefront
   sensor: a translation insensitive control method
SO ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
AB The pyramid wavefront sensor (PWFS) is the currently preferred design for adaptive optics (AO) systems for extremely large telescopes, as focal plane wavefront sensing bears potential for a large intrinsic sensitivity gain when compared to Shack-Hartmann (SH) sensors. Yet, obtaining a high quality pyramidal prism and a model-consistent assembly remains a critical design factor. We demonstrate that the traditional gradient sensing controller is extremely sensitive to prism shape defects and assembly misalignments. We show that even optimal registration of quadrants on the detector may be insufficient to prevent misalignment induced performance loss through a theoretical analysis of the impact of detection plane quadrants sampling errors and individual translations, which may be induced by a variety of mechanical defects. These misalignments displace wavefront information to terms not included in the conventional gradient-like slopes maps and high spatial frequencies become invisible to the sole X- and Y- axis differences. We introduce expanded space control (ESC) for quad-cell signal by generalizing output measurements of the PWFS and demonstrate its insensitivity to misalignment-induced information loss, therefore dramatically relaxing machining and alignment constraints for PWFS engineering. This work presents the theoretical developments leading to ESC design, along with validating performance and robustness results, both in end-to-end numerical simulations and on a PWFS demonstrator bench at LESIA.

TI A possible extension to the RInChI as a means of providing machine
   readable process data
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS
AB The algorithmic, large-scale use and analysis of reaction databases such as Reaxys is currently hindered by the absence of widely adopted standards for publishing reaction data in machine readable formats. Crucial data such as yields of all products or stoichiometry are frequently not explicitly stated in the published papers and, hence, not reported in the database entry for those reactions, limiting their usefulness for algorithmic analysis. This paper presents a possible extension to the IUPAC RInChI standard via an auxiliary layer, termed ProcAuxInfo, which is a standardised, extensible form in which to report certain key reaction parameters such as declaration of all products and reactants as well as auxiliaries known in the reaction, reaction stoichiometry, amounts of substances used, conversion, yield and operating conditions. The standard is demonstrated via creation of the RInChI including the ProcAuxInfo layer based on three published reactions and demonstrates accurate data recoverability via reverse translation of the created strings. Implementation of this or another method of reporting process data by the publishing community would ensure that databases, such as Reaxys, would be able to abstract crucial data for big data analysis of their contents.

AB In this paper, we propose an effective method to recognize human actions. Combined with the relationship between 3D skeleton model of joint position and particle group optimization algorithm is used to optimize the support vector machine (PSO-SVM) and depth through the Kinect sensor to obtain human 3D skeleton model, each skeletal model with 20 joints and 19 joints, the relative geometry between various body parts provides a more meaningful description than their absolute locations, we explicitly model the relative 3D geometry between different body parts in our skeletal representation. Mathematically, rigid body rotations and translations in 3D space are members of the special Euclidean group SE(3), which is a matrix Lie group. Hence, we represent the relative geometry between a pair of body parts as a point in SE(3), We then perform classification using a combination of dynamic time warping, and particle swarm optimization on support vector machine (PSO-SVM), Experimental results on three action datasets : MSR-Action 3D, UT-Kinect, Florence 3D-Action, show that the proposed representation performs better than many existing skeletal representations. The proposed approach also outperforms various state-of-the-art skeleton-based human action recognition approaches.

TI Data Augmentation Method for Plant Leaf Disease Recognition
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Recently, several plant pathogens have become more active due to temperature increases arising from climate change, which has caused damage to various crops. If climate change continues, it will likely be very difficult to maintain current crop production, and the problem of a shortage of expert manpower is also deepening. Fortunately, research on various early diagnosis systems based on deep learning is actively underway to solve these problems, but the problem of lack of diversity in some hard-to-collect disease samples remains. This imbalanced data increases the bias of machine learning models, causing overfitting problems. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation method based on an image-to-image translation model to solve the bias problem by supplementing these insufficient diseased leaf images. The proposed augmentation method performs translation between healthy and diseased leaf images and utilizes attention mechanisms to create images that reflect more evident disease textures. Through these improvements, we generated a more plausible diseased leaf image compared to existing methods and conducted an experiment to verify whether this data augmentation method could further improve the performance of a classification model for early diagnosis of plants. In the experiment, the PlantVillage dataset was used, and the extended dataset was built using the generated images and original images, and the performance of the classification models was evaluated through the test set.

TI Linear dimensionality reduction method based on topological properties
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Dimensionality reduction is an important data preprocessing technique that has been extensively studied in machine learning and data mining. Locality Preserving Projection (LPP) is a widely used linear unsupervised dimensionality reduction method, which maps high-dimensional data into low-dimensional subspace through linear transformation. Although various variants of LPP have been proposed to tackle different drawbacks of LPP, it is identified in this article that LPP does not possess the important topological prop-erty of translation invariance, that is, the linear transformation given by LPP is strongly related to the relative position between the data and the origin of the coordinate system. In this article, we theoretically analyze the reason why this drawback exists in LPP and pro -pose to resolve it by introducing a kind of centralization to the model. Moreover, as topo-logical properties are prominent information to characterize the structure of the data, this article proposes a further improvement of LPP to maintain topological connectivity of data after dimensionality reduction. Experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets show that the new model incorporating topological properties outperforms not only the original LPP model but also several other classic linear or non-linear dimensionality reduc-tion methods.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI DeepPASTA: deep neural network based polyadenylation site analysis
SO BIOINFORMATICS
AB Motivation: Alternative polyadenylation (polyA) sites near the 3' end of a pre-mRNA create multiple mRNA transcripts with different 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs). The sequence elements of a 3' UTR are essential for many biological activities such as mRNA stability, sub-cellular localization, protein translation, protein binding and translation efficiency. Moreover, numerous studies in the literature have reported the correlation between diseases and the shortening (or lengthening) of 3' UTRs. As alternative polyA sites are common in mammalian genes, several machine learning tools have been published for predicting polyA sites from sequence data. These tools either consider limited sequence features or use relatively old algorithms for polyA site prediction. Moreover, none of the previous tools consider RNA secondary structures as a feature to predict polyA sites.
   Results: In this paper, we propose a new deep learning model, called DeepPASTA, for predicting polyA sites from both sequence and RNA secondary structure data. The model is then extended to predict tissue-specific polyA sites. Moreover, the tool can predict the most dominant (i.e. frequently used) polyA site of a gene in a specific tissue and relative dominance when two polyA sites of the same gene are given. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that DeepPASTA signisficantly outperforms the existing tools for polyA site prediction and tissue-specific relative and absolute dominant polyA site prediction.

TI Temperature time-lag effect elimination method of structural deformation
   monitoring data for cable-stayed bridges
SO CASE STUDIES IN THERMAL ENGINEERING
AB In structural health monitoring, temperature time-lag effect inevitably affects the state assessment and damage warning of structures. Most of the existing studies focused on using machine learning models to eliminate temperature time-lag effect, but the training of models is expensive. A novel time-domain translation (TDT) method is proposed. Based on the linear correlation between temperature and structural deformation data, the mean square error (MSE) between the original structural deformation data and the fitting data is calculated. By translating the structural deformation data sequences in the time domain, the MSE is reduced to eliminate temperature time-lag effect. The Waitan Bridge located in Ningbo, China is taken as an example. The proposed method is used to eliminate the temperature time-lag effect of structural deformation data, and compared with the Fourier series method. The results show that there are obvious hysteresis loops in the correlation analysis between structural deformation and temperature. The temperature time-lag effect elimination method proposed in this study effectively reduces the area of hys-teresis loops, and enhances the correlation between bridge structure deformation and tempera ture data. Compared with the Fourier series method, the TDT method can eliminate the hysteresis loops more thoroughly, and is independent of subjective experience judgment.

TI A Measurement Image Translation-Automatic Target Recognition Technique
   Based on CycleGAN with SAR Simulation DB
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROMAGNETIC ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE
AB The proposed approach achieves the reliable accuracy of synthetic aperture radar-automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) with a simulation database. The simulation images of targets-of-interest are generated from inverse SAR using high-frequency techniques. A measurement image translation-automatic target recognition (MIT-ATR) uses two deep learning networks. The unique feature of the MIT-ATR is that the measurement images are translated to the simulation-like images by cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN). CycleGAN does not need to have a dataset of paired images between the measurement and simulation images. The generated simulation-like images are used as the inputs of the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) network. The VGG network is trained on a simulation database with a softmax layer of multi-classes. Five classes, including a T-72 tank, are considered in the numerical experiments. The images of each class are simulated at all azimuth angles, but the elevation angles range from 6 degrees to 30 degrees. The accuracy of the proposed approach is 63% better than that of the traditional method with only the VGG network. The simulation database could definitely supplement the lack of measurement data. The accuracy of MIT-ATR is properly handled by CycleGAN and the VGG network.

TI CMSENN: Computational Modification Sites with Ensemble Neural Network
SO CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS
AB With the rapid development of high-through technology, vast amounts of protein molecular data has been generated, which is crucial to advance our understanding of biological organisms. An increasing number of protein post translation modification sites identification approaches have been designed and developed to detect such modification sites among the protein sequences. Nevertheless, these methods are merely suitable for one type of modification site, their performance deteriorate rapidly when applied to other types of modification sites' prediction. In this paper, with the method of different types of neural network algorithm ensemble, a novel method, named CMSENN (http://121.250.173.184/) Computational Modification Sites with Ensemble Neural Network, was proposed to detect protein modification. The algorithm mainly consists of several steps: First, the predicted peptide sequences translate to the feature vectors. Second, the three types of employed amino acid residues properties should be normalized. Finally, various combination of features and classification model have been compared the performances with several current typical algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed model have well performance at the sensitivity, specificity, F1 score and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) value in the identification modification with the approach of the selected features and algorithm combination.

TI An assembly landscape for the 30S ribosomal subunit
SO NATURE
AB Self- assembling macromolecular machines drive fundamental cellular processes, including transcription, messenger RNA processing, translation, DNA replication and cellular transport. The ribosome, which carries out protein synthesis, is one such machine, and the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome is the preeminent model system for biophysical analysis of large RNA - protein complexes. Our understanding of 30S assembly is incomplete, owing to the challenges of monitoring the association of many components simultaneously. Here we have developed a method involving pulse - chase monitored by quantitative mass spectrometry ( PC/ QMS) to follow the assembly of the 20 ribosomal proteins with 16S ribosomal RNA during formation of the functional particle. These data represent a detailed and quantitative kinetic characterization of the assembly of a large multicomponent macromolecular complex. By measuring the protein binding rates at a range of temperatures, we find that local transformations throughout the assembling subunit have similar but distinct activation energies. Thus, the prevailing view of 30S assembly as a pathway proceeding through a global rate-limiting conformational change must give way to one in which the assembly of the complex traverses a landscape dotted with various local conformational transitions.

AB Natural language processing researchers have identified limitations of evaluation methodology for generation tasks, with new questions raised about the validity of automatic metrics and of crowdworker judgments. Meanwhile, efforts to improve generation models tend to depend on simple n-gram overlap metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE). We argue that new advances on models and metrics should each more directly benefit and inform the other. We therefore propose a generalization of leaderboards, bidimensional leaderboards ( BILLBOARDs), that simultaneously tracks progress in language generation models and metrics for their evaluation. Unlike conventional unidimensional leaderboards that sort submitted systems by predetermined metrics, a BILLBOARD accepts both generators and evaluation metrics as competing entries. A BILLBOARD automatically creates an ensemble metric that selects and linearly combines a few metrics based on a global analysis across generators. Further, metrics are ranked based on their correlation with human judgments. We release four BILLBOARDs for machine translation, summarization, and image captioning.1 We demonstrate that a linear ensemble of a few diverse metrics sometimes substantially outperforms existing metrics in isolation. Our mixed-effects model analysis shows that most automatic metrics, especially the reference-based ones, overrate machine over human generation, demonstrating the importance of updating metrics as generation models become stronger (and perhaps more similar to humans) in the future.

AB PRIMAGE is one of the largest and more ambitious research projects dealing with medical imaging, artificial intelligence and cancer treatment in children. It is a 4-year European Commission-financed project that has 16 European partners in the consortium, including the European Society for Paediatric Oncology, two imaging biobanks, and three prominent European paediatric oncology units. The project is constructed as an observational in silico study involving high-quality anonymised datasets (imaging, clinical, molecular, and genetics) for the training and validation of machine learning and multiscale algorithms. The open cloud-based platform will offer precise clinical assistance for phenotyping (diagnosis), treatment allocation (prediction), and patient endpoints (prognosis), based on the use of imaging biomarkers, tumour growth simulation, advanced visualisation of confidence scores, and machine-learning approaches. The decision support prototype will be constructed and validated on two paediatric cancers: neuroblastoma and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. External validation will be performed on data recruited from independent collaborative centres. Final results will be available for the scientific community at the end of the project, and ready for translation to other malignant solid tumours.

AB Sequence to sequence (seq2seq) prediction is a key to many tasks of machine learning. Personal computer software sequence, as one of these tasks, was regarded as stochastic and unpredictable in the past. However, the deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved excellent performance recently in sequence to sequence tasks, especially in the field of natural language process (NLP) such as language model, machine translation and dialogue systems. This paper examines the most popular DNNs approaches: LSTM, Encoder-Decoder network and Memory network in sequence prediction field to handle the software sequence learning and prediction task. Then three modified approaches based on these state of the art models are proposed to deal with additional information in sequence. These approaches focus on three aspects: adding information to enrich embedding input of Long-Short Term Memory, adding classifier to encoder-decoder neural network as an assistive model and processing data to be structured for memory unit in memory network. Experimental results based in real user data sets show that these proposed approaches outperform their corresponding standard DNNs and additional information can benefit the sequence neural network in different phases while constructing models. Experiments in different users shown that these modified strategies are robust and can be applied widely.

AB Pad dressing, which is one of the most important planarization processes, is widely used in CMP. The estimation of surface roughness under various machining parameters (such as dressing force, diamond density of the dresser, rotational speed of the dresser, different machining paths, etc.) is essential to the pad dressing process. In this study, elastic-plastic theory and the wear model are used to construct the expression for the magnitude of material removal as a function of the indentation depth. The deformation of the pad is obtained by using elastic-plastic theory, and the material removal caused by individual micro-contacts is calculated with the help of wear theory. Finally, the macroscopic wear volume is found by summing the volumetric wear of each individual micro-contact. A parametric study is conducted to explore the influence on the surface roughness results and the pad dressing interfacial phenomena of operational parameters. The results reveal that a rapid initial improvement followed by a leveling off, manifesting a saturation effect. Moreover, the model shows that a higher dressing force with a dresser speed close to the pad speed and a moderate translation speed increase the material removal rate corresponding with a lower surface roughness dressing.

TI A Hybrid Ranking Approach to Chinese Spelling Check
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB We propose a novel framework for Chinese Spelling Check (CSC), which is an automatic algorithm to detect and correct Chinese spelling errors. Our framework contains two key components: candidate generation and candidate ranking. Our framework differs from previous research, such as Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) based model or Language Model (LM) based model, in that we use both SMT and LM models as components of our framework for generating the correction candidates, in order to obtain maximum recall; to improve the precision, we further employ a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier to rank the candidates generated by the SMT and the LM. Experiments show that our framework outperforms other systems, which adopted the same or similar resources as ours in the SIGHAN 7 shared task; even comparing with the state-of- the-art systems, which used more resources, such as a considerable large dictionary, an idiom dictionary and other semantic information, our framework still obtains competitive results. Furthermore, to address the resource scarceness problem for training the SMT model, we generate around 2 million artificial training sentences using the Chinese character confusion sets, which include a set of Chinese characters with similar shapes and similar pronunciations, provided by the SIGHAN 7 shared task.

TI Exploring trace transform for robust human action recognition
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION
AB Machine based human action recognition has become very popular in the last decade. Automatic unattended surveillance systems, interactive video games, machine learning and robotics are only few of the areas that involve human action recognition. This paper examines the capability of a known transform, the so-called Trace, for human action recognition and proposes two new feature extraction methods based on the specific transform. The first method extracts Trace transforms from binarized silhouettes, representing different stages of a single action period. A final history template composed from the above transforms, represents the whole sequence containing much of the valuable spatiotemporal information contained in a human action. The second, involves Trace for the construction of a set of invariant features that represent the action sequence and can cope with variations usually appeared in video capturing. The specific method takes advantage of the natural specifications of the Trace transform, to produce noise robust features that are invariant to translation, rotation, scaling and are effective, simple and fast to create. Classification experiments performed on two well known and challenging action datasets (KTH and Weizmann) using Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel SVM provided very competitive results indicating the potentials of the proposed techniques.

TI Cross Lingual Sentiment Analysis: A Clustering-Based Bee Colony Instance
   Selection and Target-Based Feature Weighting Approach
SO SENSORS
AB The lack of sentiment resources in poor resource languages poses challenges for the sentiment analysis in which machine learning is involved. Cross-lingual and semi-supervised learning approaches have been deployed to represent the most common ways that can overcome this issue. However, performance of the existing methods degrades due to the poor quality of translated resources, data sparseness and more specifically, language divergence. An integrated learning model that uses a semi-supervised and an ensembled model while utilizing the available sentiment resources to tackle language divergence related issues is proposed. Additionally, to reduce the impact of translation errors and handle instance selection problem, we propose a clustering-based bee-colony-sample selection method for the optimal selection of most distinguishing features representing the target data. To evaluate the proposed model, various experiments are conducted employing an English-Arabic cross-lingual data set. Simulations results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the baseline approaches in terms of classification performances. Furthermore, the statistical outcomes indicate the advantages of the proposed training data sampling and target-based feature selection to reduce the negative effect of translation errors. These results highlight the fact that the proposed approach achieves a performance that is close to in-language supervised models.

TI Special Issue on Affective Speech and Language Synthesis, Generation,

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AFFECTIVE COMPUTING
AB The papers in this special section focus on affective speech and language synthesis, generation, and conversion. As an inseparable and crucial part of spoken language, emotions play a substantial role in human-human and human-technology conversation. They convey information about a person's needs, how one feels about the objectives of a conversation, the trustworthiness of one's verbal communication, and more. Accordingly, substantial efforts have been made to generate affective text and speech for conversational AI, artificial storytelling, and machine translation. Similarly, there is a push for converting the affect in text and speech, ideally, in real-time and fully preserving intelligibility, e. g., to hide one's emotion, for creative applications and in entertainment, or even to augment training data for affect analyzing AI.

AB Due to benefits such as cost savings and accuracy, automated translation of UML models to executable code is becoming more popular. However, important issues in this field include maintainability and efficiency of the produced code, as well as evaluating the consistency of UML models. This paper describes a mechanism for automatically translating UML models into code in a specific programming language. For automatic code creation, the program UML to Code employs UML class diagrams for structural reference. The program creates code structure based on the class diagram, having as backbone, a state machine that converts the XML into code. The code generating tool is experimentally validated using a case study. The resulting code is compatible with UML models, functional, efficient and intelligible, according to the results.

AB Deep Learning-based NLP systems can be sensitive to unseen tokens and hard to learn with high-dimensional inputs, which critically hinder learning generalization. We introduce an approach by grouping input words based on their semantic diversity to simplify input language representation with low ambiguity. Since the semantically diverse words reside in different contexts, we are able to substitute words with their groups and still distinguish word meanings relying on their contexts. We design several algorithms that compute diverse groupings based on random sampling, geometric distances, and entropy maximization, and we prove formal guarantees for the entropy-based algorithms. Experimental results show that our methods generalize NLP models and demonstrate enhanced accuracy on POS tagging and LM tasks and significant improvements on medium-scale machine translation tasks, up to +6.5 BLEU points.

AB YRecently, deep neural network has been widely used in computer vision, machine translation and Go playing and has become the important part of artificial intelligence applications. However, the existence of adversarial examples designed by adversaries could let deep neural networks make incorrect outputs, and fail to work in their applications. Indeed, a considerable amount of work on generating adversarial examples has emerged. Thus, it's important to investigate adversarial examples in deep learning community. Throughout this paper, we introduce some basic knowledge about attacks on DNNs. Then, we discuss several attack methods to generate adversarial examples. Subsequently, we introduce some defense mechanisms to classify or detect adversarial examples correctly. Finally, we review the challenges in this field, along with the corresponding future directions towards dealing with adversarial examples.

TI Deep Neural Architecture for Recovering Dropped Pronouns in Korean
SO ETRI JOURNAL
AB Pronouns are frequently dropped in Korean sentences, especially in text messages in the mobile phone environment. Restoring dropped pronouns can be a beneficial preprocessing task for machine translation, information extraction, spoken dialog systems, and many other applications. In this work, we address the problem of dropped pronoun recovery by resolving two simultaneous subtasks: detecting zero-pronoun sentences and determining the type of dropped pronouns. The problems are statistically modeled by encoding the sentence and classifying types of dropped pronouns using a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. Various RNN-based encoding architectures were investigated, and the stacked RNN was shown to be the best model for Korean zero-pronoun recovery. The proposed method does not require any manual features to be implemented; nevertheless, it shows good performance.

AB Modeling derivational morphology to generate words with particular semantics is useful in many text generation tasks, such as machine translation or abstractive question answering. In this work, we tackle the task of derived word generation. That is, given the word "run," we attempt to generate the word "runner" for "someone who runs." We identify two key problems in generating derived words from root words and transformations: suffix ambiguity and orthographic irregularity. We contribute a novel aggregation model of derived word generation that learns derivational transformations both as orthographic functions using sequence-to-sequence models and as functions in distributional word embedding space. Our best open-vocabulary model, which can generate novel words, and our best closed-vocabulary model, show 22% and 37% relative error reductions over current state-of-the-art systems on the same dataset.

The addition of a video channel in long distance audio communication has been commercially available since 1964, pioneered by AT&T's Picturephone. However the complexity of adding an image channel to a task oriented dialogue has not penetrated the user audience enough to change the user expectation from a like-to-like alternative of Face-to-Face communication, to a new different communication style. This study reports the increase in visual cognitive state occurrences when communicating with a video channel and the different perception that this setting provided to the subjects of the ILMT-s2s corpus.

AB Syntactic or semantic annotation is an indispensable work for understanding the intention of the spoken discourses or dialogues. As we know that dependency relation annotation is a kind of syntactic or low shallow semantic annotation, however the present annotation schemes are almost all for text rather than spoken discourses or dialogues. By analysis the online spontaneous chatting data, this paper tries to propose a dependency scheme for spoken discourses. Based on the HIT scheme (Harbin Institute of Technology), we finally proposed 26 kinds of dependencies, where four dependencies are added as "Translocation", "Repetition", "Duplication" and "Omission", and three are modified as "Independent Structure", "Independent Clause" and "Dependent Clause". The refined dependency scheme enriches the annotation to Chinese spontaneous speech, which would benefit for speech recognition, semantic comprehension and machine translation.

Knowledge of these relations is crucial in many research fields such as information retrieval, machine translation or document clustering. We obtained these relations from newspaper articles. With the help of LSA(1), HAL(2) and COALS(3) algorithms, many semantic spaces were generated. Experiments were conducted on various settings of parameters and on different ways of corpus preprocessing. The preprocessing included lemmatization and an attempt to use only "open class" words. The computed relations between words were evaluated using the Czech equivalent of the Rubenstein-Goodenough test. The results of our experiments can serve as the clue whether the algorithms (LSA, HAL and COALS) originally developed for English can be also used for Czech texts.

AB International organizations (e.g., FAO(1), WHO2, etc.) are increasingly expressing the need for multilingual ontologies for different purposes, e.g., ontology-based multilingual machine translation, multilingual information retrieval. However, most of the ontologies built so far have mainly English or another natural language as basis. Since multilingual ontology building is a very expensive and time-consuming undertaking, we propose methods for guiding users in the localization of ontologies; and provide tools for supporting the process. The main contributions of this paper are; i) the description of a generic Ontology Localization Activity and a methodology for guiding in the localization of ontologies; ii) the description of a tool built according to the guidelines proposed for an automatic localization of ontologies; and iii) a set of experiments used to evaluate the methodological and technological aspects of the Ontology Localization Activity.

To decipher the networking of markers with diagnostic roles on breast carcinomas, we constructed the diagnostic networks by incorporating 6 publically available gene expression datasets with protein interaction data retrieved from BioGRID on previously identified 1015 genes with breast cancer subtyping roles. The Greedy algorithm and mutual information were used to construct the integrated diagnostic network, resulting in 37 genes enclosing 43 interactions. Four genes, FAM134B, KIF2C, ALCAM, KIF1A, were identified having comparable subtyping efficacies with the initial 1015 genes evaluated by hierarchical clustering and cross validations that deploy support vector machine and k nearest neighbor algorithms. Pathway, Gene Ontology, and proliferation marker enrichment analyses collectively suggest 5 primary cancer hallmarks driving breast cancer differentiation, with those contributing to uncontrolled proliferation being the most prominent. Our results propose a 37-gene integrated diagnostic network implicating 5 cancer hallmarks that drives breast cancer heterogeneity and, in particular, a 4-gene panel with clinical diagnostic translation potential.

AB The project Breaking the Unwritten Language Barrier (BULB), which brings together linguists and computer scientists, aims at supporting linguists in documenting unwritten languages. In order to achieve this we develop tools tailored to the needs of documentary linguists by building upon technology and expertise from the area of natural language processing, most prominently automatic speech recognition and machine translation. As a development and test bed for this we have chosen three less-resourced African languages from the Bantu family: Basaa, Myene and Embosi. Work within the project is divided into three main steps:
   1) Collection of a large corpus of speech (100h per language) at a reasonable cost. For this we use standard mobile devices and a dedicated software-Lig-Aikuma. After initial recording, the data is re-spoken by a reference speaker to enhance the signal quality and orally translated into French.
   2) Automatic transcription of the Bantu languages at phoneme level and the French translation at word level. The recognized Bantu phonemes and French words will then be automatically aligned.
   3) Tool development. In close cooperation and discussion with the linguists, the speech and language technologists will design and implement tools that will support the linguists in their work, taking into account the linguists' needs and technology's capabilities.

TI An alignment model for extracting English-Korean translations of term
   constituents
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB Technical terms are linguistic representations of a domain concept, and their constituents are components used to represent the concept. Technical terms are usually multi-word terms and their meanings can be inferred from their constituents. Therefore, term constituents are essential for understanding the designated meaning of technical terms. However, there are several problems in finding the correct meanings of technical terms with their term constituents. First, because a term constituent is usually a morphological unit rather than a conceptual unit in the case of Korean technical terms, we need to first identify conceptual units by chunking term constituents. Second, conceptual units are sometimes homonyms or synonyms. Moreover their meanings show domain dependency. It is therefore necessary to give information about conceptual units and their possible meanings, including homonyms, synonyms, and domain dependency, so that natural language applications can properly handle technical terms. In this paper, we propose a term constituent alignment algorithm that extracts such information from bilingual technical term pairs. Our algorithm recognizes conceptual units and their meanings by finding English term constituents and their corresponding, Korean term constituents for given English-Korean term pairs. Our experimental results indicate that this method can effectively find conceptual units and their meanings with about 6% alignment error rate (AER) on manually analyzed experimental data and about 14% AER on automatically analyzed experimental data.

TI Femtoliter compartment in liposomes for in vitro selection of proteins
SO ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY
AB The aqueous compartment in liposomes provides a reaction resembling the cell and therefore is used as a microcompartment in which to study enzymatic reactions. However, regardless of their method of preparation, the heterogeneity in size of cell-size liposomes limits their potential uses. We established a strategy to estimate the internal aqueous volume of cell-size liposomes using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). Reactions inside individual liposomes can be measured in a high-throughput format provided that the encapsulated proteins give rise to a fluorescent signal such as by exhibiting fluorescence themselves or by catalyzing production of a fluorescent compound. The strategy of volume estimation was applied to in vitro selection experiments. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene was encapsulated into liposomes together with an in vitro translation system. Here liposomes carrying a single copy of the gene were identified using the internal aqueous volume information of individual liposomes, and those exhibiting higher green fluorescence intensity were sorted by the FACS machine. This system was able to enrich those encoding GFP with higher fluorescence intensity over those with lower intensity. These results suggest the possibility of performing evolutionary experiments in an environment that mimics the cell. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Normalisation of Indonesian-English Code-Mixed Text and its Effect on
   Emotion Classification
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB Usage of code-mixed text has increased in recent years among Indonesian internet users, who often mix Indonesian-language with English-language text. Normalisation of this code-mixed text into Indonesian needs to be performed to capture the meaning of English parts of the text and process them effectively. We improve a state-of-the-art code-mixed Indonesian-English normalisation system by modifying its pipeline modules. We further analyse the effect of code-mixed normalisation on emotion classification tasks. Our approach significantly improved on a state-of-the-art Indonesian-English code-mixed text normalisation system in both the individual pipeline modules and the overall system. The new feature set in the language identification module showed an improvement of 4.26% in terms of F-1 score. The combination of machine translation and ruleset in the lexical normalisation module improved BLEU score by 25.22% and lowered WER by 62.49%. The use of context in the translation module improved BLEU score by 2.5% and lowered WER by 8.84%. The effectiveness of the overall pipeline normalisation system increased by 32.11% and 33.82%, in terms of BLEU score and WER, respectively. Code-mixed normalisation also improved the accuracy of emotion classification by up to 37.74% in terms of F-1 score.

TI The Hsp90 Cochaperones Cpr6, Cpr7, and Cns1 Interact with the Intact
   Ribosome
SO EUKARYOTIC CELL
AB The abundant molecular chaperone Hsp90 is essential for the folding and stabilization of hundreds of distinct client proteins. Hsp90 is assisted by multiple cochaperones that modulate Hsp90's ATPase activity and/or promote client interaction, but the in vivo functions of many of these cochaperones are largely unknown. We found that Cpr6, Cpr7, and Cns1 interact with the intact ribosome and that Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking CPR7 or containing mutations in CNS1 exhibited sensitivity to the translation inhibitor hygromycin. Cpr6 contains a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) domain and a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain flanked by charged regions. Truncation or alteration of basic residues near the carboxy terminus of Cpr6 disrupted ribosome interaction. Cns1 contains an amino-terminal TPR domain and a poorly characterized carboxy-terminal domain. The isolated carboxy-terminal domain was able to interact with the ribosome. Although loss of CPR6 does not cause noticeable growth defects, overexpression of CPR6 results in enhanced growth defects in cells expressing the temperature-sensitive cns1-G90D mutation (the G-to-D change at position 90 encoded by cns1). Cpr6 mutants that exhibit reduced ribosome interaction failed to cause growth defects, indicating that ribosome interaction is required for in vivo functions of Cpr6. Together, these results represent a novel link between the Hsp90 molecular-chaperone machine and protein synthesis.

AB This paper presents an enhanced vision system of the "Selective Stereo Gradient Method" (SSGM). Its purpose is the detection of topographies of highly reflective, metallic surfaces of quickly moving metallic tokens. We call this vision system the 3-Color-SSGM. It represents a decisive improvement of the serial-SSGM. The objective is to decide from comparison of the measured characteristic surface topography with topographical data stored in a database whether the token belongs to a reference class or not. In the improved SSGM a 3 sector 120degrees color LED-illumination setup is used for generating a single image of a moving object. Using the spectral properties of the illumination, which matches to the special spectral characteristics of the camera, three independent images can be extracted. The comparison between these images leads to a discrimination between a real object with 3D topography and a photographic image. The experimental setup and special illumination conditions are described. The raw data images are segmented and scaled. Rotation and translation invariance of the recognition and classification process are implemented. A specimen can be classified by using statistical image analysis and template matching methods. The classification statistics results will be reported.

AB Scaling up deep neural network capacity has been known as an effective approach to improving model quality for several different machine learning tasks. In many cases, increasing model capacity beyond the memory limit of a single accelerator has required developing special algorithms or infrastructure. These solutions are often architecture-specific and do not transfer to other tasks. To address the need for efficient and task-independent model parallelism, we introduce GPipe, a pipeline parallelism library that allows scaling any network that can be expressed as a sequence of layers. By pipelining different sub-sequences of layers on separate accelerators, GPipe provides the flexibility of scaling a variety of different networks to gigantic sizes efficiently. Moreover, GPipe utilizes a novel batchsplitting pipelining algorithm, resulting in almost linear speedup when a model is partitioned across multiple accelerators. We demonstrate the advantages of GPipe by training large-scale neural networks on two different tasks with distinct network architectures: (i) Image Classification: We train a 557-million-parameter AmoebaNet model and attain a top-1 accuracy of 84.4% on ImageNet-2012, (ii) Multilingual Neural Machine Translation: We train a single 6-billion-parameter, 128-layer Transformer model on a corpus spanning over 100 languages and achieve better quality than all bilingual models.

TI In vitro stability of cemented and cementless femoral stems with
   compaction
SO CLINICAL ORTHOPAEDICS AND RELATED RESEARCH
AB Rigidity of initial fixation is a key factor contributing to the longevity of cemented and cementless femoral components in total hip arthroplasty. The objective of this study was to measure the initial stability of primary cemented and cementless femoral components under load when 15 pairs of cadaveric femurs were prepared by outward compaction of femoral cancellous bone in situ or by conventional extraction broaching. Three-dimensional micromotion was measured at proximal and distal locations on the femoral components using a device with spherical targets and linear variable differential transformers. External loads simulating the stance phases of level walking and stair ascent were applied to the femoral components by a materials test machine. Bone preparation method significantly affected each of the translation and rotation components of micromotion with cemented and cementless fixation. Micromotion with broaching was consistently greater than with compaction. Compared with compaction, the magnitude of the micromotion translation vector for broaching was an average of 3.9 (standard deviation, 3.1) times greater with cemented fixation, and an average of 2.3 (standard deviation, 1.4) times greater with cementless fixation. The results of this study showed the effectiveness of compaction of femoral cancellous bone in improving the initial stability of cemented and cementless femoral components in primary total hip arthroplasty.

TI Large-scale DNA-based phenotypic recording and deep learning enable
   highly accurate sequence-function mapping
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Predicting effects of gene regulatory elements (GREs) is a longstanding challenge in biology. Machine learning may address this, but requires large datasets linking GREs to their quantitative function. However, experimental methods to generate such datasets are either application-specific or technically complex and error-prone. Here, we introduce DNA-based phenotypic recording as a widely applicable, practicable approach to generate large-scale sequence-function datasets. We use a site-specific recombinase to directly record a GRE's effect in DNA, enabling readout of both sequence and quantitative function for extremely large GRE-sets via next-generation sequencing. We record translation kinetics of over 300,000 bacterial ribosome binding sites (RBSs) in >2.7 million sequence-function pairs in a single experiment. Further, we introduce a deep learning approach employing ensembling and uncertainty modelling that predicts RBS function with high accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. DNA-based phenotypic recording combined with deep learning represents a major advance in our ability to predict function from genetic sequence. Current methods to generate sequence-function data at large scale are either technically complex or limited to specific applications. Here the authors introduce DNA-based phenotypic recording to overcome these limitations and enable deep learning for accurate prediction of function from sequence.

The system accepts Kannada educational video clips as input and output is delivered as 3D character animation. The first phase approach of the proposed system makes use of SpeechRecognition like kaldi an open source for converting the input video files to their respective text which are used to generate the subtitles and these texts are further pre-processed in order to meet the sign language norms. The right SiGML file for these pre-processed words is picked from the database. These SiCMI, files consist of XML tags which correspond to the respective HamNoSys Notations. HamNoSys is an alphabetic system that mostly phonetically describes signs. A synthetic animation of a human in the tool in the URL APP, JA SiGML takes input as these SiGML files and generates signs of the respective pre-processed words. Synchronization of inputted video with the sign language and the subtitle generation is vital for the clear and clean flow. This system is Tested by professional sign language trainer/interpreter for the sign language generated by the avatar and is found effective. The accuracy of sign language shown was found out to be 63%.

AB The biosynthesis of inflammatory mediators relies on controlling the biogenesis and utilization of their corresponding messenger RNAs (mRNAs). These latter "utilization steps" encompass post-transcriptional mechanisms that gradually and variably impose a series of flexible-rate limiting controls to modify the abundance of an mRNA and the rate of its translation to protein in response to environmental signals. Mechanistically, post-transcriptional machines comprise networks of RNA binding proteins (RBPs), which recognize, passively or inducibly, secondary or tertiary ribonucleotide structures located on their target RNAs. The outcome of these interactions is the stringent control of mRNA maturation, localization, turnover and translation. It is conceivable that if these post-transcriptional interactions fail, they may perturb cellular responses to provide the impetus for chronic disease. Such is the case of the signal-responsive mechanisms affecting inflammatory mRNAs containing the AU-rich family of elements (AREs), which are recognized by a specific subset of RBPs. Intense research in this area has yielded important insight on the specific signals and mechanisms affecting the utilization of ARE-containing mRNAs. Here, we indicate briefly the inflammatory relevance of ARE-related mechanisms to highlight their importance in pathophysiology and their potential in the development of future biological therapies.

AB The driving of contrast microbubbles towards a boundary by means of primary radiation forces has been of interest for ultra sound-assisted drug delivery. Secondary radiation forces, resulting from oscillating microbubbles under ultrasound insonification, may cause the mutual attraction and subsequent coalescence of contrast microbubbles. This phenomenon has been less studied. Microbubbles with a negligible shell call be forced to translate towards each other at relatively low mechanical indices (MI). Thick-shelled microbubbles would require a higher MI to be moved. However, at high MI, microbubble disruption is expected. We investigated if thick-shelled contrast agent microbubbles can be forced to cluster at high-MI. The thick-shelled contrast agent M1639, inserted through a cellulose capillary, was subjected to 3 MHz, high-MI pulsed ultrasound from a commercial ultrasound machine, and synchronously captured through a high numerical aperture microscope. The agent showed the ultrasound-induced formation of bubble clusters, and the translation thereof towards the capillary boundary. Hence, forced translation and clustering of thick-shelled contrast microbubbles is feasible. The phase difference between the excursion of the oscillating bubble and the incident sound field was computed for free and encapsulated bubbles. There is a transition in phase difference for encapsulated bubbles, owing to the friction of the shell. Therefore, approach velocities of encapsulated bubbles may not be comparable to those of free gas bubbles.

AB Polymers, due to advantages such as low-cost processing, chemical stability, low density, and tunable design, have emerged as a powerhouse class of materials for a wide range of applications, including dielectrics. However, in certain applications, the performance of dielectrics is limited by insufficient electric breakdown strength. Using this real-world application as a technology driver, we describe a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach for the design of polymers. We call this approach polyG2G. The key concept underlying polyG2G is graph-to-graph translation. Graph-to-graph translation solves the inverse problem. First, the subtle chemical differences between high- and low-performing polymers are learned. Then, the learned differences are applied to known polymers, yielding large libraries of novel, high-performing, hypothetical polymers. Our approach, with respect to a host of presently adopted design methods, exhibits a favorable trade-off between generation of chemically valid materials and available chemical search space. polyG2G finds thousands of potentially high-value targets (in terms of glass-transition temperature, band gap, and electron injection barrier) from an otherwise intractable search space. Density functional theory simulations of band gap and electron injection barrier confirm that a large fraction of the polymers designed by polyG2G are indeed of high value. Finally, we find that polyG2G is able to learn established structure-property relationships.

AB Exceptions are in indispensable part of mod ern programming languages. They are, however, handled poorly, especially by higher-order languages such as Standard ML and Haskell: in both languages a well-typed program can unexpectedly fail due to an uncaught exception. In this paper, we propose a technique for type-safe exception handling. Our approach relies on representing exceptions as sums and assigning exception handlers polymorphic, extensible row types. Based on this representation, we describe an implicitly typed external language EL where well-typed programs do not raise any unhandled exceptions. EL relies on sums, extensible records, and polymorphism to represent exception-handling, and its type system is no more complicated than that for existing languages with polymorphic extensible records.
   EL is translated into an internal language IL that is a variant of System F extended with extensible records. The translation performs a CPS transformation to represent exception handlers as continuations. It also relies on duality to transform sums into records. (The details for this translation are given in an accompanying technical report.)
   We describe the implementation of a compiler for a concrete language based on EL. The compiler performs full type inference and translates EL-style source code to machine code. Type inference relieves the programmer from having to provide explicit exception annotations. We believe that this is the first practical proposal for integrating exceptions into the type system of a higher-order language.

TI Machine learning algorithm to predict anterior cruciate ligament
   revision demonstrates external validity
SO KNEE SURGERY SPORTS TRAUMATOLOGY ARTHROSCOPY
AB Purpose External validation of machine learning predictive models is achieved through evaluation of model performance on different groups of patients than were used for algorithm development. This important step is uncommonly performed, inhibiting clinical translation of newly developed models. Machine learning analysis of the Norwegian Knee Ligament Register (NKLR) recently led to the development of a tool capable of estimating the risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) revision (https://swastvedt.shinyapps.io/calculator_rev/). The purpose of this study was to determine the external validity of the NKLR model by assessing algorithm performance when applied to patients from the Danish Knee Ligament Registry (DKLR).
   Methods The primary outcome measure of the NKLR model was probability of revision ACL reconstruction within 1, 2, and/or 5 years. For external validation, all DKLR patients with complete data for the five variables required for NKLR prediction were included. The five variables included graft choice, femur fixation device, KOOS QOL score at surgery, years from injury to surgery, and age at surgery. Predicted revision probabilities were calculated for all DKLR patients. The model performance was assessed using the same metrics as the NKLR study: concordance and calibration.
   Results In total, 10,922 DKLR patients were included for analysis. Average follow-up time or time-to-revision was 8.4 (+/- 4.3) years and overall revision rate was 6.9%. Surgical technique trends (i.e., graft choice and fixation devices) and injury characteristics (i.e., concomitant meniscus and cartilage pathology) were dissimilar between registries. The model produced similar concordance when applied to the DKLR population compared to the original NKLR test data (DKLR: 0.68; NKLR: 0.68-0.69). Calibration was poorer for the DKLR population at one and five years post primary surgery but similar to the NKLR at two years.
   Conclusion The NKLR machine learning algorithm demonstrated similar performance when applied to patients from the DKLR, suggesting that it is valid for application outside of the initial patient population. This represents the first machine learning model for predicting revision ACL reconstruction that has been externally validated. Clinicians can use this in-clinic calculator to estimate revision risk at a patient specific level when discussing outcome expectations pre-operatively. While encouraging, it should be noted that the performance of the model on patients undergoing ACL reconstruction outside of Scandinavia remains unknown.

TI Representation of Medical Guidelines with a Computer Interpretable Model
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS
AB Nowadays medical software is tightly coupled with medical devices that perform patient state monitoring and lately even some basic treatment procedures. Medical guidelines (GLs) can be seen as specification of a medical system which requires their computer-interpretable representation of medical GLs. Until now most of the medical GLs are often represented in a textual format and therefore often suffer from such structural problems as incompleteness, inconsistencies, ambiguity and redundancy, which makes the translation process to the machine-interpretable language more complicated. Computer-based interpretation of GLs can improve the quality of protocols as well as the quality of medical service. Several GLs formal representation methods have been presented recently. Only some of them enable automatic formal verification by introducing an additional translation path to the existing model checking environments. However, if a verified property fails it is difficult to trace back the result needed to change the model. Moreover, these formalisms provide the notion of time mostly in terms of actions order. In this paper we preset the application of a well-know formal behaviour representation approach of embedded systems design domain to medical GLs interpretation. We use Timed Automata extended with Tasks (TAT) and TIMES toolbox to represent medical GLs as a system behaviour in a computer interpretable form. We discuss the verification issues with the help of the anticancer drug imatinib case study.

TI The power of connectivity: Identity preserving transformations on visual
   streams in the spike domain
SO NEURAL NETWORKS
AB We investigate neural architectures for identity preserving transformations (IPTs) on visual stimuli in the spike domain. The stimuli are encoded with a population of spiking neurons; the resulting spikes are processed and finally decoded. A number of IPTs are demonstrated including faithful stimulus recovery, as well as simple transformations on the original visual stimulus such as translations, rotations and zoomings. We show that if the set of receptive fields satisfies certain symmetry properties, then IPTs can easily be realized and additionally, the same basic stimulus decoding algorithm can be employed to recover the transformed input stimulus. Using group theoretic methods we advance two different neural encoding architectures and discuss the realization of exact and approximate IPTs. These are realized in the spike domain processing block by a "switching matrix" that regulates the input/output connectivity between the stimulus encoding and decoding blocks. For example, for a particular connectivity setting of the switching matrix, the original stimulus is faithfully recovered. For other settings, translations, rotations and dilations (or combinations of these operations) of the original video stream are obtained. We evaluate our theoretical derivations through extensive simulations on natural video scenes, and discuss implications of our results on the problem of invariant object recognition in the spike domain.

TI From psoriasis to a number and back
SO INFORMATION AND ORGANIZATION
AB This paper will argue that accounting can be understood as a special kind of Latourian Actor - a 'space/time/value machine' [Frandsen, A. -C. (2004). Rum, tid och pengar - En studie om redovisning i praktiken. Doctoral Thesis, Goteborg: BAS]. It starts conceptually by seeing accounting and its references as a 'chain of translations' [Latour, B. (1998). Artefaktens aterkomst. Stockholm: Knowledge and Society: Latour, B. (1999). Pandora's hope. Essays on the reality of science studies. Cambridge: Harvard University Press]. Empirically it follows a puzzling set of such references, from a psoriasis clinic where accounting is unfamiliar - so part of what [Tuan, Y. -F. (2001). Space and place, 8th ed. London: University of Minnesota Press] would call a 'space' - to a central finance function where it is taken for granted embodied knowledge, and so part of 'place', and then back, to observe how these references become integrated into medical everyday work and its embodied ways of knowing, establishing the clinic as an accounting 'place' for those who work there.. It then argues that as these references become more taken for granted, accounting acts as a special Actor because of the way it circulates inside and outside both human and non-human 'actants', as a machine which always names and counts, so constituting space, time and valuing through its flexible 'named numbers'.. It tracks how accounting moves to becoming familiar and expands its reach through four categories: 'the character of the associations', 'the integration of associations and the delimitation of movement', 'order and its relation to change; and 'the production of other spaces'. This illuminates how accounting draws actants into its chains or circuits of value, thus extending its ability to construct both facts and acts. Here the paper supplements the actor-network approach with ideas drawn from the work of Hoskin and colleagues [e.g. Ezzamel, M., & Hoskin, K. (2002). Retheorizing the relationship between accounting, writing and money with evidence from Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt. Critical Perspectives on Accounting, 13, 333-367; Hoskin, K. (1981). The history of education and the history of writing, Unpublished paper. Department of Education, University of Warwick; Hoskin, K., & Macve, R., (1986). Accounting and the examination: A genealogy of disciplinary power. Accounting, Organisation and Society, 11, 105-136] which see accounting as a visible sign system naming and counting from before the invention of writing, and so having a special priority in settings concerned with coordinating action in space and across time. In modern managerial worklife settings, its named numbers circulate as paper and electronic texts which are strategically central to both financial and non-financial coordination of resources and actants. This helps clarify why accounting should be such a special Actor, as well as how it functions as machine. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Five-axis Tri-NURBS spline interpolation method considering compensation
   and correction of the nonlinear error of cutter contacting paths
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB In order to improve the accuracy of position and direction of the tool axis vector and the controlling accuracy of cutter contacting (CC) paths between the cutter and workpiece in the traditional five-axis NURBS interpolation method, a five-axis Tri-NURBS spline interpolation method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the spline interpolation instruction format is proposed, which includes three spline curves, the CC point spline, the tool center point spline, and the tool axis point spline. The next interpolation parameter is calculated based on the tool center point spline combined with the conventional parametric interpolation method. Different from the traditional spline interpolation using the same interpolation parameter for all spline curves, the idea of equal ratio configuration of parameters is proposed in this paper to obtain the next interpolation parameter of each spline curve. The next interpolation tool center point, tool axis point, and CC point on the above three spline curves can be obtained by using different interpolation parameters, so as to improve the accuracy of position and direction of the tool axis vector. Secondly, the producing mechanism of the nonlinear error of CC paths of the traditional spline interpolation is analyzed and the mathematical calculation model of the nonlinear error is established. And then, the compensation and correction method of nonlinear error is also proposed to improve the controlling accuracy of CC paths. In this method, the next CC point on the cutter can be first obtained according to the next interpolation tool center point, tool axis point, and CC point on the three spline curves. And then, the error compensation vector is determined with the two next CC points. To correct the nonlinear error between the next CC point on the cutter and the CC point spline curve, the cutter is translated so that the two next CC points can coincide. In the end, the new tool center point and tool axis point after translation can be calculated to obtain the motion control coordinates of each axis of the machine tool. The MATLAB and VERICUT software are used as a simulation of the real machining data. The results show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the nonlinear error of CC paths. It has high practical value for five-axis machining in effectively controlling the accuracy of CC paths and improving the machining accuracy of complex surfaces.

AB Currently, multicore processors are widely used, and processing performance can be improved on many machines by exploiting thread level parallelism. However, for parallelizing a program, it takes much time and effort to analyze effect of parallel processing and to rewrite the source code, so sequential programs still remain around the world, and they can not fully bring out performance of multicore processors. To improve execution performance of existing sequential programs by effectively utilizing processing power of multicore processors, it is quite useful to automatically and directly parallelize a machine language code (binary code) by using binary translation. Based on this background, an automatic parallel processing system that parallelizes and optimizes a sequential binary code using LLVM was proposed. In this paper, we introduce parallelization directives for LLVM IR (Intermediate Representation), and implement an LLVM compiler pass for parallel code generation based on the directives. Our research makes it possible to implement analysis and code generation as versatile programs, and to generate an optimal code according to the multiple analysis results. Evaluation results show that the implemented pass can generate a parallelized IR code and can achieve speedup as highly as the parallelization using source code does.

AB Sign Language uses manual hand and body gestures as well as non-manual facial expressions as a means of communication between deaf and hearing communities. A communication divide exists between the deaf and hearing communities, to the disadvantage of the deaf. This paper explores the design and implementation of a mobile application for South African Sign Language recognition. The application connects, via Bluetooth, to an instrumented glove developed by the University of Cape Town. The objective is to recognize the manual alphabet and manual numeric digits that have static gestures (31 signs in total). Two neural networks (one with a log-sigmoid, and one with a symmetric Elliott activation function) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) were compared. The SVM was chosen for implementation primarily because of its high accuracy of 99% and its superior robustness. The mobile application is developed for Android and allows the user to connect to a Bluetooth glove, display and dictate the classification output and calibrate the connected glove. On a low-end smartphone, the classification time did not exceed 45ms, the memory usage did not exceed 15 MB, and the battery life during typical usage was approximately 11 hours.

TI Programming and training rate-independent chemical reaction networks
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Embedding computation in biochemical environments incompatible with traditional electronics is expected to have a wide-ranging impact in synthetic biology, medicine, nanofabrication, and other fields. Natural biochemical systems are typically modeled by chemical reaction networks (CRNs) which can also be used as a specification language for synthetic chemical computation. In this paper, we identify a syntactically checkable class of CRNs called noncompetitive (NC) whose equilibria are absolutely robust to reaction rates and kinetic rate law, because their behavior is captured solely by their stoichiometric structure. In spite of the inherently parallel nature of chemistry, the robustness property allows for programming as if each reaction applies sequentially. We also present a technique to program NC-CRNs using well-founded deep learning methods, showing a translation procedure from rectified linear unit (ReLU) neural networks to NC-CRNs. In the case of binary weight ReLU networks, our translation procedure is surprisingly tight in the sense that a single bimolecular reaction corresponds to a single ReLU node and vice versa. This compactness argues that neural networks may be a fitting paradigm for programming rate-independent chemical computation. As proof of principle, we demonstrate our scheme with numerical simulations of CRNs translated from neural networks trained on traditional machine learning datasets, as well as tasks better aligned with potential biological applications including virus detection and spatial pattern formation.

AB It is known, that a process of any machine translation system is, decoding of sense of the entrance text in a natural language and re-encoding this meaning in the target language to inform the user in semantic conformity with the entrance/source text.
   One of variants of achievement of this purpose is the formalization of grammatical structures of natural languages participating in translation systems. More specifically, grammatical structures mean linguistic rules of word structures and its offers on word types. The analysis of word structures will give the chance to construct the logically correct linguistic models.
   In the given work the new developed logical-linguistic models of words and offers on types of the Uzbek language are offered for created system of the multi-language modelled computer translator (MMCT). The system which is developed as multilingual on the basis of the new technology MMCT consists seven stages. The logical-linguistic models of the Uzbek language is described as one of the seven stages. The models are described using an extensible input language. Validation over the nouns of the Uzbek language was carried out and the truth of one variant of the logical-linguistic model was proved.

TI Defective samples simulation through adversarial training for automatic
   surface inspection
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
AB Deep learning has shown great potential in machine vision. However, introducing deep learning to automated surface inspection is still a challenging task because it depends heavily on the quality of training samples, especially the defective samples. In this paper, a general defective samples simulation method based on generative adversarial nets (GAN) is proposed to deal with the limitation of defective samples in production. Under the GAN framework, the simulative network with encoder-decoder architecture is proposed. Further, the simulative network and discriminative network are trained adversarially under the proposed regional training strategy, which gives priority to the translation of the defective area. Finally, the defect-free area is refined through wavelet fusion. This method requires a small number of defective training samples, and can generate simulative defects of specified shapes and types and meanwhile obtain the pixel-wise ground truth. The simulative samples can be used directly for training of deep learning based automated surface inspection tasks. We conduct experiments on four datasets. The experimental results show that our method can generate defective samples of higher quality than general image translation methods. Applying this method to surface defect inspection can significantly improve the effect of defect inspection model based on deep learning. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI USING PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION TO ACCURATELY IDENTIFY SYNTACTIC
   PHRASES IN FREE TEXT
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND SOFT COMPUTING RESEARCH
AB The present article reviews the application of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms to optimize a phrasing model, which splits any text into linguistically-motivated phrases. In terms of its functionality, this phrasing model is equivalent to a shallow parser. The phrasing model combines attractive and repulsive forces between neighbouring words in a sentence to determine which segmentation points are required. The extrapolation of phrases in the specific application is aimed towards the automatic translation of unconstrained text from a source language to a target language via a phrase-based system, and thus the phrasing needs to be accurate and consistent to the training data.
   Experimental results indicate that PSO is effective in optimising the weights of the proposed parser system, using two different variants, namely sPSO and AdPSO. These variants result in statistically significant improvements over earlier phrasing results. An analysis of the experimental results leads to a proposed modification in the PSO algorithm, to prevent the swarm from stagnation, by improving the handling of the velocity component of particles. This modification results in more effective training sequences where the search for new solutions is extended in comparison to the basic PSO algorithm. As a consequence, further improvements are achieved in the accuracy of the phrasing module.

AB In this work we formulate the problem of image captioning as a multimodal translation task. Analogous to machine translation, we present a sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural networks (RNN) model for image caption generation. Different from most existing work where the whole image is represented by convolutional neural network (CNN) feature, we propose to represent the input image as a sequence of detected objects which feeds as the source sequence of the RNN model. In this way, the sequential representation of an image can be naturally translated to a sequence of words, as the target sequence of the RNN model. To represent the image in a sequential way, we extract the objects features in the image and arrange them in a order using convolutional neural networks. To further leverage the visual information from the encoded objects, a sequential attention layer is introduced to selectively attend to the objects that are related to generate corresponding words in the sentences. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed approach on popular benchmark dataset, i.e., MS COCO, and the proposed model surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in all metrics following the dataset splits of previous work. The proposed approach is also evaluated by the evaluation server of MS COCO captioning challenge, and achieves very competitive results, e.g., a CIDEr of 1.029 (c5) and 1.064 (c40).

TI The Modular Adaptive Ribosome
SO PLOS ONE
AB The ribosome is an ancient machine, performing the same function across organisms. Although functionally unitary, recent experiments suggest specialized roles for some ribosomal proteins. Our central thesis is that ribosomal proteins function in a modular fashion to decode genetic information in a context dependent manner. We show through large data analyses that although many ribosomal proteins are essential with consistent effect on growth in different conditions in yeast and similar expression across cell and tissue types in mice and humans, some ribosomal proteins are used in an environment specific manner. The latter set of variable ribosomal proteins further function in a coordinated manner forming modules, which are adapted to different environmental cues in different organisms. We show that these environment specific modules of ribosomal proteins in yeast have differential genetic interactions with other pathways and their 5'UTRs show differential signatures of selection in yeast strains, presumably to facilitate adaptation. Similarly, we show that in higher metazoans such as mice and humans, different modules of ribosomal proteins are expressed in different cell types and tissues. A clear example is nervous tissue that uses a ribosomal protein module distinct from the rest of the tissues in both mice and humans. Our results suggest a novel stratification of ribosomal proteins that could have played a role in adaptation, presumably to optimize translation for adaptation to diverse ecological niches and tissue microenvironments.

TI LFTOP: An LF-based approach to domain-specific reasoning
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A new approach to domain-specific reasoning is presented that is based on a type-theoretic logical framework (LF) but does not require the user to be an expert in type theory. The concepts of the domain and its related reasoning systems are formalized in LF, but the user works with the system through a syntax and interface appropriate to his/her work. A middle layer provides translation between the user syntax and LF, and allows additional support for reasoning (e.g., model checking). Thus, the complexity of the logical framework is hidden but the benefits of using type theory and its related tools are retained, such as precision and machine-checkable proofs. This approach is investigated through a number of case studies: here, the authors consider the verification of properties of concurrency. The authors have formalized a specification language (CCS) and logic (mu-calculus) in LF, together with useful lemmas, and a user-oriented syntax has been designed. The authors demonstrate the approach with simple examples. However, applying lemmas to objects introduced by the user may result in framework-level objects which cannot be translated back to the user level. The authors discuss this problem, define a notion of adequacy, and prove that in this case study, translation can always be reversed.

TI Encoder-Decoder Networks for Analyzing Thermal and Power Delivery
   Networks
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DESIGN AUTOMATION OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS
AB Power delivery network (PDN) analysis and thermal analysis are computationally expensive tasks that are essential for successful integrated circuit (IC) design. Algorithmically, both these analyses have similar computational structure and complexity as they involve the solution to a partial differential equation of the same form. This article converts these analyses into image-to-image and sequence-to-sequence translation tasks, which allows leveraging a class of machine learning models with an encoder-decoder-based generative (EDGe) architecture to address the time-intensive nature of these tasks. For PDN analysis, we propose two networks: (i) IREDGe: a full-chip static and dynamic IR drop predictor and (ii) EMEDGe: electromigration (EM) hotspot classifier based on input power, power grid distribution, and power pad distribution patterns. For thermal analysis, we propose ThermEDGe, a full-chip static and dynamic temperature estimator based on input power distribution patterns for thermal analysis. These networks are transferable across designs synthesized within the same technology and packing solution. The networks predict on-chip IR drop, EM hotspot locations, and temperature in milliseconds with negligibly small errors against commercial tools requiring several hours.

TI Evaluation of Data Augmentation Techniques for Facial Expression
   Recognition Systems
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Most Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems rely on machine learning approaches that require large databases for an effective training. As these are not easily available, a good solution is to augment the databases with appropriate data augmentation (DA) techniques, which are typically based on either geometric transformation or oversampling augmentations (e.g., generative adversarial networks (GANs)). However, it is not always easy to understand which DA technique may be more convenient for FER systems because most state-of-the-art experiments use different settings which makes the impact of DA techniques not comparable. To advance in this respect, in this paper, we evaluate and compare the impact of using well-established DA techniques on the emotion recognition accuracy of a FER system based on the well-known VGG16 convolutional neural network (CNN). In particular, we consider both geometric transformations and GAN to increase the amount of training images. We performed cross-database evaluations: training with the "augmented" KDEF database and testing with two different databases (CK+ and ExpW). The best results were obtained combining horizontal reflection, translation and GAN, bringing an accuracy increase of approximately 30%. This outperforms alternative approaches, except for the one technique that could however rely on a quite bigger database.

AB Surface defect is a concerned aspect of surface integrity in ultra-precision machining The dark field microscopy method is efficient in detecting surface processing defects, and has certain development potential. However, it still has deficiencies on reliability, certainty and cross-scale adaptability. In this paper, several kinds of dark field illumination modes are compared, and high contrast and adaptable illumination modes are defined through experiments. Then a defect detection device is designed, which can detect the surface defects of opaque or transparent components by using the dome light source illumination. To enlarge the field of view (FOV), an X-Y scanning stage is used to obtain sub-area image of the surface, and a stitching method based on feature registration with SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features) is also proposed in the manuscript. Researches show that the defect detection device designed in this paper can obtain detailed, high-contrast, and wide range dark field defect images; SURF registration is insensitive to image translation, rotation, scaling and image noise, and has high calculation speed, which can relax the requirement of image stitching on positioning device and environment. This study provides an effective and low-cost solution for defects detection over large-scale surface in ultra-precision machining

TI Mobility, Singularity, and Kinematics Analyses of a Novel Spatial
   Parallel Mechanism
SO JOURNAL OF MECHANISMS AND ROBOTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
AB A spatial parallel kinematic mechanism (PKM) with five degrees of freedom (DoFs) and three limbs is proposed in this paper. To investigate the characteristics of the proposed mechanism's DoFs, mobility analysis based on a line graph method and Grassmann line geometry is carried out. The results show that the mobile platform can rotate about a fixed point at the base and translate in a specific plane (i.e., three rotations and two translations). Therefore, the mobile platform can be located at an arbitrary point in the space and has flexible orientational capability. The orientation of the mobile platform is described by using tilt-and-torsion (T&T) angles, and the kinematics model is established with this precondition. Within the process of kinematics modeling, parasitic motion of the mobile platform is analyzed, and singularity configurations are also disclosed. On this basis, four working modes with different configurations are identified, and one of them is focused on and investigated in detail. The proposed PKM has good potential to be used in the development of movable machine centers. The kinematic analysis is very helpful for the understanding of the concept and the potential applications.

TI Uncovering extensive post-translation regulation during human cell cycle
   progression by integrative multi-'omics analysis
SO BMC BIOINFORMATICS
AB Background: Analysis of high-throughput multi-'omics interactions across the hierarchy of expression has wide interest in making inferences with regard to biological function and biomarker discovery. Expression levels across different scales are determined by robust synthesis, regulation and degradation processes, and hence transcript (mRNA) measurements made by microarray/RNA-Seq only show modest correlation with corresponding protein levels.
   Results: In this work we are interested in quantitative modelling of correlation across such gene products. Building on recent work, we develop computational models spanning transcript, translation and protein levels at different stages of the H. sapiens cell cycle. We enhance this analysis by incorporating 25+ sequence-derived features which are likely determinants of cellular protein concentration and quantitatively select for relevant features, producing a vast dataset with thousands of genes. We reveal insights into the complex interplay between expression levels across time, using machine learning methods to highlight outliers with respect to such models as proteins associated with post-translationally regulated modes of action.
   Conclusions: We uncover quantitative separation between modified and degraded proteins that have roles in cell cycle regulation, chromatin remodelling and protein catabolism according to Gene Ontology; and highlight the opportunities for providing biological insights in future model systems.

TI Pre-clinical assessment of total knee replacement anterior-posterior
   constraint
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS
AB Pre-clinical, bench-top assessment of Total Knee Replacements (TKR) can provide information about the inherent constraint provided by a TKR, which does not depend on the condition of the patient undergoing the arthroplasty. However little guidance is given by the ASTM standard on test configurations such as medial-lateral (M:L) loading distribution, flexion angle or restriction of secondary motions. Using a purpose built rig for a materials testing machine, four TKRs currently in widespread clinical use, including medial-pivot and symmetrical condyle types, were tested for anterior-posterior translational constraint. Compressive joint loads from 710 to 2000 N, and a range of medial-lateral (M:L) load distributions, from 70:30% to 30:70% M:L, were applied at different flexion angles with secondary motions unconstrained. It was found that TKA constraint was significantly less at 60 and 90 degrees flexion than at 0 degrees, whilst increasing the compressive joint load increased the force required to translate the tibia to limits of AP constraint at all flexion angles tested. Additionally when M:L load distribution was shifted medially, a coupled internal rotation was observed with anterior translation and external rotation with posterior translation. This paper includes some recommendations for future development of pre-clinical testing methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Proteolysis dependent cell cycle regulation in Caulobacter crescentus
SO CELL DIVISION
AB Caulobacter crescentus, a Gram-negative alpha-proteobacterium, has surfaced as a powerful model system for unraveling molecular networks that control the bacterial cell cycle. A straightforward synchronization protocol and existence of many well-defined developmental markers has allowed the identification of various molecular circuits that control the underlying differentiation processes executed at the level of transcription, translation, protein localization and dynamic proteolysis. The oligomeric AAA+ protease ClpXP is a well-characterized example of an enzyme that exerts post-translational control over a number of pathways. Also, the proteolytic pathways of its candidate proteins are reported to play significant roles in regulating cell cycle and protein quality control. A detailed evaluation of the impact of its proteolysis on various regulatory networks of the cell has uncovered various significant cellular roles of this protease in C. crescentus. A deeper insight into the effects of regulatory proteolysis with emphasis on cell cycle progression could shed light on how cells respond to environmental cues and implement developmental switches. Perturbation of this network of molecular machines is also associated with diseases such as bacterial infections. Thus, research holds immense implications in clinical translation and health, representing a promising area for clinical advances in the diagnosis, therapeutics and prognosis.

CY AUG 23-28, 2015
CL New York, NY
SP Brookhaven Natl Lab, Collider Accelerator Dept
AB Open source hardware has the potential to revolutionise the way we build scientific instruments; with the advent of readily available 3D printers, mechanical designs can now be shared, improved, and replicated faster and more easily than ever before. However, printed parts are typically plastic and often perform poorly compared to traditionally machined mechanisms. We have overcome many of the limitations of 3D printed mechanisms by exploiting the compliance of the plastic to produce a monolithic 3D printed flexure translation stage, capable of sub-micron-scale motion over a range of 8 x 8 x 4 mm. This requires minimal post-print clean-up and can be automated with readily available stepper motors. The resulting plastic composite structure is very stiff and exhibits remarkably low drift, moving less than 20 mu m over the course of a week, without temperature stabilisation. This enables us to construct a miniature microscope with excellent mechanical stability, perfect for time-lapse measurements in situ in an incubator or fume hood. The ease of manufacture lends itself to use in containment facilities where disposability is advantageous and to experiments requiring many microscopes in parallel. High performance mechanisms based on printed flexures need not be limited to microscopy, and we anticipate their use in other devices both within the laboratory and beyond. (C) 2016 Author(s).

TI Component calibration and configuration planning in assembly automation
   with a parallel manipulator
SO ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING
AB Parallel manipulator (PM) is widely used as posture alignment mechanism in heavy component machining and assembly process. To achieve precise kinematics backward transformation, the relative spatial relationship between the component and PM's spherical joints need be calibrated, which suffers from the pain-point that the spherical joint center is inside the mechanical socket and its position can hardly be directly recovered. We refer this problem as component calibration. In this research, we present an alternate solution by formulating kinematic chain in form of AX = XB based on designedly established PM reference configuration and base coordinate system, which does not rely on the measurement of spherical joint center position. To improve the calibration accuracy, accuracy-influencing factors, PM's dexterity distribution over workspace and properties of angle-axis space are jointly analyzed then 4 centrosymmetric angle-axis vector pairs on the boundary of maximum feasible angle-axis space at zero manipulator translation are set as configuration pairs to establish the kinematic chain. Configuration planning in angle-axis space facilitates the visualization and control of the critical factors in calibration process and tends to set these factors to optimum simultaneously. Experiments are carried out finally and the results show that the calibration accuracy could be notably improved with such method compared with no configuration planning, especially for translation accuracy.

TI Conserved non-AUG uORFs revealed by a novel regression analysis of
   ribosome profiling data
SO GENOME RESEARCH
AB Upstream open reading frames (uORFs), located in transcript leaders (5' UTRs), are potent cis-acting regulators of translation and mRNA turnover. Recent genome-wide ribosome profiling studies suggest that thousands of uORFs initiate with non-AUG start codons. Although intriguing, these non-AUG uORF predictions have been made without statistical control or validation; thus, the importance of these elements remains to be demonstrated. To address this, we took a comparative genomics approach to study AUG and non-AUG uORFs. We mapped transcription leaders in multiple Saccharomyces yeast species and applied a novel machine learning algorithm (uORF-seqr) to ribosome profiling data to identify statistically significant uORFs. We found that AUG and non-AUG uORFs are both frequently found in Saccharomyces yeasts. Although most non-AUG uORFs are found in only one species, hundreds have either conserved sequence or position within Saccharomyces. uORFs initiating with UUG are particularly common and are shared between species at rates similar to that of AUG uORFs. However, non-AUG uORFs are translated less efficiently than AUG-uORFs and are less subject to removal via alternative transcription initiation under normal growth conditions. These results suggest that a subset of non-AUG uORFs may play important roles in regulating gene expression.

AB This paper is an extension of the discussion pertaining the need for, and the benefits of the capability to translate a mathematical expression into a description of a relevant physical event, respectively of a physical situation [1]. It shows, how such a translation has made it possible to recognize the shortcomings of the deeply-rooted conception[2], that the outlet angle of the impeller blades is the most significant design parameter of a rotodynamic pump. The awareness of these shortcomings, in turn, has led already to the development of a more reliable approach for calculating the heads generated by a rotodynamic impeller[3], (Compare Fig.2.). It has also made possible to solve to a number of additional problems which, in the past, could be solved only by the costly and time-consuming method of trial and error [6].
   This paper also discusses the physical meaning of the Navier-Stokes equations. It shows how the translation of these equations into their physical meaning made it possible to explain several seemingly enigmatic results of tests. In addition to the above, this paper also discusses a number of problems which need yet to be explored in the future, in order to be able to turn CFD into a useful tool for the design of rotodynamic pumps.

AB The increasing amount of hyperlinked human knowledge available on the Web has shifted the research focus to the search engines that will deliver the needed information quickly. This demand has triggered a revisitation of the long-standing issue of semantics, which was never addressed adequately by information theory or linguistic theory. Fuzzy set and fuzzy logic, on the other hand, provide a powerful mathematical tool in modeling "semantics."
   The organization and the manipulation of information, knowledge base construction and discovery, information retrieval and logical inferencing all deal with semantics in a fundamental way. Unless we experience a breakthrough in understanding semantics, especially related to machine automation, it will be difficult to make a quantum jump in accessing, creating, and modifying information.
   This paper intends to bring to center stage the complex problems of semantics confronted while dealing with natural language. We will demonstrate the ability of the fuzzy set and fuzzy logic to serve as a mathematical vehicle to model semantics in a significantly improved way. This will include taking a closer look at the PNL, Precisiated Natural Language, proposed by Lotfi A. Zadeh.
   It is well established that the multiple meaning of a single word and the ambiguity of words cause the most difficulty as we attempt to automate word processing and translation. There also are many other less well known difficulties. A closer examination reveals that words often become confusing when they have similar forms and sounds. An incorrect word choice can alter the meaning of a sentence, hence making language even more complicated. Not only can a single word have numerous definitions and subtle meanings, but it may also take on added meanings through implications. The concept of "connotation" is the idea suggested by its place near or in association with other words or phrases.
   Idiomatic language expressions often cannot be translated word for word creating an obstacle for machine automation and translation. Two- and three-word verbs, which are indispensable in the English language, illustrate further obstacles. These examples offer but a bird's eye view of the host of difficulties associated with machine automation and translation of natural language.
   In this paper, we will demonstrate that the fuzzy set and logic theory can serve as a mathematical modeling tool that is useful, effective and optimal in solving some of the obstacles mentioned above.
   A survey of recent publications reveals an increasing involvement and growing interest in the semantics aspect of natural language. I. Kobayashi, M. Chang & M. Sugeno have worked on the meaning processing of dialogue. Guoqing Chen deals with semantics in fuzzy association rules. P. Subasic & A. Huettner have investigated the problem of fuzzy semantic typing. Jonathan Lawry has studied the issue of semantic modeling. Fred Petry & Patrick Perrin handle knowledge discovery in texts of which semantics of the words play important role. Finally, Paul P. Wang & A Xia use words as 'features' in an information retrieval system for movie selections.
   Ultimately, the electrophysiological pathways in human brains and brain regions dealing with the semantics of language must be studied. It is not surprising that the gene expression patterns of different brain regions hold the key to semantics, which in turn are crucial to understanding and processing language.
   In a language that is constantly changing there is always some conflict between current usage and established practice. Commas and other punctuation, prepositions, etc., all contribute to the difficulties and ambiguities associated with machine automation and processing of the so-called "common faults" in semantics interpretations. These difficulties can be eliminated if and only if there is effective mathematical modeling of the brain from anatomical, electrophysiological and genomic standpoints.

TI Stepwise approach for combining many sources of evidence for
   site-recognition in genomic sequences
SO BMC BIOINFORMATICS
AB Background: Recognizing the different functional parts of genes, such as promoters, translation initiation sites, donors, acceptors and stop codons, is a fundamental task of many current studies in Bioinformatics. Currently, the most successful methods use powerful classifiers, such as support vector machines with various string kernels. However, with the rapid evolution of our ability to collect genomic information, it has been shown that combining many sources of evidence is fundamental to the success of any recognition task. With the advent of next-generation sequencing, the number of available genomes is increasing very rapidly. Thus, methods for making use of such large amounts of information are needed.
   Results: In this paper, we present a methodology for combining tens or even hundreds of different classifiers for an improved performance. Our approach can include almost a limitless number of sources of evidence. We can use the evidence for the prediction of sites in a certain species, such as human, or other species as needed. This approach can be used for any of the functional recognition tasks cited above. However, to provide the necessary focus, we have tested our approach in two functional recognition tasks: translation initiation site and stop codon recognition. We have used the entire human genome as a target and another 20 species as sources of evidence and tested our method on five different human chromosomes. The proposed method achieves better accuracy than the best state-of-the-art method both in terms of the geometric mean of the specificity and sensitivity and the area under the receiver operating characteristic and precision recall curves. Furthermore, our approach shows a more principled way for selecting the best genomes to be combined for a given recognition task.
   Conclusions: Our approach has proven to be a powerful tool for improving the performance of functional site recognition, and it is a useful method for combining many sources of evidence for any recognition task in Bioinformatics. The results also show that the common approach of heuristically choosing the species to be used as source of evidence can be improved because the best combinations of genomes for recognition were those not usually selected. Although the experiments were performed for translation initiation site and stop codon recognition, any other recognition task may benefit from our methodology.

TI Real-time embedded implementation of robust speed-limit sign recognition
   using a novel centroid-to-contour description method
SO IET COMPUTER VISION
AB Traffic sign recognition is a very important function in automatic driving assistance systems (ADAS). This study addresses the design and implementation of a vision-based ADAS based on an image-based speed-limit sign (SLS) recognition algorithm, which can automatically detect and recognise SLS on the road in real-time. To improve the recognition rate of SLS having different orientations and scales in the image, this study also presents a new sign content description algorithm, which describes the detected road sign using centroid-to-contour (CtC) distances of the extracted sign content. The proposed CtC descriptor is robust to translation, rotation and scale changes of the SLS in the image. This advantage improves the recognition accuracy of a support vector machine classifier trained using a large database of traffic signs. The proposed SLS recognition method had been implemented on two different embedded platforms, each of them equipped with an ARM-based Quad-Core CPU running Android 4.4 operating system. Experimental results validate that the proposed method not only provides a high recognition rate, but also achieves real-time performance up to 30 frames per second for processing 1280x720 video streams running on a commercial ARM-based smartphone.

TI Computational Sensing Using Low-Cost and Mobile Plasmonic Readers
   Designed by Machine Learning
SO ACS NANO
AB Plasmonic sensors have been used for a wide range of biological and chemical sensing applications. Emerging nanofabrication techniques have enabled these sensors to be cost-effectively mass manufactured onto various types of substrates. To accompany these advances, major improvements in sensor read-out devices must also be achieved to fully realize the broad impact of plasmonic nanosensors. Here, we propose a machine learning framework which can be used to design low-cost and mobile multispectral plasmonic readers that do not use traditionally employed bulky and expensive stabilized light sources or high-resolution spectrometers. By training a feature selection model over a large set of fabricated plasmonic nanosensors, we select the optimal set of illumination light-emitting diodes needed to create a minimum-error refractive index prediction model, which statistically takes into account the varied spectral responses and fabrication-induced variability of a given sensor design. This computational sensing approach was experimentally validated using a modular mobile plasmonic reader. We tested different plasmonic sensors with hexagonal and square periodicity nanohole arrays and revealed that the optimal illumination bands differ from those that are "intuitively" selected based on the spectral features of the sensor, e.g., transmission peaks or valleys. This framework provides a universal tool for the plasmonics community to design low-cost and mobile multispectral readers, helping the translation of nanosensing technologies to various emerging applications such as wearable sensing, personalized medicine, and point-of-care diagnostics. Beyond plasmonics, other types of sensors that operate based on spectral changes can broadly benefit from this approach, including e.g., aptamer-enabled nanoparticle assays and graphene-based sensors, among others.

TI A Machine Learning Approach To Identify Hydrogenosomal Proteins in
   Trichomonas vaginalis
SO EUKARYOTIC CELL
AB The protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis is the causative agent of trichomoniasis, the most widespread nonviral sexually transmitted disease in humans. It possesses hydrogenosomes-anaerobic mitochondria that generate H-2, CO2, and acetate from pyruvate while converting ADP to ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation. T. vaginalis hydrogenosomes lack a genome and translation machinery; hence, they import all their proteins from the cytosol. To date, however, only 30 imported proteins have been shown to localize to the organelle. A total of 226 nuclear-encoded proteins inferred from the genome sequence harbor a characteristic short N-terminal presequence, reminiscent of mitochondrial targeting peptides, which is thought to mediate hydrogenosomal targeting. Recent studies suggest, however, that the presequences might be less important than previously thought. We sought to identify new hydrogenosomal proteins within the 59,672 annotated open reading frames (ORFs) of T. vaginalis, independent of the N-terminal targeting signal, using a machine learning approach. Our training set included 57 gene and protein features determined for all 30 known hydrogenosomal proteins and 576 nonhydrogenosomal proteins. Several classifiers were trained on this set to yield an import score for all proteins encoded by T. vaginalis ORFs, predicting the likelihood of hydrogenosomal localization. The machine learning results were tested through immunofluorescence assay and immunodetection in isolated cell fractions of 14 protein predictions using hemagglutinin constructs expressed under the homologous SCS alpha promoter in transiently transformed T. vaginalis cells. Localization of 6 of the 10 top predicted hydrogenosome-localized proteins was confirmed, and two of these were found to lack an obvious N-terminal targeting signal.

SO KYBERNETES
CT Workshop of IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics United Kingdom and Ireland
CY SEP, 2003
CL Reading, ENGLAND
SP IEEE Syst, Man & Cybernet, UK & Ireland Chapter
AB Purpose - Identifying the fundamental characteristics of meaning and deriving an automated meaning-analysis procedure for machine intelligence.
   Design/methodology/approach - Semantic category theory (SCT) is an original testable scientific theory, based on readily available data: not assumptions or axioms. SCT can therefore be refuted by irreconcilable data: not opinion.
   Findings - Human language involves four totally independent semantic categories (SC), each of which has its own distinctive form of "Truff'. Any sentence that assigns the characteristics of one SC to another SC involves what is termed here "Semantic Intertwine". Semantic intertwine often lies at the core of semantic ambiguity, sophistry and paradox: problems that have plagued human reason since antiquity.
   Research limitations/implications - SCT is applicable to any endeavour involving human language. Research applications are therefore somewhat extensive. For example, identifying metaphors posing as science, or natural language processing/translation, or solving disparate paradox types, as illustrated by worked examples from: The Liar Group, Sorites Inductive, Russell's Set Theoretic and Zeno's Paradoxes.
   Practical implications - To interact successfully with human language, behaviour, and belief systems, as well as their own environment, intelligent machines will need to resolve the semantic component/intertwines of any sentence. Semantic category analysis (SCA), derived from SCT, and also described here, can be used to analyse any sentence or argument, however complex.
   Originality/value - Both SCT and SCA are original. Whilst "category error" is an intuitive notion, the observably precise nature, number and modes of interaction of such categories have never previously been presented. With SCT/SCA the rigorous analysis of any argument, whether foisted, valid, or obfuscating, is now possible: by man or machine.

TI A Trust Scale for Human-Robot Interaction: Translation, Adaptation, and
   Validation of a Human Computer Trust Scale
SO HUMAN BEHAVIOR AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES
AB Recently there has been an increasing demand for technologies (automated and intelligent machines) that brings benefits to organizations and society. Similar to the widespread use of personal computers in the past, today's needs are towards facilitating human-machine technology appropriation, especially in highly risky and regulated industries like robotics, manufacturing, automation, military, finance, or healthcare. In this context, trust can be used as a critical element to instruct how human-machine interaction should occur. Considering the context-dependency and multidimensional trust, this study seeks to find a way to measure the effects of perceived trust in a collaborative robot (cobot), regardless of its literal credibility as a real person. This article aims at translating, adapting, and validating a Human-Computer Trust Scale (HCTM) in human-robot interaction (HRI) context and its application to cobots. The Human-Robot Interaction Trust Scale (HRITS) involved 239 participants and included eleven items. The 2nd order CFA with a general factor called "trust " have proven to be empirically robust (CFI=.94; TLI=.93; SRMR=.04; and RMSEA=.05) [CR=.84; AVE=.58, and MaxRH=.92]; results indicated a good measurement of the general factor trust, and the model satisfied the criteria for measure trust. An analysis of the differences in perceptions of trust by gender was conducted using a t-test. This analysis showed that statistical differences by gender exist (p=.04). This study's results allowed for a better understanding of trust in HRI, specifically regarding cobots. The validation of a Portuguese scale for trust assessment in HRI can give a valuable contribution to designing collaborative environments between humans and robots.

TI A computerized exposure system for animal models to optimize nicotine
   delivery into the brain through inhalation of electronic cigarette
   vapors or cigarette smoke
SO SAUDI PHARMACEUTICAL JOURNAL
AB Pre-clinical studies investigated the effects of chronic exposure to nicotine on lungs, kidneys and brains using animal models. Most of these studies delivered nicotine into the circulatory and central nervous systems (CNS) through intraperitoneal injection or oral consumption methods. Few studies used inhalation machine system for nicotine delivery into brains in rodents to mimic human exposure to cigarettes. However, finding a more accurate and clinically relevant method of nicotine delivery is critical. A computerized inhalation machine has been designed (SciReq) and is currently employed in several institutions. The computerized machine delivers electronic (e)-cigarette vapor as well as tobacco smoke to rodents using marketed e-cigarette devices or tobacco cigarettes. This provides evidence about clinical effects of nicotine delivery by traditional methods (combustible cigarettes) and new methodologies (e-cigarettes) in physiological systems. Potential neurobiological mechanisms for the development of nicotine dependence have been determined recently in mice exposed to e-cigarette vapors in our laboratory using SciReq system. In this review article, the discussion focuses on the efficiency and practical applicability of using this computerized inhalation exposure system in inducing significant changes in brain protein expression and function as compared to other nicotine delivery methods. The SciReq inhalation system utilized in our laboratory and others is a method of nicotine delivery to the CNS, which has physiological relevance and mimics human inhalant exposures. Translation of the effects of inhaled nicotine on the CNS into clinical settings could provide important health considerations. (C) 2018 The Authors.

TI Identifying protein arginine methylation sites using global features of
   protein sequence coupled with support vector machine optimized by
   particle swarm optimization algorithm
SO CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS
AB Protein methylation, which plays vital roles in signal transduction and many cellular processes, is one of the most common protein post-translation modifications. Identification of methylation sites is very helpful for understanding the fundamental molecular mechanism of the methylation related biological processes. In silico predictions of methylation sites have emerged to be a powerful approach for methylation identifying. They also facilitate the performance of downstream characterizations and site-specific investigations. Herein, we proposed a novel strategy for the prediction of methylation sites based on a combination of the pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) and protein chain description as global features of protein sequence. The global features of protein sequence comprehensively utilize amino acid composition information and sequence-order information, along with the physicochemical properties and structural characteristics of amino acid information. Support vector machine (SVM) is invoked to build the prediction model for methylation sites on the basis of the global features of protein sequence. Meanwhile, a global stochastic optimization technique, particle swarm algorithm (PSO) is employed for effectively searching the optimal parameters in SVM. The prediction accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and Matthew's correlation coefficient values of the independent prediction set are 98.11%, 96.23%, 100% and 96.30%, respectively. It obviously indicates that our method has sufficient prediction effect in identification of the protein arginine methylation sites. As a comparison, other predictors are also constructed based on different feature extracting and modeling strategies. The results show that the proposed method can greatly improve the performance of arginine methylation sites prediction. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Sensor-Based Activity Recognition and Performance Assessment in
   Climbing: A Review
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In the past decades, a number of technological developments made it possible to continuously collect various types of sport activity data in an unobtrusive way. Machine learning and analytical methods have been applied to flows of sensor data to predict the conducted sport activity as well as to calculate key performance indicators. In that scenario, researchers started to be interested in leveraging pervasive information technologies for sport climbing, thus allowing, in day-to-day climbing practice, the realization of systems for automatic assessment of a climber's performance, detection of injury risk factors, and virtual coaching. This article surveys recent research works on the recognition of climbing activities and the evaluation of climbing performance indicators, where data have been acquired with accelerometers, cameras, force sensors, and other types of sensors. We describe the main types of sensors and equipment adopted for data acquisition, the techniques used to extract relevant features from sensor data, and the methods that have been proposed to identify the activities performed by a climber and to calculate key performance indicators. We also present a classification taxonomy of climbing activities and of climbing performance indicators, with the aim to unify the existing work and facilitate the comparison of methods. Moreover, open problems that call for new approaches and solutions are here discussed. We conclude that there is considerable scope for further work, particularly in the application of recognition techniques to problems involving various climbing activities. We hope that this survey will assist in the translation of research effort into intelligent environments that climbers will benefit from.

TI Extended home use of an advanced osseointegrated prosthetic arm improves
   function, performance, and control efficiency
SO JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING
AB Objective. Full restoration of arm function using a prosthesis remains a grand challenge; however, advances in robotic hardware, surgical interventions, and machine learning are bringing seamless human-machine interfacing closer to reality. Approach. Through extensive data logging over 1 year, we monitored at-home use of the dexterous Modular Prosthetic Limb controlled through pattern recognition of electromyography (EMG) by an individual with a transhumeral amputation, targeted muscle reinnervation, and osseointegration (OI). Main results. Throughout the study, continuous prosthesis usage increased (1% per week, p < 0.001) and functional metrics improved up to 26% on control assessments and 76% on perceived workload evaluations. We observed increases in torque loading on the OI implant (up to 12.5% every month, p < 0.001) and prosthesis control performance (0.5% every month, p < 0.005), indicating enhanced user integration, acceptance, and proficiency. More importantly, the EMG signal magnitude necessary for prosthesis control decreased, up to 34.7% (p < 0.001), over time without degrading performance, demonstrating improved control efficiency with a machine learning-based myoelectric pattern recognition algorithm. The participant controlled the prosthesis up to one month without updating the pattern recognition algorithm. The participant customized prosthesis movements to perform specific tasks, such as individual finger control for piano playing and hand gestures for communication, which likely contributed to continued usage. Significance. This work demonstrates, in a single participant, the functional benefit of unconstrained use of a highly anthropomorphic prosthetic limb over an extended period. While hurdles remain for widespread use, including device reliability, results replication, and technical maturity beyond a prototype, this study offers insight as an example of the impact of advanced prosthesis technology for rehabilitation outside the laboratory.

SO JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
AB Background: Despite efforts to improve targeting accuracy of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as a repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) target for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), the heterogeneity in clinical response remains unexplained.Objective: We sought to compare the patterns of functional connectivity from the DLPFC treatment site in patients with MDD who were TMS responders to those who were TMS non-responders.Methods: Baseline anatomical T1 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), resting-state functional MRI, and diffusion weighted imaging scans were obtained from 37 participants before they underwent a course of rTMS to left Brodmann area 46. A novel machine learning method was utilized to identify brain regions associated with each item of the Beck's Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), and for 26 participants who underwent rTMS treatment over the left Brodmann area 46, identify regions differentiating rTMS responders and non-responders.Results: Nine parcels of the Human Connectome Project Multimodal Parcellation Atlas matched to at least three items of the Beck's Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) as predictors of response to rTMS, with many in the temporal, parietal and cingulate cortices. Additionally, pre-treatment mapping for 17 items of the BDI-II demonstrated significant variability in symptom to parcel mapping. When parcels associated with symptom presence and symptom resolution were compared, 15 parcels were uniquely associated with resolution (potential targets), and 12 parcels were associated with both symptom presence and resolution (blockers or biomarkers).Conclusions: Machine learning approaches show promise for the development of pathoanatomical diagnosis and treatment algorithms for MDD. Prospective studies are required to facilitate clinical translation.

TI Efficient link prediction in the protein-protein interaction network
   using topological information in a generative adversarial network
   machine learning model
SO BMC BIOINFORMATICS
AB Background: The investigation of possible interactions between two proteins in intracellular signaling is an expensive and laborious procedure in the wet-lab, therefore, several in silico approaches have been implemented to narrow down the candidates for future experimental validations. Reformulating the problem in the field of network theory, the set of proteins can be represented as the nodes of a network, while the interactions between them as the edges. The resulting protein-protein interaction (PPI) network enables the use of link prediction techniques in order to discover new probable connections. Therefore, here we aimed to offer a novel approach to the link prediction task in PPI networks, utilizing a generative machine learning model.
   Results: We created a tool that consists of two modules, the data processing framework and the machine learning model. As data processing, we used a modified breadth-first search algorithm to traverse the network and extract induced subgraphs, which served as image-like input data for our model. As machine learning, an image-to-image translation inspired conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) model utilizing Wasserstein distance-based loss improved with gradient penalty was used, taking the combined representation from the data processing as input, and training the generator to predict the probable unknown edges in the provided induced subgraphs. Our link prediction tool was evaluated on the protein-protein interaction networks of five different species from the STRING database by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic, the precision-recall curves and the normalized discounted cumulative gain (AUROC, AUPRC, NDCG, respectively). Test runs yielded the averaged results of AUROC = 0.915, AUPRC = 0.176 and NDCG = 0.763 on all investigated species.
   Conclusion: We developed a software for the purpose of link prediction in PPI networks utilizing machine learning. The evaluation of our software serves as the first demonstration that a cGAN model, conditioned on raw topological features of the PPI network, is an applicable solution for the PPI prediction problem without requiring often unavailable molecular node attributes. The corresponding scripts are available at https://github.com/semmelweis-pharmacology/ppi_pred.

TI Prediction of plant pre-microRNAs and their microRNAs in genome-scale
   sequences using structure-sequence features and support vector machine
SO BMC BIOINFORMATICS
AB Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of non-coding RNAs approximately 21 nucleotides in length that play pivotal roles at the post-transcriptional level in animals, plants and viruses. These molecules silence their target genes by degrading transcription or suppressing translation. Studies have shown that miRNAs are involved in biological responses to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses. Identification of these molecules and their targets can aid the understanding of regulatory processes. Recently, prediction methods based on machine learning have been widely used for miRNA prediction. However, most of these methods were designed for mammalian miRNA prediction, and few are available for predicting miRNAs in the pre-miRNAs of specific plant species. Although the complete Solanum lycopersicum genome has been published, only 77 Solanum lycopersicum miRNAs have been identified, far less than the estimated number. Therefore, it is essential to develop a prediction method based on machine learning to identify new plant miRNAs.
   Results: A novel classification model based on a support vector machine (SVM) was trained to identify real and pseudo plant pre-miRNAs together with their miRNAs. An initial set of 152 novel features related to sequential structures was used to train the model. By applying feature selection, we obtained the best subset of 47 features for use with the Back Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (B-SVM-RFE) method for the classification of plant pre-miRNAs. Using this method, 63 features were obtained for plant miRNA classification. We then developed an integrated classification model, miPlantPreMat, which comprises MiPlantPre and MiPlantMat, to identify plant pre-miRNAs and their miRNAs. This model achieved approximately 90% accuracy using plant datasets from nine plant species, including Arabidopsis thaliana, Glycine max, Oryza sativa, Physcomitrella patens, Medicago truncatula, Sorghum bicolor, Arabidopsis lyrata, Zea mays and Solanum lycopersicum. Using miPlantPreMat, 522 Solanum lycopersicum miRNAs were identified in the Solanum lycopersicum genome sequence.
   Conclusions: We developed an integrated classification model, miPlantPreMat, based on structure-sequence features and SVM. MiPlantPreMat was used to identify both plant pre-miRNAs and the corresponding mature miRNAs. An improved feature selection method was proposed, resulting in high classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.

TI Stochastic thermodynamics and modes of operation of a ribosome: A
   network theoretic perspective
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB The ribosome is one of the largest and most complex macromolecular machines in living cells. It polymerizes a protein in a step-by-step manner as directed by the corresponding nucleotide sequence on the template messenger RNA (mRNA) and this process is referred to as "translation" of the genetic message encoded in the sequence of mRNA transcript. In each successful chemomechanical cycle during the (protein) elongation stage, the ribosome elongates the protein by a single subunit, called amino acid, and steps forward on the template mRNA by three nucleotides called a codon. Therefore, a ribosome is also regarded as a molecular motor for which the mRNA serves as the track, its step size is that of a codon and two molecules of GTP and one molecule of ATP hydrolyzed in that cycle serve as its fuel. What adds further complexity is the existence of competing pathways leading to distinct cycles, branched pathways in each cycle, and futile consumption of fuel that leads neither to elongation of the nascent protein nor forward stepping of the ribosome on its track. We investigate a model formulated in terms of the network of discrete chemomechanical states of a ribosome during the elongation stage of translation. The model is analyzed using a combination of stochastic thermodynamic and kinetic analysis based on a graph-theoretic approach. We derive the exact solution of the corresponding master equations. We represent the steady state in terms of the cycles of the underlying network and discuss the energy transduction processes. We identify the various possible modes of operation of a ribosome in terms of its average velocity and mean rate of GTP hydrolysis. We also compute entropy production as functions of the rates of the interstate transitions and the thermodynamic cost for accuracy of the translation process.

TI One- and two-incision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A
   biomechanical comparison including the effect of simulated closed-chain
   exercise
SO ARTHROSCOPY
AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of simulated closed-chain exercise on anterior translation in the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructed knee comparing patellar tendon grafts secured with endoscopic and two-incision techniques, ACL reconstructions, were performed on five matched pairs of fresh frozen cadaver lower extremities. One of each pair had endoscopic (inside-out) placement of the femoral interference screw and other had outside-in femoral screw placement, A model for closed-chain exercise was developed to simulate half squat exercises using a custom apparatus on the Material Testing machine with a 356 N (80 Ib) axial load and 40 N (9 Ib) static hamstring force. Knee motion from near full extension to 60 degrees flexion was acheived by varying the quadricep force. One thousand squats were performed, and KT-1000 arthometry was done before and after cycling each specimen. The femur-graft-tibia constructs were then stressed to failure. Closed-chain cycling resulted in no significant change in anterior translation in either group, The mean maximum load to failure of the femur-graft-tibia construct was 340.4N in the one-incision group and 434.2 N in the two-incision group. P =.048 was considered statistically significant. Anterior translation did not increase after 1,000 simulated half knee bends in either the one-or two-incision groups, Shallow knee bends are an important part of aggressive rehabilitation programs, and our data support the position that these closed-chain exercises do not deleteriously affect the graft. Though the maximum strength to failure differed significantly between the one-and two-incision groups, both techniques offered sufficient strength to withstand an aggressive simulated rehabilitation protocol.

SP IEEE
AB Words and phrases acquire meaning from the way they are used in society, from their relative semantics to other words and phrases. For computers, the equivalent of "society" is "database," and the equivalent of " use" is "a way to search the database." We present a new theory of similarity between words and phrases based on information distance and Kolmogorov complexity. To fix thoughts, we use the World Wide Web (WWW) as the database, and Google as the search engine. The method is also applicable to other search engines and databases. This theory is then applied to construct a method to automatically extract similarity, the Google similarity distance, of words and phrases from the WWW using Google page counts. The WWW is the largest database on earth, and the context information entered by millions of independent users averages out to provide automatic semantics of useful quality. We give applications in hierarchical clustering, classification, and language translation. We give examples to distinguish between colors and numbers, cluster names of paintings by 17th century Dutch masters and names of books by English novelists, the ability to understand emergencies and primes, and we demonstrate the ability to do a simple automatic English-Spanish translation. Finally, we use the WordNet database as an objective baseline against which to judge the performance of our method. We conduct a massive randomized trial in binary classification using support vector machines to learn categories based on our Google distance, resulting in an a mean agreement of 87 percent with the expert crafted WordNet categories.

TI From 2D projections to the 3D rotation matrix: an attempt for finding a
   machine learning approach for the efficient evaluation of mechanical
   joining elements in X-ray computed tomography volume data
SO SN APPLIED SCIENCES
AB Destructive and predominantly manual procedures are commonly used in the automotive industry for the testing of mechanical joints, such as rivets or screws. Combining X-ray computed tomography (CT) and machine learning (ML) bears the potential of a non-destructive and largely automated methodology. Assuming the desired result is a comprehensible and documentable evaluation, three basic steps need to be automatized: First, a joint must be detected and identified as such in a CT scan of the joined parts. Second, the detected region containing the joint is rotated to a predefined orientation. Third, key measures in cross-sections from the newly oriented joint are dimensioned and documented. This work deals only with the second step, the rotation. On the one hand, we present a methodology for creating a well-curated data set for the contextual machine learning application. On the other, we evaluate its performance on the well-known ResNet50. More concretely, we investigate if it is possible for a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the respective rotation matrix from three volume projections that are perpendicular to each other. Two scenarios are investigated: In one scenario we assume that future data that is presented to the network has similar rivet demographics to historic data. We therefore do not employ hold-out sets for the network evaluation. In the other scenario we assume the opposite and therefore evaluating the networks performance with hold-out sets. We show that from a machine learning point of view, a CNN like ResNet50 is well able to learn this relationship with acceptable accuracy. In most cases the validation loss dropped below 0.1 after only a couple of epochs. In one particular case, we even reached both mean and median errors lower than 0.2 for approximately 80% of the entire test set of 1600 examples using our methodology. From an application point of view, however, these low test set errors should be treated with caution since small deviations from the intended rotation matrix can cause volume warping and translation. In another case, in which we used a hold-out set, only a fraction of the median errors were below 0.2.

TI AI applications to medical images: From machine learning to deep
   learning
SO PHYSICA MEDICA-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PHYSICS
AB Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) models are playing an increasing role in biomedical research and healthcare services. This review focuses on challenges points to be clarified about how to develop AI applications as clinical decision support systems in the real-world context.
   Methods: A narrative review has been performed including a critical assessment of articles published between 1989 and 2021 that guided challenging sections.
   Results: We first illustrate the architectural characteristics of machine learning (ML)/radiomics and deep learning (DL) approaches. For ML/radiomics, the phases of feature selection and of training, validation, and testing are described. DL models are presented as multi-layered artificial/convolutional neural networks, allowing us to directly process images. The data curation section includes technical steps such as image labelling, image annotation (with segmentation as a crucial step in radiomics), data harmonization (enabling compensation for differences in imaging protocols that typically generate noise in non-AI imaging studies) and federated learning. Thereafter, we dedicate specific sections to: sample size calculation, considering multiple testing in AI approaches; procedures for data augmentation to work with limited and unbalanced datasets; and the interpretability of AI models (the so-called black box issue). Pros and cons for choosing ML versus DL to implement AI applications to medical imaging are finally presented in a synoptic way.
   Conclusions: Biomedicine and healthcare systems are one of the most important fields for AI applications and medical imaging is probably the most suitable and promising domain. Clarification of specific challenging points facilitates the development of such systems and their translation to clinical practice.

TI Identification of biological mechanisms underlying a multidimensional
   ASD phenotype using machine learning
SO TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY
AB The complex genetic architecture of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and its heterogeneous phenotype makes molecular diagnosis and patient prognosis challenging tasks. To establish more precise genotype-phenotype correlations in ASD, we developed a novel machine-learning integrative approach, which seeks to delineate associations between patients' clinical profiles and disrupted biological processes, inferred from their copy number variants (CNVs) that span brain genes. Clustering analysis of the relevant clinical measures from 2446 ASD cases in the Autism Genome Project identified two distinct phenotypic subgroups. Patients in these clusters differed significantly in ADOS-defined severity, adaptive behavior profiles, intellectual ability, and verbal status, the latter contributing the most for cluster stability and cohesion. Functional enrichment analysis of brain genes disrupted by CNVs in these ASD cases identified 15 statistically significant biological processes, including cell adhesion, neural development, cognition, and polyubiquitination, in line with previous ASD findings. A Naive Bayes classifier, generated to predict the ASD phenotypic clusters from disrupted biological processes, achieved predictions with a high precision (0.82) but low recall (0.39), for a subset of patients with higher biological Information Content scores. This study shows that milder and more severe clinical presentations can have distinct underlying biological mechanisms. It further highlights how machine-learning approaches can reduce clinical heterogeneity by using multidimensional clinical measures, and establishes genotype-phenotype correlations in ASD. However, predictions are strongly dependent on patient's information content. Findings are therefore a first step toward the translation of genetic information into clinically useful applications, and emphasize the need for larger datasets with very complete clinical and biological information.

TI Linking Essential Tremor to the Cerebellum-Neuroimaging Evidence
SO CEREBELLUM
AB Essential tremor (ET) is the most common pathological tremor disorder in the world, and post-mortem evidence has shown that the cerebellum is the most consistent area of pathology in ET. In the last few years, advanced neuroimaging has tried to confirm this evidence. The aim of the present review is to discuss to what extent the evidence provided by this field of study may be generalised. We performed a systematic literature search combining the terms ET with the following keywords: MRI, VBM, MRS, DTI, fMRI, PET and SPECT. We summarised and discussed each study and placed the results in the context of existing knowledge regarding the cerebellar involvement in ET. A total of 51 neuroimaging studies met our search criteria, roughly divided into 19 structural and 32 functional studies. Despite clinical and methodological differences, both functional and structural imaging studies showed similar findings but without defining a clear topography of neurodegeneration. Indeed, the vast majority of studies found functional and structural abnormalities in several parts of the anterior and posterior cerebellar lobules, but it remains to be established to what degree these neural changes contribute to clinical symptoms of ET. Currently, advanced neuroimaging has confirmed the involvement of the cerebellum in pathophysiological processes of ET, although a high variability in results persists. For this reason, the translation of this knowledge into daily clinical practice is again partially limited, although new advanced multivariate neuroimaging approaches (machine-learning) are proving interesting changes of perspective.

TI 2-D ultrasound strain images for breast cancer diagnosis using nonrigid
   subregion registration
SO ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
AB Tissue elasticity of a lesion is a useful criterion for the diagnosis of breast ultrasound (US). Elastograms are created by comparing ultrasonic radio-frequency waveforms before and after a light-tissue compression. In this study, we evaluate the accuracy of continuous US strain image in the classification of benign from malignant breast tumors. A series of B-mode US images is applied and each case involves 60 continuous images obtained by using the steady artificial pressure of the US probe. In general, after compression by the US probe, a soft benign tumor will become flatter than a stiffened malignant tumor. We proposed a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) system by utilizing the nonrigid image registration modality on the analysis of tumor deformation. Furthermore, we used some image preprocessing methods, which included the level set segmentation, to improve the performance. One-hundred pathology-proven cases, including 60 benign breast tumors and 40 malignant tumors, were used in the experiments to test the classification accuracy of the proposed method. Four characteristic values-normalized slope of metric value (NSM), normalized area difference (NAD), normalized standard deviation (NSD) and normalized center translation (NCT)-were computed for all cases. By using the support vector machine, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of the classification of continuous US strain images were satisfactory. The A,, value of the support vector machine based on the four characteristic values used for the classification of solid breast tumors was 0.9358.

   Methods Surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals of articulatory muscles were recorded from the face and neck of a patient with total laryngectomy who was articulating words silently. These sEMG signals were then used for automatic speech recognition via machine learning. Sensor placement was tailored to the patient's unique anatomy, following radiation and surgery. A personalized wearable mask covering the sensors was designed using 3D scanning and 3D printing.
   Results Using seven sEMG sensors on the patient's face and neck and two grounding electrodes, we recorded EMG data while he was mouthing "Tedd" and "Ed." With data from 75 utterances for each of these words, we discriminated the sEMG signal with 86.4% accuracy using an XGBoost machine-learning model.
   Conclusions This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of sEMG-based alaryngeal speech recognition, using tailored sensor placement and a personalized wearable device. Further refinement of this approach could allow translation of silently articulated speech into a synthesized voiced speech via portable devices.

TI Deep Learning Image Captioning in Construction Management: A Feasibility
   Study
SO JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT
AB Deep learning image captioning methods are able to generate one or several natural sentences to describe the contents of construction images. By deconstructing these sentences, the construction object and activity information can be retrieved integrally for automated scene analysis. However, the feasibility of deep learning image captioning in construction remains unclear. To fill this gap, this research investigates the feasibility of deep learning image captioning methods in construction management. First, a linguistic schema for annotating construction machine images was established, and a captioning data set was developed. Then, six deep learning image captioning methods from the computer vision community were selected and tested on the construction captioning data set. In the sentence-level evaluation, the transformer-self-critical sequence training (Tsfm-SCST) method has obtained the best performance among six methods with the bilingual evaluation (BLEU)-1 score of 0.606, BLEU-2 of 0.506, BLEU-3 of 0.427, BLEU-4 of 0.349, metric for evaluation of translation with explicit ordering (METEOR) of 0.287, recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation (ROUGE) of 0.585, consensus-based image description evaluation (CIDEr) of 1.715, and semantic propositional image caption evaluation (SPICE) score of 0.422. In the element-level evaluation, the Tsfm-SCST method achieved an average precision of 91.1%, recall of 83.3%, and an F1 score of 86.6% for recognition of construction machine objects by deconstructing the generated sentences. This research indicates that deep learning image captioning is feasible as a method of generating accurate and precise text descriptions from construction images, with potential applications in construction scene analysis and image documentation.

TI Emotion recognition from facial expressions using hybrid feature
   descriptors
SO IET IMAGE PROCESSING
AB Here, a hybrid feature descriptor-based method is proposed to recognise human emotions from their facial expressions. A combination of spatial bag of features (SBoFs) with spatial scale-invariant feature transform (SBoF-SSIFT), and SBoFs with spatial speeded up robust transform are utilised to improve the ability to recognise facial expressions. For classification of emotions, K-nearest neighbour and support vector machines (SVMs) with linear, polynomial, and radial basis function kernels are applied. SBoFs descriptor generates a fixed length feature vector for all sample images irrespective of their size. Spatial SIFT and SURF features are independent of scaling, rotation, translation, projective transforms, and partly to illumination changes. A modified form of bag of features (BoFs) is employed by involving feature's spatial information for facial emotion recognition. The proposed method differs from conventional methods that are used for simple object categorisation without using spatial information. Experiments have been performed on extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) and Japanese female facial expression (JAFFE) data sets. SBoF-SSIFT with SVM resulted in a recognition accuracy of 98.5% on CK+ and 98.3% on JAFFE data set. Images are resized through selective pre-processing, thereby retaining only the information of interest and reducing computation time.

TI Artificial Intelligence in Cornea, Refractive Surgery, and Cataract:
   Basic Principles, Clinical Applications, and Future Directions
SO ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Corneal diseases, uncorrected refractive errors, and cataract represent the major causes of blindness globally. The number of refractive surgeries, either cornea- or lens-based, is also on the rise as the demand for perfect vision continues to increase. With the recent advancement and potential promises of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies demonstrated in the realm of ophthalmology, particularly retinal diseases and glaucoma, AI researchers and clinicians are now channeling their focus toward the less explored ophthalmic areas related to the anterior segment of the eye. Conditions that rely on anterior segment imaging modalities, including slit-lamp photography, anterior segment optical coherence tomography, corneal tomography, in vivo confocal microscopy and/or optical biometers, are the most commonly explored areas. These include infectious keratitis, keratoconus, corneal grafts, ocular surface pathologies, preoperative screening before refractive surgery, intraocular lens calculation, and automated refraction, among others. In this review, we aimed to provide a comprehensive update on the utilization of AI in anterior segment diseases, with particular emphasis on the recent advancement in the past few years. In addition, we demystify some of the basic principles and terminologies related to AI, particularly machine learning and deep learning, to help improve the understanding, research and clinical implementation of these AI technologies among the ophthalmologists and vision scientists. As we march toward the era of digital health, guidelines such as CONSORT-AI, SPIRIT-AI, and STARD-AI will play crucial roles in guiding and standardizing the conduct and reporting of AI-related trials, ultimately promoting their potential for clinical translation.

TI Early detection of diabetic foot ulcers from thermal images using the
   bag of features technique
SO BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL
AB The most common diabetes complication, diabetic foot ulcer (DFU), can result in amputation if not managed effectively. Early diagnosis is thus critical, yet DFU symptoms cannot be reliably identified in the initial stages of the disease. This work develops an accurate, fast, reliable end-to-end traditional machine learning (ML) model that can be implemented in real-time computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) applications for DFU diagnosis. We selected the plantar thermogram database because it may help detect an increase in plantar temperature and thereby permit early diagnosis. This method is less affected by environmental conditions, such as smoke and weather. To extract features invariant to translation, rotation, and scaling transformation, we use the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) methods combined with the Bag Of Features (BOF) technique. We used different pretrained deep learning (DL) networks to compare ML models trained with DL and handcrafted features. This research is novel since no previous studies have used traditional ML algorithms for the diagnosis of DFU from thermal images, nor have they used SIFT, SURF, or BOF techniques. In addition, we use direct temperature files of each foot, later mapping them onto images to obtain accurate temperature distributions. Conventional ML classifiers are preferred in the final stage for binary classification between normal and DFU. The proposed model achieves 97.81% classification accuracy using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier trained with the SURF-BOF technique, along with 97.81% sensitivity, 97.9% precision, and a 0.9995 Area under the ROC curve (AUC) for DFU classification using thermal images.

TI Radiomics and machine learning applications in rectal cancer: Current
   update and future perspectives
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB The high incidence of rectal cancer in both sexes makes it one of the most common tumors, with significant morbidity and mortality rates. To define the best treatment option and optimize patient outcome, several rectal cancer biological variables must be evaluated. Currently, medical imaging plays a crucial role in the characterization of this disease, and it often requires a multimodal approach. Magnetic resonance imaging is the first-choice imaging modality for local staging and restaging and can be used to detect high-risk prognostic factors. Computed tomography is widely adopted for the detection of distant metastases. However, conventional imaging has recognized limitations, and many rectal cancer characteristics remain assessable only after surgery and histopathology evaluation. There is a growing interest in artificial intelligence applications in medicine, and imaging is by no means an exception. The introduction of radiomics, which allows the extraction of quantitative features that reflect tumor heterogeneity, allows the mining of data in medical images and paved the way for the identification of potential new imaging biomarkers. To manage such a huge amount of data, the use of machine learning algorithms has been proposed. Indeed, without prior explicit programming, they can be employed to build prediction models to support clinical decision making. In this review, current applications and future perspectives of artificial intelligence in medical imaging of rectal cancer are presented, with an imaging modality-based approach and a keen eye on unsolved issues. The results are promising, but the road ahead for translation in clinical practice is rather long.

TI A comprehensive overview of cellular senescence from 1990 to 2021: A
   machine learning-based bibliometric analysis
SO FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB BackgroundAs a cellular process, senescence functions to prevent the proliferation of damaged, old and tumor-like cells, as well as participate in embryonic development, tissue repair, etc. This study aimed to analyze the themes and topics of the scientific publications related to cellular senescence in the past three decades by machine learning. MethodsThe MeSH term "cellular senescence" was used for searching publications from 1990 to 2021 on the PubMed database, while the R platform was adopted to obtain associated data. A topic network was constructed by latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and the Louvain algorithm. ResultsA total of 21,910 publications were finally recruited in this article. Basic studies (15,382, 70.21%) accounted for the most proportion of publications over the past three decades. Physiology, drug effects, and genetics were the most concerned MeSH terms, while cell proliferation was the leading term since 2010. Three senolytics were indexed by MeSH terms, including quercetin, curcumin, and dasatinib, with the accumulated occurrence of 35, 26, and 22, separately. Three clusters were recognized by LDA and network analyses. Telomere length was the top studied topic in the cluster of physiological function, while cancer cell had been a hot topic in the cluster of pathological function, and protein kinase pathway was the most popular topic in the cluster of molecular mechanism. Notably, the cluster of physiological function showed a poor connection with other clusters. ConclusionCellular senescence has obtained increasing attention over the past three decades. While most of the studies focus on the pathological function and molecular mechanism, more researches should be conducted on the physiological function and the clinical translation of cellular senescence, especially the development and application of senotherapeutics.

TI A novel combined experimental-machine learning approach to estimate the
   probabilistic capacity of RC beams with spatially correlated rebar
   corrosion in transverse and longitudinal directions
SO ENGINEERING STRUCTURES
AB Chloride-induced corrosion of tensile rebars in reinforced concrete (RC) structures causes cracking in the concrete surface along corroded rebars. The width of these cracks could provide valuable information for estimating the amount of steel weight loss inside concrete beams. However, an experimental investigation revealed that the distribution of cracks in RC beams with multiple rebars was affected not only by pressure from the corrosion expansion of the corresponding rebar but also from that of adjacent rebars. This leads to a highly complex nonlinear relationship between crack width and amount of steel corrosion. In this study, a novel combined experimental-machine learning approach is developed to estimate steel corrosion distributions in RC beams. This procedure applies generative adversarial networks (GANs) to consider the effects of spatially correlated rebar corrosion in transverse and longitudinal directions. A pix2pix network is trained by the distributions of a dataset of steel weight loss that is generated based on random field theory with the statistical parameters identified using the experimental evidence and the distributions of a dataset of corrosion crack widths constructed using finite element (FE) analysis. Subsequently, the probability density function (PDF) of the flexural capacity for corroded RC beams is obtained using Monte Carlo-based FE analysis. A case study investigating the effect of the distributions of observed crack widths on the PDF of the flexural capacity for aging RC beams with spatially correlated rebar corrosion in transverse and longitudinal directions is presented.

AB Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide the sensing and detection community with a discriminative, machine learning based approach for classifying images of objects. However, one of the largest limitations for deep CNN image classifiers is the need for extensive training data for a variety of appearances of class objects. While current methods such as GAN data augmentation, noise-perturbation, and rotation or translation of images can allow CNNs to better associate convolved features to ones similar to a learned image class, many fail to provide new context of ground truth information associated with each object class. To expand the association of new convolved feature examples with image classes within CNN training datasets, we propose a feature learning and training data enhancement paradigm via a multi-sensor domain data augmentation algorithm. This algorithm uses a mutual information, merit-based feature selection subroutine to iteratively select SAR object features that most correlate to each sensor domain's class image objects. It then re-augments these features into the opposite sensor domain's feature set via a highest mutual information, cross sensor domain image concatenation function. This augmented set then acts to retrain the CNN to recognize new cross domain class object features that each respective sensor domain's network was not previously exposed to. Our experimental results using T60-class vs T70-class SAR object images from both the MSTAR and MGTD dataset repositories demonstrated an increase in classification accuracy from 88% and 61% to post-augmented cross-domain dataset training of 93.75% accuracy for the MSTAR, MGTD and subsequent fused datasets, respectively.

TI Using an integrated feature set to generalize and justify the

SO JOURNAL OF ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY-SCIENCE C-COMPUTERS & ELECTRONICS
AB In machine translation (MT) practice, there is an urgent need for constructing a set of Chinese-to-English aspect transferring rules to define the transferring conditions. The integrated feature set was used to generalize and justify the Chinese-to-English transferring rule of the 'ZHE' aspect (ZHE Rule). A ZHE classification model was built in this study. The impacts of each set of temporal, lexical aspectual, and syntactic features, and their integrated impacts, on the accuracy of the ZHE Rule were tested. Over 600 misclassified corpus sentences were manually examined. A 10-fold cross-validation was used with a decision tree algorithm. The main results are: (1) The ZHE Rule was generalized and justified to have a higher accuracy under the two metrics: the precision rate and the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). (2) The temporal, lexical aspectual, and syntactic feature sets have an integrated contribution to the accuracy of the ZHE Rule. The syntactic and temporal features have an impact on ZHE aspect derivations, while the lexical aspectual features are not predictive of ZHE aspect derivation. (3) While associated with active verbs, the ZHE aspect can denote a perfective situation. This study suggests that the temporal and syntactic features are the predictive ZHE aspect classification features and that the ZHE Rule with an overall precision rate of 80.1% is accurate enough to be further explored in MT practice. The machine learning method, decision tree, can be applied to the automatic aspect transferring in MT research and aspectual interpretations in linguistic research.

AB The arrangement of defined irrigation events reveals a challenging issue to farmers all over the world, whereas the lack of instant top soil characterization simultaneously displays a major reason for this. Due to a consequent spatial heterogeneity of water contents, moving irrigation can scarcly be adjusted evenly in a proper relation to prevailing top soil water contents. For that a number of water content evaluation methods have been established to customise the previously calculated irrigation amounts according to the spatial variation of prevailing water contents on field. The most prominent method to detect a present state of water content is the translation of prevailing suction pressure within different soil depths into water contents. A second method is the Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) which reveals volumetric water contents using a mathematic runtime translation from transmitted electromagnetic pulses (Topp et al., 1980; Roth et al., 1992). Crux of the matter is where to allocate the stationary equipment on farm in order to derive a proper information of an all over field valid information on water content by selecting few and right spots hence to cost and maintenance of the abovementioned detecting devices.
   The latest design of a dynamic moving TDR reveals water contents in 3 depths using one solid probe body, moving in the top soil. But the produced shallow strap of information solitarily qualifies to display machine tracks of the moving irrigation cart. The translation into working breadth has been acquired using visually processed thermographic patterns. This resulted in a proper identification of moistened surfaces to a depth of -2 cm, even though an ocularly rating was not feasible. Moreover, the approach reveals current top soil evaporation, indicating changing zones of topsoil properties, which is indispensable to draw a clear image of actual irrigation needs within deeper layers of the root zone.

TI Fully implanted adaptive deep brain stimulation in freely moving
   essential tremor patients
SO JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING
AB Objective. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a safe and established treatment for essential tremor (ET) and several other movement disorders. One approach to improving DBS therapy is adaptive DBS (aDBS), in which stimulation parameters are modulated in real time based on biofeedback from either external or implanted sensors. Previously tested systems have fallen short of translational applicability due to the requirement for patients to continuously wear the necessary sensors or processing devices, as well as privacy and security concerns.Approach. We designed and implemented a translation-ready training data collection system for fully implanted aDBS. Two patients chronically implanted with electrocorticography strips over the hand portion of M1 and DBS probes in the ipsilateral ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus for treatment of ET were recruited for this study. Training was conducted using a translation-ready distributed training procedure, allowing a substantially higher degree of control over data collection than previous works. A linear classifier was trained using this system, biased towards activating stimulation in accordance with clinical considerations.Main results. The clinically relevant average false negative rate, defined as fraction of time during which stimulation dropped below 1/2 clinical levels during movement epochs, was 0.036. Tremor suppression, calculated through analysis of gyroscope data, was 33.2% more effective on average with aDBS than with continuous DBS. During a period of free movement with aDBS, one patient reported a slight paresthesia; patients noticed no difference in treatment efficacy between systems.Significance. Here is presented the first translation-ready training procedure for a fully embedded aDBS control system for MDs and one of the first examples of such a system in ET, adding to the consensus that fully implanted aDBS systems are sufficiently mature for broader deployment in treatment of movement disorders.

TI Lysine Malonylation Identification in E-coli with Multiple Features
SO CURRENT PROTEOMICS
AB Motivation: Lysine malonylation in eukaryote proteins had been found in 2011 through high-throughput proteomic analysis. However, it was poorly understood in prokaryotes. Recent researches have shown that maonylation in E. colt was significantly enriched in protein translation, energy metabolism pathways and fatty acid biosynthesis.
   Results: In this work we proposed a predictor to identify the lysine malonylation sites in E. coli through physicochemical properties, binary code and sequence frequency by support vector machine algorithm. The experimentally determined lysine malonylation sites were retrieved from the first and largest malonylome dataset in prokaryotes up to date. The physicochemical properties plus position specific amino acid sequence propensity features got the best results with AUC (the area under the Receive Operating Character curve) 0.7994, MCC (Mathew correlation coefficient) 0.4335 in 10-fold cross-validation. Meanwhile the AUC values were 0.7800, 0.7851 and 0.8050 in 6-fold, 8-fold and LOO (leave-one-out) cross-validation, respectively. All the ROC curves were close to each other which illustrated the robustness and performance of the proposed predictor. We also analyzed the sequence propensities through TwoSampleLogo and found some peptides differences with t-test p<0.01. The predictor had shown better results than those of other methods K-Nearest Neighbors, C4.5 decision tree, Naive Bayes and Random Forest. Functional analysis showed that malonylated proteins were involved in many transcription activities and diverse biological processes. Meanwhile we also developed an online package which could be freely downloaded https://github.com/Sunmile/Malonylation E.coli.

In particular, the fitness functions required for evolving FSTs are generally different from those used for FSMs. In this paper, three string distance-based fitness functions are evaluated, in order of increasing computational complexity: string equality, Hamming distance, and edit distance. The fitness-distance correlation (FDC) and evolutionary performance of each fitness function is analyzed when used within a random mutation hill-climber (RMHC). Edit distance has the strongest FDC and also provides the best evolutionary performance, in that it is more likely to find the target FST within a given number of fitness function evaluations. Edit distance is also the most expensive to compute, but in most cases this extra computation is more than justified by its performance.
   The RMHC was compared with the best known heuristic method for learning FSTs, the onward subsequential transducer inference algorithm (OSTIA). On noise-free data, the RMHC performs best on problems with sparse training sets and small target machines. The RMHC and OSTIA offer similar performance for large target machines and denser data sets. When noise-corrupted data is used for training, the RMHC still performs well, while OSTIA performs poorly given even small amounts of noise. The RMHC is also shown to outperform a genetic algorithm. Hence, for certain classes of FST induction problem, the RMHC presented in this paper offers the best performance of any known algorithm.

TI Image-to-Image Translation-Based Data Augmentation for Improving
   Crop/Weed Classification Models for Precision Agriculture Applications
SO ALGORITHMS
AB Applications of deep-learning models in machine visions for crop/weed identification have remarkably upgraded the authenticity of precise weed management. However, compelling data are required to obtain the desired result from this highly data-driven operation. This study aims to curtail the effort needed to prepare very large image datasets by creating artificial images of maize (Zea mays) and four common weeds (i.e., Charlock, Fat Hen, Shepherd's Purse, and small-flowered Cranesbill) through conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs). The fidelity of these synthetic images was tested through t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualization plots of real and artificial images of each class. The reliability of this method as a data augmentation technique was validated through classification results based on the transfer learning of a pre-defined convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture-the AlexNet; the feature extraction method came from the deepest pooling layer of the same network. Machine learning models based on a support vector machine (SVM) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were trained using these feature vectors. The F1 scores of the transfer learning model increased from 0.97 to 0.99, when additionally supported by an artificial dataset. Similarly, in the case of the feature extraction technique, the classification F1-scores increased from 0.93 to 0.96 for SVM and from 0.94 to 0.96 for the LDA model. The results show that image augmentation using generative adversarial networks (GANs) can improve the performance of crop/weed classification models with the added advantage of reduced time and manpower. Furthermore, it has demonstrated that generative networks could be a great tool for deep-learning applications in agriculture.

TI Efficient Deep Neural Network Serving: Fast and Furious
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK AND SERVICE MANAGEMENT
AB The emergence of deep neural networks (DNNs) as a state-of-the-art machine learning technique has enabled a variety of artificial intelligence applications for image recognition, speech recognition and translation, drug discovery, and machine vision. These applications are backed by large DNN models running in serving mode on a cloud computing infrastructure to process client inputs such as images, speech segments, and text segments. Given the compute-intensive nature of large DNN models, a key challenge for DNN serving systems is to minimize the request response latencies. This paper characterizes the behavior of different parallelism techniques for supporting scalable and responsive serving systems for large DNNs. We identify and model two important properties of DNN workloads: 1) homogeneous request service demand and 2) interference among requests running concurrently due to cache/memory contention. These properties motivate the design of serving deep learning systems fast (SERF), a dynamic scheduling framework that is powered by an interference-aware queueing-based analytical model. To minimize response latency for DNN serving, SERF quickly identifies and switches to the optimal parallel configuration of the serving system by using both empirical and analytical methods. Our evaluation of SERF using several well-known benchmarks demonstrates its good latency prediction accuracy, its ability to correctly identify optimal parallel configurations for each benchmark, its ability to adapt to changing load conditions, and its efficiency advantage (by at least three orders of magnitude faster) over exhaustive profiling. We also demonstrate that SERF supports other scheduling objectives and can be extended to any general machine learning serving system with the similar parallelism properties as above.

AB In recent years, researchers have developed a wide range of Brain Machine Interface applications to aid differentially enabled communities, which includes speech communication and wheelchair navigation. Intelligent Robot Chair with communication aid (IRCC) involves classification of navigational tasks (FORWARD, LEFT, RIGHT & RELAX) along with tasks related to speech (YES, NO and Help), to provide an alternative navigation system with a communication aid for the DE patients. The navigational tasks and the binary YESINO tasks can be used for navigating a wheelchair and also for speech communications using any oddball paradigm. The additional tasks 'HELP' can be used to help the patient during an emergency. The proposed system records the 8-channel wireless electroencephalography signal from twenty subjects while the subject performs the seven different tasks. The recorded brain wave signals are preprocessed to remove the interference waveforms and segmented into six frequency band signals, i. e. Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma1-1 and Gamma-2. The frequency band signals are segmented into frame samples of equal length and are used to extract the features using cross-correlation (r) function. This study presents statistical features of cross-correlation based distinctive feature extraction technique. The cross-correlation features are extracted from combinations of different frequency band signals. The extracted feature sets are tenfold cross validated using multi-class support vector machine using RBF kernel algorithm. From the results, it is observed that the Mean feature set has the maximum classification accuracy of 88.65 % and standard deviation feature has the minimum classification accuracy of 78.51 %.

TI Towards an effective identification strategy in volumetric error
   compensation of machine tools
SO MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The influence of technical parameters for volumetric error compensation in large-volume machine tools (MTs) is presented in this paper. The techniques presented are based on characterization models using nonlinear optimization procedures. The parameters presented allow for the characterization of different errors in the MT studied and depend on the kinematics and geometry of the system, regardless of the optimization methodology. The kinematics is affected by the MT errors on the number and type of axes and movements. To relate the coordinates of the tool to the coordinates of a laser tracker, a kinematic model of the MT that includes the measurement system must be defined. Kinematic models can be realized by using homogeneous transformation matrices or independent rotation and translation arrays according to the type of machine. Chebyshev, simple or Legendre polynomial regression functions can be used to characterize the geometric errors of the MT and are presented and compared. The distribution of measurement points, mesh or cloud, and optimization constraints of polynomial regressions are factors that also affect volumetric error compensation. Therefore, these parameters were studied and presented as well. In addition to the parameters discussed above, another parameter that affects the accuracy of data capture is the measurement noise. To improve the measurement accuracy, multilateration techniques need to be applied. Each of the aforementioned parameters has been studied by using a synthetic test generated by a parametric synthetic data generator. The selected parameters constitute a package of optimization improvement regardless of the optimization methodology, which have improved the nonlinear optimization from 60-70% to 98%.

TI Efficient hybrid explicit-implicit learning for multiscale problems
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS
AB Splitting method is a powerful method to handle application problems by splitting physics, scales, domain, and so on. Many splitting algorithms have been designed for efficient temporal discretization. In this paper, our goal is to use temporal splitting concepts in designing machine learning algorithms and, at the same time, help splitting algorithms by incorporating data and speeding them up. We propose a machine learning assisted splitting scheme which improves the efficiency of the scheme meanwhile preserves the accuracy. We consider a recently introduced multiscale splitting algorithms, where the multiscale problem is solved on a coarse grid. To approximate the dynamics, only a few degrees of freedom are solved implicitly, while others explicitly. This splitting concept allows identifying degrees of freedom that need implicit treatment. In this paper, we use this splitting concept in machine learning and propose several strategies. First, the implicit part of the solution can be learned as it is more difficult to solve, while the explicit part can be computed. This provides a speed-up and data incorporation for splitting approaches. Secondly, one can design a hybrid neural network architecture because handling explicit parts requires much fewer communications among neurons and can be done efficiently. Thirdly, one can solve the coarse grid component via PDEs or other approximation methods and construct simpler neural networks for the explicit part of the solutions. We discuss these options and implement one of them by interpreting it as a machine translation task. This interpretation of the splitting scheme successfully enables us using the Transformer since it can perform model reduction for multiple time series and learn the connection between them. We also find that the splitting scheme is a great platform to predict the coarse solution with insufficient information of the target model: the target problem is partially given and we need to solve it through a known problem which approximates the target. Our machine learning model can incorporate and encode the given information from two different problems and then solve the target problems. We conduct four numerical examples and the results show that our method is stable and accurate. (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Analysing Head-Thorax Choreography During Free-Flights in Bumblebees
SO FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB Animals coordinate their various body parts, sometimes in elaborate manners to swim, walk, climb, fly, and navigate their environment. The coordination of body parts is essential to behaviors such as, chasing, escaping, landing, and the extraction of relevant information. For example, by shaping the movement of the head and body in an active and controlled manner, flying insects structure their flights to facilitate the acquisition of distance information. They condense their turns into a short period of time (the saccade) interspaced by a relatively long translation (the intersaccade). However, due to technological limitations, the precise coordination of the head and thorax during insects' free-flight remains unclear. Here, we propose methods to analyse the orientation of the head and thorax of bumblebees Bombus terrestris, to segregate the trajectories of flying insects into saccades and intersaccades by using supervised machine learning (ML) techniques, and finally to analyse the coordination between head and thorax by using artificial neural networks (ANN). The segregation of flights into saccades and intersaccades by ML, based on the thorax angular velocities, decreased the misclassification by 12% compared to classically used methods. Our results demonstrate how machine learning techniques can be used to improve the analyses of insect flight structures and to learn about the complexity of head-body coordination. We anticipate our assay to be a starting point for more sophisticated experiments and analysis on freely flying insects. For example, the coordination of head and body movements during collision avoidance, chasing behavior, or negotiation of gaps could be investigated by monitoring the head and thorax orientation of freely flying insects within and across behavioral tasks, and in different species.

TI An innovative hybrid approach for extracting named entities from
   unstructured text data
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Named entity recognition (NER) is the core part of information extraction that facilitates the automatic detection and classification of entities in natural language text into predefined categories, such as the names of persons, organizations, locations, and so on. The output of the NER task is crucial for many applications, including relation extraction, textual entailment, machine translation, information retrieval, etc. Literature shows that machine learning and deep learning approaches are the most widely used techniques for NER. However, for entity extraction, the abovementioned approaches demand the availability of a domain-specific annotated data set. Our goal is to develop a hybrid NER system composed of rule-based deep learning as well as clustering-based approaches, which facilitates the extraction of generic entities (such as person, location, and organization) out of natural language texts of domains that lack generic named entities labeled domain data sets. The proposed approach takes the advantages of both deep learning and clustering approaches but separately, in combination with a knowledge-based approach by using a postprocessing module. We evaluated the proposed methodology on court cases (judgments) as a use case since it contains generic named entities of different forms that are poorly or not present in open-source NER data sets. We also evaluated our hybrid models on two benchmark data sets, namely, Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL) 2003 and Open Knowledge Extraction (OKE) 2016. The experimental results obtained from benchmark data sets show that our hybrid models achieved substantially better performance in terms of the F-score in comparison to other competitive systems.

TI Host-rabies virus protein-protein interactions as druggable antiviral
   targets
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB We present an unconventional approach to antiviral drug discovery, which is used to identify potent small molecules against rabies virus. First, we conceptualized viral capsid assembly as occurring via a host-catalyzed biochemical pathway, in contrast to the classical view of capsid formation by self-assembly. This suggested opportunities for antiviral intervention by targeting previously unappreciated catalytic host proteins, which were pursued. Second, we hypothesized these host proteins to be components of heterogeneous, labile, and dynamic multi-subunit assembly machines, not easily isolated by specific target protein-focused methods. This suggested the need to identify active compounds before knowing the precise protein target. A cell-free translation-based small molecule screen was established to recreate the hypothesized interactions involving newly synthesized capsid proteins as host assembly machine substrates. Hits from the screen were validated by efficacy against infectious rabies virus in mammalian cell culture. Used as affinity ligands, advanced analogs were shown to bind a set of proteins that effectively reconstituted drug sensitivity in the cell-free screen and included a small but discrete subfraction of cellular ATP-binding cassette family E1 (ABCE1), a host protein previously found essential for HIV capsid formation. Taken together, these studies advance an alternate view of capsid formation (as a host-catalyzed biochemical pathway), a different paradigm for drug discovery (whole pathway screening without knowledge of the target), and suggest the existence of labile assembly machines that can be rendered accessible as next-generation drug targets by the means described.

TI Machine Learning Tools for Image-Based Glioma Grading and the Quality of
   Their Reporting: Challenges and Opportunities
SO CANCERS
AB Simple Summary Despite their prevalence in research, ML tools that can predict glioma grade from medical images have yet to be incorporated clinically. The reporting quality of ML glioma grade prediction studies is below 50% according to TRIPOD-limiting model reproducibility and, thus, clinical translation-however, current efforts to create ML-specific reporting guidelines and risk of bias tools may help address this. Several additional deficiencies in the areas of ML model data and glioma classification hamper widespread clinical use, but promising efforts to overcome current challenges and encourage implementation are on the horizon. Technological innovation has enabled the development of machine learning (ML) tools that aim to improve the practice of radiologists. In the last decade, ML applications to neuro-oncology have expanded significantly, with the pre-operative prediction of glioma grade using medical imaging as a specific area of interest. We introduce the subject of ML models for glioma grade prediction by remarking upon the models reported in the literature as well as by describing their characteristic developmental workflow and widely used classifier algorithms. The challenges facing these models-including data sources, external validation, and glioma grade classification methods -are highlighted. We also discuss the quality of how these models are reported, explore the present and future of reporting guidelines and risk of bias tools, and provide suggestions for the reporting of prospective works. Finally, this review offers insights into next steps that the field of ML glioma grade prediction can take to facilitate clinical implementation.

TI A Review on the Challenges in Indian Genomics Research for Variant
   Identification and Interpretation
SO FRONTIERS IN GENETICS
AB Today, genomic data holds great potential to improve healthcare strategies across various dimensions - be it disease prevention, enhanced diagnosis, or optimized treatment. The biggest hurdle faced by the medical and research community in India is the lack of genotype-phenotype correlations for Indians at a population-wide and an individual level. This leads to inefficient translation of genomic information during clinical decision making. Population-wide sequencing projects for Indian genomes help overcome hurdles and enable us to unearth and validate the genetic markers for different health conditions. Machine learning algorithms are essential to analyze huge amounts of genotype data in synergy with gene expression, demographic, clinical, and pathological data. Predictive models developed through these algorithms help in classifying the individuals into different risk groups, so that preventive measures and personalized therapies can be designed. They also help in identifying the impact of each genetic marker with the associated condition, from a clinical perspective. In India, genome sequencing technologies have now become more accessible to the general population. However, information on variants associated with several major diseases is not available in publicly-accessible databases. Creating a centralized database of variants facilitates early detection and mitigation of health risks in individuals. In this article, we discuss the challenges faced by genetic researchers and genomic testing facilities in India, in terms of dearth of public databases, people with knowledge on machine learning algorithms, computational resources and awareness in the medical community in interpreting genetic variants. Potential solutions to enhance genomic research in India, are also discussed.

SO TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY
CT 9th International Trenchless Technology Research Colloquium
CY SEP 06-07, 2007
CL Rome, ITALY
AB In recent years the interest in microtunnelling has grown due to the fact that open trenching is an increasingly undesired operation. However. microtunnelling encounters restrictions in expanding into new areas. In the Netherlands, and more general in (very) soft soils, one of the main problems is the controlled boring of curves. To better understand the behaviour of the tunnel boring machine (TBM) an analytical model has been developed, that takes translation and rotation of the TBM into account. These movements can be superimposed to describe the complete movement of the TBM. The model has been developed in an incremental fashion by first taking only the influence of a limited set of parameters into account. The first model takes the subgrade reaction modulus and the influence of the machine on the stiffness of the soil into account and is subsequently improved upon by taking the dead weight and eccentric jacking forces into account. This second model is validated with a case study, the installation of the KPE-pipe under the Hartel canal in Rotterdam, and this shows reliable results. Using the model, the required position of the steering jacks in the tunnelling machine can be determined, given that the required parameters are known. In addition, the ovalisation of the bored hole can be forecast. With the variation in angular rotations and the maximum rotation, the behaviour of the joints can be determined. In this way problematic situations can be prevented. Although the results of the validations are good, a number of aspects do need further research. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sequential labelling plays a vital role in solving numerous Natural Language Processing (NLP) applica-tions such as Machine Translation and Information Extraction etc. One of these is Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, which assigns a sequence of grammatical categories to the given sentence, and Chunking which groups them into 'chunks' or what can be called minimal phrases. Bhojpuri, Maithili and Magahi are low resource languages and widely spoken in central north-eastern India, belonging to the Indo-Aryan lan-guage family. The creation of an annotated corpus for POS tagging and Chunking, and then building an initial automatic tool for these problems is the first attempt towards building language technology tools for these languages. The annotated corpus used to develop POS Taggers and Chunkers, based on various machine learning algorithms (TnT, CRF, MEMM and Structured SVM) and state-of-the-art LSTM-CNN-CRF model, and then these compared with the obtained results on two new proposed deep learning-based models, Self-Attention Hierarchical Bi-LSTM CRF (SAHBiLC) and a fine-tuned version of it, Fine-SAHBiLC. The SAHBiLC and Fine-SAHBiLC models outperform on Bhojpuri (Accuracy for POS and Chunking is 0.86% and 0.94%, respectively) and Maithili (Accuracy for POS and Chunking is 0.86% and 0.95%, respectively) and Magahi (Accuracy for POS is 0.86%).(c) 2021 The Authors.

TI Prediction of zinc-binding sites using multiple sequence profiles and
   machine learning methods
SO MOLECULAR OMICS
AB The zinc (Zn2+) cofactor has been proven to be involved in numerous biological mechanisms and the zinc-binding site is recognized as one of the most important post-translation modifications in proteins. Therefore, accurate knowledge of zinc ions in protein structures can provide potential clues for elucidation of protein folding and functions. However, determining zinc-binding residues by experimental means is usually lab-intensive and associated with high cost in most cases. In this context, the development of computational tools for identifying zinc-binding sites is highly desired, especially in the current post-genomic era. In this work, we developed a novel zinc-binding site prediction method by combining several intensively-trained machine learning models. To establish an accurate and generative method, we downloaded all zinc-binding proteins from the Protein Data Bank and prepared a non-redundant dataset. Meanwhile, a well-prepared dataset by other groups was also used. Then, effective and complementary features were extracted from sequences and three-dimensional structures of these proteins. Moreover, several well-designed machine learning models were intensively trained to construct accurate models. To assess the performance, the obtained predictors were stringently benchmarked using the diverse zinc-binding sites. Furthermore, several state-of-the-art in silico methods developed specifically for zinc-binding sites were also evaluated and compared. The results confirmed that our method is very competitive in real world applications and could become a complementary tool to wet lab experiments. To facilitate research in the community, a web server and stand-alone program implementing our method were constructed and are publicly available at http:// bioinformatics. fzu. edu. cn/ znMachine. html. The downloadable program of our method can be easily used for the high-throughput screening of potential zinc-binding sites across proteomes.

TI Multi-pathway multi-echo acquisition and neural contrast translation to
   generate a variety of quantitative and qualitative image contrasts
SO MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE
AB Purpose Clinical exams typically involve acquiring many different image contrasts to help discriminate healthy from diseased states. Ideally, 3D quantitative maps of all of the main MR parameters would be obtained for improved tissue characterization. Using data from a 7-min whole-brain multi-pathway multi-echo (MPME) scan, we aimed to synthesize several 3D quantitative maps (T-1 and T-2) and qualitative contrasts (MPRAGE, FLAIR, T-1-weighted, T-2-weighted, and proton density [PD]-weighted). The ability of MPME acquisitions to capture large amounts of information in a relatively short amount of time suggests it may help reduce the duration of neuro MR exams. Methods Eight healthy volunteers were imaged at 3.0T using a 3D isotropic (1.2 mm) MPME sequence. Spin-echo, MPRAGE, and FLAIR scans were performed for training and validation. MPME signals were interpreted through neural networks for predictions of different quantitative and qualitative contrasts. Predictions were compared to reference values at voxel and region-of-interest levels. Results Mean absolute errors (MAEs) for T-1 and T-2 maps were 216 ms and 11 ms, respectively. In ROIs containing white matter (WM) and thalamus tissues, the mean T-1/T-2 predicted values were 899/62 ms and 1139/58 ms, consistent with reference values of 850/66 ms and 1126/58 ms, respectively. For qualitative contrasts, signals were normalized to those of WM, and MAEs for MPRAGE, FLAIR, T-1-weighted, T-2-weighted, and PD-weighted contrasts were 0.14, 0.15, 0.13, 0.16, and 0.05, respectively. Conclusions Using an MPME sequence and neural-network contrast translation, whole-brain results were obtained with a variety of quantitative and qualitative contrast in similar to 6.8 min.

TI Action Classification in Action Ontology Building Using Robot-Specific
   Texts
SO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND CONTROL
AB Instructions written in human-language cause no perception problems for humans, but become a challenge when translating them into robot executable format. This complex translation process covers different phases, including instruction completion by adding obligatory information that is not explicitly given in human-oriented instructions. Robot action ontology is a common source of such additional information, and it is normally structured around a limited number of verbs, denoting robot specific action categories, each of them characterized by a certain action environment. Semi-manual action ontology building procedures are normally based on domain-specific human-language text mining, and one of the problems to be solved is the assignment of action categories for the obtained verbs. Verbs in English language are very polysemous, therefore action category, referring to different robot capabilities, can be determined only after comprehensive analysis of the verb's context. The task we solve is formulated as the text classification task, where action categories are treated as classes, and appropriate verb context as classification instances. Since all classes are clearly defined, supervised machine learning paradigm is the best selection to tackle this problem.
   We experimentally investigated different context window widths; directions (context on the right, left, both sides of analyzed verb); and feature types (symbolic, lexical, morphological, aggregated). All statements were proved after exploration of two different datasets. The fact that all obtained results are above random and majority baselines allow us to claim that the proposed method can be used for predicting action categories. The best obtained results were achieved with Support Vector Machine method using window width of only 25 symbols on the right and bag-of-words as features. This exceeded random and majority baselines by more than 37% reaching 60% of accuracy.

TI DEVELOPMENT OF KEY TECHNOLOGIES FOR HIGH-THROUGHPUT CELL-FREE PROTEIN
   PRODUCTION WITH THE EXTRACT FROM WHEAT EMBRYOS
SO STRUCTURAL GENOMICS, PT A
SE ADVANCES IN PROTEIN CHEMISTRY
AB The cell-free translation system from wheat embryos had been considered to be inefficient, as compared with the E. coli, cell-based and cell-free protein production methods. However, it was revealed that the extract from extensively washed wheat embryo particles can provide a very productive cell-free protein synthesis system. Since then, the method has been improved, so that it. fits the postgenomic researches. New mRNA configurations enabled LIS to synthesize many different proteins in parallel and to prepare large amounts of proteins, which fits the need for screening of suitable proteins for structural and functional analyses before large-scale production. The new reaction formats promoted the developments of new machines that perform highly parallel and highly productive protein synthesis reactions automatically. It. was revealed that, by parallel synthesis of many proteins, much more multidomain proteins are produced in soluble forms in the wheat system than in the prokaryotic systems. The wheat system provides a rapid and cost-effective method for stable isotope labeling of proteins for NMR analyses. Selenomethionine substitution of proteins for X-ray crystallography through die cell-free synthesis was also achieved. Synthesis of some families of proteins that were difficult to be produced by conventional methods has been tested. At least, cytotoxic restriction enzymes were readily produced in a large amount. Some multisubunit proteins and cofactor-binding proteins could be synthesized by the method and were characterized successfully. Membrane proteins have also been tested, and a transporter was synthesized in an active form. Although some issues remains to be solved, we expect that the wheat cell-free protein synthesis system can contribute to the structural and functional genomics and to the future understanding of life.

TI Prediction of Protein-Protein Interactions with Clustered Amino Acids
   and Weighted Sparse Representation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB With the completion of the Human Genome Project, bioscience has entered into the era of the genome and proteome. Therefore, protein-protein interactions (PPIs) research is becoming more and more important. Life activities and the protein-protein interactions are inseparable, such as DNA synthesis, gene transcription activation, protein translation, etc. Though many methods based on biological experiments and machine learning have been proposed, they all spent a long time to learn and obtained an imprecise accuracy. How to efficiently and accurately predict PPIs is still a big challenge. To take up such a challenge, we developed a new predictor by incorporating the reduced amino acid alphabet (RAAA) information into the general form of pseudo-amino acid composition (PseAAC) and with the weighted sparse representation-based classification (WSRC). The remarkable advantages of introducing the reduced amino acid alphabet is being able to avoid the notorious dimensionality disaster or overfitting problem in statistical prediction. Additionally, experiments have proven that our method achieved good performance in both a low- and high-dimensional feature space. Among all of the experiments performed on the PPIs data of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the best one achieved 90.91% accuracy, 94.17% sensitivity, 87.22% precision and a 83.43% Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) value. In order to evaluate the prediction ability of our method, extensive experiments are performed to compare with the state-of-the-art technique, support vector machine (SVM). The achieved results show that the proposed approach is very promising for predicting PPIs, and it can be a helpful supplement for PPIs prediction.

AB Learning representations from massive unlabeled data is a hot topic for high-level tasks in many applications. The recent great improvements on benchmark data sets, which are achieved by increasingly complex unsupervised learning methods and deep learning models with lots of parameters, usually require many tedious tricks and much expertise to tune. However, filters learned by these complex architectures are quite similar to standard hand-crafted features visually, and training the deep models costs quite long time to fine-tune their weights. In this paper, Extreme Learning Machine-Autoencoder (ELM-AE) is employed as the learning unit to learn local receptive fields at each layer, and the lower layer responses are transferred to the last layer (trans-layer) to form a more complete representation to retain more information. In addition, some beneficial methods in deep learning architectures such as local contrast normalization and whitening are added to the proposed hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine networks to further boost the performance. The obtained trans-layer representations are followed by block histograms with binary hashing to learn translation and rotation invariant representations, which are utilized to do high-level tasks such as recognition and detection. Compared to traditional deep learning methods, the proposed trans-layer representation method with ELM-AE based learning of local receptive filters has much faster learning speed and is validated in several typical experiments, such as digit recognition on MNIST and MNIST variations, object recognition on Caltech 101. State-of-the-art performances are achieved on both CaItech 101 15 samples per class task and 4 of 6 MNIST variations data sets, and highly impressive results are obtained on MNIST data set and other tasks.

TI Designing Reconfigurable Cyber-Physical Systems Using Unified Modeling
   Language
SO ENERGIES
AB Technological progress in recent years in the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) area has given designers unprecedented possibilities and computational power, but as a consequence, the modeled CPSs are becoming increasingly complex, hierarchical, and concurrent. Therefore, new methods of CPSs design (especially using abstract modeling) are needed. The paper presents an approach to the CPS control part modeling using state machine diagrams from Unified Modelling Language (UML). The proposed design method attempts to combine the advantages of graphical notation (intuitiveness, convenience, readability) with the benefits of text specification languages (unambiguity, precision, versatility). The UML specification is transformed using Model-Driven Development (MDD) techniques into an effective program in Hardware Description Language (HDL), using Concurrent Finite State Machine (CFSM) as a temporary model. The obtained HDL specification can be analyzed, validated, synthesized, and finally implemented in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices. The dynamic, partial reconfiguration (a feature of modern FPGAs) allows for the exchange of a part of the implemented CPS algorithm without stopping the device. But to use this feature, the model must be safe, which in the proposed approach means, that it should possess special idle states, where the control is transferred during the reconfiguration process. Applying the CFSM model greatly facilitates this task. The proposed design method offers efficient graphical modeling of a control part of CPS, and automatic translation of the behavior model into a synthesizable Verilog description, which can be directly implemented in FPGA devices, and dynamically reconfigured as needed. A practical example illustrating the successive stages of the proposed method is also presented.

AB Intel's novel Loihi processing chip has been used to explore new information exploitation techniques. Specifically, we analyzed two types of data (optical and radar). These data modalities and associated machine learning algorithms were used to showcase the ability of the system to address real world problems, such as object detection and classification. Intel's fully digital Loihi design is inspired by biological processes and brain functions. Neuromorphic architectures, such as Loihi, promise to improve computational efficiency for various machine learning tasks with a realizable path toward implementation into many systems, e.g., airborne computing for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems, and/or future autonomous vehicles and household appliances. With the current software development kit, it is possible to train an artificial neural network model in a common deep learning framework such as Keras and quantize the model weights for a simplistic, direct translation onto the Loihi hardware. The radar imagery analyzed included a seven-vehicle class target set, which was processed at a rate of 9.5 images per second and with an overall accuracy of 90.1%. The optical data included a binary (two classes), and another nine-class data set. The binary classifier processed the optical data at a rate of 12.8 images per second with 94.0% accuracy. The nine classes optical data was processed at a rate 12.9 images per second and 79.7% accuracy. Lastly, the system used similar to 6 Watts of total power with similar to 0.6 Watts being utilized by the neuromorphic cores. The inferencing energy used to classify each image varied between 14.9 and 63.2 millijoules/image.

TI Assessing validation of dual fluoroscopic image matching method for
   measurement of in vivo spine kinematics
SO CHINESE MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB Background Accurate knowledge of the spinal structural functions is critical to understand the biomechanical factors that affect spinal pathology. Many studies have investigated the human vertebral motion both in vitro and in vivo. However, determination of in vivo motion of the vertebrae under physiologic loading conditions remains a challenge in biomedical engineering because of the limitations of current technology and the complicated anatomy of the spine.
   Methods For in vitro validation, a human lumbar specimen was imbedded with steel beads and moved to a known distance by an universal testing machine (UTM). The dual fluoroscopic system was used to capture the spine motion and reproduce the moving distance. For in vivo validation, a living subject moved the spine in various positions while bearing weight. The fluoroscopes were used to reproduce the in vivo spine positions 5 times. The standard deviations in translation and orientation of the five measurements were used to evaluate the repeatability of technique. The accuracy of vertebral outline matching with metallic marks matching technology was compared.
   Results The translation positions of the human lumbar specimen could be determined with a mean accuracy less than 0.35 mm and a mean repeatability 0.36 mm for the image matching technique. The repeatability of the method in reproducing in vivo human spine six degrees of freedom (6DOF) kinematics was less than 0.43 mm in translation and less than 0.65 degrees in rotation. The accuracy of metallic marks and vertebral outline matching did not show significant difference.
   Conclusions Combining a dual fluoroscopic and computerized tomography imaging technique was accurate and reproduceable for noninvasive measurement of spine vertebral motion. The vertebral outline matching technique could be a useful technique for matching of vertebral positions and orientations which can evaluate and improve the efficacy of the various surgical treatments.

AB Inspired by Transformer, one of the most successful deep learning models in natural language processing, machine translation, etc. Vision Transformer (ViT) has recently demonstrated its effectiveness in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, etc. However, the major issue with ViT is to require massively trainable parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel compressed ViT model, namely Tensor-train ViT (TT-ViT), based on tensor-train (TT) decomposition. Consider a multi-head self-attention layer, instead of storing whole trainable matrices, we represent them in TT format via their TT cores using fewer parameters. The results of our experiments on CIFAR-10/Fashion-MNIST dataset reveal that TT-ViT achieves outstanding performance with equivalent accuracy to its baseline model, while total parameters of TT-ViT are just half of those of the baseline model.

We propose a novel multi-step workload forecasting approach named TEALED which applies time-sensitive empirical mode decomposition and auto long short-term memory based encoder-decoder to predict resource utilization and query arrival rates for DBMSs. We first improve the empirical mode decomposition method by considering time translation and extending short series. Then we utilize the encoder-decoder network to extract features from decomposed workloads and generate workload predictions. Moreover, we combine hyperparameter search technologies to guarantee performance under varying workloads. The experiment results show the effectiveness and robustness of TEALED, and indicate the ability of multi-step workload forecasting.

AB Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) is to learn continuous vectors of entities and relations in the Knowledge Graph (KG). Inspired by the R-GCN model, we propose a novel embedding learning model named RotatGAT, which combines the RotatE model and the GAT model. The goal is to overcome the shortcomings of R-GCN, that has a relatively high computing complexity and cannot distinguish the importance of neighbors. We introduce the RotatE model into RotatGAT to represent the embeddings of heterogeneous entities and relations in KG. Considering RotatE cannot use the structure information to learn entities' embeddings, we introduce the GAT model to learn the importance of neighbors of an entity and aggregate the feature information of neighbors for graph embedding learning. The link prediction experiments show the overall performance of RotatGAT on four benchmark datasets outperforms existing state-of-the-art models.

AB Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNs) plays an important role in many applications ranging from information retrieval, recommender systems to machine translation. Several ANN indexes, such as hashing and quantization, have been designed to update for the evolving database, but there exists a remarkable performance gap between them and retrained indexes on the entire database. To close the gap, we propose an online additive quantization algorithm (online AQ) to dynamically update quantization codebooks with the incoming streaming data. Then we derive the regret bound to theoretically guarantee the performance of the online AQ algorithm. Moreover, to improve the learning efficiency, we develop a randomized block beam search algorithm for assigning each data to the codewords of the codebook. Finally, we extensively evaluate the proposed online AQ algorithm on four real-world datasets, showing that it remarkably outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.

AB Regularization and data augmentation are crucial to training end-to-end automatic speech recognition systems. Dropout is a popular regularization technique, which operates on each neuron independently by multiplying it with a Bernoulli random variable. We propose a generalization of dropout, called "convolutional dropout", where each neuron's activation is replaced with a randomly-weighted linear combination of neuron values in its neighborhood. We believe that this formulation combines the regularizing effect of dropout with the smoothing effects of the convolution operation. In addition to convolutional dropout, this paper also proposes using random word-piece segmentations as a data augmentation scheme during training, inspired by results in neural machine translation. We adopt both these methods during the training of transformer-transducer speech recognition models, and show consistent WER improvements on Librispeech as well as across different languages.

TI Anaphora and coreference resolution: A review
SO INFORMATION FUSION
AB Coreference resolution aims at resolving repeated references to an object in a document and forms a core component of natural language processing (NLP) research. When used as a component in the processing pipeline of other NLP fields like machine translation, sentiment analysis, paraphrase detection, and summarization, coreference resolution has a potential to highly improve accuracy. A direction of research closely related to coreference resolution is anaphora resolution. Existing literature is often ambiguous in its usage of these terms and often uses them interchangeably. Through this review article, we clarify the scope of these two tasks. We also carry out a detailed analysis of the datasets, evaluation metrics and research methods that have been adopted to tackle these NLP problems. This survey is motivated by the aim of providing readers with a clear understanding of what constitutes these two tasks in NLP research and their related issues.

TI Non-audio-Video Gesture Recognition Systems
SO WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB Gesture recognition as a topic in computer science and language technology has the goal of interpreting human gestures via mathematical algorithms. Gestures can originate from any bodily motion or state but commonly originate from the face or hand. Gesture recognition enables humans to communicate with the machine and interact naturally without any mechanical devices. This paper investigates the possibility to use non-audio/video sensors to design a low-cost gesture recognition device that can be connected to any computer on the market. The paper proposes an equation that relates the distance and voltage for a Sharp GP2Y0A21 and GP2D120 sensors in the situation that a hand is used as the reflective object. In the end, the presented system is compared with other audio/video system that exist on the market. Also, future research is shown of a glove-like device for sign-language translation.

TI Dictionary generation for less-frequent language pairs using WordNet
SO LITERARY AND LINGUISTIC COMPUTING
AB Bilingual dictionaries are vital resources in many areas of natural language processing. Numerous methods of machine translation require bilingual dictionaries of large coverage, but less-frequent language pairs rarely have any digitalized resources of such kind. Since the need for these resources is increasing, but the human resources are scarce for less represented languages, efficient automatized methods are imperative. This article presents a fully automated, robust intermediate language-based bilingual dictionary generation method that uses the WordNet of the intermediate language to build a new bilingual dictionary. We propose the usage of WordNet in order to increase accuracy; we also introduce a bidirectional selection method with a flexible threshold to maximize recall. The evaluations showed 79% accuracy and 51% weighted recall, outperforming representative pivot language-based methods. A dictionary generated with this method will still need manual post-editing, but the improved recall and precision decrease the work of human correctors.

TI Robust Understanding in Multimodal Interfaces
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Multimodal grammars provide an effective mechanism for quickly creating integration and understanding capabilities for interactive systems supporting simultaneous use of multiple input modalities. However, like other approaches based on hand-crafted grammars, multimodal grammars can be brittle with respect to unexpected, erroneous, or disfluent input. In this article, we show how the finite-state approach to multimodal language processing can be extended to support multimodal applications combining speech with complex freehand pen input, and evaluate the approach in the context of a multimodal conversational system (MATCH). We explore a range of different techniques for improving the robustness of multimodal integration and understanding. These include techniques for building effective language models for speech recognition when little or no multimodal training data is available, and techniques for robust multimodal understanding that draw on classification, machine translation, and sequence edit methods. We also explore the use of edit-based methods to overcome mismatches between the gesture stream and the speech stream.

AB The Development of effective content-based 3D model retrieval and classification is still an important research issue due to the growing amount of digital information, this paper present a novel 3D model retrieval and classification algorithm. In feature representation, a method combining distance histogram and moment invariants is proposed to improve the retrieval peformance. A major advantage of the distance histogram is its invariance to the transforms of scaling, translation and rotation. Based on the premise that two similar images should have high mutual information, or equivalent v, the querying image should convey high information about those similar to it, this paper proposed a mutual information distance measure to perform the similarity comparison. Multi-class support vector machine performs the classification for it has a very good generalization performance. This paper tested the algorithm with a 3D model retrieval and classification prototype, the experimental evaluation demonstrates the satisfactory retrieval results and good classification accuracy.

TI FeLIX GUATTARI AND THE HIGHWAYS OF MEMORY
SO ANGELAKI-JOURNAL OF THE THEORETICAL HUMANITIES
AB One of the last major works of "French Theory," Felix Guattari's notoriously dense 1989 Schizoanalytic Cartographies (SC) has only recently been made available to English-speaking audiences by Andrew Goffey's 2013 translation. This sudden displacement of Guattari's treatise into the present day provides the ideal opportunity for its place within Guattari's thought, and also within the wider field of post-humanist critical discourse that has developed since its publication, to be reconsidered. I contend that the thread of memory - the storing, recalling, and forgetting of memory-data - serves as both a privileged means of navigating this text's hyper-complexity and of articulating its critical utility. SC offers itself as a framework for thinking through the subject-in-production's complex imbrication in the "age of planetary computerization," one in which there is always a revolving door between the "data" of subjectivity and the "memory" of technical machines.

AB We propose a method for natural language generation, choosing the most representative output rather than the most likely output. By viewing the language generation process from the voting theory perspective, we define representativeness using range voting and a similarity measure. The proposed method can be applied when generating from any probabilistic language model, including n-gram models and neural network models. We evaluate different similarity measures on an image captioning task and a machine translation task, and show that our method generates longer and more diverse sentences, providing a solution to the common problem of short outputs being preferred over longer and more informative ones. The generated sentences obtain higher BLEU scores, particularly when the beam size is large. We also perform a human evaluation on both tasks and find that the outputs generated using our method are rated higher.

AB When using optimization methods with matrix variables in signal processing and machine learning, it is customary to assume some low-rank prior on the targeted solution. Nonnegative matrix factorization of spectrograms is a case in point in audio signal processing. However, this low-rank prior is not straightforwardly related to complex matrices obtained from a short-time Fourier - or discrete Gabor - transform (STFT), which is generally defined from and studied based on a modulation operator and a translation operator applied to a so-called window. This paper is a first study of the low-rankness property of time-frequency matrices. We characterize the set of signals with a rank-r (complex) STFT matrix in the case of a unit hop size and frequency step with few assumptions on the transform parameters. We discuss the scope of this result and its implications on low-rank approximations of STFT matrices.

AB Text simplification (TS) is a monolingual text-to-text transformation task where an original (complex) text is transformed into a target (simpler) text. Most recent work is based on sequence-to-sequence neural models similar to those used for machine translation (MT). Different from MT, TS data comprises more elaborate transformations, such as sentence splitting. It can also contain multiple simplifications of the same original text targeting different audiences, such as school grade levels. We explore these two features of TS to build models tailored for specific grade levels. Our approach uses a standard sequence-to-sequence architecture where the original sequence is annotated with information about the target audience and/or the (predicted) type of simplification operation. We show that it outperforms state-of-the-art TS approaches (up to 3 and 12 BLEU and SARI points, respectively), including when training data for the specific complex-simple combination of grade levels is not available, i.e. zero-shot learning.

Current models for sentence simplification adopted ideas from machine translation studies and implicitly learned simplification mapping rules from normal-imple sentence pairs. In this paper, we explore a novel model based on a multi-layer and multi-head attention architecture and we propose two innovative approaches to integrate the Simple PPDB (A Paraphrase Database for Simplification), an external paraphrase knowledge base for simplification that covers a wide range of real-world simplification rules. The experiments show that the integration provides two major benefits: (1) the integrated model outperforms multiple state-of-the-art baseline models for sentence simplification in the literature (2) through analysis of the rule utilization, the model seeks to select more accurate simplification rules.

AB Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the ability to identify the meaning of words in context in a computational manner. WSD is considered as an AI-complete problem, that is, a task whose solution is at least as hard as the most difficult problems in artificial intelligence. This is basically used in application like information retrieval, machine translation, information extraction because of its semantics understanding. This paper describes the proposed approach (WSD-TIC) which is based on the words surrounding the polysemous word in a context. Each meaning of these words is represented by a vector composed of weighted nouns using taxonomic information content. The main emphasis of this paper is feature selection for disambiguation purpose. The assessment of WSD systems is discussed in the context of the Senseval campaign, aiming at the objective evaluation of our proposal to the systems participating in several different disambiguation tasks.

AB Unsupervised discovery of synonymous phrases is useful in a variety of tasks ranging from text mining and search engines to semantic analysis and machine translation. This paper presents an unsupervised corpus-based conditional model: Near-Synonym System (NeSS) for finding phrasal synonyms and near synonyms that requires only a large monolingual corpus. The method is based on maximizing information-theoretic combinations of shared contexts and is parallelizable for large-scale processing. An evaluation framework with crowd-sourced judgments is proposed and results are compared with alternate methods, demonstrating considerably superior results to the literature and to thesaurus look up for multi-word phrases. Moreover, the results show that the statistical scoring functions and overall scalability of the system are more important than language specific NLP tools. The method is language-independent and practically useable due to accuracy and real-time performance via parallel decomposition.

TI Meta-Learning a Cross-lingual Manifold for Semantic Parsing
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Localizing a semantic parser to support new languages requires effective cross-lingual generalization. Recent work has found success with machine-translation or zero-shot methods, although these approaches can struggle to model how native speakers ask questions. We consider how to effectively leverage minimal annotated examples in new languages for few-shot cross-lingual semantic parsing. We introduce a first-order meta-learning algorithm to train a semantic parser with maximal sample efficiency during cross-lingual transfer. Our algorithm uses high-resource languages to train the parser and simultaneously optimizes for cross-lingual generalization to lower-resource languages. Results across six languages on ATIS demonstrate that our combination of generalization steps yields accurate semantic parsers sampling <= 10% of source training data in each new language. Our approach also trains a competitive model on Spider using English with generalization to Chinese similarly sampling <= 10% of training data.(1)

TI Analysis of the Impact of the Traditional Literature Environment Based
   on Big Data Technology on Overseas Literature
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB To study the influence of conventional literature on foreign literature driven by big data, this essay begins with surveys and interviews. Chinese big data-driven corpora are distinct from other Chinese corpora, as is widely known. Its main objective is to categorize professional corpora that are unknown and fall within the category of professional corpora. In order to provide a straightforward and useful domain partitioning model for corpus texts, this research makes use of text clustering and big data-driven methodologies. We can easily determine the domain of the aligned text, making it easier to do machine translation research in the future. The research findings demonstrate that the accuracy rate of the approach suggested in this article is essentially above 89.79%, demonstrating the viability of the way of automatically building a corpus suggested in this paper in the experiment.

TI Morphological analysis and disambiguation for Breton
SO LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
AB In this paper we present an extended description of two resources for natural language processing of Breton, a morphological analyser and constraint grammar-based disambiguator. The constraint grammar was developed using a novel methodology by a linguist and a language consultant creating rules to solve specific errors in disambiguation in a machine translation system. In addition we introduce a new morphologically-disambiguated corpus of Breton and evaluate both the morphological analyser and constraint grammar for coverage and accuracy. For comparison we use the same corpus to train several reference systems for part-of-speech tagging and lemmatisation and compare the performance. The experiments show that our system outperforms the reference systems by a wide margin when the reference systems are trained without an external full-form list, and performs comparably when they are trained with a full-form list generated from our morphological analyser.

SO ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS
AB Deep Learning (DL) techniques for Natural Language Processing have been evolving remarkably fast. Recently, the DL advances in language modeling, machine translation, and paragraph understanding are so prominent that the potential of DL in Software Engineering cannot be overlooked, especially in the field of program learning. To facilitate further research and applications of DL in this field, we provide a comprehensive review to categorize and investigate existing DL methods for source code modeling and generation. To address the limitations of the traditional source code models, we formulate common program learning tasks under an encoder-decoder framework. After that, we introduce recent DL mechanisms suitable to solve such problems. Then, we present the state-of-the-art practices and discuss their challenges with some recommendations for practitioners and researchers as well.

SO DISCRETE AND CONTINUOUS DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS-SERIES S
AB As a fundamental research in the field of natural language processing, the Uyghur morphological analysis is used mainly to determine the part of speech (POS) and segmental morphemes (stem and affix) of a word in a given sentence, as well as to automatically annotate the grammatical function of the morphemes based on the context. It is necessary to provide various information for other tasks of natural language processing including syntactic analysis, machine translation, automatic summarization, and semantic analysis, etc. In order to increase the morphological analysis efficiency, this paper puts forward a hybrid approach to create a statistical model for Uyghur morphological tagging through a small-scale corpus. Experimental results show that this plan can obtain an overall accuracy of 92.58% with a limited training corpus.

TI Paraphrasing Method Based on Contextual Synonym Substitution
SO JOURNAL OF ICT RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
AB Generating paraphrases is an important component of natural language processing and generation. There are several applications that use paraphrasing, for example linguistic steganography, recommender systems, machine translation, etc. One method for paraphrasing sentences is by using synonym substitution, such as the NGM-based paraphrasing method proposed by Gadag et al. The weakness of this method is that ambiguous meanings frequently occur because the paraphrasing process is based solely on n-gram. This negatively affects the naturalness of the paraphrased sentences. For overcoming this problem, a contextual synonym substitution method is proposed, which aims to increase the naturalness of the paraphrased sentences. Using the proposed method, the paraphrasing process is not only based on n-gram but also on the context of the sentence such that the naturalness is increased. Based on the experimental result, the sentences generated using the proposed method had higher naturalness than the sentences generated using the original method.

AB We propose FFTX, a new framework for building high-performance FFT-based applications on exascale machines. Complex node architectures lead to multiple levels of parallelism and demand efficient ways of data communication. The current FFTW interface falls short in maximizing performance in such scenarios. FFTX is designed to enable application developers to leverage expert-level, automatic optimizations while navigating a familiar interface. FFTX is backwards compatible to FFTW and extends the FFTW Interface into an embedded Domain Specific Language (DSL) expressed as a library interface. By means of a SPIRAL-based back end, this enables build-time source-to-source translation and advanced performance optimizations, such as cross-library calls optimizations, targeting of accelerators through offloading, and inlining of user-provided kernels. We demonstrate the use of FFTX with the prototypical example of 1D and 3D pruned convolutions and discuss future extensions.

AB Convolution layers are prevalent in many classes of deep neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which provide state-of-the-art results for tasks like image recognition, neural machine translation and speech recognition. The computationally expensive nature of a convolution operation has led to the proliferation of implementations including matrix-matrix multiplication formulation, and direct convolution primarily targeting GPUs. In this paper, we introduce direct convolution kernels for x86 architectures, in particular for Xeon and Xeon Phi systems, which are implemented via a dynamic compilation approach. Our JIT-based implementation shows close to theoretical peak performance, depending on the setting and the CPU architecture at hand. We additionally demonstrate how these JIT-optimized kernels can be integrated into a lightweight multi-node graph execution model. This illustrates that single- and multi-node runs yield high efficiencies and high image-throughputs when executing state-of-the-art image recognition tasks on CPUs.

AB Precise evaluation metrics are important for assessing progress in high-level language generation tasks such as machine translation or image captioning. Historically, these metrics have been evaluated using correlation with human judgment. However, human-derived scores are often alarmingly inconsistent and are also limited in their ability to identify precise areas of weakness. In this paper, we perform a case study for metric evaluation by measuring the effect that systematic sentence transformations (e.g. active to passive voice) have on the automatic metric scores. These sentence "corruptions" serve as unit tests for precisely measuring the strengths and weaknesses of a given metric. We find that not only are human annotations heavily inconsistent in this study, but that the Metric Unit TesT analysis is able to capture precise shortcomings of particular metrics (e.g. comparing passive and active sentences) better than a simple correlation with human judgment can.

TI The complexity of one-agent refinement modal logic
SO THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB We investigate the complexity of satisfiability for one-agent refinement modal logic (RML), a known extension of basic modal logic (ML) obtained by adding refinement quantifiers on structures. It is known that RML has the same expressiveness as ML, but the translation of RML into ML is of non-elementary complexity, and RML is at least doubly exponentially more succinct than ML. In this paper, we show that RML-satisfiability is 'only' singly exponentially harder than ML-satisfiability, the latter being a well-known PSPACE-complete problem. More precisely, we establish that RML-satisfiability is complete for the complexity class AEXP(pol), i.e., the class of problems solvable by alternating Turing machines running in single exponential time but only with a polynomial number of alternations (note that NEXPTIME subset of AEXP(pol) subset of EXPSPACE).(1) (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Implementing efficient communication and I/O mechanisms in Java requires both fast access to low-level system resources (such as network and raw disk interfaces) and direct manipulation of memory regions external to the Java heap (such as communication and I/O buffers). Java native methods are too expensive to perform these operations and raise serious protection concerns, We present Jaguar, a new mechanism that provides Java applications with efficient access to system resources while retaining the protection of the Java environment. This is accomplished through compile-time translation of certain Java bytecodes to inlined machine code segments, We demonstrate the use of Jaguar through a Java interface to the VIA fast communications layer, which achieves nearly identical performance to that of C, and Pre-Serialized Objects, a mechanism which greatly reduces the cost of Java object serialization, Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Comparing transfer learning to feature optimization in microstructure
   classification
SO ISCIENCE
AB Human analysis of research data is slow and inefficient. In recent years, machine learning tools have advanced our capability to perform tasks normally carried out by humans, such as image segmentation and classification. In this work, we seek to further improve binary classification models for high-throughput identification of different microstructural morphologies. We utilize a dataset with limited observations (133 dendritic structures, 444 non-dendritic) and employ data augmentation via rotation and translation to enhance the dataset six-fold. Then, transfer learning is carried out using pre-trained networks VGG16, InceptionV3, and Xception achieving only moderate F1 scores (0.801-0.822). We hypothesize that feature engineering could yield better results than transfer learning alone. To test this, we employ a new nature-inspired feature optimization algorithm, the Binary Red Deer Algorithm (BRDA), to carry out binary classification and observe F1 scores in the range of 0.96.

AB Grammatical error correction (GEC) has been successful with deep and complex neural machine translation models, but the annotated data to train the model are scarce. We propose a novel self-feeding training method that generates incorrect sentences from freely available correct sentences. The proposed training method can generate appropriate wrong sentences from unlabeled sentences, using a data generation model trained as an autoencoder. It can also add artificial noise to correct sentences to automatically generate incorrect sentences. We show that the GEC models trained with the self-feeding training method are successful without extra annotated data or deeper neural network-based models, achieving F-0.5 score of 0.5982 on the CoNLL-2014 Shared Task test data with a transformer model. The results also show that fully unlabeled training is possible for data-scarce domains and languages.

SO JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING
AB Most detection methods of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) use classic image classification models, which have problems of low recognition accuracy and inaccurate capture of modal features when detecting chest X-rays of COVID-19. This study proposes a COVID-19 detection method based on image modal feature fusion. This method first performs small-sample enhancement processing on chest X-rays, such as rotation, translation, and random transformation. Five classic pretraining models are used when extracting modal features. A global average pooling layer reduces training parameters and prevents overfitting. The model is trained and fine-tuned, the machine learning evaluation standard is used to evaluate the model, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is drawn. Experiments show that compared with the classic model, the classification method in this study can more effectively detect COVID-19 image modal information, and it achieves the expected effect of accurately detecting cases.

The combination of availability of recent datasets and advances in computer vision made through deep learning paved the way toward automated satellite image translation. To facilitate research in this direction, we introduce the Satellite Imagery Competition using a modified SpaceNet dataset.

In this work, we present five approaches based on improvements of U-Net and Mask R-Convolutional Neuronal Networks models, coupled with unique training adaptations using boosting algorithms, morphological filter, Conditional Random Fields and custom losses. The good results-as high as AP = 0.937 and AR = 0.959-from these models demonstrate the feasibility of Deep Learning in automated satellite image annotation.

In order to analyze a kind of permanent and imperceptible supervision, coupled with the proper functioning of a system, we propose reflections upon the contemporary ramifications of the panopticon considering the paradoxical central positioning of a guarded tower coated in invisibility, as postulated by Bentham. In the virtual daily life, technologically crossed by hyperconnectivity, the categorizing observation, to which the users are subject as they accept the terms of service, indicates the use of classification machines in the constitution of databases.

These layers capture uncertainty over weights (Bayesian neural nets), pre-activation units (dropout), activations ("stochastic output layers"), or the function itself (Gaussian processes). They can also be reversible to propagate uncertainty from input to output. We include code examples for common architectures such as Bayesian LSTMs, deep GPs, and flow-based models. As demonstration, we fit a 5-billion parameter "Bayesian Transformer" on 512 TPUv2 cores for uncertainty in machine translation and a Bayesian dynamics model for model-based planning. Finally, we show how Bayesian Layers can be used within the Edward2 language for probabilistic programming with stochastic processes.(1)

TI Efficient probabilistic grammar induction for design
SO AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND
   MANUFACTURING
AB The use of grammars in design and analysis has been set back by the lack of automated ways to induce them from arbitrarily structured datasets. Machine translation methods provide a construct for inducing grammars from coded data which have been extended to be used for design through pre-coded design data. This work introduces a four-step process for inducing grammars from un-coded structured datasets which can constitute a wide variety of data types, including many used in the design. The method includes: (1) extracting objects from the data, (2) forming structures from objects, (3) expanding structures into rules based on frequency, and (4) finding rule similarities that lead to consolidation or abstraction. To evaluate this method, grammars are induced from generated data, architectural layouts and three-dimensional design models to demonstrate that this method offers usable grammars automatically which are functionally similar to grammars produced by hand.

A striking characteristic of Scielo is that many of its full-text contents are presented in more than one language, thus being a potential source of parallel corpora. In this article, we present the development of a parallel corpus from Scielo in three languages: English, Portuguese, and Spanish. Sentences were automatically aligned using the Hunalign algorithm for all language pairs, and for a subset of trilingual articles also. We demonstrate the capabilities of our corpus by training a Statistical Machine Translation system (Moses) for each language pair, which outperformed related works on scientific articles. Sentence alignment was also manually evaluated, presenting an average of 98.8% correctly aligned sentences across all languages. Our parallel corpus is freely available in the TMX format, with complementary information regarding article metadata.

AB A key problem in structured output prediction is direct optimization of the task reward function that matters for test evaluation. This paper presents a simple and computationally efficient approach to incorporate task reward into a maximum likelihood framework. By establishing a link between the log-likelihood and expected reward objectives, we show that an optimal regularized expected reward is achieved when the conditional distribution of the outputs given the inputs is proportional to their exponentiated scaled rewards. Accordingly, we present a framework to smooth the predictive probability of the outputs using their corresponding rewards. We optimize the conditional log-probability of augmented outputs that are sampled proportionally to their exponentiated scaled rewards. Experiments on neural sequence to sequence models for speech recognition and machine translation show notable improvements over a maximum likelihood baseline by using reward augmented maximum likelihood (RML), where the rewards are defined as the negative edit distance between the outputs and the ground truth labels.

AB Whereas deep neural networks were first mostly used for classification tasks, they are rapidly expanding in the realm of structured output problems, where the observed target is composed of multiple random variables that have a rich joint distribution, given the input. In this paper we focus on the case where the input also has a rich structure and the input and output structures are somehow related. We describe systems that learn to attend to different places in the input, for each element of the output, for a variety of tasks: machine translation, image caption generation, video clip description, and speech recognition. All these systems are based on a shared set of building blocks: gated recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks, along with trained attention mechanisms. We report on experimental results with these systems, showing impressively good performance and the advantage of the attention mechanism.

AB Recurrent Neural Networks can be trained to produce sequences of tokens given some input, as exemplified by recent results in machine translation and image captioning. The current approach to training them consists of maximizing the likelihood of each token in the sequence given the current (recurrent) state and the previous token. At inference, the unknown previous token is then replaced by a token generated by the model itself. This discrepancy between training and inference can yield errors that can accumulate quickly along the generated sequence. We propose a curriculum learning strategy to gently change the training process from a fully guided scheme using the true previous token, towards a less guided scheme which mostly uses the generated token instead. Experiments on several sequence prediction tasks show that this approach yields significant improvements. Moreover, it was used succesfully in our winning entry to the MSCOCO image captioning challenge, 2015.

AB The paper discusses several issues concerning the lexicon within a psycholinguistic pragmatic model of language which takes into account both use and competence. Besides semantic information entailed in the word meaning, the lexicon also includes the semantic relations. Therefore, the logical line of research should combine the pragmatic perspective with a model of language competence and language use which would assume that the semantic relations among words must be represented in the lexicon with other knowledge of words, i.e. we need an otology for the lexicon, seen as a non-linguistic object that more-directly represents the world, providing an interpretation or grounding of word senses. This kind of approach is to be used in machine translation and other multilingual applications where a mapping like this could act as an interlingua, enabling the words in one language to be interpreted in another.

TI Kinematic design of large displacement precision XY positioning stage by
   using cross strip flexure joints and over-constrained mechanism
SO MECHANISM AND MACHINE THEORY
AB Flexures are widely used in precision machines since they offer frictionless, particle-free, and low maintenance operation, and they provide extremely high resolution. A large displacement precision XY positioning stage is designed by using cross strip flexure joints. An over-constrained mechanism is used to incorporate symmetry to cancel out the effects of center shifting in large-motion flexures. Advanced kinematic techniques such as screw system theory are used to achieve a good kinematic design. Existing flexure-based translation stages usually have motion range to size ratios of less than 0.01 as compared to 0.25 or higher in this research. It is believed that large-motion flexure-based XY stages can be a cost-effective solution for semiconductor applications, particularly the ones that operate in vacuum. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recursive matrix relations for kinematics and dynamics of the HALF parallel manipulator are presented in this paper. The prototype of this robot is a spatial mechanism with revolute actuators, which has two translation degrees of freedom and one rotation degree of freedom. The parallel manipulator consists of a base plate, a movable platform and a system of three connecting legs, having wide application in the fields of industrial robots, simulators, parallel machine tools and any other manipulating devices where high mobility is required. Supposing that the position and the motion of the moving platform are known, an inverse dynamics problem is solved using the principle of virtual powers. Finally, some iterative matrix relations and graphs of the torques and powers for all actuators are analysed and determined. It is shown that this approach is an effective means for kinematics and dynamics modelling of parallel mechanisms.

AB Erlang is a concurrent functional programming language with explicit support for real-time and fault-tolerant distributed systems. Generic components encapsulated as design patterns are provided by the Open Telecom Platform (OTP) library. Although Erlang has many high-level features, verification is still non-trivial. One (existing) approach is to perform an abstraction of an Erlang program into the process algebra mu CRL, upon which standard verification tools can be applied. In this paper we extend this work and propose a model that supports the translation of an OTP finite state machine design pattern into a mu CRL specification. Then a standard toolset such as CADP can be applied in order to check properties that should hold for the system under development. Two small examples are presented, which experimentally show how the proposed model assists in model checking Erlang OTP components in mu CRL.

AB The protocol described here is an adapted version of the toeprinting assay in which the oligonucleotide used to prime the reverse transcription step is labeled with a fluorescent dye instead of P-32. By using a fluorescent dye, the results of the assay arc obtained within one hour by direct electrophoresis of the samples on an automated sequencing machine. This eliminates the need to cast and run polyacrylamide gels and to wait to expose dried gels. We show that an identical toeprint was found for the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase transcript using this nonradioactive Method, which is in agreement with the previously published P-32-labeled method. Furthermore, in addition to being a faster and safer method, a larger region of sequence can be analyzed with one primer in a single experiment.

AB We present an LFG syntax-semantics interface for the semiautomatic annotation of frame semantic roles for German in the SALSA project. The architecture is intended to support a bootstrapping cycle for the acquisition of stochastic models for frame semantic role assignment, starting from manual annotations on the basis of the syntactically annotated TIGER treebank, with smooth transition to automatic syntactic analysis and (semi-) automatic semantic annotation of a much larger corpus, on top of a free-running LFG grammar of German. Our study investigates the applicability of the LFG formalism for modeling frame semantic role annotation, and designs a flexible and extensible syntax-semantics architecture that supports the induction of stochastic models for automatic frame assignment. We propose a method familiar from example-based Machine Translation to translate between the TIGER and LFG annotation formats, thus enabling the transition from treebank annotation to large-scale corpus processing.

AB Currently, image retrieval system are based on low level features of color, texture and shape, not on the semantic descriptions that are common to humans, such as objects, people, and place. In order to narrow down the gap between the low level and semantic level, in this study, we describe an efficient and effective image similarity calculation method for image comparison at object classes. It is not only suitable for images with single objects, but also for images containing multiple and partially occluded objects. In this approach, a machine learning algorithm is used to predict the classes of each of object-contour segments. The similarity measure between two images is been computed using Euclidean distance between images in the k-dimensional space. Experimental results show that this approach is effective, and is invariant to rotation, scaling, and translation of objects.

AB Residual networks are an Euler discretization of solutions to Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). This paper explores a deeper relationship between Transformer and numerical ODE methods. We first show that a residual block of layers in Transformer can be described as a higher-order solution to ODE. Inspired by this, we design a new architecture, ODE Transformer, which is analogous to the Runge-Kutta method that is well motivated in ODE. As a natural extension to Transformer, ODE Transformer is easy to implement and efficient to use. Experimental results on the large-scale machine translation, abstractive summarization, and grammar error correction tasks demonstrate the high genericity of ODE Transformer. It can gain large improvements in model performance over strong baselines (e.g., 30.77 and 44.11 BLEU scores on the WMT'14 English-German and English-French benchmarks) at a slight cost in inference efficiency.

AB The evolution of language follows the rule of gradual change. Grammar, vocabulary, and lexical semantic shifts take place over time, resulting in a diachronic linguistic gap. As such, a considerable amount of texts are written in languages of different eras, which creates obstacles for natural language processing tasks, such as word segmentation and machine translation. Although the Chinese language has a long history, previous Chinese natural language processing research has primarily focused on tasks within a specific era. Therefore, we propose a cross-era learning framework for Chinese word segmentation (CWS), CROSSWISE, which uses the Switch-memory (SM) module to incorporate era-specific linguistic knowledge. Experiments on four corpora from different eras show that the performance of each corpus significantly improves. Further analyses also demonstrate that the SM can effectively integrate the knowledge of the eras into the neural network.

TI Knowledge Graph Embedding Based on Multi-View Clustering Framework
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
AB Knowledge representation is one of the critical problems in knowledge engineering and artificial intelligence, while knowledge embedding as a knowledge representation methodology indicates entities and relations in knowledge graph as low-dimensional, continuous vectors. In this way, knowledge graph is compatible with numerical machine learning models. Major knowledge embedding methods employ geometric translation to design score function, which is weak-semantic for natural language processing. To overcome this disadvantage, in this paper, we propose our model based on multi-view clustering framework, which could generate semantic representations of knowledge elements (i.e., entities/relations). With our semantic model, we also present an empowered solution to entity retrieval with entity description. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves substantial improvements against baselines on the task of knowledge graph completion, triple classification, entity classification, and entity retrieval.

AB Transformer is an attention-based neural network, which consists of two sublayers, namely, Self-Attention Network (SAN) and FeedForward Network (FFN). Existing research explores to enhance the two sublayers separately to improve the capability of Transformer for text representation. In this paper, we present a novel understanding of SAN and FFN as Mask Attention Networks (MANs) and show that they are two special cases of MANs with static mask matrices. However, their static mask matrices limit the capability for localness modeling in text representation learning. We therefore introduce a new layer named dynamic mask attention network (DMAN) with a learnable mask matrix which is able to model localness adaptively. To incorporate advantages of DMAN, SAN, and FFN, we propose a sequential layered structure to combine the three types of layers. Extensive experiments on various tasks, including neural machine translation and text summarization demonstrate that our model outperforms the original Transformer.

While modifying the pretrained models via fine-tuning remains the popular approach, it incurs a significant computational cost and can be infeasible due to lack of appropriate data. As an alternative, we propose MUCOCO-a flexible and modular algorithm for controllable inference from pretrained models. We formulate the decoding process as an optimization problem which allows for multiple attributes we aim to control to be easily incorporated as differentiable constraints to the optimization. By relaxing this discrete optimization to a continuous one, we make use of Lagrangian multipliers and gradient-descent based techniques to generate the desired text. We evaluate our approach on controllable machine translation and style transfer with multiple sentence-level attributes and observe significant improvements over baselines.(1)

AB We solve the fNIRS left/right hand force decoding problem using a data-driven approach by using a convolutional neural network architecture, the HemCNN. We test HemCNN's decoding capabilities to decode in a streaming way the hand, left or right, from fNIRS data. HemCNN learned to detect which hand executed a grasp at a naturalistic hand action speed of 1 Hz, outperforming standard methods. Since HemCNN does not require baseline correction and the convolution operation is invariant to time translations, our method can help to unlock fNIRS for a variety of real-time tasks. Mobile brain imaging and mobile brain machine interfacing can benefit from this to develop real-world neuroscience and practical human neural interfacing based on BOLD-like signals for the evaluation, assistance and rehabilitation of force generation, such as fusion of fNIRS with EEG signals.

AB Lexical ambiguity, a challenging phenomenon in all natural languages, is particularly prevalent for languages with diacritics that tend to be omitted in writing, such as Arabic. Omitting diacritics leads to an increase in the number of homographs: different words with the same spelling. Diacritic restoration could theoretically help disambiguate these words, but in practice, the increase in overall sparsity leads to performance degradation in NLP applications. In this paper, we propose approaches for automatically marking a subset of words for diacritic restoration, which leads to selective homograph disambiguation. Compared to full or no diacritic restoration, these approaches yield selectively-diacritized datasets that balance sparsity and lexical disambiguation. We evaluate the various selection strategies extrinsically on several downstream applications: neural machine translation, part-of-speech tagging, and semantic textual similarity. Our experiments on Arabic show promising results, where our devised strategies on selective diacritization lead to a more balanced and consistent performance in downstream applications.

With the design goals of modularity, versatility, and extensibility in mind, Texar extracts common patterns underlying the diverse tasks and methodologies, creates a library of highly reusable modules and functionalities, and allows arbitrary model architectures and algorithmic paradigms. In Texar, model architecture, inference, and learning processes are properly decomposed. Modules at a high concept level can be freely assembled or plugged in/swapped out. Texar is thus particularly suitable for researchers and practitioners to do fast prototyping and experimentation. The versatile toolkit also fosters technique sharing across different text generation tasks. Texar supports both TensorFlow and PyTorch, and is released under Apache License 2.0 at https://www.texar.io.(1)

TI Defining Textual Entailment
SO JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Textual entailment is a relationship that obtains between fragments of text when one fragment in some sense implies the other fragment. The automation of textual entailment recognition supports a wide variety of text-based tasks, including information retrieval, information extraction, question answering, text summarization, and machine translation. Much ingenuity has been devoted to developing algorithms for identifying textual entailments, but relatively little to saying what textual entailment actually is. This article is a review of the logical and philosophical issues involved in providing an adequate definition of textual entailment. We show that many natural definitions of textual entailment are refuted by counterexamples, including the most widely cited definition of Dagan et al. We then articulate and defend the following revised definition: T textually entails H = (df) typically, a human reading T would be justified in inferring the proposition expressed by H from the proposition expressed by T. We also show that textual entailment is context-sensitive, nontransitive, and nonmonotonic.

AB Semantic vectors, or language embeddings, are used in computational linguistics to represent language for a variety of machine related tasks including translation, speech to text, and natural language understanding. These semantic vectors have also been extensively studied in correlation with human brain data, showing evidence that the representation of language in the human brain can be modeled through these vectors with high correlation. Further, various attempts have been made to study how the human brain represents and understands music. For example, it has been shown that EEG data of subjects listening to music can be used for tempo detection and singer gender recognition. We propose studying the relationship between the EEG data of subjects listening to audio and the audio feature vectors modeled after the semantic vectors in computational linguistics. This could provide new insight into how the brain processes and understands music.

In this paper, we focus on virtual dressing, which is a newly heated application of human-computer interaction, and develop a novel framework for real-time virtual dressing. We made three major contributions in our framework: 1) We introduce an effective algorithm to pre-process and improve the skeleton data from an RGB-D camera; 2) We develop a strategy to measure the skeleton motion parameters (scaling, translation and rotation) and apply a two-step deforming scheme specific to create dress deformation results. 3) We introduce hand-integration module to integrate the clothing models and user arms, so as to guarantee user arms being properly displayed in the visual dressing result. Experimental results show that our proposed virtual dressing system achieves satisfactory visual dressing results.(1)

TI Enriching short text representation in microblog for clustering
SO FRONTIERS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Social media websites allow users to exchange short texts such as tweets via microblogs and user status in friendship networks. Their limited length, pervasive abbreviations, and coined acronyms and words exacerbate the problems of synonymy and polysemy, and bring about new challenges to data mining applications such as text clustering and classification. To address these issues, we dissect some potential causes and devise an efficient approach that enriches data representation by employing machine translation to increase the number of features from different languages. Then we propose a novel framework which performs multi-language knowledge integration and feature reduction simultaneously through matrix factorization techniques. The proposed approach is evaluated extensively in terms of effectiveness on two social media datasets from Facebook and Twitter. With its significant performance improvement, we further investigate potential factors that contribute to the improved performance.

AB This paper initially discusses models in manufacturing, then processes in the product industry and finally processes in the construction industry. Although numerical control in machining was introduced in the 1950s, CAE/CAM in the 1970s, and rapid prototyping in the mid 1980s, their use in the construction industry is quite recent. Our research verified that words like mock-up, prototype and product have well established meanings, both in general terms and particularly in manufacturing. Also that, manufacturing processes cannot be simply classified as additive or subtractive. And that the type of physical model produced isn't determined by the type of manufacturing technology. This text uses English as a basis for putting forward correct terminology and classification structures for processes and models, mainly because texts from its language communities, especially the construction industry, present fewer errors. Translations to other languages are given when necessary.

Our second objective was to obtain a better picture of the relative merit of various search engines when processing documents in those languages. To do so we evaluated our scheme using two probabilistic models and five vector-processing approaches. In the bilingual track, we evaluated both the machine translation and bilingual dictionary approaches applied to automatically translate a query submitted in English into various target languages. Finally, using the GIRT corpora (available in English, German and Russian), we investigated the variations in retrieval effectiveness that resulted when we included or excluded manually assigned keywords attached to the bibliographic records (mainly comprising a title and an abstract).

AB In visual surveillance applications, it is becoming popular to perceive video images and to interpret them using natural language concepts. In this paper we propose a new approach to generate natural language description of human behavior appeared in real video images. First, a head region of a human, on behalf of the whole body, is extracted from each frames. Using a model based method, three dimensional pose and position of the head are estimated. Next, the trajectory of these parameters is divided into segments of monotonous motions. For each segment, we evaluate conceptual features such as degree of change of pose and position and that of relative distance to some objects in the surroundings, and so on. By calculating product of these feature values, a most suitable verb is selected and other syntactic elements are supplied. Finally natural language text is generated using technique of machine translation.

AB The vast majority of successful deep neural networks are trained using variants of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms. Recent attempts to improve SGD can be broadly categorized into two approaches: (1) adaptive learning rate schemes, such as AdaGrad and Adam, and (2) accelerated schemes, such as heavy-ball and Nesterov momentum. In this paper, we propose a new optimization algorithm, Lookahead, that is orthogonal to these previous approaches and iteratively updates two sets of weights. Intuitively, the algorithm chooses a search direction by looking ahead at the sequence of "fast weights" generated by another optimizer. We show that Lookahead improves the learning stability and lowers the variance of its inner optimizer with negligible computation and memory cost. We empirically demonstrate Lookahead can significantly improve the performance of SGD and Adam, even with their default hyperparameter settings on ImageNet, CIFAR-10/100, neural machine translation, and Penn Treebank.

The neural model which is regenerative, is created. It depends on computer vision and machine translation. This model is used to generate natural sentences which eventually describes the image. This model consists of Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) as well as Recurrent Neural Network(RNN). The CNN is used for feature extraction from image and RNN is used for sentence generation. The model is trained in such a way that if input image is given to model it generates captions which nearly describes the image. The accuracy of model and smoothness or command of language model learns from image descriptions is tested on different datasets. These experiments show that model is frequently giving accurate descriptions for an input image.

AB Self-attention - an attention mechanism where the input and output sequence lengths are the same - has recently been successfully applied to machine translation, caption generation, and phoneme recognition. In this paper we apply a restricted self-attention mechanism (with multiple heads) to speech recognition. By "restricted" we mean that the mechanism at a particular frame only sees input from a limited number of frames to the left and right. Restricting the context makes it easier to encode the position of the input - we use a 1-hot encoding of the frame offset. We try introducing attention layers into TDNN architectures, and replacing LSTM layers with attention layers in TDNN+LSTM architectures. We show experiments on a number of ASR setups. We observe improvements compared to the TDNN and TDNN+LSTM baselines. Attention layers are also faster than LSTM layers in test time, since they lack recurrence.

AB Concentric tube robots comprise telescopic pre-curved elastic tubes. The robot's tip and shape are controlled via relative tube motions, i.e. tube rotations and translations. Non-linear interactions between the tubes, e.g. friction and torsion, as well as uncertainty in the physical properties of the tubes themselves, e.g. the Young's modulus, curvature, or stiffness, hinder accurate kinematic modelling. In this paper, we present a machine-learning-based methodology for kinematic modelling of concentric tube robots and in situ model adaptation. Our approach is based on Locally Weighted Projection Regression (LWPR). The model comprises an ensemble of linear models, each of which locally approximates the original complex kinematic relation. LWPR can accommodate for model deviations by adjusting the respective local models at run-time, resulting in an adaptive kinematics framework. We evaluated our approach on data gathered from a three-tube robot, and report high accuracy across the robot's configuration space.

AB Multilingual multi-document summarization is a task to generate the summary in target language from a collection of documents in multiple source languages. A straightforward approach to this task is automatically translating the non-target language documents into target language and then applying monolingual summarization methods, but the summaries generated by this method is often poorly readable due to the low quality of machine translation. To solve this problem, we propose a novel graph model based on guided edge weighting method in which both informativeness and readability of summaries are taken into consideration fully. In methodology, our model attempts to choose from the target language documents the sentences which contain important shared information across languages, and also retains the salient sentences which cannot be covered by documents in other language. The experimental results on our manually labeled dataset (It will be released to the public.) show that our method significantly outperforms other baseline methods.

AB This paper presents comparative experiment results of code mixed data with the normal text. We first identify the Languages present in social media text, in the case of code mixed data existing language detector fails to detect language at the word level because of the use of roman script to write their own language. So we bootstrap language identification step and we caluculate the Code Mixe Index to show the amount of code mix in the corpora. We use the RNNLM to create a language model of code mixed data as well as pen tree bank data. We use the model to evaluate the similarity of code mixed data and open tree bank data. Using Perplexity measure we show that the code mixed data of Indian social media very less similarity to the normal data.

TI Optimization Algorithms and Applications for Speech and Language
   Processing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Optimization techniques have been used for many years in the formulation and solution of computational problems arising in speech and language processing. Such techniques are found in the Baum-Welch, extended Baum-Welch (EBW), Rprop, and GIS algorithms, for example. Additionally, the use of regularization terms has been seen in other applications of sparse optimization. This paper outlines a range of problems in which optimization formulations and algorithms play a role, giving some additional details on certain application problems in machine translation, speaker/language recognition, and automatic speech recognition. Several approaches developed in the speech and language processing communities are described in a way that makes them more recognizable as optimization procedures. Our survey is not exhaustive and is complemented by other papers in this volume.

TI Minimally supervised question classification on fine-grained taxonomies
SO KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB This article presents a minimally supervised approach to question classification on fine-grained taxonomies. We have defined an algorithm that automatically obtains lists of weighted terms for each class in the taxonomy, thus identifying which terms are highly related to the classes and are highly discriminative between them. These lists have then been applied to the task of question classification. Our approach is based on the divergence of probability distributions of terms in plain text retrieved from the Web. A corpus of questions with which to train the classifier is not therefore necessary. As the system is based purely on statistical information, it does not require additional linguistic resources or tools. The experiments were performed on English questions and their Spanish translations. The results reveal that our system surpasses current supervised approaches in this task, obtaining a significant improvement in the experiments carried out.

TI A Top-Down Chart Parser for Analyzing Arabic Sentences
SO INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Parsing of Arabic sentences is a necessary mechanism for many natural language processing applications such as machine translation, question answering, knowledge extraction and information retrieval. In this study, we present a top-down chart parser for parsing simple Arabic sentences, including nominal and verbal sentences within specific domain Arabic grammar. We used the Context Free Grammar (CFGs) to represent the Arabic grammar. We first developed the Arabic grammar rules that give precise description of grammatical sentences. Then, we implemented the parser that assigns grammatical structure to the input sentence. The parser is tested on sentences extracted from real documents. Experimental results showed the effectiveness of the proposed top-down chart parser for parsing modern standard Arabic sentences. From a practical perspective, the parser is able to satisfy syntactic constraints and reduce parsing ambiguity.

AB The common use of null arguments is one of the most critical issues in pro-drop languages. When translating Korean into other languages, the omitted elements should be replaced with appropriate pronouns to get grammatical target sentences. One of the most important issues when dealing with zero pronouns is to determine the referentiality of zero pronouns. Since, like expletive 'it' in English, omitted elements do not have always explicit referents, it is important to determine whether a zero pronoun is referential or not. In this paper, we focus on identifying non-referential zero pronouns. Since non-referential zero pronouns are likely to occur in similar contexts, referentiality determination in this paper is regarded as the identification of clauses containing non-referential zero pronouns. Our method outperforms the baseline systems using n-grams and bag of words, and achieves the F-measure of 0.51 and 0.78.

AB This paper presents a set of rules which form the prototype lexical selection component of a rifle-based machine translation system between two closely-related minority languages, North Sami and Lule Sami. While the languages have comprehensive monolingual computational linguistic resources, they lack bilingual resources. One-to-one relations in the lexicon dominate, but there are also more complex relations that require lexical selection using both lexical and syntactico-semantic context. An evaluation was performed over a set of 11 word pairs, which shows that constructing lexical selection rules and doing research on a North Sami Lule Sami contrastive lexicon is an interrelated process. Other lesser-resourced language pairs will benefit from the use of lexical selection rules as the relevance of lexical selection increases with the divergence of the languages.

TI Investigation of iron containers for storage of hydrogen gas -
   Translation of the Adolf Martens' spectacular failure investigation
   report published in 1896
SO ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS
AB More than 400 iron hydrogen storage containers (also called bottles or cylinders exploded on the air strip Berlin-Tempelhof on May 25, 1894, leaving immense destruction. The Royal Prussian Materials Testing Institute was requested to investigate the material properties and to furnish an expertise, how an increased safety of such cylinders might be achieved for the future under protection of the interests of the air ship service, as for instance by improvement of delivery specifications or respective material inspections.
   The studies conducted personally by the director Prof. Adolf Martens and his deputy Prof. M. Rudeloff represent one of the first comprehensive failure case investigations in history and initiated BAMs long tradition in failure analysis. Martens and his colleague elaborated quite detailed specimen plans and investigated original failure parts with a special emphasis on conspicuous fracture appearance, but also made comparison experiments with hardened as well as annealed samples. Experienced investigators might identify some first routines how to conduct failure analyses and the importance of Adolf Martens as a pioneer in this field becomes evident.
   Martens publications about the original expertise Martens, 1896 [1,2] include detailed descriptions about the experimental procedures and specimen preparation. Also, quite modern materials testing technologies and machines have been utilized, as for instance light microscopy as well as the tensile testing machines developed by Werder and Pohlmeyer. As special features developed by Martens, precision strain measurements have been applied during respective tensile tests and the so-called micro-photographic apparatus has been adopted to produce photos of the investigated microstructures. Additionally, the publications contain at that time very valuable advices regarding appropriate materials selection for gas storage cylinders.
   The present contribution provides a nearly complete and as exact as possible translation of the original report Martens, 1896 [1] written in Old German language. Only little changes have been made in the text for a better understanding. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A privacy notice is a short descriptive statement that describes to users how their information is used and why?. When a mobile application uses any personal information of the user, such as location, it must provide them with a privacy notice. However, creating concise and accurate privacy notices with each update to an application is a challenging task. Previous efforts have focused on creating these notices through questionnaires or predefined templates which do not make application source code traceable with privacy notices. Lack of traceability between source code and privacy notices leads to inconsistencies and inaccuracies. In this paper, we discuss our approach to creating privacy captions, short sentences that describe how and why users' personal information is used. by translating the application's source code. In this work, we explain our plan to implement our approach and demonstrate the steps we have implemented so far.

Modern biotechnology, i.e. bioengineering and in particular 3D-bioprinting raises the hope of improving the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The goal of 3D-bioprinting is to transfer the advantages of fast, precise and reproducible instant machine fabrication, as known from industry, to living complex structures and to subsequently further cultivate the resulting tissue composites and organoids in a bioreactor. Three of the most common bioprinting methods, i.e. injection-based bioprinting, laser-based bioprinting and extrusion-based bioprinting, are described and their potential application in cardiovascular medicine is discussed. Furthermore, the current and future possibilities of 3D-bioprinting in cardiovascular medicine are highlighted in this article.

TI A Survey on Heliumspeech Communications in Saturation Diving

AB With the development of society and the progress of technology, more and more ocean activities are carried out. It results in booming of deep-sea diving. The use of helium-oxygen mixture (as a kind of breathing gas) solves the physiological problems of divers in saturated diving, but it brings about the Heliumspeech voice communication problem, the drop of speech intelligibility. There is no doubt that the effective speech communication must be provided for supporting the life and work of divers in deep-sea. This paper describes the mechanism of forming helium-speech, discusses the effects of pressure and helium environment on the speech spectrum, compares the pros and cons of the time-domain and frequency-domain unscrambling techniques, shows the challenges in heliumspeech communications. Finally, it briefly introduces the deep learning, and points out that deep learning/machine learning may be a perfectly unscrambling technique.

TI The role of image representations in vision to language tasks
SO NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING
AB Tasks that require modeling of both language and visual information, such as image captioning, have become very popular in recent years. Most state-of-the-art approaches make use of image representations obtained from a deep neural network, which are used to generate language information in a variety of ways with end-to-end neural-network-based models. However, it is not clear how different image representations contribute to language generation tasks. In this paper, we probe the representational contribution of the image features in an end-to-end neural modeling framework and study the properties of different types of image representations. We focus on two popular vision to language problems: The task of image captioning and the task of multimodal machine translation. Our analysis provides interesting insights into the representational properties and suggests that end-to-end approaches implicitly learn a visual-semantic subspace and exploit the subspace to generate captions.

AB There are limited biomarkers for substance use disorders (SUDs). Traditional statistical approaches are identifying simple biomarkers in large samples, but clinical use cases are still being established. High-throughput clinical, imaging, and 'omic' technologies are generating data from SUD studies and may lead to more sophisticated and clinically useful models. However, analytic strategies suited for high-dimensional data are not regularly used. We review strategies for identifying biomarkers and biosignatures from high-dimensional data types. Focusing on penalized regression and Bayesian approaches, we address how to leverage evidence from existing studies and knowledge bases, using nicotine metabolism as an example. We posit that big data and machine learning approaches will considerably advance SUD biomarker discovery. However, translation to clinical practice, will require integrated scientific efforts.

AB We consider methods for handling incomplete (elliptical) utterances in spoken phraselators, and describe how they have been implemented inside BabelDr, a substantial spoken medical phraselator. The challenge is to extend the phrase matching process so that it is sensitive to preceding dialogue context. We contrast two methods, one using limited-vocabulary strict grammar-based speech and language processing and one using large-vocabulary speech recognition with fuzzy grammar-based processing, and present an initial evaluation on a spoken corpus of 821 context-sentence/elliptical-phrase pairs. The large-vocabulary/fuzzy method strongly outperforms the limited-vocabulary/strict method over the whole corpus, though it is slightly inferior for the subset that is within grammar coverage. We investigate possibilities for combining the two processing paths, using several machine learning frameworks, and demonstrate that hybrid methods strongly outperform the large-vocabulary/fuzzy method.

AB Deep learning has been successful in a variety of applications that have high-dimensional state spaces such as object recognition, video games, and machine translation. Deep neural networks can automatically learn important features from high-dimensional state given large training datasets. However, the success of deep learning in robot systems in the real-world is limited due to the cost of obtaining these large datasets. To overcome this problem, we propose an information-theoretic, intrinsically motivated, self-labeling mechanism using closed-loop control states. Taking this approach biases exploration to informative interactions-as such, a robot requires much less training to achieve reliable performance. In this paper, we explore the impact such an approach has on learning how to grasp objects. We evaluate different intrinsic motivators present in the literature applied appropriately in our framework and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each.

AB Distributional representation of words is used for both syntactic and semantic tasks. In this paper two different methods are presented for clustering word roots. In the first method, the distributional model word2vec [1] is used for clustering word roots, whereas distributional approaches are generally used for words. For this purpose, the distributional similarities of roots are modeled and the roots are divided into syntactic categories (noun, verb etc.). In the other method, two different models are proposed: an information theoretical model and a probabilistic model. With a metric [8] based on mutual information and with another metric based on Jensen-Shannon divergence, similarities of word roots are calculated and clustering is performed using these metrics. Clustering word roots has a significant role in other natural language processing applications such as machine translation and question answering, and in other applications that include language generation. We obtained a purity of 0.92 from the obtained clusters.

This model can be used for reasoning purposes, where the users can identify pertinent information, regarding the Production Performance Indicators-PPI's attributes, relations to resources an their connection to other indicators. Furthermore, it can also be used for the generation of queries, for the handling of data streams from the shop floor and their translation into useful information for the higher levels. Both types of functionalities are demonstrated through a specific automotive use case, where energy related data streams, generated from machines, are handled by queries created through this model.

AB This paper describes an approach based on Zernike moments and Delaunay triangulation for localization of hand-written text in machine printed text documents. The Zernike moments of the image are first evaluated and we classify the text as hand-written using the nearest neighbor classifier. These features are independent of size, slant, orientation, translation and other variations in handwritten text. We then use Delaunay triangulation to reclassify the misclassified text regions. When imposing Delaunay triangulation on the centroid points of the connected components, we extract features based on the triangles and reclassify the text. We remove the noise components in the document as part of the preprocessing step so this method works well on noisy documents. The success rate of the method is found to be 86%. Also for specific hand-written elements such as signatures or similar text the accuracy is found to be even higher at 93%.

AB This paper presents an empirical evaluation of the main usability factors that play a significant role in the interaction with on-line Machine Translation (MT) services. The investigation is carried out from the point of view of typical users with an emphasis on their real needs, and focuses on a set of key usability criteria that have an impact on the successful deployment of Internet-based MT technology. A small-scale evaluation of the performance of five popular web-based MT systems against the selected usability criteria shows that different approaches to interaction design can dramatically affect the level of user satisfaction. There are strong indications that the results of this study can be fed back into the development of on-line MT services to enhance their design, thus ensuring that they meet the requirements and expectations of a wide range of Internet users.

AB Dealing with Out Of Vocabulary (OOV) words or unseen words is one of the main issues of Machine Translation (MT) as well as automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. For morphologically rich languages having high type token ratio, the OOV percentage is also quite high. Sub-word segmentation has been found to be one of the major approaches in dealing with OOVs. In this paper we present a hybrid sub-word segmentation algorithm to deal with OOVs. A sub-word segmentation evaluation methodology is also presented. We also present results of our segmentation approach in comparison to some of the popular sub-word segmentation algorithms. Malayalam is a morphological rich low resource Indic language with very high type token ratio. All the experiments are done for conversational code-switched Malayalam-English corpus.

AB Computer-Aided Design (CAD) applications are used in manufacturing to model everything from coffee mugs to sports cars. These programs are complex and require years of training and experience to master. A component of all CAD models particularly difficult to make are the highly structured 2D sketches that lie at the heart of every 3D construction. In this work, we propose a machine learning model capable of automatically generating such sketches. Through this, we pave the way for developing intelligent tools that would help engineers create better designs with less effort. The core of our method is a combination of a general-purpose language modeling technique alongside an off-the-shelf data serialization protocol. Additionally, we explore several extensions allowing us to gain finer control over the generation process. We show that our approach has enough flexibility to accommodate the complexity of the domain and performs well for both unconditional synthesis and image-to-sketch translation.

AB In this study, we propose sentence simplification from a non-parallel corpus with adversarial learning. In recent years, sentence simplification based on a statistical machine translation framework and neural networks have been actively studied. However, most methods require a large parallel corpus, which is expensive to build. In this paper, our purpose is sentence simplification with a non-parallel corpus in open data en-Wikipedia and Simple-Wikipedia articles. We use a style transfer framework with adversarial learning for learning by non-parallel corpus and adapted a prior work [by Barzilay et al.] to sentence simplification as a base framework. Furthermore, from the perspective of improving retention of sentence meaning, we add pretraining reconstruction loss and cycle consistency loss to the base framework. We also improve the sentence quality output from the proposed model as a result of the expansion.

AB We present a demonstration of a neural interactive-predictive system for tackling multimodal sequence to sequence tasks. The system generates text predictions to different sequence to sequence tasks: machine translation, image and video captioning. These predictions are revised by a human agent, who introduces corrections in the form of characters. The system reacts to each correction, providing alternative hypotheses, compelling with the feedback provided by the user. The final objective is to reduce the human effort required during this correction process.
   This system is implemented following a client-server architecture. For accessing the system, we developed a website, which communicates with the neural model, hosted in a local server. From this website, the different tasks can be tackled following the interactive-predictive framework. We opensource all the code developed for building this system.

TI Computational approaches to schizophrenia
SO BULLETIN DE L ACADEMIE NATIONALE DE MEDECINE
AB One main challenge in modern psychiatry is certainly to combine the multiple levels of understanding today available in the field (i.e., molecular, circuits, behavior, etc.) into a unique theoretical framework, and when possible to refine the nosology, predict major outcomes of the illness and support treatment planning. Despite constant efforts in the field of mental health, such translation from bench to bedside remains very challenging, notably for heterogenous super-categories of disorder such as schizophrenia. I would like to argue that computational modeling may help reaching this goal, in psychiatry in general (i), and in schizophrenia in particular (ii). To illustrate the complementary roles of data-driven and theory-driven computational approaches of schizophrenia, I sketch two recent examples from the literature, taken, respectively, from the diagnosis and outcome predictions using machine-learning, and from the hierarchical Bayesian modeling of psychotic experience.

AB We introduce a hardware-based methodology for performing workload execution forensics in microprocessors. More specifically, we discuss the on-chip instrumentation required for capturing the operational profile of the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB), as well as an off-line machine learning approach which uses this information to identify the executed processes and reconstruct the workload. Unlike workload forensics methods implemented at the operating system (OS) and/or hypervisor level, whose data logging and monitoring mechanisms may be compromised through software attacks, this approach is implemented directly in hardware and is, therefore, immune to such attacks. The proposed method is demonstrated on an experimentation platform which consists of a 32-bit x86 architecture running Linux operating system, implemented in the Simics simulation environment. Experimental results using the Mibench workload benchmark suite reveal an overall workload identification accuracy of 96.97% at an estimated logging rate of only 5.17 KB/sec.

AB A soft sensor model based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is proposed for the measurement of fill level in highly complex environment inside ball mill. CNN has achieved success in the field of image and speech recognition due to the use of local filtering and max-pooling, which is applied to frequency domain in our method to acquire high invariance to signal translation, scaling and distortion. A pair of convolution layer and max-pooling layer is added at the lowest end of neural network as a method to extract the high level abstraction from the vibration spectral features of the mill bearing. Then, the learned features are transferred to the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) to model the mapping between extracted features and mill level. Experimental results show that the proposed CNN-ELM method can get more accurate and efficient measurement.

This paper describes how a system design depicted using activity, sequence and statemachine diagrams can be converted to its implementation code. Activity diagram helps to make the outline of the source program, and the sequence and state machine diagrams contribute to the expansion of the source code. We are using an MDA approach where the system design is do ne in Platform Independent Model (PIM), then converted to Platform Specific Model (PSM) and finally to implementation code.

TI Guidelines for word alignment evaluation and manual alignment
SO LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
AB The purpose of this paper is to provide guidelines for building a word alignment evaluation scheme. The notion of word alignment quality depends on the application: here we review standard scoring metrics for full text alignment and give explanations on how to use them better. We discuss strategies to build a reference corpus, and show that the ratio between ambiguous and unambiguous links in the reference has a great impact on scores measured with these metrics. In particular, automatically computed alignments with higher precision or higher recall can be favoured depending on the value of this ratio. Finally, we suggest a strategy to build a reference corpus particularly adapted to applications where recall plays a significant role, like in machine translation. The manually aligned corpus we built for the Spanish-English European Parliament corpus is also described. This corpus is freely available.

AB Automatic detection of cognates helps downstream NLP tasks of Machine Translation, Cross-lingual Information Retrieval, Computational Phylogenetics and Cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition. Previous approaches for the task of cognate detection use orthographic, phonetic and semantic similarity based features sets. In this paper, we propose a novel method for enriching the feature sets, with cognitive features extracted from human readers' gaze behaviour. We collect gaze behaviour data for a small sample of cognates and show that extracted cognitive features help the task of cognate detection. However, gaze data collection and annotation is a costly task. We use the collected gaze behaviour data to predict cognitive features for a larger sample and show that predicted cognitive features, also, significantly improve the task performance. We report improvements of 10% with the collected gaze features, and 12% using the predicted gaze features, over the previously proposed approaches. Furthermore, we release the collected gaze behaviour data along with our code and cross-lingual models.

AB Dialogue response generation is a fundamental technique in natural language processing, which can be used in human-computer interaction. As the quick development in neural networks, the sequence to sequence (seq2seq) model which employed recurrent neural networks (RNN) encoder-decoder has archived great success in machine translation. Many researchers began to apply this model in dialogue response generation. However, the conventional seq2seq model counters several problems, e.g., grammatical mistake, safe response and etc. In this paper, motivated by the great success of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in generating images, we propose an improved seq2seq framework by employing GANs to rewrite questions in order to retrieve more information from the question. Afterwards we combine the original question and the rewritten question together to generate responses. The experiments on the public Yahoo! Answers dataset demonstrated the proposed framework's potential in dialogue response generation.

AB Despite lots of work in gesture recognition, very little work is done in hand-forearm segmentation. Most of the previous work have overlooked this step by imposing restriction on users. This work presents a novel algorithm for hand-forearm segmentation. The proposed algorithm is inspired and based on the observation of human hand anatomy. Experiments are performed with RGB-D sensor to show the robustness of our algorithm. Additionally, we have compared the performance of our algorithm with the state of the art methods on HGR1 database. The comparative result shows that the presented method performs better than the other state of the art methods. The proposed algorithm is invariant to rotation, scale & translation changes. The advantage of our approach is that users do not require to wear any band/ full sleeve shirt.

AB The transfer or share of knowledge between languages is a popular solution to resource scarcity in NLP. However, the effectiveness of cross-lingual transfer can be challenged by variation in syntactic structures. Frameworks such as Universal Dependencies (UD) are designed to be cross-lingually consistent, but even in carefully designed resources trees representing equivalent sentences may not always overlap. In this paper, we measure cross-lingual syntactic variation, or anisomorphism, in the UD treebank collection, considering both morphological and structural properties. We show that reducing the level of anisomorphism yields consistent gains in cross-lingual transfer tasks. We introduce a source language selection procedure that facilitates effective cross-lingual parser transfer, and propose a typologically driven method for syntactic tree processing which reduces anisomorphism. Our results show the effectiveness of this method for both machine translation and cross-lingual sentence similarity, demonstrating the importance of syntactic structure compatibility for boosting cross-lingual transfer in NLP.

AB Transportation mode classification is a key task in trajectory data mining. It adds human behaviour semantics to raw trajectories for trip recommendation, traffic management and transport planning. Previous approaches require heavy pre-processing and feature extraction processes in order to build a classifier, which is complicated and time-consuming. Recurrent neural network has demonstrated its capacity in sequence modelling tasks ranging from machine translation, speech recognition to image captioning. In this paper, we propose a trajectory transportation mode classification framework that is based on an end-to-end bidirectional LSTM classifier. The proposed classification process does not require any feature extraction process, but automatically learns features from trajectories, and use them for classification. We further improve this framework by feeding the time interval as an external feature by embedding. Our experiments on real GPS datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods with regard to AUC.

AB Many tasks in natural language processing, ranging from machine translation to question answering, can be reduced to the problem of matching two sentences or more generally two short texts. We propose a new approach to the problem, called Deep Match Tree (DEEPMATCH tree), under a general setting. The approach consists of two components, 1) a mining algorithm to discover patterns for matching two short-texts, defined in the product space of dependency trees, and 2) a deep neural network for matching short texts using the mined patterns, as well as a learning algorithm to build the network having a sparse structure. We test our algorithm on the problem of matching a tweet and a response in social media, a hard matching problem proposed in [Wang et al., 2013], and show that DEEPMATCH tree can outperform a number of competitor models including one without using dependency trees and one based on word-embedding, all with large margins.

CL Lille, FRANCE
AB The chain-structured long short-term memory (LSTM) has showed to be effective in a wide range of problems such as speech recognition and machine translation. In this paper, we propose to extend it to tree structures, in which a memory cell can reflect the history memories of multiple child cells or multiple descendant cells in a recursive process. We call the model S-LSTM, which provides a principled way of considering long-distance interaction over hierarchies, e.g., language or image parse structures. We leverage the models for semantic composition to understand the meaning of text, a fundamental problem in natural language understanding, and show that it outperforms a state-of-the-art recursive model by replacing its composition layers with the S-LSTM memory blocks. We also show that utilizing the given structures is helpful in achieving a performance better than that without considering the structures.

AB Today's embedded systems require multiple functions such as real-time control and information technology and integrating these functions on a multi-core processor is one effective solution. However, this increases overhead as it is necessary to partition resources in this approach to protect them. We developed hardware support called ExVisor/XVS to reduce the overhead of partitioning resources to achieve real-time characteristics. This features a physical address management module (PAM) that uses direct address translation by using a single level page table based on an embedded system's memory usage. We evaluated the overhead in a virtual machine's (VM) resource access through register transfer level (RTL) simulation and implementation on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), and it was only less than 5.6% compared with the resource access time by a single core processor.

AB In the automata-theoretic framework, finite-state automata are used as a machine model to capture the operational content of temporal logics. Decision problems like satisfiability, subsumption, equivalence, etc. then translate into questions on automata like emptiness, inclusion, language equivalence, etc. Linear-time temporal logics like LTL, PSL and the linear-time mu-calculus have relatively simple translations into alternating parity automata, and this automaton model is closed under all Boolean operations with very simple constructions. Thus, the typical decision problems for such linear-time temporal logics reduce relatively simply to the emptiness problem for alternating parity automata. In this paper we present a method for decision this emptiness problem without going through intermediate automaton models like nondeterministic ones. The method is a direct adaptation of the size-change termination principle which was orgininally used to decide termination of abstract functional programs.

AB Enterprise models describe and analyze collaborative processes and provide stakeholders with a common view of requirements. A core challenge to tackle the management of collaborative business processes is the continuous translation between business requirements and the current collaborative process model of the involved enterprises. This model is constituted by multiple IT systems, resources, and human labour. This paper presents a novel approach to modelling business processes from the perspective of collaborative systems. The proposal consists of a multi-level design scheme based on ontologies for the description of complex collaborative systems. The use of this ontology-based framework enables machine reasoning which can be applied to automated or semi-automated control and propagation of changes in the functional requirements specification. Benefits related to integrating ontology-based models are also presented.

TI Differentiable Subset Pruning of Transformer Heads
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Multi-head attention, a collection of several attention mechanisms that independently attend to different parts of the input, is the key ingredient in the Transformer. Recent work has shown, however, that a large proportion of the heads in a Transformer's multi-head attention mechanism can be safely pruned away without significantly harming the performance of the model; such pruning leads to models that are noticeably smaller and faster in practice. Our work introduces a new head pruning technique that we term differentiable subset pruning. Intuitively, our method learns perhead importance variables and then enforces a user-specified hard constraint on the number of unpruned heads. The importance variables are learned via stochastic gradient descent. We conduct experiments on natural language inference and machine translation; we show that differentiable subset pruning performs comparably or better than previous works while offering precise control of the sparsity level.(1)

AB We introduce an efficient approach for optimization over orthogonal groups on highly parallel computation units such as GPUs or TPUs. As in earlier work, we parametrize an orthogonal matrix as a product of Householder reflections. However, to overcome low parallelization capabilities of computing Householder reflections sequentially, we propose employing an accumulation scheme called the compact WY (or CWY) transform - a compact parallelization-friendly matrix representation for the series of Householder reflections. We further develop a novel Truncated CWY (or T-CWY) approach for Stiefel manifold parametrization which has a competitive complexity and, again, yields benefits when computed on GPUs and TPUs. We prove that our CWY and T-CWY methods lead to convergence to a stationary point of the training objective when coupled with stochastic gradient descent. We apply our methods to train recurrent neural network architectures in the tasks of neural machine translation and video prediction.

AB Text generation tasks require that the generated text have certain diversity while ensuring the relevance. Traditional Seq2Seq models usually use cross entropy as the objective function. It demands the results keep strictly consistent with the ground truth texts, which easily leads to the lack of variability in generated texts. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, TransVAE, which applies Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) to improve the Seq2Seq architecture. We design the Translator module to transform the latent variable spaces of origin input to target output, thus enhancing the diversity of generated texts and supporting semi-supervised learning. Moreover, we add attention and copy mechanisms to the TransVAE model to balance the relevance and diversity. Abundant experiments are carried out on three different string transduction tasks: dialogue generation, machine translation, and text summarization. The experiment results verify the effectiveness of our method.

AB Untethered small-scale robots have great potential for biomedical applications. However, critical barriers to effective translation of these miniaturized machines into clinical practice exist. High resolution tracking and imaging in vivo is one of the barriers that limit the use of micro- and nanorobots in clinical applications. Here, the inclusion of radioactive compounds in soft thermoresponsive magnetic microrobots is investigated to enable their single-photon emission computed tomography imaging. Four microrobotic platforms differing in hydrogel structure and four Tc-99m[Tc]-based radioactive compounds are investigated in order to achieve optimal contrast agent retention and optimal imaging. Single microrobot imaging of structures as low as 100 mu m in diameter, as well as tracking of shape switching from tubular to planar configurations by inclusion of Tc-99m[Tc] colloid in the hydrogel structure, is reported.

AB Latest development of neural models has connected the encoder and decoder through a self-attention mechanism. In particular, Transformer, which is solely based on self-attention, has led to breakthroughs in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, the multi-head attention mechanism, as a key component of Transformer, limits the effective deployment of the model to a resource-limited setting. In this paper, based on the ideas of tensor decomposition and parameters sharing, we propose a novel self-attention model (namely Multi-linear attention) with Block-Term Tensor Decomposition (BTD). We test and verify the proposed attention method on three language modeling tasks (i.e., PTB, WikiText-103 and One-billion) and a neural machine translation task (i.e., WMT-2016 English-German). Multi-linear attention can not only largely compress the model parameters but also obtain performance improvements, compared with a number of language modeling approaches, such as Transformer, Transformer-XL, and Transformer with tensor train decomposition.

AB Conversation partners rely on inference using each other's gaze and utterances to negotiate shared meaning. In contrast, dialogue systems still operate mostly with unimodal question or command and response interactions. To realize systems that can intuitively discuss and collaborate with humans, we should consider other sensory information. We begin to address this limitation with an innovative study that acquires, analyzes, and fuses interlocutors' discussion and gaze. Introducing a discussion-based elicitation task, we collect gaze with remote and wearable eye trackers alongside dialogue as interlocutors come to consensus on questions about an on-screen 2D image and a real-world 3D scene. We analyze the visual-linguistic patterns, and also map the modalities onto the visual environment by extending a multimodal image region annotation framework using statistical machine translation for multimodal fusion, applying three ways of fusing speakers' gaze and discussion.

AB Linear motors are being used in different application with a huge popularity in the use of transport industry. With the invention of maglev trains and other high speed trains, linear motors are being used for the translation and braking applications for these systems. However, a huge drawback for the linear motor design is the cogging force, low thrust values, and voltage ripples. This paper aims to study the force analysis with change in taper/teeth width of the motor stator and mover to understand the best teeth ratio to obtain a high flux density and a high thrust. The analysis is conducted through JMAG software and it is found that the optimum teeth ratio for both the stator and mover gives an increase of 94.4% increases compared to the 0.5 mm stator and mover width.

TI Effective searching of RDF knowledge graphs
SO JOURNAL OF WEB SEMANTICS
AB RDF knowledge graphs are typically searched using triple-pattern queries. Often, triple-pattern queries will return too many or too few results, making it difficult for users to find relevant answers to their information needs. To remedy this, we propose a general framework for effective searching of RDF knowledge graphs. Our framework extends both the searched knowledge graph and triple-pattern queries with keywords to allow users to form a wider range of queries. In addition, it provides result ranking based on statistical machine translation, and performs automatic query relaxation to improve query recall. Finally, we also define a notion of result diversity in the setting of RDF data and provide mechanisms to diversify RDF search results using Maximal Marginal Relevance. We evaluate the effectiveness of our retrieval framework using various carefully-designed user studies on DBpedia, a large and real-world RDF knowledge graph. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI Choreography of molecular movements during ribosome progression along
   mRNA
SO NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB During translation elongation, ribosome translocation along an mRNA entails rotations of the ribosomal subunits, swiveling motions of the small subunit (SSU) head and stepwise movements of the tRNAs together with the mRNA. Here, we reconstructed the choreography of the collective motions of the Escherichia coli ribosome during translocation promoted by elongation factor EF-G, by recording the fluorescence signatures of nine different reporters placed on both ribosomal subunits, tRNA and mRNA. We captured an early forward swiveling of the SSU head taking place while the SSU body rotates in the opposite, clockwise direction. Backward swiveling of the SSU head starts upon tRNA translocation and continues until the post-translocation state is reached. This work places structures of translocation intermediates along a time axis and unravels principles of the motions of macromolecular machines.

AB Accurate, real-time hand gesture recognition is a challenging and crucial task due to the need of more natural human-computer interaction methods. The major problem lies in fining a good compromise between the accuracy of recognition and the computational load for the algorithm to run in real-time. In this paper we propose a method for static hand gesture recognition using Fourier descriptors for feature extraction with different classifiers. Fourier descriptors have the advantage of giving a set of features that are invariant to rotation, translation and scaling. They are also efficient in terms of speed as they only use a small number of points from the entire image. The proposed method is evaluated using images from the Cambridge Hand Gesture Dataset at different number of features and different classifiers. The effectiveness of the method is shown through simulation results.

AB The setting of this paper is the implementation of timed discrete-event systems (TDES) as sampled-data (SD) controllers. An SD controller is driven by a periodic clock and sees the system as a series of inputs and outputs. On each clock edge (tick event), it samples its inputs, changes states, and updates its outputs.
   In this paper, we establish a formal representation of an SD controller as a Moore synchronous finite state machine (FSM). We describe how to translate a TDES supervisor to a FSM, as well as necessary properties to be able to do so. We discuss how to construct a single centralized controller as well as a set of modular controllers, and show that they will produce equivalent output.
   We also discuss a flexible manufacturing system (FMS) example and present some FSM translation issues encountered, as well as the FSM version of some of the system's supervisors.

AB This paper introduces a new type of active fluid-film bearing and its feedback control. In particular, we propose to actively adjust the angular velocity of the pads of a tilting-pad bearing in response to changes in the operating conditions of the rotating machine. This is motivated by the observation that there is more control authority in the pad tilt motion than in its radial translation. To this end, we first develop a dynamic model for the bearing system, inclusive of the nonlinear hydrodynamic force for the infinitely-short bearing case. A model-based controller is then constructed, based on measurements of the journal position and velocity and pad tilt angles, to ensure that the journal is asymptotically regulated to the bearing center. Numerical simulations illustrate the performance of the active bearing under the proposed control in comparison with the bearing's standard passive mode of operation.

Further and straight-forward processing of the network output provides the dominant points. Two translations of the Freeman chain-code are presented, that easily provide the network input from the chain link values. Results with real and test images are presented that show the feasibility of the proposed algorithm. The simulation of the neural computations on a sequential machine makes the execution time of this algorithm of the same order as that of existing algorithms, but the cost can be significantly reduced by executing these computations on a neural-oriented hardware.

AB Molecular nanotechnology involves the ability to manufacture objects to precise atomic specifications. A central postulate is that any structure that can be specified and that does not violate physical law can be built. Three pathways to molecular nanotechnology are proximate probe technology (the use of improvements of the scanning tunneling microscope, STM), biotechnology, and supramolecular chemistry. Combinations of these technologies appear particularly powerful. The biotechnological approach should make it possible to use in vitro translation systems to manufacture polymers containing at least 10 times as many different artificial monomers as there are natural amino acids. These polymers could further adsorb various other molecular devices, and the use of STMs should enable the complexes to be arranged into sophisticated machines, including molecular computers. The implications include pocket superautomated analyzers and the ability to base medical therapy on the biochemical individuality of specific patients.

TI Spatiotemporal Precision of Neuroimaging in Psychiatry
SO BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY
AB Aberrant patterns of cognition, perception, and behavior seen in psychiatric disorders are thought to be driven by a complex interplay of neural processes that evolve at a rapid temporal scale. Understanding these dynamic processes in vivo in humans has been hampered by a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions inherent to current neuroimaging technology. A recent trend in psychiatric research has been the use of high temporal resolution imaging, particularly magnetoencephalography, often in conjunction with sophisticated machine learning decoding techniques. Developments here promise novel insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of cognitive phenomena, including domains relevant to psychiatric illnesses such as reward and avoidance learning, memory, and planning. This review considers recent advances afforded by exploiting this increased spatiotemporal precision, with specific reference to applications that seek to drive a mechanistic understanding of psychopathology and the realization of preclinical translation.

TI Implementing computational methods in tandem with synonymous gene
   recoding for therapeutic development
SO TRENDS IN PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Synonymous gene recoding, the substitution of synonymous variants into the genetic sequence, has been used to overcome many production limitations in therapeutic development. However, the safety and efficacy of recoded therapeu-tics can be difficult to evaluate because synonymous codon substitutions can re-sult in subtle, yet impactful changes in protein features and require sensitive methods for detection. Given that computational approaches have made signifi-cant leaps in recent years, we propose that machine-learning (ML) tools may be leveraged to assess gene-recoded therapeutics and foresee an opportunity to adapt codon contexts to enhance some powerful existing tools. Here, we examine how synonymous gene recoding has been used to address challenges in thera-peutic development, explain the biological mechanisms underlying its effects, and explore the application of computational platforms to improve the surveillance of functional variants in therapeutic design.

AB Cross-lingual text representations have gained popularity lately and act as the backbone of many tasks such as unsupervised machine translation and cross-lingual information retrieval, to name a few. However, evaluation of such representations is difficult in the domains beyond standard benchmarks due to the necessity of obtaining domain-specific parallel language data across different pairs of languages. In this paper, we propose an automatic metric for evaluating the quality of cross-lingual textual representations using images as a proxy in a paired image-text evaluation dataset. Experimentally, Backretrieval is shown to highly correlate with ground truth metrics on annotated datasets, and our analysis shows statistically significant improvements over baselines. Our experiments conclude with a case study on a recipe dataset without parallel cross-lingual data. We illustrate how to judge cross-lingual embedding quality with Backretrieval, and validate the outcome with a small human study.

AB The detection of metaphors can provide valuable information about a given text and is crucial to sentiment analysis and machine translation. In this paper, we outline the techniques for word-level metaphor detection used in our submission to the Second Shared Task on Metaphor Detection. We propose using both BERT and XLNet language models to create contextualized embeddings and a bidirectional LSTM to identify whether a given word is a metaphor. Our best model achieved F1-scores of 68.0% on VUA AllPOS, 73.0% on VUA Verbs, 66.9% on TOEFL AllPOS, and 69.7% on TOEFL Verbs, placing 7th, 6th, 5th, and 5th respectively. In addition, we outline another potential approach with a KNN-LSTM ensemble model that we did not have enough time to implement given the deadline for the competition. We show that a KNN classifier provides a similar F1-score on a validation set as the LSTM and yields different information on metaphors.

AB Semantic parsing, as an essential approach to question answering over knowledge bases KBQA), transforms a question into query graphs for further generating logical queries. Existing semantic parsing approaches in KBQA mainly focus on relations (called local semantics) with paying less attention to the relationship among relations (called global semantics). In this paper, we present a seq2seq-based semantic parsing approach to improving performance of KBQA by converting the identification problem of question types to the problem of machine translation. Firstly, we introduce a BiLSTM-based named entity recognition (NER) method to extract all classes of entities occurring in questions. Secondly, we present an attention-based seq2seq model to learn one type of a question by applying seq2seq model in extracting relationships among classes. Finally, we generate templates to adopt more question types for matching more complex questions. The experimental results on a real knowledge base Chinese film show that our approach outperforms the existing template matching model.

AB We introduce the Scratchpad Mechanism, a novel addition to the sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) neural network architecture and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the overall fluency of seq2seq models for natural language generation tasks. By enabling the decoder at each time step to write to all of the encoder output layers, Scratchpad can employ the encoder as a "scratchpad" memory to keep track of what has been generated so far and thereby guide future generation. We evaluate Scratchpad in the context of three well-studied natural language generation tasks - Machine Translation, Question Generation, and Text Summarization - and obtain state-of-the-art or comparable performance on standard datasets for each task. Qualitative assessments in the form of human judgements (question generation), attention visualization (MT), and sample output (summarization) provide further evidence of the ability of Scratchpad to generate fluent and expressive output.

SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Switchable crown ether-ammonium [2] rotaxanes with a redox-active tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) unit implemented in their wheels were synthesised and fully characterised. Reversible operation in two modes is possible, in which the [2] rotaxane's axle is either charged or neutral. Cyclic voltammetry experiments reveal the effects of mechanical bonding on the electrochemical properties of TTF and show the [2] rotaxanes to perform a distinct function in both modes. In the charged mode, redox-switching is dominated by strong electrostatic repulsion in the [2] rotaxane which subsequently leads to a macrocycle translation along the axle. In the non-charged mode, a selective energetic stabilisation of TTF radical cations is observed, which can be attributed to an interplay of weak electrostatic interactions between wheel and axle.

According to our results, Twitter Tweets is the best on lyrics sentiment analysis, whereas Google News and Common Crawl are the top performers on movie polarity analysis. Glove trained models slightly outrun those trained with Skip-gram. Also, factors like topic relevance and size of corpus significantly impact the quality of the models. When medium or large-sized text sets are available, obtaining word embeddings from same training dataset is usually the best choice.

AB Text generation is a typical nature language processing task, and is the basis of machine translation and question answering. Deep learning techniques can get good performance on this task under the condition that huge number of parameters and mass of data are available for training. However, human beings do not learn in this way. People combine knowledge learned before and something new with only few samples. This process is called one-shot learning. In this paper, we propose a neocortex based computational model, Semantic Hierarchical Temporal Memory model (SHTM), for one-shot text generation. The model is refined from Hierarchical Temporal Memory model. LSTM is used for comparative study. Results on three public datasets show that SHTM performs much better than LSTM on the measures of mean precision and BLEU score. In addition, we utilize SHTM model to do question answering in the fashion of text generation and verifying its superiority.

In the fruit industry, various fruits like banana, mango, apple and pomegranate, etc. are transported in the conveyor for a post harvest process like classification, sorting, grading and juice extraction. The manual discrimination of various fruits consumes time and, it can be automated. This research work is intended to build an image processing algorithm that ensures automatic discrimination of banana (Musa Species.) from other fruits like Citrus, Apple, and Pomegranate. The input object is segmented using Background subtraction and threshold method. Morphological operations are performed to obtain the clear contour of the segmented objects. The shape of the banana and non-banana are described by scale and translation invariant signature. Binary SVM with signature feature vectors detect the banana fruit from the non-banana fruit automatically. The accuracy rate is 95%.

The success of extracting collocations depends on the technique of preprocessing. A systematic pre-processing technique is described in this paper. Then the pre-processed data is used to extract collocation by using two methods: Point-wise Mutual Information and Fuzzy Bi-gram Index. The paper mainly focuses on bi-gram extraction from a Bengali news corpus. Collocations of higher length i.e., n-grams (n>2) are then obtained when the extracted collocations of lower lengths are treated as individual words. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB One notable distinction between the W3C approach to web services, and the ontology-based approach called semantic web services, is the inclusion of behavioural models in the relevant standards. Indeed the de facto standard for the orchestration of plain web services, BPEL - increasingly applied also to choreography - was developed and standardised independently. At the same time the formal behavioural semantics given to semantic web services are expressed extra-ontologically and not amenable to the machine-based reasoning that the approach is intended to provide. With the advent of semantic business process management, introduced by the SUPER project, the same ontology-based approach is being applied to business process models but the same criticism applies, thus far, to behavioural models. This paper presents work on the Behavioural Reasoning Ontology and the ontology-based translation from SUPER's Business Process Modelling Ontology, which aims to remedy this situation.

AB The Hindi morpheme 'vaalaa' is very widely used as a suffix and also as a separate word. The common usage of this suffix is to denote an activity or profession of a person. This form of the usage has been borrowed in English with the spelling of 'wallah'. However, it has a large number of other interpretations depending upon the context in which it is used. This paper presents an account of different senses in which this morpheme is used in Hindi and presents a strategy for learning their disambiguation based on contextual features with sparse data using a semi-supervised method. We present a new technique of unifying learned instances using supervised training with limited data and computing matching index and bootstrapping the training set to deal with corpus sparseness. This study finds application in machine translation, information retrieval, text understanding and text summarization.

Therefore, we have developed a system that can automatically acquire these annotations. We performed experiments using this system for the case of communication between Japanese and foreign students. We present the results of these experiments regarding the users' evaluations and discussions. (1) The annotation contents of an image obtained by the automatic acquirement function obtained a relatively good evaluation. (2) With regard to annotation sentences, the content acquired through a multilingual links was given the highest evaluation. (3) With regard to the annotation images, the content acquired through an image search service was given the highest evaluation.

TI Human gait recognition based on kernel PCA using projections
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB This paper presents a novel approach for human identification at a distance using gait recognition. Recognition of a person from their gait is a biometric of increasing interest. The proposed work introduces a nonlinear machine learning method, kernel Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to extract gait features from silhouettes for individual recognition. Binarized silhouette of a motion object is first represented by four 1-D signals which are the basic image features called the distance vectors. Fourier transform is performed to achieve translation invariant for the gait patterns accumulated from silhouette sequences which are extracted from different circumstances. Kernel PCA is then used to extract higher order relations among the gait patterns for future recognition. A fusion strategy is finally executed to produce a final decision. The experiments are carried out on the CMU and the USF gait databases and presented based on the different training gait cycles.

AB Although pursuing accuracy is important in language learning or teaching, knowing what types of errors interfere with communication and what types do not would be more beneficial for efficiently enhancing communicative competence. Language learners could be greatly helped by a system that detected errors in learner language and automatically measured their effect on intelligibility. In this paper, we reported our attempt, based on machine learning, to measure the intelligibility of learner language. In the learning process, the system referred to the BLEU and NIST scores between the learners' original sentences and their back translation (or corrected sentences), the log-probability of the parse, sentence length, and error types (manually or automatically assigned) as a key feature. We found that the system can distinguish between intelligible sentences and others (unnatural and unintelligible) rather successfully, but still has a lot of difficulties in distinguishing the three levels of intelligibility.

AB To make walking machine more active and practical. reducing its weight without reducing its working ability is the key issue of design. Robot with many actuators that produce a function of real animal's joint-base kinematics tends to be too heavy for a light-step animal-like walking. This paper gives a concept of reducing a number of actuators, which is extremely effective to reduce a weight of walkers. Considering the essence of walking locomotion. absolutely indispensable functions are an arbitrarily movement of swing leg and some translation of the center of gravity to keep balance. Seven actuators for biped. four for quadruped, six for hexapod are the minimum numbers for essential functions. A 6-actuator hexapod is realized by trial manufacturing. Furthermore, as a practical solution. more reduction is available by restricting walking functions. A 5-actuator biped and 3-actuator quadruped are introduced with experiments.

AB Verification of instruction encoders and decoders is essential for formalizing manipulation of machine code. The existing approaches cannot guarantee the critical consistency property, i.e., that an encoder and its corresponding decoder are mutual inverses of each other. We observe that consistent encoder-decoder pairs can be automatically derived from bijections inherently embedded in instruction formats. Based on this observation, we develop a framework for writing specifications that capture these bijections, for automatically generating encoders and decoders from these specifications, and for formally validating the consistency and soundness of the generated encoders and decoders by synthesizing proofs in Coq and discharging verification conditions using SMT solvers. We apply this framework to a subset of X86-32 instructions to illustrate its effectiveness in these regards. We also demonstrate that the generated encoders and decoders have reasonable performance.

AB Cross-lingual semantic role labeling (SRL) aims at leveraging resources in a source language to minimize the effort required to construct annotations or models for a new target language. Recent approaches rely on word alignments, machine translation engines, or preprocessing tools such as parsers or taggers. We propose a cross-lingual SRL model which only requires annotations in a source language and access to raw text in the form of a parallel corpus. The backbone of our model is an LSTM-based semantic role labeler jointly trained with a semantic role compressor and multilingual word embeddings. The compressor collects useful information from the output of the semantic role labeler, filtering noisy and conflicting evidence. It lives in a multilingual embedding space and provides direct supervision for predicting semantic roles in the target language. Results on the Universal Proposition Bank and manually annotated datasets show that our method is highly effective, even against systems utilizing supervised features.(1)

AB We present LAReQA, a challenging new benchmark for language-agnostic answer retrieval from a multilingual candidate pool. Unlike previous cross-lingual tasks, LAReQA tests for "strong" cross-lingual alignment, requiring semantically related cross-language pairs to be closer in representation space than unrelated same-language pairs. This level of alignment is important for the practical task of cross-lingual information retrieval. Building on multilingual BERT (mBERT), we study different strategies for achieving strong alignment. We find that augmenting training data via machine translation is effective, and improves significantly over using mBERT out-of-the-box. Interestingly, model performance on zero-shot variants of our task that only target "weak" alignment is not predictive of performance on LAReQA. This finding underscores our claim that language-agnostic retrieval is a substantively new kind of cross-lingual evaluation, and suggests that measuring both weak and strong alignment will be important for improving cross-lingual systems going forward.

AB Segmentation serves as an integral part in many NLP applications including Machine Translation, Parsing, and Information Retrieval. When a model trained on the standard language is applied to dialects, the accuracy drops dramatically. However, there are more lexical items shared by the standard language and dialects than can be found by mere surface word matching. This shared lexicon is obscured by a lot of cliticization, gemination, and character repetition. In this paper, we prove that segmentation and base normalization of dialects can help in domain adaptation by reducing data sparseness. Segmentation will improve a system performance by reducing the number of OOVs, help isolate the differences and allow better utilization of the commonalities. We show that adding a small amount of dialectal segmentation training data reduced OOVs by 5% and remarkably improves POS tagging for dialects by 7.37% f-score, even though no dialect-specific POS training data is included.

AB We present the first sentence simplification model that learns explicit edit operations (ADD, DELETE, and KEEP) via a neural programmer-interpreter approach. Most current neural sentence simplification systems are variants of sequence-to-sequence models adopted from machine translation. These methods learn to simplify sentences as a byproduct of the fact that they are trained on complex-simple sentence pairs. By contrast, our neural programmer-interpreter is directly trained to predict explicit edit operations on targeted parts of the input sentence, resembling the way that humans might perform simplification and revision. Our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art neural sentence simplification models (without external knowledge) by large margins on three benchmark text simplification corpora in terms of SARI (+0.95 WikiLarge, +1.89 WikiSmall, +1.41 Newsela), and is judged by humans to produce overall better and simpler output sentences(1).

TI Beyond Temporal Pooling: Recurrence and Temporal Convolutions for
   Gesture Recognition in Video
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION
AB Recent studies have demonstrated the power of recurrent neural networks for machine translation, image captioning and speech recognition. For the task of capturing temporal structure in video, however, there still remain numerous open research questions. Current research suggests using a simple temporal feature pooling strategy to take into account the temporal aspect of video. We demonstrate that this method is not sufficient for gesture recognition, where temporal information is more discriminative compared to general video classification tasks. We explore deep architectures for gesture recognition in video and propose a new end-to-end trainable neural network architecture incorporating temporal convolutions and bidirectional recurrence. Our main contributions are twofold; first, we show that recurrence is crucial for this task; second, we show that adding temporal convolutions leads to significant improvements. We evaluate the different approaches on the Montalbano gesture recognition dataset, where we achieve state-of-the-art results.

AB Much work in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been for resource-rich languages, making generalization to new, less-resourced languages challenging. We present two approaches for improving generalization to low-resourced languages by adapting continuous word representations using linguistically motivated subword units: phonemes, morphemes and graphemes. Our method requires neither parallel corpora nor bilingual dictionaries and provides a significant gain in performance over previous methods relying on these resources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches on Named Entity Recognition for four languages, namely Uyghur, Turkish, Bengali and Hindi, of which Uyghur and Bengali are low resource languages, and also perform experiments on Machine Translation. Exploiting subwords with transfer learning gives us a boost of +15.2 NER F1 for Uyghur and +9.7 F1 for Bengali. We also show improvements in the monolingual setting where we achieve (avg.) +3 F1 and (avg.) +1.35 BLEU.

AB Recurrent neural network language models (RNNLMs) have been successfully applied in a variety of language processing applications ranging from speech recognition to machine translation. They can fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation (word vector). The components of these vectors measure the co-occurrence of the word with context features over a corpus. However, RNNLMs ignore the fact that the meaning of word can vary substantially in different contexts (e.g., for polysemous words). In this paper, we investigate part-of-speech information to address this issue to some extent on the basis of information about the meaning of a word they could provide. Experimental results on Mandarin speech recognition task show that a significant character error reduction of 1.18% absolute (7.72% relative) was obtained when using recurrent neural network language model with part-of-speech.

AB Femtosecond laser processing of bulk transparent materials can generate localized increase of the refractive index. Thus, translation of the laser spot give potential access to three dimensionnal photowriting of waveguiding structures. Increasing the number of machining foci can considerably reduce the processing efforts when complex photonic structures are envisaged such as waveguide arrays. The present report presents a technique of dynamic ultrafast laser beam spatial tailoring for parallel writing of photonic devices. The wavefront of the beam is modulated by a periodical binary (0-pi) phase mask of variable pattern to achieve dynamic multispot operation. The parallel photoinscription of multiple waveguides is demonstrated in fused silica. Using this method, light dividers in three dimensions relying on evanescent coupling are reported and wavelength-division demultiplexing (WDD) devices were achieved in single sample scan.

AB Bacteriophages (phages) are selective viral predators of bacteria. Abundant and ubiquitous in nature, phages can be used to treat bacterial infections (phage therapy), including refractory infections and those resistant to antibiotics. However, despite an abundance of anecdotal evidence of efficacy, significant hurdles remain before routine implementation of phage therapy into medical practice, including a dearth of robust clinical trial data. Phage-bacterium interactions are complex and diverse, characterized by co-evolution trajectories that are significantly influenced by the environments in which they occur (mammalian body sites, water, soil, etc.). An understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning these dynamics is essential for successful clinical translation. This review aims to cover key aspects of bacterium-phage interactions that affect bacterial killing by describing the most relevant published literature and detailing the current knowledge gaps most likely to influence therapeutic success.

Due to the lack of data for abstractive summarization on low-resource languages such as Italian, we propose two new original datasets collected from two Italian news websites with multi-sentence summaries and corresponding articles, and from a dataset obtained by machine translation of a Spanish summarization dataset. These two datasets are currently the only two available in Italian for this task. To evaluate the quality of these two datasets, we used them to train a T5-base model and an mBART model, obtaining good results with both. To better evaluate the results obtained, we also compared the same models trained on automatically translated datasets, and the resulting summaries in the same training language, with the automatically translated summaries, which demonstrated the superiority of the models obtained from the proposed datasets.

Our application provides features such as early detection of plant disease, implemented using various approaches. After evaluation, results showed that Convolutional Neural Network was performing better for plant disease detection with an accuracy of 97.94% at 20 epochs. It further helps the farmer to forecast the weather to decide the right time for agricultural activities like harvesting and plucking. To avoid reoccurrence of disease due to loss in soil minerals, a crop specific fertilizer calculator is incorporated which can calculate the amount of urea, diammonium phosphate and muriate of potash required for a given area. Since India is a multilingual country, the application has been designed to incorporate language translation in four languages: Marathi, Hindi, Punjabi and English.

AB In this paper, we focus on the problem of applying the transformer structure to video captioning effectively. The vanilla transformer is proposed for uni-modal language generation task such as machine translation. However, video captioning is a multimodal learning problem, and the video features have much redundancy between different time steps. Based on these concerns, we propose a novel method called sparse boundary-aware transformer (SBAT) to reduce the redundancy in video representation. SBAT employs boundary-aware pooling operation for scores from multihead attention and selects diverse features from different scenarios. Also, SBAT includes a local correlation scheme to compensate for the local information loss brought by sparse operation. Based on SBAT, we further propose an aligned cross-modal encoding scheme to boost the multimodal interaction. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that SBAT outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under most of the metrics.

AB Words embedding (distributed word vector representations) have become an essential component of many natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, word analogy, named entity recognition and word similarity. Despite this, the only work that provides word vectors for Hausa language is that of [1] trained using fastText, consisting of only a few words vectors. This work presents words embedding models using Word2Vec's Continuous Bag of Words (CBoW) and Skip Gram (SG) models. The models, hauWE (Hausa Words Embedding), are bigger and better than the only previous model, making them more useful in NLP tasks. To compare the models, they were used to predict the 10 most similar words to 30 randomly selected Hausa words. hauWE CBoW's 88.7% and hauWE SG's 79.3% prediction accuracy greatly outperformed [1]'s 22.3%.

AB We present Steadiface, a new real-time face-centric video stabilization method that simultaneously removes hand shake and keeps subject's head stable. We use a CNN to estimate the face landmarks and use them to optimize a stabilized head center. We then formulate an optimization problem to find a virtual camera pose that locates the face to the stabilized head center while retains smooth rotation and translation transitions across frames. We test the proposed method on fieldtest videos and show it stabilizes both the head motion and background. It is robust to large head pose, occlusion, facial appearance variations, and different kinds of camera motions. We show our method advances the state of art in selfie video stabilization by comparing against alternative methods. The whole process runs very efficiently on a modern mobile phone (8.1 ms/frame).

AB We propose an word alignment model with two core features: the ability to handle uncertainty in the morpheme matching process and in the selecting correct phrase alignments after its creation. These processes are based on the use of a morphological analysis tool and a large monolingual corpora, which is used for improving the alignment elements correspondence. The consideration of this tool is language-dependent for a special pair of the languages, although an Wikipedia data represents an adequate source of the training text that can be used in many cases, and even allows an unsupervised word segmentation. Based on these features, we propose an approach that captures the morphotactics which is common to the source text. The paper describes experiments in the general domain by using a tagset, and has been compared to a classical word alignment by the help of human judgment.

AB Recurrent neural network language models (RNNLMs) have recently produced improvements on language processing tasks ranging from machine translation to word tagging and speech recognition. To date, however, the computational expense of RNNLMs has hampered their application to first pass decoding. In this paper, we show that by restricting the RNNLM calls to those words that receive a reasonable score according to a n-gram model, and by deploying a set of caches, we can reduce the cost of using an RNNLM in the first pass to that of using an additional n-gram model. We compare this scheme to lattice rescoring, and find that they produce comparable results for a Bing Voice search task. The best performance results from rescoring a lattice that is itself created with a RNNLM in the first pass.

AB We describe here the process of implementing a morphological generator for Romanian, together with references to the resources and previous work that made this achievement possible. The generator receives a lemma and a morpho-lexical description of the intended word-form and it is supposed to generate that very word-form. It uses a paradigmatic description of Romanian morphology and a large dictionary of lemmas associated with their inflectional paradigms. The work is motivated by an ongoing example-based machine translation system and by its utility in extending the lexical resources created in our group. The generation process distinguishes two major situations, depending on the lemma being recorded or not into the generator's dictionary. In the first case, the generated inflected form is guaranteed to be a real word of Romanian language while in the second case the inflected form might be a potential but not extant word of Romanian.

AB Semantic lexicons and lexical ontologies are important resources in natural language processing. They are used in various tasks and applications, especially where semantic processing is evolved such as question answering, machine translation, text understanding, information retrieval and extraction, content management, text summarization, knowledge acquisition and semantic search engines. Although there are a number of semantic lexicons for English and some other languages, Persian lacks such a complete resource to be used in NLP works. In this paper we introduce an ongoing project on developing a lexical ontology for Persian called FarsNet. It uses a combination of WordNet and FrameNet features to represent words meanings. We exploited a hybrid semi-automatic approach to acquire lexical and conceptual knowledge from resources such as WordNet, bilingual dictionaries, mono-lingual corpora and morpho-syntactic and semantic templates. FarsNet provides links between various types of words and also between words and their corresponding concepts in other ontologies.

AB Live Sequence Charts (LSCs) provide a formal visual framework for creating scenario-based requirements for reactive systems. An LSC imposes a partial order over a set of events, such as the sending or receiving of messages. Each. event is associated with a liveness property, indicating whether it can or must occur. Time extensions can further specify when these events should occur. An individual LSC tells a story about particular fragment of system behavior, whereas LSC specifications - a finite set of LSCs - collectively define the total behavior. An LSC specification may require that more than one distinct scenario, or multiple instances of the same scenario, execute concurrently. It is natural to ask whether LSC specifications can be synthesized into formal languages. Previous work offers translations from untimed LSCs to finite state machines, and from single (non-concurrent) LSCs to timed automata. Here, we show that LSC specifications with concurrency can also be expressed as a timed automata.

AB The Java security policy is implemented by security components such as the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), the API, the verifier, the loader. It is of prime importance to ensure that the implementation of these components is in accordance with their specifications. Formal methods can be used to bring the mathematical proof that the implementation of these components corresponds to their specification. In this paper, a formal development is performed on the Java Card byte code verifier using the B method. The whole Java Card language is taken into account in order to provide realistic metrics on formal development. The architecture and the tricky points of the development are presented. This formalization leads to an embeddable implementation of the byte code verifier thanks to automatic code translation from formal implementation into C code. We present the formal models, discuss the integration into the card and the results of such an experiment.

TI Massively parallel pooled screening reveals genomic determinants of
   nanoparticle delivery
SO SCIENCE
AB To accelerate the translation of cancer nanomedicine, we used an integrated genomic approach to improve our understanding of the cellular processes that govern nanoparticle trafficking. We developed a massively parallel screen that leverages barcoded, pooled cancer cell lines annotated with multiomic data to investigate cell association patterns across a nanoparticle library spanning a range of formulations with clinical potential. We identified both materials properties and cell-intrinsic features that mediate nanoparticle-cell association. Using machine learning algorithms, we constructed genomic nanoparticle trafficking networks and identified nanoparticle-specific biomarkers. We validated one such biomarker: gene expression of SLC46A3, which inversely predicts lipid-based nanoparticle uptake in vitro and in vivo. Our work establishes the power of integrated screens for nanoparticle delivery and enables the identification and utilization of biomarkers to rationally design nanoformulations.

AB The attention mechanism has shown good performance in many aspects such as machine translation. But it is not completely suitable for combinatorial optimization problems. In the Traveling Salesman Problem(TSP), there is no need to consider the city nodes that have been traveled, but only the city ones that have not been traveled to in the future. To address this problem, this paper extends the attention mechanism to solve combinatorial optimization problems such as the traveling salesman problem. We train a Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU) to predict a distribution over different city permutations with the input of a set of city coordinates, and use negative tour length as the reward signal, and optimize the parameters of the GRU using a policy gradient method. The experiments demonstrate that the extended attention mechanism achieves more close to optimum solutions than the globe attention and local attentional mechanism on two-dimension planar space graphs with up to 100 nodes.

AB Diabetes is a global eye health issue. Given the rising in diabetes prevalence and ageing population, this poses significant challenge to perform diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening for these patients. Artificial intelligence (AI) using machine learning and deep learning have been adopted by various groups to develop automated DR detection algorithms. This article aims to describe the state-of-art AI DR screening technologies that have been described in the literature, some of which are already commercially available. All these technologies were designed using different training datasets and technical methodologies. Although many groups have published robust diagnostic performance of the AI algorithms for DR screening, future research is required to address several challenges, for examples medicolegal implications, ethics, and clinical deployment model in order to expedite the translation of these novel technologies into the healthcare setting.

AB The paraphrase identification task is one of the important problems that affect the quality of many natural language processing tasks such as querying information, text summarization, plagiarism detection, etc. Especially in the present time, with the development of machine translation tools, the task of paraphrase identification also has to be considered in the case of pairs of texts in two different languages. In this paper, we propose to use the Siamese Recurrent architectures to identify the Vietnamese- English cross-lingual paraphrase cases. In addition, we also use methods such as mapping bilingual word embedding, adding POS vector to word embedding and adjusting the POS tagging label between Vietnamese text and English text. The experimental results in the English-Vietnamese paraphrase corpus with 44,652 sentence pairs show that the use of these methods help to improve the accuracy of the model from 86.86% to 89.61%.

AB Despite the effectiveness of recurrent neural network language models, their maximum likelihood estimation suffers from two limitations. It treats all sentences that do not match the ground truth as equally poor, ignoring the structure of the output space. Second, it suffers from "exposure bias": during training tokens are predicted given ground-truth sequences, while at test time prediction is conditioned on generated output sequences. To overcome these limitations we build upon the recent reward augmented maximum likelihood approach i.e. sequence-level smoothing that encourages the model to predict sentences close to the ground truth according to a given performance metric. We extend this approach to token-level loss smoothing, and propose improvements to the sequence-level smoothing approach. Our experiments on two different tasks, image captioning and machine translation, show that token-level and sequence-level loss smoothing are complementary, and significantly improve results.

TI A toxic imbalance of Hsp70s in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is caused by
   competition for cofactors
SO MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY
AB Molecular chaperones are responsible for managing protein folding from translation through degradation. These crucial machines ensure that protein homeostasis is optimally maintained for cell health. However, too much of a good thing' can be deadly, and the excess of chaperones can be toxic under certain cellular conditions. For example, overexpression of Ssa1, a yeast Hsp70, is toxic to cells in folding-challenged states such as [PSI+]. We discovered that overexpression of the nucleotide exchange factor Sse1 can partially alleviate this toxicity. We further argue that the basis of the toxicity is related to the availability of Hsp70 cofactors, such as Hsp40 J-proteins and nucleotide exchange factors. Ultimately, our work informs future studies about functional chaperone balance and cautions against therapeutic chaperone modifications without a thorough examination of cofactor relationships.

AB Different Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications such as text categorization, machine translation, etc., need annotated corpora to check quality and performance. Similarly, sentiment analysis requires annotated corpora to test the performance of classifiers. Manual annotation performed by native speakers is used as a benchmark test to measure how accurate a classifier is. In this paper we summarise currently available Arabic corpora and describe work in progress to build, annotate, and use Arabic corpora consisting of Facebook (FB) posts. The distinctive nature of these corpora is that they are based on posts written in Dialectal Arabic (DA) not following specific grammatical or spelling standards. The corpora are annotated with five labels (positive, negative, dual, neutral, and spam). In addition to building the corpora, the paper illustrates how manual tagging can be used to extract opinionated words and phrases to be used in a lexicon-based classifier.

The French-German ANR-DFG project Breaking the Unwritten Language Barrier (BULB) aims at developing such tools for three mostly unwritten African languages of the Bantu family. For one of them, Mboshi, a language originating from the "Cuvette" region of the Republic of Congo, we investigate unsupervised word discovery techniques from an unsegmented stream of phonemes. We compare different models and algorithms, both monolingual and bilingual, on a new corpus in Mboshi and French, and discuss various ways to represent the data with suitable granularity. An additional French-English corpus allows us to contrast the results obtained on Mboshi and to experiment with more data.

AB Sentence similarity methods are used to assess the degree of likelihood between phrases. Many natural language applications such as text summarization, information retrieval, text categorization, and machine translation employ measures of sentence similarity. The existing approaches for this problem represent sentences as vectors of bag of words or the syntactic information of the words in the phrase. The likelihood between phrases is calculated by composing the similarity between the words in the sentences. Such schemes do not address two important concerns in the area, however: the semantic problem and the word order. This paper proposes a new sentence similarity measure that attempts to address such problems by taking into account the lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis of sentences. The new similarity measure proposed outperforms the state of the art systems in around 6%, when tested using a standard and publically available dataset.

TI Alignment-based extraction of multiword expressions
SO LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
AB Due to idiosyncrasies in their syntax, semantics or frequency, Multiword Expressions (MWEs) have received special attention from the NLP community, as the methods and techniques developed for the treatment of simplex words are not necessarily suitable for them. This is certainly the case for the automatic acquisition of MWEs from corpora. A lot of effort has been directed to the task of automatically identifying them, with considerable success. In this paper, we propose an approach for the identification of MWEs in a multilingual context, as a by-product of a word alignment process, that not only deals with the identification of possible MWE candidates, but also associates some multiword expressions with semantics. The results obtained indicate the feasibility and low costs in terms of tools and resources demanded by this approach, which could, for example, facilitate and speed up lexicographic work.

AB The rCOS modeler implements the requirements modelling phase of a model driven component-based software engineering process. Components are specified in rCOS, a relational calculus for Refinement of Component and Object Systems. As an aid to the software engineer, the modeler helps to separate the different concerns by creating different artifacts in the UML model: use cases define a scenario through a sec:we:rice diagram, and methods are given as guarded designs in rCOS. rCOS interface contracts are specified through state machines with modelling variables. Messages and transitions in the diagrams are labelled with method invocations.
   The modeler checks the consistency of those artifacts through the process algebra CSP and the model checker FDR2: a scenario must follow a contract, and an implementation must not deadlock when following the contract. We illustrate the translation and validation with a case study.

AB A micro hole punching system was developed and micro holes of 100 mum in diameter were successfully made on brass sheets of 100 mum in thickness. A micro punch made of tungsten carbide was designed to withstand the punch load, considering the buckling and the bending moment due to possible misalignment error, The punch was fabricated by the grinding process with diamond wheel. The die was designed considering the punch load and fabricated by micro electrodischarge machining process. In this system the stripper is designed to guide punch tip to minimize the possible misalignment. The punch was installed on a vertical stepper and the die was mounted on an X-Y translation unit. The precision motion controller controlled all motions of the micro hole punching system. In this study technical difficulties and solutions in the micro hole punching process were also discussed.

AB In this paper we propose a representation for what we have called an interpretation of a text. We base this representation on TMR (Text Meaning Representation), an interlingual representation developed for Machine Translation purposes. A TMR consists of a complex feature-value structure, with the feature names and filler values drawn from an ontology, in this case, ONTOS, developed concurrently with TMR. We suggest on the basis of previous work, that a representation of an interpretation of a text must build on a TMR structure for the text in several ways: (1) by the inclusion of additional required features and feature values (which may themselves be complex feature structures); (2) by pragmatically filling in empty slots in the TMR structure itself; and (3) by supporting the connections between feature values by including, as part of the TMR itself, the chains of inferencing that link various parts of the structure.

AB This paper describes Sync/Trans, an incremental spoken language translation system. The system has been being developed for efficiently translating a spontaneous speech dialogue between an English speaker and a Japanese speaker. Its purpose being to behave as a simultaneous interpreter, the system produces the target output synchronously with the source input. Sync/Trans has the following features: (1) the system consists of modules that work in a synchronous fashion, (2) the system translates the source language possibly word-by-word according to the appearance order, (3) the system utilizes grammatically ill-formed expressions for the speech output, and (4) the system corrects the grammatical ill-formedness of the speech input at a pretty early stage. An experimental system for translating English speech into Japanese speech has been implemented. A few experimental results have shown Sync/Trans to be a promising system for simultaneous interpretation.

SO DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP IN THE HUMANITIES
AB There is still little linguistic data on the Ukrainian language in the context of natural language processing (NLP). At the same time, in view of real perspectives of European integration of Ukraine, its state language will soon probably become one of the European Community languages. This fact draws more and more interest to the possible inclusion of the Ukrainian language in multilingual NLP scenarios. This article aims to provide some important data that are necessary for text-to-speech (TTS) conversion of the Ukrainian language. Relying on Ukrainian phonetics and grammar, we formulate the basic rules governing the normalization of Ukrainian letters, numerals, and measures, which help obtain Ukrainian speech data. The results are presented in tables and strings convenient for coding and further implementation into linguistic tools. These rules are necessary for the TTS tasks arising in various NLP tasks associated with speech synthesis, machine translation, information retrieval, etc.

AB We propose a framework for training non-autoregressive sequence-to-sequence models for editing tasks, where the original input sequence is iteratively edited to produce the output. We show that the imitation learning algorithms designed to train such models for machine translation introduces mismatches between training and inference that lead to undertraining and poor generalization in editing scenarios. We address this issue with two complementary strategies: 1) a roll-in policy that exposes the model to intermediate training sequences that it is more likely to encounter during inference, 2) a curriculum that presents easy-to-learn edit operations first, gradually increasing the difficulty of training samples as the model becomes competent. We show the efficacy of these strategies on two challenging English editing tasks: controllable text simplification and abstractive summarization. Our approach significantly improves output quality on both tasks and controls output complexity better on the simplification task.

AB Pre-trained contextual vision-and-language (V&L) models have achieved impressive performance on various benchmarks. However, existing models require a large amount of parallel image-caption data for pre-training Such data are costly to collect and require cumbersome curation. Inspired by unsupervised machine translation, we investigate if a strong V&L representation model can be learned through unsupervised pre-training without image-caption corpora. In particular, we propose to conduct "mask-and-predict" pre-training on text-only and image-only corpora and introduce the object tags detected by an object recognition model as anchor points to bridge two modalities. We find that such a simple approach achieves performance close to a model pre-trained with aligned data, on four English V&L benchmarks. Our work challenges the widely held notion that aligned data is necessary for V&L pre-training, while significantly reducing the amount of supervision needed for V&L models.

AB Counterfactual statements describe events that did not or cannot take place. We consider the problem of counterfactual detection (CFD) in product reviews. For this purpose, we annotate a multilingual CFD dataset from Amazon product reviews covering counterfactual statements written in English, German, and Japanese languages. The dataset is unique as it contains counterfactuals in multiple languages, covers a new application area of ecommerce reviews, and provides high quality professional annotations. We train CFD models using different text representation methods and classifiers. We find that these models are robust against the selectional biases introduced due to cue phrase-based sentence selection. Moreover, our CFD dataset is compatible with prior datasets and can be merged to learn accurate CFD models. Applying machine translation on English counterfactual examples to create multilingual data performs poorly, demonstrating the language-specificity of this problem, which has been ignored so far.

AB The task of predicting dialog acts (DA) based on conversational dialog is a key component in the development of conversational agents. Accurately predicting DAs requires a precise modeling of both the conversation and the global tag dependencies. We leverage seq2seq approaches widely adopted in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) to improve the modelling of tag sequentiality. Seq2seq models are known to learn complex global dependencies while currently proposed approaches using linear conditional random fields (CRF) only model local tag dependencies. In this work, we introduce a seq2seq model tailored for DA classification using: a hierarchical encoder, a novel guided attention mechanism and beam search applied to both training and inference. Compared to the state of the art our model does not require hand-crafted features and is trained end-to-end. Furthermore, the proposed approach achieves an unmatched accuracy score of 85% on SwDA, and state-of-the-art accuracy score of 91.6% on MRDA.

AB Person identification becomes increasingly an important task to guarantee the security of persons with the possible fraud attacks, in our life. In this paper, we propose a bimodal biometric system based on hand shape and palmprint modalities for person identification. For each modality, the SIFT descriptors (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) are extracted thanks to their advantages based on the invariance of features to possible rotation, translation, scale and illumination changes in images. These descriptors are then represented sparsely using sparse representation method. The fusion step is carried out at rank level after the classification step using SVM (Support Vector Machines) classifier, in which matching scores are transformed into probability measures. The experimentation is performed on the IITD hand database and results demonstrate encouraging performances achieving IR=99.34% which are competitive to methods fusing hand shape and palmprint modalities existing in the literature.

AB Symmetry is a pervasive phenomenon presenting itself in all forms and scales in natural and manmade environments. Its detection plays an essential role at all levels of human as well as machine perception. The recent resurging interest in computational symmetry for computer vision and computer graphics applications has motivated us to conduct a US NSF funded symmetry detection algorithm competition as a workshop affiliated with the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Conference, 2013. This competition sets a more complete benchmark for computer vision symmetry detection algorithms. In this report we explain the evaluation metric and the automatic execution of the evaluation workflow. We also present and analyze the algorithms submitted, and show their results on three test sets of real world images depicting reflection, rotation and translation symmetries respectively. This competition establishes a performance baseline for future work on symmetry detection.

AB This paper investigates the impact of word classing on a recently proposed shrinkage-based language model, Model M [5]. Model M, a class-based n-gram model, has been shown to significantly outperform word-based n-gram models on a variety of domains. In past work, word classes for Model M were induced automatically from unlabeled text using the algorithm of [2]. We take a closer look at the classing and attempt to find out whether improved classing would also translate to improved performance. In particular, we explore the use of manually-assigned classes, part-of-speech (POS) tags, and dialog state information, considering both hard classing and soft classing. In experiments with a conversational dialog system (human-machine dialog) and a speech-to-speech translation system (human-human dialog), we find that better classing can improve Model M performance by up to 3% absolute in word-error rate.

AB Multiword expressions are important for applications like machine translation and information retrieval. Any grammar engineering solution to MWEs is made up of two components: (1) the machinery to systematically capture the idiosyncrasies of different MWE classes, in the form of a system of lexical types; and (2) the lexical items by which each lexical type is populated. In this paper, we have described an approach for extraction of MWEs. This paper describes methodology that extracts multiword expression candidates from part-of-speech tagged corpora. It takes parsed file as input and extracts multiword We use input from CHARNIAK parser. We describe methodology for extracting multiword expressions (MWE) from a given English corpus. This paper also describes the methodology to extract multiword for specified domain. Mainly we concentrate on health and tourism domain.

TI The signal recognition particle and its interactions during protein
   targeting
SO CURRENT OPINION IN STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY
AB The synthesis of secretory or integral membrane proteins can be directly coupled to their translocation across or insertion into membranes. In co-translational targeting, the translation machine, the ribosome, is transferred to the respective membrane by the signal recognition particle (SIRP) and its receptor (SIR) as soon as a signal sequence emerges. Protein synthesis can continue at the membrane, with the nascent peptide chain directly inserting into the ribosome-bound protein-conducting channel, the Sec61 complex. During the past two years, several structures have been solved by crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy that represent distinct functional states of the SIRP cycle. On this basis, the first structure-based models can be suggested that explain important aspects of protein targeting, such as the SRP-ribosome and SIRP-SR interactions.

AB Previous work demonstrated that web counts can be used to approximate bigram frequencies, and thus should be useful for a wide variety of NLP tasks. So far, only two generation tasks (candidate selection for machine translation and confusion-set disambiguation) have been tested using web-scale data sets. The present paper investigates if these results generalize to tasks covering both syntax and semantics, both generation and analysis, and a larger range of n-grams. For the majority of tasks, we find that simple, unsupervised models perform better when n-gram frequencies are obtained from the web rather than from a large corpus. However, in most cases, web-based models fail to outperform more sophisticated state-of-the-art models trained on small corpora. We argue that web-based models should therefore be used as a baseline for, rather than an alternative to, standard models.

AB In this paper, we try to find empirically the optimal dimensionality in data-driven models, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) model and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) model. These models are used for building linguistic semantic knowledge which could be used in estimating contextual semantic similarity for the target word selection in English-Korean machine translation. We also facilitate k-Nearest Neighbor learning algorithm. We diversify our experiments by analyzing the covariance between the value of k in k-NN learning and accuracy of selection, in addition to that between the dimensionality and the accuracy. While we could not find regular tendency of relationship between the dimensionality and the accuracy, however, we could find the optimal dimensionality having the most sound distribution of data during experiments.

AB This paper describes the design and implementation of CACAO, a just-in-time compiler for Java, The CACAO system translates Java byte code on demand into native code for the ALPHA processor, During this translation process the stack-oriented Java byte code is transformed into a register-oriented intermediate code, Local variables and stack locations are replaced by pseudo-registers eliminating the 32-bit restriction on address types, A fast register allocation algorithm is applied to map the pseudo-registers to machine registers, During code generation, field offsets are computed for proper alignment on 64-bit architectures, Even though the CACAO system has to incur loading and compilation time, it executes Java programs up to 85 times faster than the JDK interpreter, and up to severs times faster than the kaffe JIT compiler, It is slightly slower than equivalent C programs compiled at the highest optimization level, (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Most studies on word-level Quality Estimation (QE) of machine translation focus on language-specific models. The obvious disadvantages of these approaches are the need for labelled data for each language pair and the high cost required to maintain several language-specific models. To overcome these problems, we explore different approaches to multilingual, word-level QE. We show that multilingual QE models perform on par with the current language-specific models. In the cases of zero-shot and few-shot QE, we demonstrate that it is possible to accurately predict word-level quality for any given new language pair from models trained on other language pairs. Our findings suggest that the word-level QE models based on powerful pre-trained transformers that we propose in this paper generalise well across languages, making them more useful in real-world scenarios.

AB Transformers have advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP) in many ways. At the heart of the Transformer architecture is the multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism which models pairwise interactions between the elements of the sequence. Despite its massive success, the current framework ignores interactions among different heads, leading to the problem that many of the heads are redundant in practice, which underutilizes the capacity of the model. To improve parameter efficiency, we re-formulate the MHA as a latent variable model from a probabilistic perspective. We present cascaded head-colliding attention (CODA) which explicitly models the interactions between attention heads through a hierarchical variational distribution. We conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate that CODA outperforms the transformer baseline, by 0.6 perplexity on Wikitext-103 in language modeling, and by 0.6 BLEU on WMT14 EN-DE in machine translation, due to its improvements on the parameter efficiency.(1)

AB Image captioning is currently viewed as a problem analogous to machine translation. However, it always suffers from poor interpretability, coarse or even incorrect descriptions on regional details. Moreover, information abstraction and compression, as essential characteristics of captioning, are always overlooked and seldom discussed. To overcome the shortcomings, a swell-shrink method is proposed to redefine image captioning as a compositional task which consists of two separated modules: modality transformation and text compression. The former is guaranteed to accurately transform adequate visual content into textual form while the latter consists of a hierarchical LST-M which particularly emphasizes on removing the redundancy among multiple phrases and organizing the final abstractive caption. Additionally, the order and quality of region of interest and modality processing are studied to give insights of better understanding the influence of regional visual cues on language forming. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB This paper presents the kinematics of a reconfigurable 3-DoF parallel manipulator, with three identical legs, conceived for motions of pure rotations and pure translations. The three legs own a Universal-Revolute-Universal (URU) kinematic architecture. The main characteristic of the machine is that of providing the moving platform with different kinds of motions once a small modification is produced on the kinematic structure of the three identical legs. Such change can be performed when a particular configuration of the manipulator is reached; operatively, it consists of a reconfiguration of three metamorphic universal joints, which are used to connect each limb to the ground. After a brief presentation of the device, the paper tackles the forward kinematics problem. The velocity kinematics is then presented, aimed at mapping the performance of the robot within its workspace by means of its Jacobian matrix.

AB Many Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics applications involve the generation of new texts based on some existing texts, such as summarization, text simplification and machine translation. However, there has been a serious problem haunting these applications for decades, that is, how to automatically and accurately assess quality of these applications. In this paper, we will present some preliminary results on one especially useful and challenging problem in NLP system evaluation - how to pinpoint content differences of two text passages (especially for large passages such as articles and books). Our idea is intuitive and very different from existing approaches. We treat one text passage as a small knowledge base, and ask it a large number of questions to exhaustively identify all content points in it. By comparing the correctly answered questions from two text passages, we will be able to compare their content precisely. The experiment using 2007 DUC summarization corpus clearly shows promising results.

Proper interactions between DNA and protein would lead to the onset of various biological phenomena like transcription, translation, and replication. However, the mechanisms of these well-known processes vary between prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. The exact molecular mechanisms of these processes are unknown. Therefore, it is of interest to report the comparative estimate of the different properties of the DNA binding proteins from prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. We analyzed the different sequence-based features such as the frequency of amino acids and amino acid groups in the proteins of prokaryotes and eukaryotes by statistical measures. The general pattern of differences between the various DNA binding proteins for the development of a prediction system to discriminate between these proteins between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is documented.

AB Even though Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has matured to the point of commercial applications, high error rate in some speech recognition domains remain as one of the main impediment factors to the wide adoption of speech technology, and especially for continuous large vocabulary speech recognition applications. The persistent presence of ASR errors have intensified the need to find alternative techniques to automatically detect and correct such errors. The correction of the transcription errors is very crucial not only to improve the speech recognition accuracy, but also to avoid the propagation of the errors to the subsequent language processing modules such as machine translation. In this paper, basic principles of ASR evaluation are first summarized, and then the state of the current ASR errors detection and correction research is reviewed. We focus on emerging techniques using word error rate metric. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The process of assigning part of speech for every word in a given sentence according to the context is called as part of speech tagging. Part of speech tagging (POS tagging) plays an important role in the area of natural language processing (NLP) including applications such as speech recognition, speech synthesis, natural language parsing, information retrieval, multi words term extraction, word sense disambiguation and machine translation. This paper proposes an efficient and accurate POS tagging technique for Malayalam language using hybrid approach. We propose a Conditional Random Fields(CRF) based method integrated with Rule-Based method. We use SVM based method to compare the accuracy. The corpus both tagged and untagged used for training and testing the system is in the unicode format. The tagset developed by IIIT Hyderabad for Indian Languages is used. The system is tested for selected books of Bible and perform with an accuracy of 94%.

AB Formally verified metafunctions which synthesize array multipliers and inner product hardware of arbitrary size and structure are presented. The metafunctions operate on signed-binary inputs in general and two's complement in particular. The metafunctions are higher order, as they accept structure functions which give rise to various array structures like carry-save and Wallace-tree arrays. They are shown to be equivalence-preserving transformations and correctly produce multipliers and inner product hardware of arbitrary size and structure. All the metafunctions, their associated correctness theorems, and their correctness proofs are machine executable within the higher order logic (HOL) theorem prover. The function expressions produced by the metafunctions can be used as hardware synthesis descriptions or as comparison functions for Boolean-comparison-based systems. In addition to the definitions written in HOL, the major definitions are written in a more informal functional programming language-like notation which should facilitate translation of the synthesis functions to other hardware description languages.

TI Effective Exploitation of Posterior Information for Attention-Based
   Speech Recognition
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB End-to-end attention-based modeling is increasingly popular for tackling sequence-tosequence mapping tasks. Traditional attention mechanisms utilize prior input information to derive attention, which then conditions the output. However, we believe that knowledge of posterior output information may convey some advantage when modeling attention. Arecent technique proposed for machine translation called the posterior attention model (PAM) demonstrates that posterior output information can be used in that way for machine translation. This paper explores the use of posterior information for attention modeling in an automatic speech recognition (ASR) task. We demonstrate that direct application of PAM to ASR is unsatisfactory, due to two deficiencies; Firstly, PAM adopts attention based weighted single-frame output prediction by assuming a single focused attention variable, whereas wider contextual information from acoustic frames is important for output prediction in ASR. Secondly, in addition to the well-known exposure bias problem, PAM introduces additional mismatches in attention training and inference calculations. We present extensive experiments combining a number of alternative approaches to solving these problems, leading to a high performance technique which we call extended PAM (EPAM). To counter the first deficiency, EPAM modifies the encoder to introduce additional context information for output prediction. The second deficiency is overcome in EPAM through a two part solution of a mismatch penalty term and an alternate learning strategy. The former applies a divergence-based loss to correct the mismatch bias distribution, while the latter employs a novel update strategy which relies on introducing iterative inference steps alongside each training step. In experiments with both WSJ-80hrs and Switchboard-300hrs datasets we found significant performance gains. For example, the full EPAM system model achieved a word error rate (WER) of 10.6% on the WSJ eval92 test set, compared to 11.6% for traditional prior-attention modeling. Meanwhile, on the Switchboard eval2000 test set, we achieved 16.3% WER compared to the traditional method WER of

TI Signs unsigned and meanings not meant: linguistic theory and
   hypothetical, simulated, imitation and meaningless language
SO LANGUAGE SCIENCES
AB Standard linguistic theory assumes that meanings are attached to linguistic artefacts by some semantic component during their production yet prior to their material realization, and it is those meanings that are decoded by the recipient/interpreter of the realized signs according to the same mental machinery/semantic component inside their brain. Rather than theorizing a single sign that is encoded, materialized, transmitted and then decoded, integrationism assumes that signs are created not only by speakers/writers but also by hearers/readers. This paper looks at linguistic artefacts that are not created to mean anything but to do something. The successful accomplishment of those actions depends entirely upon the recipient recreating them as meaningful linguistic signs, no matter what the meaning assigned to them. Examples of such linguistic artifacts to be examined are simulated language as a product of "user-friendly" software, whether programmed as potential aids for human use of technical systems (e.g. Google's "Did you mean...? and machine translation) or as deceptions (spam and texts inserted into emails to "fool" anti-spam programs), and utterances whose meanings have no relation to what the standard theory regards as lexical meaning nor to interpretative rules (e.g. glossalalia). Of particular interest are the hypothetical language of examples in linguistic theory (Bill is a farmer but John is not; Colorless green ideas sleep furiously) in which nothing is meant other than "this text represents a certain structure," and the reproduction of texts that would be meaningful in one context but whose sole meaning is reduced to technical manipulation. In all of these cases a linguistic sign is produced (or its production programmed) by someone intent on accomplishing a certain end not through the recipient's comprehension of a sign and its lexical or discourse meaning but by the human recipient's creation of a linguistic sign on the one hand, or software unable to distinguish meaningful signs from meaningless textual strings on the other.

The second stage takes the output of the first stage as input (cropped car images) to train EfficientNet B3 for the image recognition task. Using predefined 3D Models, we substitute each vehicle on the scene with its match using the rotation matrix and translation vector from the first stage to get the 3D detection bounding boxes and segmentation masks. We trained our models on an open-source dataset (ApolloCar3D). Our method outperforms all published solutions in terms of 6 degrees of freedom error (6 DoF err).

SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Biology exploits a transcription-translation approach to deliver structural information from DNA to the protein-building machines with high precision. Here, we show how the structural information of small synthetic molecules could be used to guide the assembly of inorganic nanoparticles into diversified yet long-range ordered superstructures, enabling the information transfer across four or five orders of magnitude in length scale. We designed three perylene diimide (PDI) based isomers differing by their site-specific substitutions of the methyl group, which were able to supramolecularly polymerize into diverse structures. Importantly, coassembly of these PDI isomers with nanoparticles (NPs) could produce diverse long-range ordered nanoparticle superstructures, including one-dimensional NPs chains, double helical NPs assemblies and two-dimensional NPs superlattices. Equally important, we demonstrate that the information originated from small molecules could diversify the functions of the self-assembled nanocomposites.

AB Recent work has demonstrated the importance of dealing with Multi-Word Terms (MWTs) in several Natural Language Processing applications. In particular, MWTs pose serious challenges for alignment and machine translation systems because of their syntactic and semantic properties. Thus, developing algorithms that handle MWTs is becoming essential for many NLP tasks. However, the availability of bilingual and more generally multi-lingual resources is limited, especially for low-resourced languages and in specialized domains. In this paper, we propose an approach for building comparable corpora and bilingual term dictionaries that help evaluate bilingual term alignment in comparable corpora. To that aim, we exploit parallel corpora to perform automatic bilingual MWT extraction and comparable corpus construction. Parallel information helps to align bilingual MWTs and makes it easier to build comparable specialized sub-corpora. Experimental validation on an existing dataset and on manually annotated data shows the interest of the proposed methodology.

TI Halcyon: an accurate basecaller exploiting an encoder-decoder model with
   monotonic attention
SO BIOINFORMATICS
AB Motivation: In recent years, nanopore sequencing technology has enabled inexpensive long-read sequencing, which promises reads longer than a few thousand bases. Such long-read sequences contribute to the precise detection of structural variations and accurate haplotype phasing. However, deciphering precise DNA sequences from noisy and complicated nanopore raw signals remains a crucial demand for downstream analyses based on higher-quality nanopore sequencing, although various basecallers have been introduced to date.
   Results: To address this need, we developed a novel basecaller, Halcyon, that incorporates neural-network techniques frequently used in the field of machine translation. Our model employs monotonic-attention mechanisms to learn semantic correspondences between nucleotides and signal levels without any pre-segmentation against input signals. We evaluated performance with a human whole-genome sequencing dataset and demonstrated that Halcyon outperformed existing third-party basecallers and achieved competitive performance against the latest Oxford Nanopore Technologies' basecallers.

AB The ability to communicate is one of the most important rights of a healthy individual. Hearing-impaired citizens face several challenges: There is not a common sign language and the percentage of the population that understands a given sign language is negligible. The benefits of a system capable of translating from a sign language, in particular, the Mexican Sign language, to text, is outstanding. In this contribution, we describe such system. It is based on convolutional neural networks, which are particularly useful tool to extract relevant features from images. The sign language is captured in hundreds of images, and the system is able to translate them to text via several convolutional stages and transfer learning with 91% accuracy. We report the architecture and performance of the system.

AB Learning fine-grained distinctions between vocabulary items is a key challenge in learning a new language. For example, the noun "wall" has different lexical manifestations in Spanish - "pared" refers to an indoor wall while "muro" refers to an outside wall. However, this variety of lexical distinction may not be obvious to non-native learners unless the distinction is explained in such a way. In this work, we present a method for automatically identifying fine-grained lexical distinctions, and extracting concise descriptions explaining these distinctions in a human- and machine-readable format. We confirm the quality of these extracted descriptions in a language learning setup for two languages, Spanish and Greek, where we use them to teach non-native speakers when to translate a given ambiguous word into its different possible translations. Code and data are publicly released here.(1)

TI Structural basis of ClpXP recognition and unfolding of ssrA-tagged
   substrates
SO ELIFE
AB When ribosomes fail to complete normal translation, all cells have mechanisms to ensure degradation of the resulting partial proteins to safeguard proteome integrity. In Escherichia coli and other eubacteria, the tmRNA system rescues stalled ribosomes and adds an ssrA tag or degron to the C-terminus of the incomplete protein, which directs degradation by the AAA+ ClpXP protease. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of ClpXP bound to the ssrA degron. C-terminal residues of the ssrA degron initially bind in the top of an otherwise closed ClpX axial channel and subsequently move deeper into an open channel. For short-degron protein substrates, we show that unfolding can occur directly from the initial closed-channel complex. For longer degron substrates, our studies illuminate how ClpXP transitions from specific recognition into a nonspecific unfolding and translocation machine. Many AAA+ proteases and protein-remodeling motors are likely to employ similar multistep recognition and engagement strategies.

AB This paper presents an approach for developing a task-oriented dialog system for less-resourced languages in scenarios where no training data is available. Both intent classification and slot filling are tackled. We project the existing annotations in rich-resource languages by means of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and posterior word alignments. We then compare training on the projected monolingual data with direct model transfer alternatives. Intent Classifiers and slot filling sequence taggers are implemented using a BiLSTM architecture or by fine-tuning BERT transformer models. Models learnt exclusively from Basque projected data provide better accuracies for slot filling. Combining Basque projected train data with rich-resource languages data outperforms consistently models trained solely on projected data for intent classification. At any rate, we achieve competitive performance in both tasks, with accuracies of 81% for intent classification and 77% for slot filling.

AB Learning non-deterministic dynamics and intrinsic factors from images obtained through physical experiments is at the intersection of machine learning and material science. Disentangling the origins of uncertainties involved in microstructure growth, for example, is of great interest because future states vary due to thermal fluctuation and other environmental factors. To this end we propose a flow-based image-to-image model, called Flow U-Net with Squeeze modules (FUNS), that allows us to disentangle the features while retaining the ability to generate high-quality diverse images from condition images. Our model successfully captures probabilistic phenomena by incorporating a U-Net-like architecture into the flow-based model. In addition, our model automatically separates the diversity of target images into condition-dependent/independent parts. We demonstrate that the quality and diversity of the images generated for microstructure growth and CelebA datasets outperform existing variational generative models.

AB This work describes an investigation of formal grammar with application to text mining. It is an important area since text is the most widespread type of data and it contains a lot of potentially useful information. Unstructured nature of text requires other methods for its processing, in contrast to other types of data mining. In this work, the authors propose an original approach to text mining by making a parse tree for each sentence using regular grammar and creating an ontology and provide a demonstration of this system being implemented in a constrained scenario. This ontology can be used for different tasks, ranging from expert systems to automatic machine translation. The ontology is a network consisting of concepts linked by relations. The authors developed a new system to implement proposed approach working in different languages.

AB Compounding is widespread in highly inflectional languages with a quarter of all nouns created by composition. In our field of study, the German medical language, the amount of compounds significantly outnumbers this figure with 64 %. Thus, their correct splitting is a high-impact preprocessing step for any NLP-based application. In this work we address two challenges of medical decomposition: First, we introduce the consideration of unknown constituents in order to split compounds that were not recognized as such so far. Second, our approach builds on the corpus-based approach of Koehn and Knight and adds semantic knowledge from domain ontologies to increase the accuracy during disambiguation of the various split options. Using this first-of-a-kind semantic approach in a study on decomposition of German medical compounds, we outperform the existing approaches by far.

AB This paper presents first steps toward a large vocabulary continuous speech recognition system (LVCSR) for conversational Mandarin-English code-switching (CS) speech. We applied state-of-the-art techniques such as speaker adaptive and discriminative training to build the first baseline system on the SEAME corpus [1] (South East Asia Mandarin-English). For acoustic modeling, we applied different phone merging approaches based on the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and Bhattacharyya distance in combination with discriminative training to improve accuracy. On language model level, we investigated statistical machine translation (SMT) based text generation approaches for building code-switching language models. Furthermore, we integrated the provided information from a language identification system (LID) into the decoding process by using a multi-stream approach. Our best 2-pass system achieves a Mixed Error Rate (MER) of 36.6% on the SEAME development set.

The system is executed on a set of news videos in English and encompasses several other components including an automatic speech recognition system for English, an English-to-Turkish machine translation system, a news video database, and a semantic video retrieval interface. The performance evaluation demonstrates that the system components achieve promising results which provides evidence for the applicability of the system. The proposed system and its application on the video set are significant as they constitute a plausible case study targeting at the problem of multilingual video indexing and retrieval utilizing information extraction as the central technique for semantic video indexing.

AB The design of translation invariant and locally defined binary image operators over large windows is made difficult by decreased statistical precision and increased training time. We present a complete framework for the application of stacked design, a recently proposed technique to create two-stage operators that circumvents that difficulty. We propose a novel algorithm, based on Information Theory, to find groups of pixels that should be used together to predict the Output Value. We employ this algorithm to automate the process of creating a set of first-level operators that are later combined in a global operator. We also propose a principled way to guide this combination, by using feature selection and model comparison. Experimental results Show that the proposed framework leads to better results than single stage design. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper investigates the issue of automatic segmentation of speech recordings for broadcast news (BN) and broadcast conversation (BC) speech recognition. Our previous segmentation algorithm often exhibited high deletion errors, where some speech segments were misclassified as non-speech and thus were never passed on to the recognizer. In contrast with our previous segmentation models, which only differentiated between speech and non-speech segments, phonetic knowledge is applied to represent speech by using multiple models for different types of speech segments. Moreover, the "pronunciation" of the speech segment has been modified to loosen the minimum duration constraint. This method makes use of language specific knowledge, while keeping the number of models low to achieve fast segmentation. Experimental results show that the new segmenter outperforms our previous segmenter significantly, particularly in reducing deletion errors.

AB Automatic paraphrasing has numerous applications such as query reformulation in query-answering systems, dialog systems, and machine translation. Recently, due to the limitations of automatic paraphrasing systems, crowdsourcing has been growing in popularity for obtaining corpora of paraphrases. Since crowdsourced paraphrases are generated by crowd workers with varied skills and motivations, such paraphrases may suffer from various quality issues (e.g., semantic and linguistic errors). Such quality issues stem from the lack of quality assessment methods for open-ended text in crowdsourcing platforms (e.g., Mechanical Turk). Thus unqualified workers and spammers may generate erroneous paraphrases. Crowdsourced paraphrases must be verified to remove erroneous paraphrases, imposing an extra cost. Detecting such erroneous paraphrases requires an understanding of how malicious workers generate paraphrases. In this paper, we provide a taxonomy of cheating behaviors in crowdsourced paraphrasing. We also propose an effective approach to detect cheating behaviors.

AB The algorithm of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for automatic target recognition consists of two stages: feature extraction and classification. The quality of extracted features has significant impacts on the final classification performance. This paper presents a SAR automatic target classification method based on the wavelet-scattering convolution network. By introducing a deep scattering convolution network with complex wavelet filters over spatial and angular variables, robust feature representations can be extracted across various scales and angles without training data. Conventional dimension reduction and a support vector machine classifier are followed to complete the classification task. The proposed method is then tested on the moving and stationary target acquisition and recognition (MSTAR) benchmark data set and achieves an average accuracy of 97.63% on the classification of ten-class targets without data augmentation.

For this type of sensors, the energy supplied for measurement and for the communication of measured data back to the reader is provided exclusively by the reader via the electromagnetic field. Therefore, it was important for the device to be designed so that the power consumption be minimal. For this reason, our sensor glove is designed using devices capable of harvesting the electromagnetic energy from the reader, monitor this energy and consume it only when needed by using a microcontroller which features several very low power consumption modes.

AB We present on extraction of Co-reference chains from a document. Co-reference chains show cohesiveness of the document. The cohesiveness in the document is marked by cohesive markers such as Reference, Substitution, Ellipsis, Conjunction, and Lexical cohesion. In this work we will take up Pronominal, Reflexives, R-expressions and form Co-reference chains for each of the above markers. The Co-reference chains are very essential in building sophisticated natural language processing applications such as information extraction, profile generator, entity specific text summarization etc. It is also needed in machine translation and information retrieval task. Though pronominal resolution is dealt in few Indian languages such as Tamil, Hindi, Bengali, Malayalam, extraction of co-reference chains in Indian languages is not attempted. We extract co-reference chains from Tamil language text. We have evaluated the system with real time data and results are encouraging.

AB In this paper, we suggest a stemmer for Gujarati language, which conflates terms by affix removal. Affix is combination of suffix and prefix. Suffix is attached after root word whereas prefix is attached before it. We are using suffix rules, prefix rules and substitution rules. As per our knowledge, negligible work has been done based on prefix removal in Gujarati language. We are using dictionary lookup and customized rules for Gujarati language. The dictionary is organized as red-black tree data structure. We are analyzing result on correctness of stemmer based on over-stemming and under-stemming errors. The steamer is entirely rule-based, for which, we attained an accuracy of 96.63% with the help of specially farmed suffix-stripping, substitution and prefix rules. The system developed might be useful in applications such as information Retrieval, dictionary search document summarization, as preprocessing module in many NLP problems, for Machine Translation, et al.

TI Proteomic maps of breast cancer subtypes
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Systems-wide profiling of breast cancer has almost always entailed RNA and DNA analysis by microarray and sequencing techniques. Marked developments in proteomic technologies now enable very deep profiling of clinical samples, with high identification and quantification accuracy. We analysed 40 oestrogen receptor positive (luminal), Her2 positive and triple negative breast tumours and reached a quantitative depth of >10,000 proteins. These proteomic profiles identified functional differences between breast cancer subtypes, related to energy metabolism, cell growth, mRNA translation and cell-cell communication. Furthermore, we derived a signature of 19 proteins, which differ between the breast cancer subtypes, through support vector machine (SVM)-based classification and feature selection. Remarkably, only three proteins of the signature were associated with gene copy number variations and eleven were also reflected on the mRNA level. These breast cancer features revealed by our work provide novel insights that may ultimately translate to development of subtype-specific therapeutics.

AB This paper proposes a processing for rich inflectional languages such as Russian and Kazakh, based on finite state transducers with multivalued mappings. We propose to simplify grammar of inflectional languages and use multivalued mappings. An advantage of finite state transducers with multivalued mappings proposed in this paper is that it automatically generates possible alternatives of words' grammatical characteristics, while in existing rule-based technologies alternatives are written by hand. Ambiguity of grammatical characteristics is solved by comparing alternative grammatical characteristics between adjacent words in the source sentence and matching grammatical characteristics are selected. Here an advantage of proposed method should be noted, it does not require explicit description of matching agreements for grammatical characteristics of adjacent words in a sentence, as it is done in existing rule-based methods.

AB The case method is an effective teaching technique for business management education. The main objective with this method is to spark discussion and share ideas. However, discussions are generally conducted in a single-language environment, which is difficult for non-native speakers. We therefore developed a multilingual case method system for global classroom environments to benefit students of different cultures and who speak various languages. The system provides a learning environment in which students can communicate in their native language through the Language-Grid service. We evaluated our system by conducting experiments using a short case of an unresolved cultural conflict. Japanese and Korean students participated in the experiments. The system enabled sufficiently effective communication in their native languages. We were also able to address cultural differences; for example, Japanese students tend to think of cultural conflicts more negatively than Korean students.

AB Part of Speech (POS) tagging is an important problem and is one of the first steps included in many tasks in natural language processing. It affects directly on the accuracy of many, other problems such as Syntax Parsing, Word Sense Disambiguation, and Machine Translation. Stochastic models solve this problem relatively well, but they Still make mistakes. Transformation-based learning (TBL) is a solution which can be used to improve stochastic taggers by learning a set of tran formation rules. However its rule learning algorithm has the disadvantages that rule templates must be prepared by hand and only rules are instances of rule templates can be generated. In this paper we propose a model to learn transformation rules without rule templates. This model considers the rule learning problem as a feature selection problem. Experiments on Penn TreeBank showed that the proposal model reduces errors of stochastic taggers with some tags.

AB This article presents the design of a syntactico-semantic dictionary for Polish, i.e., a valence dictionary enriched with certain semantic informations. Valence dictionaries, specifying the number and morphosyntactic form of arguments of verbs, are useful in many Natural Language Processing applications, including deep parsing, e.g., for the purpose of machine translation, shallow parsing, e.g., for the purpose of information extraction, and rule-based morphosyntactic disambiguation, e.g., for the purpose of corpus annotation. An approach based on recent results in formal and computational linguistics is proposed, which takes into consideration the morphosyntactic and syntactic structure of Polish and which avoids various known problems of previous valence dictionaries, some of them stemming from their impoverished theoretical framework, unable to take proper care of the syntax-semantics interface, case variations and raising predicates. An implementation of a grammar of Polish deploying the ideas presented here is currently under development.

AB Binary code analysis allows analyzing binary code without having access to the corresponding source code. A binary, after disassembly, is expressed in an assembly language. This inspires us to approach binary analysis by leveraging ideas and techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP), a fruitful area focused on processing text of various natural languages. We notice that binary code analysis and NLP share many analogical topics, such as semantics extraction, classification, and code/text comparison. This work thus borrows ideas from NLP to address two important code similarity comparison problems. (I) Given a pair of basic blocks of different instruction set architectures (ISAs), determining whether their semantics is similar; and (II) given a piece of code of interest, determining if it is contained in another piece of code of a different ISA. The solutions to these two problems have many applications, such as cross-architecture vulnerability discovery and code plagiarism detection.
   Despite the evident importance of Problem I, existing solutions are either inefficient or imprecise. Inspired by Neural Machine Translation (NMT), which is a new approach that tackles text across natural languages very well, we regard instructions as words and basic blocks as sentences, and propose a novel cross(assembly)-lingual deep learning approach to solving Problem I, attaining high efficiency and precision. Many solutions have been proposed to determine whether two pieces of code, e.g., functions, are equivalent (called the equivalence problem), which is different from Problem II (called the containment problem). Resolving the cross-architecture code containment problem is a new and more challenging endeavor. Employing our technique for cross-architecture basic-block comparison, we propose the first solution to Problem II. We implement a prototype system INNEREYE and perform a comprehensive evaluation. A comparison between our approach and existing approaches to Problem I shows that our system outperforms them in terms of accuracy, efficiency and scalability. The case studies applying the system demonstrate that our solution to Problem II is effective. Moreover, this research showcases how to apply ideas and techniques from NLP to large-scale binary code analysis.

AB In this paper, we propose a generic learning method for training conditional generative adversarial networks on audio data. This makes it possible to apply the same generic approach as described in this study to problems that previously required completely different loss formulations when learning audio data. This method can be useful for labeling noises with a certain number of identical frequencies, generating speech labels corresponding to each frequency, and generating audio data for noise cancellation. To achieve this, we propose a sound restoration process based on U-Net, called Sound U-net. In this study, we realized a wide applicability of our system, owing to its ease of implementation without a parameter adjustment, as well as a reduction in the training time for audio data. During the experiment, reasonable results were obtained without manually adjusting the loss function.

TI An optical-flow-based monitoring method for measuring translational

SO PRODUCTION ENGINEERING-RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB This paper presents a novel method for a precise localization of the automated-fiber-placement head, without the need for a data access to the machine control. It is based on a sub-pixel accurate optical-flow-algorithm which determines information about the heads movement by means of the material flow in sequences of IR images. Using local curvatures in the temperature field of the IR images, feature matrices are created which can locally be compared to the features of successive images. Thus, the translation between images become visible. This enables the possibility to perform an accurate (16.8 mu m) and self-sufficient process monitoring that additionally is capable of capturing the motion and position information of the AFP system and can be linked to existing algorithms for defect detection and classification.

AB We train neural machine translation (NMT) models from English to six target languages, using NMT encoder representations to predict ancestor constituent labels of source language words. We find that NMT encoders learn similar source syntax regardless of NMT target language, relying on explicit morphosyntactic cues to extract syntactic features from source sentences. Furthermore, the NMT encoders outperform RNNs trained directly on several of the constituent label prediction tasks, suggesting that NMT encoder representations can be used effectively for natural language tasks involving syntax. However, both the NMT encoders and the directly-trained RNNs learn substantially different syntactic information from a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) parser. Despite lower overall accuracy scores, the PCFG often performs well on sentences for which the RNN-based models perform poorly, suggesting that RNN architectures are constrained in the types of syntax they can learn.

AB Modern neural networks do not always produce well-calibrated predictions, even when trained with a proper scoring function such as cross-entropy. In classification settings, simple methods such as isotonic regression or temperature scaling may be used in conjunction with a held-out dataset to calibrate model outputs. However, extending these methods to structured prediction is not always straightforward or effective; furthermore, a held-out calibration set may not always be available. In this paper, we study ensemble distillation as a general framework for producing wellcalibrated structured prediction models while avoiding the prohibitive inference-time cost of ensembles. We validate this framework on two tasks: named-entity recognition and machine translation. We find that, across both tasks, ensemble distillation produces models which retain much of, and occasionally improve upon, the performance and calibration benefits of ensembles, while only requiring a single model during test-time.

AB Embedding is widely used in most natural language processing. e.g., neural machine translation, text classification, text abstraction and sentiment analysis etc. Word-based embedding is faster and character-based embedding performs better. In this paper, we explore a way to combine these two embeddings to bridge the gap between word-based and character-based embedding in speed and performance. In the experiments and analysis of Hybrid Embedding, we found it's difficult to make these two different embeddings generate the same embedding vector, but we still obtain a comparable result. According to the results of analysis, we explore a form of character-based embedding called Cached Embedding that can achieve almost the same performance and reduce the extra training time by almost half compared to character-based embedding.

AB In this article, we study the problem of parsing a math problem into logical forms. It is an essential preprocessing step for automatically solving math problems. Most of the existing studies about semantic parsing mainly focused on the single-sentence level. However, for parsing math problems, we need to take the information of multiple sentences into consideration. To achieve the task, we formulate the task as a machine translation problem and extend the sequence-to-sequence model with a novel two-encoder architecture and a word-level selective mechanism. For training and evaluating the proposed method, we construct a large-scale dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed two-encoder architecture and word-level selective mechanism could bring significant improvement. The proposed method can achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Mining parallel sentences from comparable corpora is important. Most previous work relies on supervised systems, which are trained on parallel data, thus their applicability is problematic in low-resource scenarios. Recent developments in building unsupervised bilingual word embeddings made it possible to mine parallel sentences based on cosine similarities of source and target language words. We show that relying only on this information is not enough, since sentences often have similar words but different meanings. We detect continuous parallel segments in sentence pair candidates and rely on them when mining parallel sentences. We show better mining accuracy on three language pairs in a standard shared task on artificial data. We also provide the first experiments showing that parallel sentences mined from real life sources improve unsupervised MT. Our code is available, we hope it will be used to support low-resource MT research.

AB Modern neural network architectures are powerful models. They have been proven efficient in many fields, such as imaging and acoustic. However, these neural networks involve a long-running and time-consuming process. To accelerate the training process, we propose a two-stage approach based on data analysis and focus on the gravity center concept. The neural network is first trained on reduced data represented by a set of centroids of the original data points, and then the learned weights are used to initialize a second training phase of the neural network over the full-blown data. The design of deep neural networks is extremely difficult, and the primary objective is to achieve high performance. In this study, we apply the Taguchi method to select good values for the factors required to build the proposed architecture.

AB During software maintenance, code comments help developers comprehend programs and reduce additional time spent on reading and navigating source code. Unfortunately, these comments are often mismatched, missing or outdated in the software projects. Developers have to infer the functionality from the source code. This paper proposes a new approach named DeepCom to automatically generate code comments for Java methods. The generated comments aim to help developers understand the functionality of Java methods. DeepCom applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to learn from a large code corpus and generates comments from learned features. We use a deep neural network that analyzes structural information of Java methods for better comments generation. We conduct experiments on a large-scale Java corpus built from 9,714 open source projects from GitHub. We evaluate the experimental results on a machine translation metric. Experimental results demonstrate that our method DeepCom outperforms the state-of-the-art by a substantial margin.

As well as, Arabic doesn't have an equivalent number of linguistic corpuses as compared to other languages like English. In this paper, we focus on building our corpus of Arab questions-texts. We present a method for recovering text passages. This method is based on a real automatic interrogation of Google, in order to generate passages of texts and answer the factual questions. The first part of this paper describes the formal details about this method; the second part presents some experiments and results that validate our method. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB Speech segmentation is important in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT). Particularly in N-best list rescoring processing, generalizing N-best lists consisting of as many as candidates from a decoding lattice requires proper utterance segmentation. In lecture speech recognition, only long audio recordings are provided without any utterance segmentation information. In addition, rather than only speech event, other acoustic events, e.g., laugh, applause, etc., are included in the recordings. Traditional speech segmentation algorithms for ASR focus on acoustic cues in segmentation, while in MT, speech text segmentation algorithms pay much attention to linguistic cues. In this study, we propose a three-stage speech segmentation framework by integrating both the acoustic and linguistic cues. We tested the segmentation framework for lecture speech recognition. Our results showed the effectiveness of the proposed segmentation algorithm.

TI Graph representation of the syntactic structure of the Lithuanian
   sentence
SO INFORMATICA
AB The paper offers a new way of presenting the structure of a sentence. None of the two widely known methods of representation the syntactic structure of a sentence can be of any avail when applied to the Lithuanian language. Neither the tree, based on the phrase structure principle, nor the tree, suggested by the dependency grammar, do reflect all the syntactic information, which a Lithuanian sentence contains.
   The paper points out the differences between the Lithuanian language and other languages as well as presents the reasons why a Lithuanian sentence should be represented by a graph.
   The paper presents a generalized structure of a simple sentence in the Lithuanian language, namely, such a structure, which would embrace all the possible instances of a Lithuanian simple sentence. Every sentence of the text would have to activate only one path in the generalized structure.

AB Identification of script in multi-lingual documents is essential for many language dependent applications such as machine translation and optical character recognition. Techniques for script identification generally require large areas for operation so that sufficient information is available. Such assumption is nullified in Indian context, as there is an interspersion of words of two different scripts in most documents. In this paper, techniques to identify the script of a word are discussed. Two different approaches have been proposed and tested. The first method structures words into 3 distinct spatial zones and utilizes the information on the spatial spread of a word in upper and lower zones, together with the character density, in order to identify the script. The second technique analyzes the directional energy distribution of a word using Gabor filters with suitable frequencies and orientations. Words with various font styles and sizes have been used for the testing of the proposed algorithms and the results obtained are quite encouraging.

AB This paper describes SEMPER, a programming environment for developing parallel object-oriented applications on massively parallel architectures.  SEMPER is based on the PO model.
   The aim of the paper is to show that the features of parallelism of the support integrate well with the properties of the object paradigm.  In addition, another goal is to show the effectiveness of the SEMPER support for an object-oriented programming environment based on the PO model, on transputer-based architectures.
   SEMPER is currently implemented on a MEIKO Computing Surface machine.  In this paper, the experience gained in the design of such a prototype is illustrated.
   The paper addresses new areas of interventions, in the sense of both designing high-level tools to assist users (e.g. PO translation and automatic mapping) and enhancing the provided virtual support level toward dynamicity.

TI Synset Based Multilingual Dictionary: Insights, Applications and

AB In this paper, we report our effort at the standardization, design and partial implementation of a multilingual dictionary in the context of three large scale projects, viz., (i) Cross Lingual Information Retrieval, (ii) English to Indian Language Machine Translation, and (iii) Indian Language to Indian Language Machine Translation. These projects are large scale, because each project involves 8-10 partners spread across the length and breadth of India with great amount of language diversity. The dictionary is based not on words but on WordNet SYNSETS, i. e., concepts. Identical dictionary architecture is used for all the three projects, where source to target language transfer is initiated by concept to concept mapping. The whole dictionary can be looked upon as an M X N matrix where M is the number of synsets (rows) and N is the number of languages (columns). This architecture maps the lexeme(s) of one language-standing for a concept-with the lexeme(s) of other languages standing for the same concept. In actual usage, a preliminary WSD identifies the correct row for a word and then a lexical choice procedure identifies the correct target word from the corresponding synset. Currently the multilingual dictionary is being developed for 11 languages: English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Urdu, Tamil, Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam and Oriya. Our work with this framework makes us aware of many benefits of this multilingual concept based scheme over language pair-wise dictionaries. The pivot synsets, with which all other languages link, come from Hindi. Interesting insights emerge and challenges are faced in dealing with linguistic and cultural diversities. Economy of representation is achieved on many fronts and at many levels. We have been eminently assisted by our long standing experience in building the WordNets of two major languages of India, viz., Hindi and Marathi which rank 5th (similar to 500 million) and 14th (similar to 70 million) respectively in the world in terms of the number of people speaking these languages.

TI Artificial intelligence in reaction prediction and chemical synthesis
SO CURRENT OPINION IN CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Recent years have seen a sudden spurt in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) methods for computational reaction modeling and prediction. Given the diversity of the techniques, we believe it would be helpful to assess them using a broad conceptual framework within which the different approaches reside. Towards that goal, we categorize the different methods into symbolic AI, purely data-driven numeric AI, and hybrid AI methods. Symbolic AI-based approaches require the translation of a priori chemistry knowledge into clearly encoded rules and instructions. Purely data-driven numeric AI methods utilize recent advances in machine learning, generally without explicit incorporation of a priori domain knowledge. In between these two extremes, we have hybrid AI, which integrates domain knowledge with data-driven techniques. We review recent progress across these broad areas to highlight their benefits as well as limitations and provide a future outlook of this rapidly evolving field.

AB Sentiment Analysis is a major element in Artificial Intelligence. Its applications include machine translation, text analysis, computational linguistics, etc. In most cases, classification of sentiment is done into two or three classes. But in some situations, for example rating a product from Amazon, there are multiple classes. One major challenge in such tasks is the class imbalance which reduces the accuracy by making the model biased. To deal with this problem, we use oversampling to reduce the class imbalance of the dataset before training the model. In this research work, first we use variations of recurrent neural networks, such as simple RNN, GRU, LSTM and Bidirectional LSTM, to find out which model performs the best in multi-class classification of sentiment. Then, we use that model to understand the effect of oversampling a dataset before using it to train a model.

AB Automatic evaluation of text generation tasks (e.g. machine translation, text summarization, image captioning and video description) usually relies heavily on task-specific metrics, such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and ROUGE (Lin, 2004). They, however, are abstract numbers and are not perfectly aligned with human assessment. This suggests inspecting detailed examples as a complement to identify system error patterns. In this paper, we present VizSeq, a visual analysis toolkit for instance-level and corpus-level system evaluation on a wide variety of text generation tasks. It supports multimodal sources and multiple text references, providing visualization in Jupyter notebook or a web app interface. It can be used locally or deployed onto public servers for centralized data hosting and benchmarking. It covers most common n-gram based metrics accelerated with multiprocessing, and also provides latest embedding-based metrics such as BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019).

SO TRENDS IN BIOCHEMICAL SCIENCES
AB Great progress has been made toward solving the atomic structure of the ribosome, which is the main biosynthetic machine in cells, but we still do not have a full picture of exactly how cellular ribosomes function. Based on the analysis of crystallographic and electron microscopy data, we propose a basic model of the structural organization of ribosomes into a compartment. This compartment is regularly formed by arrays of ribosomal tetramers made up of two dimers that are actually facing in opposite directions. The compartment functions as the main 'factory' for the production of cellular proteins. The model is consistent with the existing biochemical and genetic data. We also consider the functional connections of such a compartment with cellular transcription and ribosomal biogenesis.

AB The interpretation of non-coding variants still constitutes a major challenge in the application of whole-genome sequencing in Mendelian disease, especially for single-nucleotide and other small non-coding variants. Here we present Genomiser, an analysis framework that is able not only to score the relevance of variation in the non-coding genome, but also to associate regulatory variants to specific Mendelian diseases. Genomiser scores variants through either existing methods such as CADD or a bespoke machine learning method and combines these with allele frequency, regulatory sequences, chromosomal topological domains, and phenotypic relevance to discover variants associated to specific Mendelian disorders. Overall, Genomiser is able to identify causal regulatory variants as the top candidate in 77% of simulated whole genomes, allowing effective detection and discovery of regulatory variants in Mendelian disease.

It uses minimum amount of search space and memory to provide top best matches with high accuracy against a query image. Control points are extracted using Speeded-Up Robust Feature points (SURF) operator. A pre-processing technique consisting of mean centring, principal components, rotation and normalization has been proposed to make these control points invariant to translation, rotation and scaling. The modified geometric hashing is used to hash these control points to index of the hash table. The indexing scheme has been tested on FERET face database which has achieved 100% hit rate for top 4 best matches. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We applied state-of-the-art techniques such as speaker adaptive and discriminative training to build the first baseline system on the SEAME corpus [1] (South East Asia Mandarin-English). For acoustic modeling, we applied different phone merging approaches based on the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and Bhattacharyya distance in combination with discriminative training to improve accuracy. On language model level, we investigated statistical machine translation (SMT) based text generation approaches for building code-switching language models. Furthermore, we integrated the provided information from a language identification system (LID) into the decoding process by using a multi-stream approach. Our best 2-pass system achieves a Mixed Error Rate (MER) of 36.6% on the SEAME development set.

AB Connecting automatic speech recognizers (ASRs) and language analyzers is difficult since they may be based on differences in part-of-speech (POS) systems; the latter cannot directly analyze the outputs of the former. In addition, in unsegmented languages such as Japanese, the ASR outputs are likely to have different word segmentation from that of the language analyzer inputs because they are individually developed.
   A conventional approach is to generate raw texts from the ASR outputs and re-analyze them using a morphological analyzer. However, if the ASR outputs contain recognition errors, the morphological analyzer incorrectly analyzes them even though they contain correctly recognized words.
   To avoid this problem, we propose a morpheme conversion method that directly converts ASR outputs into morpheme sequences suitable for the language analyzers. Our experiments show that morpheme conversion is more robust than the conventional approach against recognition errors.

AB This paper describes a two level classification algorithm to discriminate the handwritten elements from the printed text in a printed document. The proposed technique is independent of size, slant, orientation. translation and other variations in handwritten text. At the first level of classification, we use two classifiers and present a comparison between the nearest neighbour classifier and Support Vector Machines(SVM) classifier to localize the handwritten text. The features that are extracted from the document are seven invariant central moments and based on these features, we classify the text as hand-written. At the second level, we use Delaunay triangulation to reclassify the misclassified elements. When Delaunay triangulation is imposed on the centroid points of the connected components, we extract features based on the triangles and reclassify the misclassified elements. We remove the noise components in the document as part of the pre-processing step.

AB The PASCAL Challenge's textual entailment recognition task, or RTE, presents intriguing opportunities to test various implications of the strong language universal constraint posited by Wu's (1995, 1997) Inversion Transduction Grammar (ITG) hypothesis. The ITG Hypothesis provides a strong inductive bias, and has been repeatedly shown empirically to yield both efficiency and accuracy gains for numerous language acquisition tasks. Since the RTE challenge abstracts over many tasks, it invites meaningful analysis of the ITG Hypothesis across tasks including information retrieval, comparable documents, reading comprehension, question answering, information extraction, machine translation, and paraphrase acquisition. We investigate two new models for the RTE problem that employ simple generic Bracketing ITGs. Experimental results show that, even in the absence of any thesaurus to accommodate lexical variation between the Text and the Hypothesis strings, surprisingly strong results for a number of the task subsets are obtainable from the Bracketing ITG's structure matching bias alone.

AB This paper describes experiments for testing the power of large-scale resources for lexical selection in machine translation (MT) and cross-language information retrieval (CLIR). We adopt the view that verbs with similar argument structure share certain meaning components, but that those meaning components are more relevant to argument realization than to idiosyncratic verb meaning. We verify this by demonstrating that verbs with similar argument structure as encoded in Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS) are rarely synonymous in WordNet. We then use the results of this work to guide our implementation of an algorithm for cross-language selection of lexical items, exploiting the strengths of each resource: LCS for semantic structure and WordNet for semantic content. We use the Parka Knowledge-Based System to encode LCS representations and WordNet synonym sets and we implement our lexical-selection algorithm as Parka-based queries into a knowledge base containing both information types.

TI Modeling the ribosome as a bipartite graph
SO PLOS ONE
AB Developing mathematical representations of biological systems that can allow predictions is a challenging and important research goal. It is demonstrated here how the ribosome, the nano-machine responsible for synthesizing all proteins necessary for cellular life, can be represented as a bipartite network. Ten ribosomal structures from Bacteria and six from Eukarya are explored. Ribosomal networks are found to exhibit unique properties despite variations in the nodes and edges of the different graphs. The ribosome is shown to exhibit very large topological redundancies, demonstrating mathematical resiliency. These results can potentially explain how it can function consistently despite changes in composition and connectivity. Furthermore, this representation can be used to analyze ribosome function within the large machinery of network theory, where the degrees of freedom are the possible interactions, and can be used to provide new insights for translation regulation and therapeutics.

AB Automated audio captioning (AAC) is a novel task, where a method takes as an input an audio sample and outputs a textual description (i.e. a caption) of its contents. Most AAC methods are adapted from image captioning or machine translation fields. In this work, we present a novel AAC method, explicitly focused on the exploitation of the temporal and time-frequency patterns in audio. We employ three learnable processes for audio encoding, two for extracting the temporal and time-frequency information, and one to merge the output of the previous two processes. To generate the caption, we employ the widely used Transformer decoder. We assess our method utilizing the freely available splits of the Clotho dataset. Our results increase previously reported highest SPIDEr to 17.3, from 16.2 (higher is better).

TI Ribosome Fingerprinting with a Solid-State Nanopore
SO ACS SENSORS
AB Nanopores hold great potential for the analysis of complex biological molecules at the single-entity level. One particularly interesting macromolecular machine is the ribosome, responsible for translating mRNAs into proteins. In this study, we use a solid-state nanopore to fingerprint 80S ribosomes and polysomes from a human neuronal cell line andDrosophila melanogaster cultured cells and ovaries. Specifically, we show that the peak amplitude and dwell time characteristics of 80S ribosomes are distinct from polysomes and can be used to discriminate ribosomes from polysomes in mixed samples. Moreover, we are able to distinguish large polysomes, containing more than seven ribosomes, from those containing two to three ribosomes, and demonstrate a correlation between polysome size and peak amplitude. This study highlights the application of solid-state nanopores as a rapid analytical tool for the detection and characterization of ribosomal complexes.

TI Identification and Classification of Enhancers Using Dimension Reduction
   Technique and Recurrent Neural Network
SO COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE
AB Enhancers are noncoding fragments in DNA sequences, which play an important role in gene transcription and translation. However, due to their high free scattering and positional variability, the identification and classification of enhancers have a higher level of complexity than those of coding genes. In order to solve this problem, many computer studies have been carried out in this field, but there are still some deficiencies in these prediction models. In this paper, we use various feature extraction strategies, dimension reduction technology, and a comprehensive application of machine model and recurrent neural network model to achieve an accurate prediction of enhancer identification and classification with the accuracy of was 76.7% and 84.9%, respectively. The model proposed in this paper is superior to the previous methods in performance index or feature dimension, which provides inspiration for the prediction of enhancers by computer technology in the future.

TI AMR Similarity Metrics from Principles
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Different metrics have been proposed to compare AbstractMeaning Representation (AMR) graphs. The canonical SMATCH metric (Cai and Knight, 2013) aligns the variables of two graphs and assesses triple matches. The recent SEMBLEU metric (Song and Gildea, 2019) is based on the machine-translation metric BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and increases computational efficiency by ablating the variablealignment. In this paper, i) we establish criteria that enable researchers to performa principled assessment ofmetrics comparingmeaning representations like AMR; ii) we undertake a thorough analysis of SMATCH and SEMBLEU where we show that the latter exhibits some undesirable properties. For example, it does not conform to the identity of indiscernibles rule and introduces biases that are hard to control; and iii) we propose a novel metric S2 MATCH that is more benevolent to only very slight meaning deviations and targets the fulfilment of all established criteria.We assess its suitability and show its advantages over SMATCH and SEMBLEU.

AB Most sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models are autoregressive; they generate each token by conditioning on previously generated tokens. In contrast, non-autoregressive seq2seq models generate all tokens in one pass, which leads to increased efficiency through parallel processing on hardware such as GPUs. However, directly modeling the joint distribution of all tokens simultaneously is challenging, and even with increasingly complex model structures accuracy lags significantly behind autoregressive models. In this paper, we propose a simple, efficient, and effective model for non-autoregressive sequence generation using latent variable models. Specifically, we turn to generative flow, an elegant technique to model complex distributions using neural networks, and design several layers of flow tailored for modeling the conditional density of sequential latent variables. We evaluate this model on three neural machine translation (NMT) benchmark datasets, achieving comparable performance with state-of-the-art nonautoregressive NMT models and almost constant decoding time w.r.t the sequence length.(1)

TI Kinetic theory and thermodynamics of template-directed copolymerization
SO JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT
AB Template-directed copolymerization is the fundamental process for the replication, transcription, and translation of genetic information. The copy of the template sequence is grown by the attachment of monomers with a molecular machine. The long-time kinetics of such processes is exactly solvable in terms of iterated function systems. This method determines the effects of sequence heterogeneity and replication errors on the growth of the copy and the statistical properties of its sequence. In particular, a transition can occur between linear and sublinear growth in time of the copy. In the linear regime, the local growth velocity along the template may have a fractal distribution. Furthermore, the growth can be driven around equilibrium by the entropic effect of replication errors in an adverse free-energy landscape.

AB Construction of powerful computer systems to understand the human languages or natural languages to capture information about various domains demands morphologically featured modeled architected appropriately in a core way. Morphological analysis is a crucial step that plays a predominant role in the field of natural language processing. It includes the study of structure, formation, functional units of the words, identification of morphemes to endeavor the formulation of the rules of the language. Since natural language processing applications like machine translation systems, speech recognition, information retrieval rely on large text data to analyze using linguistic expertise is not viable. To overcome this issue morphological analysis using unsupervised settings is incorporated. It is an alternative procedure that works independently to uncover the morphological structure of the languages. This paper gives a theoretical model to analysis morphologically the structure of the Tamil language in an unsupervised way.

AB We propose an unsupervised learning algorithm for automatically inferring the mappings between English nouns and corresponding video objects. Given a sequence of natural language instructions and an unaligned video recording, we simultaneously align each instruction to its corresponding video segment, and also align nouns in each instruction to their corresponding objects in video. While existing grounded language acquisition algorithms rely on pre-aligned supervised data (each sentence paired with corresponding image frame or video segment), our algorithm aims to automatically infer the alignment from the temporal structure of the video and parallel text instructions. We propose two generative models that are closely related to the HMM and IBM 1 word alignment models used in statistical machine translation. We evaluate our algorithm on videos of biological experiments performed in wetlabs, and demonstrate its capability of aligning video segments to text instructions and matching video objects to nouns in the absence of any direct supervision.

TI Generalizing predicates with string arguments
SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE
AB The least general generalization (LGG) of strings may cause an over-generalization in the generalization process of the clauses of predicates with string arguments. We propose a specific generalization (SG) for strings to reduce over-generalization. SGs of strings are used in the generalization of a set of strings representing the arguments of a set of positive examples of a predicate with string arguments. In order to create a SG of two strings, first, a unique match sequence between these strings is found. A unique match sequence of two strings consists of similarities and differences to represent similar parts and differing parts between those strings. The differences in the unique match sequence are replaced to create a SG of those strings. In the generalization process, a coverage algorithm based on SGs of strings or learning heuristics based on match sequences are used.

AB This paper presents a low-level natural processing technique for preprocessing Arabic text without diacritical marks. The aim of the proposed technique is to prepare Arabic text for natural language processing applications. This technique proceeds by lexical parsing of the Arabic text in order to identify the structure of each word. It operates in two steps. The first step isolates the words of the input text. The second step is a rule-based system that decomposes a word into its basic morphological components: a root and a pattern. Most of the Arabic words are generated from three-letter roots according to standard morphological patterns. This feature of Arabic language facilitates the implementation of the proposed technique. The proposed technique can be integrated in larger natural language processing systems such as automatic translation, text summarization, text correction, and human machine communication.

AB This paper describes automatic techniques for mapping 9611. entries in a database of English verbs to Word-Net senses. The verbs were initially grouped into 491 classes based on syntactic features. Mapping these verbs into Word-Net senses provides a resource that supports disambiguation in multilingual applications such as machine translation and cross-language information retrieval. Our techniques make use of (1) a training set of 1791 disambiguated entries, representing 1442 verb entries from 167 classes; (2) word sense probabilities, from frequency counts in a tagged corpus; (3) semantic similarity of WordNet senses for verbs within the same class; (4) probabilistic correlations between WordNet data and attributes of the verb classes. The best results achieved 72% precision and 58% recall, versus a lower bound of 62% precision and 38% recall for assigning the most frequently occurring WordNet sense, and an upper bound of 87% precision and 75% recall for human judgment.

TI OFFLINE TRACING AND REPRESENTATION OF SIGNATURES
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS
AB A new approach to the representation of signatures in an offline environment is presented. The approach makes a tracing of a signature similar to the way a human normally does and incorporates the dynamic information of the tracing sequence into the representation of the signature. Tracing involves hierarchical decision-making for stroke identification and ordering based on a set of heuristic rules. These heuristic rules work as operators that transform a two-dimensional (2-D) spatial pattern into a one-dimensional (1-D) temporal pattern, thus making it possible to extract the dynamic features of a signature. Following the stroke sequence of a signature identified by the tracing, a multiresolution critical-point segmentation method is proposed to extract local feature points, at varying degrees of scale and coarseness, for representation. Finally, to make the representation translation-, rotation-, and scaling-invariant, a critical-point normalization method is introduced. Experimental results are shown.

TI Multilingual fine-tuning for Grammatical Error Correction
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB Finding a single model capable of comprehending multiple languages is an area of active research in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Recently developed models such as mBART, mT5 or xProphetNet can solve problems connected with, for instance, machine translation and summarization for many languages. However, good multilingual solutions to the problem of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) are still missing - this paper aims at filling this gap. We first review current annotated GEC datasets and then apply existing pre-trained multilingual models to correct grammatical errors in multiple languages. In our experiments, we compare how different pre-training approaches impact the final GEC quality. Our result is a single model that can correct seven different languages and is the best (in terms of F-score) currently reported multilingual GEC model. Additionally, our multilingual model achieves better results than the SOTA monolingual model for Romanian.

We capture the phenomenon of diversity through the notions of lexical gap and language-specific word and use a systematic method to infer gaps semi-automatically on a large scale. As a first result obtained for the domain of kinship terminology, known to be very diverse throughout the world, we publish a lexico-semantic resource consisting of 198 domain concepts, 1,911 words, and 37,370 gaps covering 699 languages. We see potential in the use of resources such as ours for the improvement of a variety of cross-lingual NLP tasks, which we demonstrate through a downstream application for the evaluation of machine translation systems.

AB The conventional wisdom behind learning deep classification models is to focus on bad-classified examples and ignore well-classified examples that are far from the decision boundary. For instance, when training with cross-entropy loss, examples with higher likelihoods (i.e., well-classified examples) contribute smaller gradients in back-propagation. However, we theoretically show that this common practice hinders representation learning, energy optimization, and margin growth. To counteract this deficiency, we propose to reward well-classified examples with additive bonuses to revive their contribution to the learning process. This counterexample theoretically addresses these three issues. We empirically support this claim by directly verifying the theoretical results or significant performance improvement with our counterexample on diverse tasks, including image classification, graph classification, and machine translation. Furthermore, this paper shows that we can deal with complex scenarios, such as imbalanced classification, OOD detection, and applications under adversarial attacks, because our idea can solve these three issues.

AB Recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks have shown some success with many practical applications in recent years such as machine translation, speech recognition, image processing and financial market forecasting. In recent years, a dual-stage attention-based recurrent neural network (DA-RNN) has shown some promising results on stock price prediction. We propose dual attention-dilated long short-term memory (DAD-LSTM) models combining DA-RNN and dilated recurrent neural networks (DRNN) to select the most relevant input features and capture the long-term temporal dependencies of a time series more efficiently. Numerical results from experiments on the NASDAQ 100, S&P 500, HSI and DJIA datasets show that DAD-LSTM models outperform the state-of-the-art and most recent approaches.

AB It is challenging to deploy deep neural nets on memory-constrained devices due to the explosion of numbers of parameters. Especially, the input embedding layer and Softmax layer usually dominate the memory usage in an RNNbased language model. For example, input embedding and Softmax matrices in IWSLT2014 German-to-English data set account for more than 80% of the total model parameters. To compress these embedding layers, we propose MulCode, a novel multi-way multiplicative neural compressor. MulCode learns an adaptively created matrix and its multiplicative compositions. Together with a prior weighted loss, MulCode is more effective than the state-of-the-art compression methods. On the IWSLT-2014 machine translation data set, MulCode achieved 17 times compression rate for the embedding and Softmax matrices, and when combined with quantization technique, our method can achieve 41.38 times compression rate with very little loss in performance.

AB Named Entity (NE) classification is a task to classify words or group of words in a sentence into some predefined classes like, Person, Organization, Location etc. It is used in different natural language processing (NLP) tasks like machine translation, information retrieval, text annotation, question answering, summarization etc. To classify the Named Entity, researchers use different techniques like rule based entity sorting, statistical class modeling, linear chaining etc. However, most of those techniques do not capture grammatical dependencies of words hidden in the sentence, which is very essential to classify a Named Entity. In our research, we consider grammatical dependencies of words hidden in the sentence and use them to learn a classification model which classifies the Named Entity. In a classification task among three different classes, average performance gain of the proposed system over the state of the art system exceeds more than 6% in F1 Score.

AB This paper presents the design of a reconfigurable parallel kinematics machine endowed with three degrees of freedom of pure translation, or alternately of pure rotation. Such reconfigurability results from the use of lockable spherical joints, which realize the connection between each robot leg and the moving platform. Three actuated legs are used to drive the platform motion. The change of configuration occurs only at a specific pose, called home configuration. A control strategy allows to manage the shift phase and activate the two mobilities one at a time. Multibody simulations allowed to analyze the dynamic behavior of the manipulator and to verify the choices made with regard to the robot mechanics and the size of actuation systems. Position and differential kinematics of the manipulator are briefly introduced in order to demonstrate the simplicity of the analytic expressions and the mechanical feasibility of the manipulator.

TI A two-level parser for patent claim parsing
SO ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS
AB Patent claim parsing can contribute in many patent-related applications, such as patent search, information extraction, machine translation and summarization. However, patent claim parsing is difficult due to the special structure of patent claims. To overcome this difficulty, the challenges facing the patent claim parsing were first investigated and the peculiarities of claim syntax that obstruct dependency parsing were highlighted. To handle these peculiarities, this study proposes a new two-level parser, in which a conventional parser is imbedded. A patent claim is pre-processed in order to remove peculiarities before passed to the conventional parser. The process is based on a new dependency-based syntax called Independent Claim Segment Dependency Syntax (ICSDS). This two-lever parser has demonstrated promising improvement for patent claim parsing on both effectiveness and efficiency over the conventional parser. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Profiling of Ribose Methylations in RNA by High-Throughput Sequencing
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Ribose methylations are the most abundant chemical modifications of ribosomal RNA and are critical for ribosome assembly and fidelity of translation. Many aspects of ribose methylations have been difficult to study due to lack of efficient mapping methods. Here, we present a sequencing-based method (RiboMeth-seq) and its application to yeast ribosomes, presently the best-studied eukaryotic model system. We demonstrate detection of the known as well as new modifications, reveal partial modifications and unexpected communication between modification events, and determine the order of modification at several sites during ribosome biogenesis. Surprisingly, the method also provides information on a subset of other modifications. Hence, RiboMeth-seq enables a detailed evaluation of the importance of RNA modifications in the cells most sophisticated molecular machine. RiboMeth-seq can be adapted to other RNA classes, for example, mRNA, to reveal new biology involving RNA modifications.

AB Converting Handwritten documents to its machine written counterpart using Optical Character Recognition has many benefits like easier formatting, less storage apace, and automatic translation if needed. However, it has many noise difficulties; one of them is the ruled lines intersection with the text. In this paper, we introduce a trial to detect these ruled lines and remove them without affecting the text strokes significantly in grey-level image documents. The detection stage use Hough Transform in four squared sub-windows. And the removal stage employs intensity histogram and its entropy to isolate the text. The removal stage is followed by a morphological based enhancement for the resulting text. The proposed technique has been tested on several test real-world image documents and achieved very good results.

AB Action verbs are the less predictable linguistic type for bilingual dictionaries and they cause major problems for MT technologies that are immediately evident to the user. This is not only because of language specific phraseology, but is rather a consequence of the peculiar way each natural language categorizes events i.e. it is a consequence of semantic factors. In ordinary languages the most frequent Action verbs are "general", since they extend productively to actions belonging to different ontological types. Moreover, each language categorizes action in its own way and therefore the cross-linguistic reference to everyday activities is puzzling. But the actual variation of verbs across action types is largely unknown. This paper sketches the problem constituted by the Ontology of Action when disambiguation and cross-linguistic reference to action is concerned and presents the IMAGACT Ontology Infrastructure, which aims at filling this gap by exploiting multilingual spoken corpora.

AB Ngram language models are ubiquitous in speech applications and many other natural language systems. One issue with n-gram language models is that the language is not completely represented in the model. When words appear that are not in the model, we may need to provide a smoothing method to distribute the model probabilities over the unknown values. Many techniques exist for language model smoothing with many different performance characteristics. Often the performance of smoothing algorithms may depend on the application of the language model (so, for example, unigram models with interpolation smoothing may perform better with information retrieval applications, but trigram models with backoff smoothing might perform better for speech). This paper examines the relative performance of some selected smoothing methods with bigram language models created using chat data. The language models are used for machine translation of chat data and for creating text classification models.

TI Learning Tractable Word Alignment Models with Complex Constraints
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Word-level alignment of bilingual text is a critical resource for a growing variety of tasks. Probabilistic models for word alignment present a fundamental trade-off between richness of captured constraints and correlations versus efficiency and tractability of inference. In this article, we use the Posterior Regularization framework (Graca, Ganchev, and Taskar 2007) to incorporate complex constraints into probabilistic models during learning without changing the efficiency of the underlying model. We focus on the simple and tractable hidden Markov model, and present an efficient learning algorithm for incorporating approximate bijectivity and symmetry constraints. Models estimated with these constraints produce a significant boost in performance as measured by both precision and recall of manually annotated alignments for six language pairs. We also report experiments on two different tasks where word alignments are required: phrase-based machine translation and syntax transfer, and show promising improvements over standard methods.

Here we review the contributions of single-molecule experiments to providing answers to questions such as: How much energy is required to unfold a secondary or tertiary structure? How fast is the process? How do helicases unwind double helices? Are the unwinding activities of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and of ribosomes different from other helicases? We discuss the use of optical tweezers to monitor the unfolding activities of helicases, polymerases, and ribosomes, and to apply force to unfold RNAs directly. We also review the applications of fluorescence and fluorescence resonance energy transfer to measure RNA dynamics.

AB In this paper we proposed a new word sense disambiguation method, called Multi-engine Collaborative Bootstrapping (MCB) that combines different types of corpora and also uses two languages to bootstrapping. MCB contains the bilingual bootstrapping as its kernel algorithm that leads to incremental knowledge acquisition. EM model is performed to train parameters in base learner. Feature translation model is improved by semantic correlation estimation. In addition we use multi-engine to produce qualified starting seeds from parallel corpora and monolingual corpora. Those seeds that are generated through unsupervised machine learning approaches can also ensure bootstrapping effectiveness in contrast with manual selected seeds in spite of their different selection mechanisms. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of MCB. Some factors including feature space and starting seed number are concerned in our experiments because EM algorithm is sensible to starting values. Limitation of resources is also concerned.

AB Transformer is a ubiquitous model for natural language processing and has attracted wide attentions in computer vision. The attention maps are indispensable for a transformer model to encode the dependencies among input tokens. However, they are learned without explicit interactions in each layer and sometimes fail to capture reasonable patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel and generic mechanism based on evolving attention try improve the performance of transformers. On one hand, the attention maps in different layers share common knowledge, thus the ones in preceding layers can instruct the learning of attention in succeeding layers through residual connections. On the other hand, low-level and high-level attentions vary in the levels of abstraction, so we adopt additional convolutional layers to capture the evolutionary process of attention maps. The proposed evolving attention mechanism achieves significant performance improvement over various state-of-the-art models for multiple tasks, including image classification, natural language understanding and machine translation.

AB In order to improve the performance of woodblock printing Mongolian words recognition, a method based on cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) has been proposed for data augmentation. A well-trained CycleGAN model can learn image-to-image translation without paired examples. To be specific, the style of machine printing word images can be transformed into the corresponding word images with the style of woodblock printing by utilizing a CycleGAN, and vice versa. In thisway, new instances of woodblock printing Mongolian word images are able to be generated by using the two generative models of CycleGAN. Thus, the aim of data augmentation could be attained. Given a dataset of woodblock printingMongolian word images, experimental results demonstrate that the performance of woodblock printing Mongolian words recognition can be improved through such the data augmentation.

We propose a simple method based on knowledge graph to improve the quality of machine translation. First, we propose a multi-task learning model that learns subjects, objects, and predicates at the same time. Second, we treat different predicates as different fields, and improve the recognition ability of NMT models in different fields through classification labels. Finally, beam search combined with L2R, R2L rearranges results through entities. Based on the CWMT2018 experimental data, using the predicate's domain classification identifier, the BLUE score increased from 33.58% to 37.63%, and through L2R, R2L rearrangement, the BLEU score increased to 39.25%, overall improvement is more than 5 percentage

AB Depth estimation has been achieved much attention in recent five years for visual SLAM, AR, VR, autonomous vehicle, 3D object understanding and so on. Similar to stereo matching analysis, stereo image based depth estimation methods using deep learning surprisingly obtain great improvement in performance but still cannot understand why learning depth can estimate depth in a new image and also require accuracy improvement. Therefore, we apply attention mechanism into depth learning. Attention mechanism achieve great improvement in various applications such as visual identification of objects, speech recognition, reasoning, image captioning, summarization, segmentation, machine translation(or NLP) and image classification etc. but yet depth estimation. This is because depth estimation is considered as geometric area. We apply attention mechanism in the PSMNet [1] method. Attention mechanism usually apply to channel attention. In our experiments, we apply our method into two benchmark dataset: KITTI [2] and SceneFlow [3]. In our experiments, we found the attention net can improve the quality of depth.

Stemming is used as a preprocessing step in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications like Information retrieval (IR), Machine Translation, Parsing, Summarization, etc. The present work explores the application of stemming to the task of information retrieval. In IR, stemming is generally used for two main purposes: decreasing index size and for increasing system performance. This paper presents a stemmer for Marathi language which uses rule-based technique. The average accuracy achieved by the proposed stemmer is 79.97% when tested on a collection of 4500 unique words from the news corpus among nine runs. Since the accuracy of the proposed stemmer is satisfactory it can be effectively useful in several NLP systems for Marathi language.

AB Perception of the environment in 3D has always been an important sensory input for machine vision applications. Stereo vision range sensors have been used for several decades to obtain 3D information of the scene. Still, the major issue involved in the stereo analysis of images is the correspondence problem. In this paper we consider the correspondence problem only for point clouds. The algorithm proposed is intended to solve the problem of the correlation of two point clouds. The clouds may have any rotation and translation to one another. Also a different amount of points within the two clouds are not a problem for the proposed algorithm. To solve the problem the graph theory is used. Simulations results are presented and at the end of the paper the application for a stereo vision 3D camera are demonstrated.

AB We investigate the implications of the ubiquity of personal mobile devices and reveal new techniques for compromising the privacy of users typing on virtual keyboards. Specifically, we show that so-called compromising reflections (in, for example, a victim's sunglasses) of a device's screen are sufficient to enable automated reconstruction, from video, of text typed on a virtual keyboard. Despite our deliberate use of low cost commodity video cameras, we are able to compensate for variables such as arbitrary camera and device positioning and motion through the application of advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques. Using footage captured in realistic environments (e.g., on a bus), we show that we are able to reconstruct fluent translations of recorded data in almost all of the test cases, correcting users' typing mistakes at the same time. We believe these results highlight the importance of adjusting privacy expectations in response to emerging technologies.

AB A lexicon is the heart of any language processing system. Accurate words with grammatical and semantic attributes are essential or highly desirable for any application - be it machine translation, information extraction, various forms of tagging or text mining. However, good quality lexicons are difficult to construct requiring enormous amount of time and manpower. In this paper, we present a method for automatically generating the dictionary from an input document - making use of the WordNet. The dictionary entries are in the form of Universal Words (UWs) which are language words (primarily English) concatenated with disambiguation information. The entries are associated with syntactic and semantic properties - most of which too are generated automatically. In addition to the WordNet, the system uses a word sense disambiguator, an inferencer and the knowledge base (KB) of the Universal Networking Language which is a recently proposed interlingua. The lexicon so constructed is sufficiently accurate and reduces the manual labour substantially.

TI On Decoding Strategies for Neural Text Generators
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB When generating text from probabilistic models, the chosen decoding strategy has a profound effect on the resulting text. Yet the properties elicited by various decoding strategies do not always transfer across natural language generation tasks. For example, while mode-seeking methods like beam search perform remarkably well for machine translation, they have been observed to lead to incoherent and repetitive text in story generation. Despite such observations, the effectiveness of decoding strategies is often assessed on only a single task. This work-in contrast-provides a comprehensive analysis of the interaction between language generation tasks and decoding strategies. Specifically, we measure changes in attributes of generated text as a function of both decoding strategy and task using human and automatic evaluation. Our results reveal both previously observed and novel findings. For example, the nature of the diversity-quality trade-off in language generation is very task-specific; the length bias often attributed to beam search is not constant across tasks.

AB Nearly 5% of the world population is hearing-impaired and uses a sign language as their primary mode of communication. Unfortunately, sign languages are not commonly understood, and this poses a great communication barrier between the hearing-impaired and the rest.
   This paper builds, based on prior wok, a novel approach that breaks the barrier one-way with accessibility and accuracy as the key objectives. It achieves accessibility using mobile devices for user-facing interactions and accuracy using a transformer model. The system uses a four-stage pipeline to enable one-way communication between hearing-gifted and hearing-impaired: audio capture, audio-to-text conversion, text-to-gloss transliteration, and gloss animation. The user-facing first and last stages of the pipeline are implemented on mobile devices to ensure wide accessibility, while the computationally intensive middle stages are implemented on cloud servers. Empirical evaluations show that the approach has a high accuracy.

AB Many tasks in natural language processing involve predicting structured outputs, e.g., sequence labeling, semantic role labeling, parsing, and machine translation. Researchers are increasingly applying deep representation learning to these problems, but the structured component of these approaches is usually quite simplistic. In this work, we propose several high-order energy terms to capture complex dependencies among labels in sequence labeling, including several that consider the entire label sequence. We use neural parameterizations for these energy terms, drawing from convolutional, recurrent, and selfattention networks. We use the framework of learning energy-based inference networks (Tu and Gimpel, 2018) for dealing with the difficulties of training and inference with such models. We empirically demonstrate that this approach achieves substantial improvement using a variety of high-order energy terms on four sequence labeling tasks, while having the same decoding speed as simple, local classifiers. We also find high-order energies to help in noisy data conditions.(1)

AB Currently agricultural complex is presented by diverse techniques with different manufacturing capabilities to perform various tasks. Efficiency of agricultural mechanisms and machines seriously depends on a design of their kinematic structures. In the presented study we carry out novel kinematic design of linkage-based sickle drive for actuation of combine harvester's blades. The developed sickle drive is designed as a symmetrical planar six-bar linkage with only rotational joints. The linkage is actuated by a single pneumatic drive and allows moving blades in opposite directions with equal translations. The optimal structure of the linkage provides lightweight, reliability, speedwork, stiffness and precision for the whole drive. The study presents structural and kinematic analysis as well as numerical calculations of the proposed sickle drive. The functional capabilities of novel drive allow reducing maintenance costs and saving power.

AB Compositional generalization is a basic mechanism in human language learning, but current neural networks lack such ability. In this paper, we conduct fundamental research for encoding compositionality in neural networks. Conventional methods use a single representation for the input sentence, making it hard to apply prior knowledge of compositionality. In contrast, our approach leverages such knowledge with two representations, one generating attention maps, and the other mapping attended input words to output symbols. We reduce the entropy in each representation to improve generalization. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over the conventional methods in five NLP tasks including instruction learning and machine translation. In the SCAN domain, it boosts accuracies from 14.0% to 98.8% in Jump task, and from 92.0% to 99.7% in TurnLeft task. It also beats human performance on a few-shot learning task. We hope the proposed approach can help ease future research towards human-level compositional language learning. Source code is available online(1).

AB The paper presents our work towards the simultaneous creation of a data-driven WordNet for Bulgarian and a manually annotated treebank with semantic information. Such an approach requires synchronization of the word senses in both - syntactic and lexical resources, without limiting the WordNet senses to the corpus or vice versa. Our strategy focuses on the identification of senses used in BulTreeBank, but the missing senses of a lemma also have been covered through exploration of bigger corpora. The identified senses have been organized in synsets for the Bulgarian WordNet. Then they have been aligned to the Princeton WordNet synsets. Various types of mappings are considered between both resources in a cross-lingual aspect and with respect to ensuring maximum connectivity and potential for incorporating the language specific concepts. The mapping between the two WordNets (English and Bulgarian) is a basis for applications such as machine translation and multilingual information retrieval.

TI A hybrid approach for building a Vietnamese sentiment dictionary
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
AB Sentiment (or emotional) dictionaries play a key role and are "the materials" for sentiment analysis applications, especially in Vietnamese where the corpus is not yet available. In this research, we propose a sentiment dictionary for Vietnamese, known as VNSD, which adopts machine translation, Logistic Regression, "double propagation," and fuzzy rules. The sentiment dictionary counts approximately 5,000 adjectives, 2,000 verbs, 300 nouns, and more than 200 adverbs, which lead to a combination of more than 100,000 sentiment phrases covering the Vietnamese emotional lexicons. We found that a hybrid approach offers better performance compared to stand-alone data-mining or natural language processing techniques. The key contribution of VNSD that distinguishes it from related work is a deep investment in exploiting Vietnamese linguistic characteristics to propose suitable rules for computing the sentiment scores of Vietnamese text phrases.

AB Handwritten document analysis is a persistent research area nowadays. It has large applications in various image processing domain as human computer interaction, machine translation and automation of reading various scanned images for handwritten fields in forms, postal address on envelopes and amounts in banks checks. The main factor which influence the performance of handwritten text recognition is the selection of an appropriate set of features for representing input samples. In this paper, we propose a efficient feature vector for handwritten character recognition, using a hybrid of the statistical and structural properties of a character to represent the particular character class. Experiments have been performed on standard database of handwritten digits and letters. The recognition accuracy is tested on a Neural Network classifier with different parameters. The results have been compared with existing features extraction algorithms. The comparative results shows the effectiveness of our approach.

AB We examine a set of biologically inspired features and apply it to the multiclass object recognition problem. To obtain these features we modify HMAX, which is based on a hierarchical model of visual cortex. Instead of using a set of standard Gabor filters we use a set of natural-stimuli adapted filters. These filters emerge as a result of optimization based in part on smooth L1-norm based sparseness maximization. These filters in conjunction with the HMAX model give more biological plausibility to the model. The features thus obtained are largely scale, translation and rotation invariant, and are fed to a support vector machine classifier. We successfully demonstrate the applicability of this modified HMAX model to the object recognition task by testing it on Caltech-5 and Caltech-101 datasets.

We have found that only about 5% of webpages are "valid" according to the HTML standard. An "invalid" webpage may be rendered differently by different browsers; it may not be machine-processable: it might not be translated into other Web document formats correctly using some of the translation engines available on the Web; etc. Through sampling and analyzing the results, we have identified the most common problems in existing webpages that made them invalid. We hope our discovery can encourage standard bodies, browser developers, authoring tool developers, and webpage designers to work together so that the number of valid webpages continues to grow and the Web can indeed reach its full potential.

AB Sign languages are used by healthy individuals when communicating with those who are hearing or speech impaired as well by those with hearing or speech impediments. It is quite difficult to acquire sign language skills since there are vast number of sign language words and some signing motions are very complex. Several attempts at machine translation have been investigated for a limited number of sign language motions by using KINECT and a data glove, which is equipped with a strain gauge to monitor the angles at which fingers are bent, to detect hand motions and hand shapes.
   One of the key features of our proposed method is using an optical camera and colored gloves for detection of sign language motion. The optical camera is implemented in a smartphone. This makes it possible to remove the limitation of using area and occasion as a machine translation tool.
   The authors propose two new schemes. One is to add the two feature elements, that is, hand direction obtained from the angle between the wrist and fingertips, and hand rotation calculated from the visible size of the palm and wrist incorporating the four conventional elements comprising motion trajectory, motion velocity, hand position and hand shape. The other is integrating the results which is obtained by each classifier to enhance the recognition performance. The six kinds of classifiers have been applied to 35 sign language motions.
   A total of 3150 pieces of motion data, that is, 2100 pieces of motion data as training data and 1050 pieces as evaluation data, were used to evaluate the proposed method. The recognition results were examined by integrating the feature elements and classifier. The success rate for 35 words was respectively 76.2% and 94.2%, for the selection of the first ranked answer, and the selection of the first, second or third ranked answers. These values suggest that the proposed method could be used as a review tool for assessing how well learner have mastered sign language motions.

TI The flaneur in the Borsig locomotive works: Walter Benjamin, the Berlin
   Radio Youth Hour, and sound as pedagogy
SO GERMAN QUARTERLY
AB Walter Benjamin's radio addresses for young people remain a comparatively neglected part of his work. New scholarship and translations have begun to address this, however. This article argues that the radio addresses, and particularly the address on the Borsig locomotive and machine works, deserve a prominent place within the critical and intellectual trajectory of Benjamin's career. A close reading of "Borsig" demonstrates how the addresses model the modes of experience mediated by and through Benjamin's master figure of the flaneur and generate the possibility for a historical pedagogy adequate to modernity. In the radio addresses, in general, and in "Borsig," in particular, the mediation of experience entirely through sound and the narrating voice requires the simultaneity of past, present, and future that resolves into Benjamin's theory of history. "Borsig" thus points directly toward the stakes of the Passagen-Werk and Benjamin's later theoretical essays.

AB The detection and extraction of abbreviations from unstructured texts can help to improve the performance of Natural Language Processing tasks, such as machine translation and information retrieval. However, in terms of publicly available datasets, there is not enough data for training deep-neural-networks-based models to the point of generalising well over data. This paper presents PLOD, a large-scale dataset for abbreviation detection and extraction that contains 160k+ segments automatically annotated with abbreviations and their long forms. We performed manual validation over a set of instances and a complete automatic validation for this dataset. We then used it to generate several baseline models for detecting abbreviations and long forms. The best models achieved an F1-score of 0.92 for abbreviations and 0.89 for detecting their corresponding long forms. We release this dataset along with our code and all the models publicly in this Github Repository.

AB Without positional information, attention-based Transformer neural networks are permutation-invariant. Absolute or relative positional embeddings are the most popular ways to feed Transformer models with positional information. Absolute positional embeddings are simple to implement, but suffer from generalization issues when evaluating on sequences longer than seen at training time. Relative positions are more robust to input length change, but are more complex to implement and yield inferior model throughput due to extra computational and memory costs. In this paper, we propose an augmentation-based approach (CAPE) for absolute positional embeddings, which keeps the advantages of both absolute (simplicity and speed) and relative positional embeddings (better generalization). In addition, our empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art models in machine translation, image and speech recognition demonstrates that CAPE leads to better generalization performance as well as increased stability with respect to training hyper-parameters.

AB Multilayer transformer networks consist of interleaved self-attention and feedforward sub layers. Could ordering the sublayers in a different pattern lead to better performance? We generate randomly ordered transformers and train them with the language modeling objective. We observe that some of these models are able to achieve better performance than the interleaved baseline, and that those successful variants tend to have more self-attention at the bottom and more feedforward sublayers at the top. We propose a new transformer pattern that adheres to this property, the sandwich transformer, and show that it improves perplexity on multiple word-level and character-level language modeling benchmarks, at no cost in parameters, memory, or training time. However, the sandwich reordering pattern does not guarantee performance gains across every task, as we demonstrate on machine translation models. Instead, we suggest that further exploration of task-specific sublayer reorderings is needed in order to unlock additional gains.(1)

AB Machine translation is highly sensitive to the size and quality of the training data, which has led to an increasing interest in collecting and filtering large parallel corpora. In this paper, we propose a new method for this task based on multilingual sentence embeddings. In contrast to previous approaches, which rely on nearest neighbor retrieval with a hard threshold over cosine similarity, our proposed method accounts for the scale inconsistencies of this measure, considering the margin between a given sentence pair and its closest candidates instead. Our experiments show large improvements over existing methods. We outperform the best published results on the BUCC mining task and the UN reconstruction task by more than 10 F1 and 30 precision points, respectively. Filtering the English-German ParaCrawl corpus with our approach, we obtain 31.2 BLEU points on newstest2014, an improvement of more than one point over the best official filtered version.

AB Grammatical error correction (GEC) is one of the areas in natural language processing in which purely neural models have not yet superseded more traditional symbolic models. Hybrid systems combining phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) and neural sequence models are currently among the most effective approaches to GEC. However, both SMT and neural sequence-to-sequence models require large amounts of annotated data. Language model based GEC (LM-GEC) is a promising alternative which does not rely on annotated training data. We show how to improve LM-GEC by applying modelling techniques based on finite state transducers. We report further gains by rescoring with neural language models. We show that our methods developed for LM-GEC can also be used with SMT systems if annotated training data is available. Our best system outperforms the best published result on the CoNLL-2014 test set, and achieves far better relative improvements over the SMT baselines than previous hybrid systems.

AB In the field of digital image processing, JPEG image compression technique has been widely applied. And numerous image processing software suppose this. It is likely for the images undergoing double JPEG compression to be tampered. Therefore, double JPEG compression detection schemes can provide an important clue for image forgery detection. In this paper, we propose an effective algorithm to detect double JPEG compression with different quality factors. Firstly, the quantized DCT coefficients with same frequency are extracted to build the new data matrices. Then, considering the direction effect on the correlation between the adjacent positions in DCT domain, twelve kinds of high-pass filter templates with different directions are executed and the translation probability matrix is calculated for each filtered data. Furthermore, principal component analysis and support vector machine technique are applied to reduce the feature dimension and train a classifier, respectively. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method is effective and has comparable performance.

AB Current research, in Natural Language Processing, shows more interest in the under-resourced languages, during last years. Amazigh language is the autochthon language of North Africa. However, until 2011 that it became a constitutionally official language in Morocco, after years of persecution. Amazigh language is still considered as one of the under resourced languages. The question is:. how can the Amazigh language reach advanced languages?. Motivated by these considerations, we describe our effort in the development of an Amazigh-English parallel corpus aimed to be used in linguistic research, teaching, and natural language processing application, primarily machine translation. To the best of our knowledge, this corpus is the first Amazigh-English parallel corpus. The built corpus is sentence aligned, including 20726 sentences. The alignment was done automatically, while the evaluation was done manually. The experimentation results are satisfactory, achieving more than 90%.

AB The standard metric to evaluate automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems is the word error rate (WER). WER has proven very useful in stand-alone ASR systems. Nowadays, these systems are often embedded in complex natural language processing systems to perform tasks like speech translation, man machine dialogue, or information retrieval from speech. This exacerbates the need for the speech processing community to design a new evaluation metric to estimate the quality of automatic transcriptions within their larger applicative context. We introduce a new measure to evaluate ASR in the context of named entity recognition, which makes use of a probabilistic model to estimate the risk of ASR errors inducing downstream errors in named entity detection. Our evaluation, on the ETAPE data, shows that ATENE achieves a higher correlation than WER between the performances in named entities recognition and in automatic speech transcription.

AB It is widely accepted that in a text, sentences and clauses cannot be understood in isolation but in relation with each other through discourse relations that may or may not be explicitly marked. Discourse relations have been found useful in many applications such as machine translation, text summarization, and question answering; however, they are often not considered in computational language applications because domain and genre independent robust discourse parsers are very few. In this paper, we analyze existing approaches to identify five discourse relations automatically (namely, comparison, contingency, illustration, attribution, and topic-opinion), and propose a new approach to identify attributive relations. We evaluate the accuracy of each approach with respect to the discourse relations it can identify and compare it to a human gold standard. The evaluation results show that the state of the art systems are rather effective at identifying most of the relations considered, but other relations such as attribution are still not identified with high accuracy.

AB Dynamic binary translation is a key component of Hardware/Software (HW/SW) co-design, which is an enabling technology for processor microarchitecture innovation. There are two well-known dynamic binary optimization techniques based on atomic execution support. Frame-based optimizations leverage processor pipeline support to enable atomic execution of hot traces. Region level optimizations employ transactional-memory-like atomicity support to aggressively optimize large regions of code. In this paper we propose a two-level atomic optimization scheme which not only overcomes the limitations of the two approaches, but also boosts the benefits of the two approaches effectively. Our experiment shows that the combined approach can achieve a total of 21.5% performance improvement over an aggressive out-of-order baseline machine and improve the performance over the frame-based approach by an additional 5.3%.

TI Towards a computational model for-1 eukaryotic frameshifting sites
SO BIOINFORMATICS
AB Motivation: Unconventional decoding events are now well acknowledged, but not yet well formalized. In this study, we present a bioinformatics analysis of eukaryotic -1 frameshifting, in order to model this event.
   Results: A consensus model has already been established for -1 frameshifting sites. Our purpose here is to provide new constraints which make the model more precise. We show how a machine learning approach can be used to refine the current model. We identify new properties that may be involved in frameshifting. Each of the properties found was experimentally validated. Initially, we identify features of the overall model that are to be simultaneously satisfied. We then focus on the following two components: the spacer and the slippery sequence. As a main result, we point out that the identity of the primary structure of the so-called spacer is of great importance.

TI Enhancing Text Generation via Parse Tree Embedding
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB Natural language generation (NLG) is a core component of machine translation, dialogue systems, speech recognition, summarization, and so forth. The existing text generation methods tend to be based on recurrent neural language models (NLMs), which generate sentences from encoding vector. However, most of these models lack explicit structured representation for text generation. In this work, we introduce a new generative model for NLG, called Tree-VAE. First it samples a sentence from the training corpus and then generates a new sentence based on the corresponding parse tree embedding vector. Tree-LSTM is used in collaboration with the Stanford Parser to retrieve sentence construction data, which is then used to train a conditional discretization autoencoder generator based on the embeddings of sentence patterns. The proposed model is extensively evaluated on three different datasets. The experimental results proved that the proposed model can generate substantially more diverse and coherent text than existing baseline methods.

AB Based on the perception of the interlocutors' speech and nonverbal cues, socially interactive robots are expected to generate suitable responses and body movements. A substantial amount of research has been conducted to enable natural interaction based on audio-visual perception systems. However, the linguistic, reasoning and cognitive aspects for such robots have been less explored in the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). This paper incorporates various types of language knowledge e.g., real-time machine translation, checking grammatical mistakes, vocabulary and a limited number of cognitive skills in a socially interactive robot. The proposed approach has been implemented on top of an existing audio-visual system generating robot behaviour. Several interaction scenarios have been created to validate the approach proposed. The experimental results showed a notion of cognitive behaviour and natural language skills in social robots, making the interactions much more diverse, interesting and engaging.

AB Negation is a linguistic universal that poses difficulties for cognitive and computational processing. Despite many advances in text analytics, negation resolution remains an acute and continuously researched question in Natural Language Processing. Reliable negation parsing affects results in biomedical text mining, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and many other fields. The availability of multilingual pre-trained general representation models makes it possible to experiment with negation detection in languages that lack annotated data. In this work we test the performance of two state-of-the-art contextual representation models, Multilingual BERT and XLM-RoBERTa. We resolve negation scope by conducting zero-shot transfer between English, Spanish, French, and Russian. Our best result amounts to a token-level F1-score of 86.86% from Spanish to Russian. We correlate these results with a linguistic negation typology and lexical capacity of the models.

We focus on Arabic, a gender-marking morphologically rich language, in the context of machine translation (MT) from English, and for first-person-singular constructions only. Our contributions are the development of a system-independent gender-awareness wrapper, and the building of a corpus for training and evaluating first-person-singular gender identification and reinflection in Arabic. Our results successfully demonstrate the viability of this approach with 8% relative increase in BLEU score for first-person-singular feminine, and 5.3% comparable increase for first-person-singular masculine on top of a state-of-the-art gender-blind MT system on a held-out test set.

AB Translating low-level machine instructions into higher-level intermediate language (IL) is one of the central steps in many binary analysis and instrumentation systems. Existing systems build such translators manually. As a result, it takes a great deal of effort to support new architectures. Even for widely deployed architectures, full instruction sets may not be modeled, e.g., mature systems such as Valgrind still lack support for AVX, FMA4 and SSE4.1 for x86 processors. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel approach that leverages knowledge about instruction set semantics that is already embedded into modern compilers such as GCC. In particular, we present a learning-based approach for automating the translation of assembly instructions to a compiler's architecture-neutral IL. We present an experimental evaluation that demonstrates the ability of our approach to easily support many architectures (x86, ARM and AVR), including their advanced instruction sets. Our implementation is available as open-source software.

In our model, only the most relevant context of each word is concentrated to avoid the redundant information. Our model is based on two new models that have been successfully used recently in neural machine translation. The first is Bidirectional model that can be trained using all the available input information in the past and future. The second is Attention model that focus not only the whole sentence information but also the particular context of each word in this sentence. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms all the recently state-of-the-art method, the Bidirectional and the Attention model on the Google sentence compression dataset.

AB In today's fast-paced world, users face the challenge of having to consume a lot of content in a short time. This situation is exacerbated by the fact that content is scattered in a range of different languages and locations. This research addresses these challenges using a number of natural language processing techniques: adapting content using automatic text summarization; enhancing content accessibility through machine translation; and altering the delivery modality through speech synthesis. This paper introduces Lean-back Learning (LbL), an information system that delivers automatically generated audio presentations for consumption in a "lean-back" fashion, i.e. hands-busy, eyes-busy situations. These presentations are personalized and are generated using multilingual multi-document text summarization. The paper discusses the system's components and algorithms, in addition to initial system evaluations.

AB The serial robot architecture is widespread in modern day manufacturing, and over the last few decades the technology has matured and settled to its current state. One drawback from the architecture however is the location of motors and gearboxes which are either at the joint it controls or close by. A novel hybrid 6 DOF robot was designed to move all the actuators to the robot base, and to control the desired axis through a set of connected links and gears, while maintaining the same workspace and dexterity. This would reduce the inertia of the movable part of the robot and some of the moment arms on the 3 axes required for translation of the 3 DOF spherical wrist. Doing so would decrease the energy requirements when compared to a 6 DOF serial robot. This paper focuses on the mathematical modelling and simulation of the novel hybrid machine design and compares it to an equivalent serial robot.

AB This paper presents a pilot study of the use of phrasal Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) techniques to identify and correct writing errors made by learners of English as a Second Language (ESL). Using examples of mass noun errors found in the Chinese Learner Error Corpus (CLEC) to guide creation of an engineered training set, we show that application of the SMT paradigm can capture errors not well addressed by widely-used proofing tools designed for native speakers. Our system was able to correct 61.81% of mistakes in a set of naturally-occurring examples of mass noun errors found on the World Wide Web, suggesting that efforts to collect alignable corpora of pre- and post-editing ESL writing samples offer can enable the development of SMT-based writing assistance tools capable of repairing many of the complex syntactic and lexical problems found in the writing of ESL learners.

SO MICROSCOPY
AB Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has realized high-throughput defect monitoring of semiconductor devices. As miniaturization and complexification of semiconductor circuit patterns increase in recent years, so has the number of defects. There is thus a great need to further increase the throughput of SEM defect monitoring. Toward this end, we propose a deep learning-based super-resolution method that reproduces high-resolution (HR) images from corresponding low-resolution images. Image quality factors such as pattern contrast and sharpness are important in SEM HR images in order to evaluate the quality of printed circuit patterns. Our proposed method meets various image quality requirements by changing the loss calculation method pixelwise based on the pattern in the image. It realizes super-resolved images that compare favorably with actual HR images and can improve SEM throughput by 100% or more.

AB Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is of importance for variable real-world applications but remains more challenges like stationarity and scalability. While recently value function factorization methods have obtained empirical good results in cooperative multi-agent environment, these works mostly focus on the decomposable learning structures. Inspired by the application of attention mechanism in machine translation and other related domains, we propose an attention based approach called attention value decomposition network (AVD-Net), which capitalizes on the coordination relations between agents. AVD-Net employs centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, which factorizes the joint action-value functions with only local observations and actions of agents. Our method is evaluated on multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and StarCraft micromanagement environment (SMAC). The experiment results show the strength of our approach compared to existing methods with state-of-the-art performance in cooperative scenarios.

AB Despite the advances achieved by neural models in sequence to sequence learning, exploited in a variety of tasks, they still make errors. In many use cases, these are corrected by a human expert in a posterior revision process. The interactive-predictive framework aims to minimize the human effort spent on this process by considering partial corrections for iteratively refining the hypothesis. In this work, we generalize the interactive-predictive approach, typically applied in to machine translation field, to tackle other multimodal problems namely, image and video captioning. We study the application of this framework to multimodal neural sequence to sequence models. We show that, following this framework, we approximately halve the effort spent for correcting the outputs generated by the automatic systems. Moreover, we deploy our systems in a publicly accessible demonstration, that allows to better understand the behavior of the interactive-predictive framework.

AB Artificial neural networks excel at doing specific tasks like image recognition, sequence learning, machine translation. But, the direction of research has moved towards the creation of more general purpose neural network architectures. Recently, DeepMind introduced Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC), with an external memory system that is capable of working on complex data structures. DNC can infer from graph problem, solve block puzzle using reinforcement learning and so on. DNC uses LSTM as controller network that manipulates the memory matrix. In this paper, we introduce a change to DNC architecture by replacing LSTM network with multiplicative LSTM and measure the performance of the improved model by training it on three different tasks; namely question answering task using bAbI dataset, character level modelling using harry potter text and planning search using air cargo problem. We compared the performance of the previous model to determine its behavior.

AB In the literature, various supervised learning approaches have been adopted to address the task of emotion classification. However, the performance of these approaches greatly suffers when the size of the labeled data is limited. In this paper, we tackle this challenge from a cross-lingual sensoria where the labeled data in a resource-rich language (i.e., English in this study) is employed to improve the emotion classification performance in a resource-poor language (i.e., Chinese in this study). Specifically, we first use machine translation services to eliminate the language gap between Chinese and English data and then propose a joint learning framework to leverage both Chinese and English data, which develops auxiliary representations from several auxiliary emotion classification tasks. Furthermore, in our joint learning approach, we introduce an attention mechanism to capture informative words. Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach to emotion classification.

The shape recognition capability of Krawtchouk moment-based local features is verified on two databases: the standard Jochen Triesch's database and 26 ISL alphabets which are collected from 72 different subjects, with variations in position, scale and rotation. Feature selection is performed to minimise redundancy. The effect of order and feature dimensionality for different classifiers is studied. Results show that Krawtchouk moment-based local features are found to exhibit user, scale, rotation and translation invariance. Moreover, they have shape identification capability.

AB Morphological annotation constitutes a separate layer in the multi-layered annotation scenario of the Prague Dependency Treebank. At this layer, morphological categories expressed by a word form are captured in a positional part-of-speech tag. According to the Praguian approach based on the relation between form and function, functions (meanings) of morphological categories are represented as well, namely as grammateme attributes at the deep-syntactic (tectogrammatical) layer of the treebank.
   In the present paper, we first describe the role of morphology in the Prague Dependency Treebank, and then outline several recent topics based on Praguian morphology: named entity recognition in Czech, formemes attributes encoding morpho-syntactic information in the dependency-based machine translation system, and development of a lexical database of derivational relations based partially on information provided by the morphological analyser.

AB Arabic sign languages still lack exhaustive scientific studies of their grammatical structure, morpho-syntactic rules, as well as the rules that govern the construction of sentences in these languages. Such studies are necessary for the development and evolution of any language (spoken or sign language). In addition, the lack of tools that help researchers and all those interested in studying Arab sign languages is another obstacle. Among these tools, we highline the importance of the availability of a language for representing Sign Language (SL) in a written form. In this context, we present a new initiative toward the creation of an Arab Gloss writing system for Arab sign languages based on gloss annotation system like American Sign Language. This new transcription system can be useful for learning, teaching or studying as well as developing Sign Language Processing tool like machine translation or building n-gram models.

AB Herein we report the design, synthesis, and properties of novel electromechanical actuators based on organic polymers that are capable of redox-induced dimensional change at the molecular level. Specifically, this report will focus on regioisomers of poly(cyclooctatetrathiophene), and, evidence of corresponding single molecule actuation. Cyclooctatetrathiophene has been calculated to undergo atom-to-atom dimensional changes of up to 10% upon redox switching. In theory, this distance change occurring within the repeat unit of the polymer can be translated into dimensional changes in both the single polymer chain and bulk material. As such, electromechanical actuation in this system is an intrinsic property of the individual chains, not a bulk property of the material. However, this, translation varies as a function of both environment and regioisomer. Our ultimate goal of demonstrating single-molecule electromechanical actuation will be discussed herein.

In this paper, we present HIJaX, a novel Natural Language-to-JavaScript generator prototype, that creates workable XSS exploit code from English sentences using neural machine translation. We train and test the HIJaX model with a variety of datasets containing benign and malicious intents along with differing numbers of baseline code entries to demonstrate how to best create datasets for XSS code generation. We also examine part-of-speech tagging algorithms and automated dataset expansion scripts to aid the dataset creation and code generation processes. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of deploying auto-generated XSS attacks against real-world websites.

AB The extraction of named entities from unstructured text is a crucial component in numerous Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications such as information retrieval, question answering, machine translation, to name but a few. Named-entity Recognition (NER) aims at locating proper nouns from unstructured text and classifying them into a predefined set of types, such as persons, locations, and organizations. There has been extensive research on improving the accuracy of NER in English text. For other languages such as Arabic, extracting Named-entities is quite challenging due to its morphological structure. In this paper, we introduce ArabiaNer, a system employing Conditional Random Field (CRF) learning algorithm with extensive feature engineering steps to effectively extract Arabic named Entities. ArabiaNer produced state-of-the-art results with f1-score of 91.31% when applied on the ANERcrop dataset.

AB Adversarial attacks alter NLP model predictions by perturbing test-time inputs. However, it is much less understood whether, and how, predictions can be manipulated with small, concealed changes to the training data. In this work, we develop a new data poisoning attack that allows an adversary to control model predictions whenever a desired trigger phrase is present in the input. For instance, we insert 50 poison examples into a sentiment model's training set that causes the model to frequently predict Positive whenever the input contains "James Bond". Crucially, we craft these poison examples using a gradient-based procedure so that they do not mention the trigger phrase. We also apply our poison attack to language modeling ("Apple iPhone" triggers negative generations) and machine translation ("iced coffee" mistranslated as "hot coffee"). We conclude by proposing three defenses that can mitigate our attack at some cost in prediction accuracy or extra human annotation.

TI Determination of isoform-specific RNA structure with nanopore long reads
SO NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Current methods for determining RNA structure with short-read sequencing cannot capture most differences between distinct transcript isoforms. Here we present RNA structure analysis using nanopore sequencing (PORE-cupine), which combines structure probing using chemical modifications with direct long-read RNA sequencing and machine learning to detect secondary structures in cellular RNAs. PORE-cupine also captures global structural features, such as RNA-binding-protein binding sites and reactivity differences at single-nucleotide variants. We show that shared sequences in different transcript isoforms of the same gene can fold into different structures, highlighting the importance of long-read sequencing for obtaining phase information. We also demonstrate that structural differences between transcript isoforms of the same gene lead to differences in translation efficiency. By revealing isoform-specific RNA structure, PORE-cupine will deepen understanding of the role of structures in controlling gene regulation.

TI HiPHET: HYBRID APPROACH FOR TRANSLATING CODE-MIXED LANGUAGE (HINGLISH)
   TO PURE LANGUAGES (HINDI AND ENGLISH)
SO COMPUTER SCIENCE-AGH
AB Bilingual code-mixed (hybrid) languages have become very popular in India as a result of the spread of technology in the form of television, the Internet, and social media. Due to this increase in the use of code-mixed languages in day-to-day communication, the need for maintaining the integrity of the Indian languages has arisen. As a result of this, a tool named Hinglish to Pure Hindi and Fnglish Translator was developed. The tool is capable of translating in thn ways: namely, Hinglish into pure Hindi and English, pure Hindi into pure English, and vice versa. The tool has achieved an accuracy of 91% in giving Hindi sentences and of 84% in giving English sentences as output when the input sentences were in Hinglish. The tool has also been compared with another similar tools.

TI Linear transformations for cross-lingual semantic textual similarity
SO KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS
AB Cross-lingual semantic textual similarity systems estimate the degree of the meaning similarity between two sentences, each in a different language. State-of-the-art algorithms usually employ machine translation and combine vast amount of features, making the approach strongly supervised, resource rich, and difficult to use for poorly-resourced languages.
   In this paper, we study linear transformations, which project monolingual semantic spaces into a shared space using bilingual dictionaries. We propose a novel transformation, which builds on the best ideas from prior works. We experiment with unsupervised techniques for sentence similarity based only on semantic spaces and we show they can be significantly improved by the word weighting. Our transformation outperforms other methods and together with word weighting leads to very promising results on several datasets in different languages. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI New RNN Activation Technique for Deeper Networks: LSTCM Cells
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Long short-term memory (LSTM) has shown good performance when used with sequential data, but gradient vanishing or exploding problem can arise, especially when using deeper layers to solve complex problems. Thus, in this paper, we propose a new LSTM cell termed long short-time complex memory (LSTCM) that applies an activation function to the cell state instead of a hidden state for better convergence in deep layers. Moreover, we propose a sinusoidal function as an activation function for LSTM and the proposed LSTCM instead of a hyperbolic tangent activation function. The performance capabilities of the proposed LSTCM cell and the sinusoidal activation function are demonstrated through experiments on various natural language benchmark datasets, in this case the Penn Tree-bank, IWSLT 2015 English-Vietnamese, and WMT 2014 English-German datasets.

AB With the spread of digital cameras, smart phones, and SNS, the number facial images of people have increased. Facial expression generation from a single facial image has been widely applied to the fields of entertainment and social communication. Many approaches that apply machine learning techniques have been developed. In our previous study, we developed a makeup simulator system. However, this system is incapable of changing the impression of a cosmetic face based on changes in facial expression; in addition, another challenge is that the user cannot see the impression of makeup dynamically and objectively. Therefore, in this study, we generate static facial expression images from a natural (expressionless) image by using generative adversarial networks, which is critical to the research on dynamic facial expression change. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves the best expression image.

AB This paper considers cross-lingual image annotation, harvesting deep visual models from one language to annotate images with labels from another language. This task cannot be accomplished by machine translation, as labels can be ambiguous and a translated vocabulary leaves us limited freedom to annotate images with appropriate labels. Given non-overlapping vocabularies between two languages, we formulate cross-lingual image annotation as a zero-shot learning problem. For cross-lingual label matching, we adapt zero-shot by replacing the current monolingual semantic embedding space by a bilingual alternative. In order to reduce both label ambiguity and redundancy we propose a simple yet effective approach called label-enhanced zero-shot learning. Using three state-of-the-art deep visual models, i.e., ResNet-152, GoogleNet-Shuffle and OpenImages, experiments on the test set of Flickr8k-CN demonstrate the viability of the proposed approach for cross-lingual image annotation.

AB Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a well-studied area in natural language processing (NLP) and the reported results in the literature are generally very high (similar to>%95) for most of the languages. Today, the focus area of most practical natural language applications (i.e. web mining, sentiment analysis, machine translation) is real natural language data such as Web2.0 or speech data. Nevertheless, the NER task is rarely investigated on this type of data which differs severely from formal written text. In this paper, we present 3 new Turkish data sets from different domains (on this focused area; namely from Twitter, a Speech-to-Text Interface and a Hardware Forum) annotated specifically for NER and report our first results on them. We believe, the paper draws light to the difficulty of these new domains for NER and the possible future work.

In this paper we describe a statistical method based on Chi-square test. The traditional algorithm implementing this method is an inefficient and time-consuming one. The aim of the paper is to develop the algorithm of this method based on distributed computing model. So we describe the implementation of the algorithm based on the MapReduce model of distributed computing and present the results of experiments showing the benefits of distributed computing.

Key to our approach is the integration of lexicographic and encyclopedic knowledge from WordNet and Wikipedia. In addition, Machine Translation is applied to enrich the resource with lexical information for all languages. We first conduct in vitro experiments on new and existing gold-standard datasets to show the high quality and coverage of BabelNet. We then show that our lexical resource can be used successfully to perform both monolingual and cross-lingual Word Sense Disambiguation: thanks to its wide lexical coverage and novel semantic relations, we are able to achieve state-of the-art results on three different SemEval evaluation tasks.

Automated classifiers using features derived from multiwavelet transform, fractal dimension and other measurements, and using texton forests have shown considerable successes. This paper presents our study on application of cardinal multiridgelet transform (CMRT) to prostate cancer images to extract texture features in the transform domain. CMRT can provide cardinality, approximate translation invariance and rotation invariance simultaneously. With 32 images of Gleason grade 3 and grade 4 as a training set and using texture features extracted therefrom, a support vector machine with Gaussian kernel has been trained to classify grade 3 and grade 4. The leave-one-out cross-validation showed its accuracy of 93.75% and AUC of 0.9651. 10 test images of grade 4 showed 100% accuracy.

AB Transformer recently has achieved impressive success in a number of domains, including machine translation, image recognition, and speech recognition. Most of the previous work on Keyword Spotting (KWS) is built upon convolutional or recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we explore a family of Transformer architectures for keyword spotting, optimizing the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in a high-speed regime. We also studied the effectiveness and summarized the principles of applying key components in vision Transformers to KWS, including patch embedding, position encoding, attention mechanism, and class token. On top of the findings, we propose the LeTR: a lightweight and highly efficient Transformer for KWS. We consider different efficiency measures on different edge devices so as to reflect a wide range of application scenarios best. Experimental results on two common benchmarks demonstrate that LeTR has achieved state-of-the-art results over competing methods with respect to the speed/accuracy trade-off.

TI Targeting neoantigens for cancer immunotherapy
SO BIOMARKER RESEARCH
AB Neoantigens, a type of tumor-specific antigens derived from non-synonymous mutations, have recently been characterized as attractive targets for cancer immunotherapy. Owing to the development of next-generation sequencing and utilization of machine-learning algorithms, it has become feasible to computationally predict neoantigens by depicting genetic alterations, aberrant post-transcriptional mRNA processing and abnormal mRNA translation events within tumor tissues. Consequently, neoantigen-based therapies such as cancer vaccines have been widely tested in clinical trials and have demonstrated promising safety and efficacy, opening a new era for cancer immunotherapy. We systematically summarize recent advances in the identification of both personalized and public neoantigens, neoantigen formulations and neoantigen-based clinical trials in this review. Moreover, we discuss future techniques and strategies for neoantigen-based cancer treatment either as a monotherapy or as a combination therapy with radiotherapy, chemotherapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors.

AB In this paper, we propose a Bidirectional Attention Network (BANet), an end-to-end framework for monocular depth estimation (MDE) that addresses the limitation of effectively integrating local and global information in convolutional neural networks. The structure of this mechanism derives from a strong conceptual foundation of neural machine translation, and presents a light-weight mechanism for adaptive control of computation similar to the dynamic nature of recurrent neural networks. We introduce bidirectional attention modules that utilize the feed-forward feature maps and incorporate the global context to filter out ambiguity. Extensive experiments reveal the high degree of capability of this bidirectional attention model over feed-forward baselines and other state-of-the-art methods for monocular depth estimation on two challenging datasets - KITTI and DIODE. We show that our proposed approach either outperforms or performs at least on a par with the state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation methods with less memory and computational complexity.

AB Self-attention networks (SANs) with selective mechanism has produced substantial improvements in various NLP tasks by concentrating on a subset of input words. However, the underlying reasons for their strong performance have not been well explained. In this paper, we bridge the gap by assessing the strengths of selective SANs (SSANs), which are implemented with a flexible and universal Gumbel-Softmax. Experimental results on several representative NLP tasks, including natural language inference, semantic role labelling, and machine translation, show that SSANs consistently outperform the standard SANs. Through well-designed probing experiments, we empirically validate that the improvement of SSANs can be attributed in part to mitigating two commonly-cited weaknesses of SANs: word order encoding and structure modeling. Specifically, the selective mechanism improves SANs by paying more attention to content words that contribute to the meaning of the sentence. The code and data are released at https : //github.com/xwgeng/SSAN.

AB It is important to maintain the temperature uniformly in the calcining process at the manufacturing site. However, it is not easy to maintain a constant temperature. To predict the temperature, it is necessary to predict the life of the heating element in the calcining process. The breakdown time of the process should be reduced by replacing the heating element at an appropriate time before the life of the heating element is reached. In this paper, to predict the temperature of the firing furnace used in the manufacturing process, the temperature of the firing furnace was predicted using the Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq) model, which is often used for machine translation. The implemented model proved to have very high accuracy. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Stationary Signal Processing on Graphs
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB Graphs are a central tool in machine learning and information processing as they allow to conveniently capture the structure of complex datasets. In this context, it is of high importance to develop flexible models of signals defined over graphs or networks. In this paper, we generalize the traditional concept of wide sense stationarity to signals defined over the vertices of arbitrary weighted undirected graphs. We show that stationarity is expressed through the graph localization operator reminiscent of translation. We prove that stationary graph signals are characterized by a well-defined power spectral density that can be efficiently estimated even for large graphs. We leverage this new concept to derive Wiener-type estimation procedures of noisy and partially observed signals and illustrate the performance of this new model for denoising and regression.

AB This paper presents an unsupervised learning approach to building a non-English (Arabic) sternmer. The stemming model is based on statistical machine translation and it uses an English sternmer and a small (10K sentences) parallel corpus as its sole training resources. No parallel text is needed after the training phase. Monolingual, unannotated text can be used to further improve the sternmer by allowing it to adapt to a desired domain or genre. Examples and results will be given for Arabic, but the approach is applicable to any language that needs affix removal. Our resource-frugal approach results in 87.5% agreement with a state of the art, proprietary Arabic sternmer built using rules, affix lists, and human annotated text, in addition to an unsupervised component. Task-based evaluation using Arabic information retrieval indicates an improvement of 22-38% in average precision over unstemmed text, and 96% of the performance of the proprietary stemmer above.

TI Rotation invariant texture features and their use in automatic script

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB This paper concerns the extraction of rotation invariant texture features and the use of such features in script identification from document images. Rotation invariant texture features are computed based on an extension of the popular multi-channel Gabor filtering technique, and their effectiveness is tested with 300 randomly rotated samples of 15 Brodatz textures. These features are then used in an attempt to solve a practical but hitherto mostly overlooked problem in document image processing-the identification of the script of a machine printed document. Automatic script and language recognition is an essential front-end process for the efficient and correct use of OCR and language translation products in a multilingual environment. Six languages (Chinese, English, Greek, Russian, Persian, and Malayalam) are chosen to demonstrate the potential of such a texture-based approach in script identification.

TI 3-D CURVE MATCHING USING SPLINES
SO JOURNAL OF ROBOTIC SYSTEMS
AB A machine vision algorithm to find the longest common subcurve of two 3-D curves is presented. The curves are represented by splines fitted through sequences of sample points extracted from dense range data. The approximated 3-D curves are transformed into 1-D numerical strings of rotation and translation invariant shape signatures, based on a multiresolution representation of the curvature and torsion values of the space curves. The shape signature strings are matched using an efficient hashing technique that finds longest matching substrings. The results of the string matching stage are later verified by a robust, least-squares, 3-D curve matching technique, which also recovers the Euclidean transformation between the curves being matched. This algorithm is of average complexity O(n) where n is the number of the sample points on the two curves. The algorithm has applications in assembly and object recognition tasks. Results of assembly experiments are included.

TI Hyperpolarized MRI, functional MRI, MR spectroscopy and CEST to provide
   metabolic information in vivo
SO CURRENT OPINION IN CHEMICAL BIOLOGY
AB Access to metabolic information in vivo using magnetic resonance (MR) technologies has generally been the niche of MR spectroscopy (MRS) and spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). Metabolic fluxes can be studied using the infusion of substrates labeled with magnetic isotopes, with the use of hyperpolarization especially powerful. Unfortunately, these promising methods are not yet accepted clinically, where fast, simple, and reliable measurement and diagnosis are key. Recent advances in functional MRI and chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI allow the use of water imaging to study oxygen metabolism and tissue metabolite levels. These, together with the use of novel data analysis approaches such as machine learning for all of these metabolic MR approaches, are increasing the likelihood of their clinical translation.

AB We present SpeakingFaces as a publicly-available large-scale multimodal dataset developed to support machine learning research in contexts that utilize a combination of thermal, visual, and audio data streams; examples include human-computer interaction, biometric authentication, recognition systems, domain transfer, and speech recognition. SpeakingFaces is comprised of aligned high-resolution thermal and visual spectra image streams of fully-framed faces synchronized with audio recordings of each subject speaking approximately 100 imperative phrases. Data were collected from 142 subjects, yielding over 13,000 instances of synchronized data (similar to 3.8 TB). For technical validation, we demonstrate two baseline examples. The first baseline shows classification by gender, utilizing different combinations of the three data streams in both clean and noisy environments. The second example consists of thermal-to-visual facial image translation, as an instance of domain transfer.

AB Neural methods have been shown to achieve high performance in Named Entity Recognition (NER), but rely on costly high-quality labeled data for training, which is not always available across languages. While previous works have shown that unlabeled data in a target language can be used to improve crosslingual model performance, we propose a novel adversarial approach (AdvPicker) to better leverage such data and further improve results. We design an adversarial learning framework in which an encoder learns entity domain knowledge from labeled source-language data and better shared features are captured via adversarial training - where a discriminator selects less language-dependent target-language data via similarity to the source language. Experimental results on standard benchmark datasets well demonstrate that the proposed method benefits strongly from this data selection process and outperforms existing state-ofthe-art methods; without requiring any additional external resources (e.g., gazetteers or via machine translation).(1)

AB Winograd schemas are a well-established tool for evaluating coreference resolution (CoR) and commonsense reasoning (CSR) capabilities of computational models. So far, schemas remained largely confined to English, limiting their utility in multilingual settings. This work presents Wino-X, a parallel dataset of German, French, and Russian schemas, aligned with their English counterparts. We use this resource to investigate whether neural machine translation (NMT) models can perform CoR that requires commonsense knowledge and whether multilingual language models (MLLMs) are capable of CSR across multiple languages. Our findings show Wino-X to be exceptionally challenging for NMT systems that are prone to undesireable biases and unable to detect disambiguating information. We quantify biases using established statistical methods and define ways to address both of these issues. We furthermore present evidence of active cross-lingual knowledge transfer in MLLMs, whereby fine-tuning models on English schemas yields CSR improvements in other languages.(1)

AB One of the barriers of sentiment analysis research in low-resource languages such as Bengali is the lack of annotated data. Manual annotation requires resources, which are scarcely available in low-resource languages. We present a cross-lingual hybrid methodology that utilizes machine translation and prior sentiment information to generate accurate pseudo-labels. By leveraging the pseudo-labels, a supervised ML classifier is trained for sentiment classification. We contrast the performance of the proposed self-supervised methodology with the Bengali and English sentiment classification methods (i.e., methods which do not require labeled data). We observe that the self-supervised hybrid methodology improves the macro F1 scores by 15%-25%. The results infer that the proposed framework can improve the performance of sentiment classification in low-resource languages that lack labeled data.

AB Even though SRL is researched for many languages, major improvements have mostly been obtained for English, for which more resources are available. In fact, existing multilingual SRL datasets contain disparate annotation styles or come from different domains, hampering generalization in multilingual learning. In this work we propose a method to automatically construct an SRL corpus that is parallel in four languages: English, French, German, Spanish, with unified predicate and role annotations that are fully comparable across languages. We apply high-quality machine translation to the English CoNLL-09 dataset and use multilingual BERT to project its high-quality annotations to the target languages. We include human-validated test sets that we use to measure the projection quality, and show that projection is denser and more precise than a strong baseline. Finally, we train different SOTA models on our novel corpus for mono- and multilingual SRL, showing that the multilingual annotations improve performance especially for the weaker languages.

AB Semantic lexicon and semantic framework are the primary support of natural language processing tasks such as information extraction, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. Therefore, it is essential to construct the contemporary Chinese common verbs' semantic framework dictionary that covers rich semantic knowledge. Based on an analysis of current research results, this paper defines the lexical framework of common Chinese verbs. According to the predicate thematic roles, the semantic framework is divided into the basic semantic framework and extended semantic framework. Frameworks which are automatically extracted, taking semantics as the processing unit, and summarized based on large-scale lexical and thematic roles labeling corpus. The complete and simplified versions of the verb framework is constructed with the help of manual proofreading. The final verb framework contains a detailed description and corresponding example sentences of 2,782 common verbs with 4,516 meanings.

AB The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer is an important advancement in the field of neural networks and machine learning, allowing for effective training and impressive inference performance. LSTM-based neural networks have been successfully employed in various applications such as speech processing and language translation. The LSTM layer can be simplified by removing certain components, potentially speeding up training and runtime with limited change in performance. In particular, several recently introduced variants, called Slim LSTMs, have shown success in initial experiments to support this view. In this paper, we perform computational analysis of the validation accuracy of a convolutional plus recurrent neural network architecture designed to analyze sentiment, using comparatively the standard LSTM and three Slim LSTM layers. We found that some realizations of the Slim LSTM layers can potentially perform as well as the standard LSTM layer for our considered architecture targeted at sentiment analysis.

AB Text matching based on deep learning models often suffer from the limitation of query term coverage problems. Inspired by the success of attention based models in machine translation, which the models can automatically search for parts of a sentence that are relevant to a target word, we propose a multi-level attention model with maximum matching matrix rank to simulate what human does when finding a good answer for a query question. Firstly, we apply a multi-attention mechanism to choose the high effect document words for every query words. Then an approach we called reciprocal relative standard deviation (RRSD) will calculate the matching coverage score for all query words. Experiments on both question-answer task and learning to rank task have achieved state-of-the-art results compared to traditional statistical methods and deep neural network methods.

AB Translation of Data analysis algorithms from data analysis language to high-level programming language is hard work when we construct a cloud computing platform for data analysis. It adds implementation difficulty and maintenance cost of constructing the platform. This paper suggests a new method to use the popular data analysis language R directly on constructing a cloud computing platform. By using resource virtualization techniques, computing resource environment is virtualized into R cluster based on given configurations. By allocating different R machines from R cluster to specified data analysis service, we solve the problem that data analysis algorithms implemented in R should be run in single-user mode only and cannot be customized. After verification, this method simplifies the work of translating data analysis algorithms and speeds up the process of constructing a cloud computing platform for data analysis.

AB The initial behavioural specification of any software programs goes through significant optimizing and parallelizing transformations, automated and also human guided, before being mapped to an architecture. Establishing validity of these transformations is crucial to ensure that they preserve the original behaviour. PRES+ model (Petri net based Representation of Embedded Systems) encompassing data processing is used to model parallel behaviours. Being value based with inherent scope of capturing parallelism, PRES+ models depict such data dependencies more directly; accordingly, they are likely to be more convenient as the intermediate representations (IRs) of both the source and the transformed codes for translation validation than strictly sequential variable-based IRs like Finite State Machines with Data path (FSMDs) (which are essentially sequential control flow graphs (CFGs)). In this work, a path based equivalence checking method for PRES+ models is presented.

AB We propose a convolutional neural network, named genCNN, for word sequence prediction. Different from previous work on neural network-based language modeling and generation (e.g., RNN or LSTM), we choose not to greedily summarize the history of words as a fixed length vector. Instead, we use a convolutional neural network to predict the next word with the history of words of variable length. Also different from the existing feed-forward networks for language modeling, our model can effectively fuse the local correlation and global correlation in the word sequence, with a convolution-gating strategy specifically designed for the task. We argue that our model can give adequate representation of the history, and therefore can naturally exploit both the short and long range dependencies. Our model is fast, easy to train, and readily parallelized. Our extensive experiments on text generation and n-best re-ranking in machine translation show that genCNN outperforms the state-of-the-arts with big margins.

SO LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
AB We present a verb-complement dictionary of Modern Hebrew, automatically extracted from text corpora. Carefully examining a large set of examples, we defined ten types of verb complements that cover the vast majority of the occurrences of verb complements in the corpora. We explored several collocation measures as indicators of the strength of the association between the verb and its complement. We then used these measures to automatically extract verb complements from corpora. The result is a wide-coverage, accurate dictionary that lists not only the likely complements for each verb, but also the likelihood of each complement. We evaluated the quality of the extracted dictionary both intrinsically and extrinsically. Intrinsically, we showed high precision and recall on randomly (but systematically) selected verbs. Extrinsically, we showed that using the extracted information is beneficial for two applications, prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation and Arabic-to-Hebrew machine translation.

AB The IP-based Internet of Things refers to the interconnection of smart devices in a Low-power and Lossy Network (LLN) with the Internet by means of protocols such as 6LoWPAN or CoAP. The mechanisms to protect the LLN from attacks from the Internet and provisioning of an end-to-end (E2E) secure connection are key requirements for functionalities ranging from network access to software updates. Interconnecting such resource constrained devices with high-performance machines requires new security mechanisms that cannot be covered by already known solutions. This paper describes attacks at transport layer against the LLN launched from the Internet. It also introduces approaches to ensure E2E security between two devices located in homogeneous networks using either HTTP/TLS or CoAP/DTLS by proposing a mapping between TLS and DTLS.

In this view it is a dynamic framework where we can share ideas and technologies, refine algorithms, see and discuss performance and errors of our algorithms that are daily applied on fresh data.
   In this paper we describe a framework in which a set of parallel news streams in different languages are automatically transcribed and translated. The architecture of the system utilizes modules that perform ASR, MT and NLP. The development of the various modules relies upon a continuous acquisition activity of parallel data (both audio and texts) in different languages.
   In particular, the availability of large corpora of aligned multi-lingual text/audio data has allowed to implement unsupervised Acoustic Model (AM) training approaches.

TI AAV vectors for RNA-based modulation of gene expression
SO GENE THERAPY
AB At the post-transcriptional level, gene expression is largely regulated through a network of molecular machines that regulate pre-mRNA maturation integrity, transport, translation and degradation. These processes are based on the formation of nucleoprotein complexes and require the recognition of sequence motifs on the RNA. By masking these targets with complementary RNA sequences forming Watson-Crick base pairing, it is possible to efficiently and specifically impact on the cell phenotype, or to compensate the deleterious effect of mutations. Here we review how the adeno-associated virus technology is being exploited for expressing non-coding RNAs in tissues such as the brain, muscle or liver, in functional genomic studies as well as for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

AB This paper presents the participation of the University of Ottawa group in the Cross-Language Speech Retrieval (CL-SR) task at CLEF 2007. We present the results of the submitted runs for the English collection. We have used two Information Retrieval systems in our experiments: SMART and Terrier, with two query expansion techniques: one based on a thesaurus and the second one based on blind relevant feedback. We proposed two novel data fusion methods for merging the results of several models (retrieval schemes available in SMART and Terrier). Our experiments showed that the combination of query expansion methods and data fusion methods helps to improve the retrieval performance. We also present cross-language experiments, where the queries are automatically translated by combining the results of several online machine translation tools. Experiments on indexing the manual summaries and keywords gave the best retrieval results.

AB This paper describes the modeling of a biomass based weed-crop competitiveness classification process, based on a Bayesian network classifier The understandability of the model is improved by its automatic translation into a set of classification rules, which are easily understood by human beings. The Bayes approach is based on empirical data collected in a corn-crop and uses the concept of maximum a posteriori probability to extract a set of probabilistic rules from the induced Bayesian network classifier The features used to build the Bayesian network classifier are the total density of weeds and the corresponding proportions of narrow and broadleaf weeds and the class variable is the weeds biomass from which the weed-crop competitiveness is inferred. The paper presents a set of 27 rules extracted from the Bayesian network classifier which classify the biomass of weeds.

TI Fuzzy query interface for a business database
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES
AB Managers, in today's corporations, rely increasingly on the use of databases to obtain insights and updated information to make their decisions. This paper describes a flexible query interface based on fuzzy logic. Hence, queries in natural language with pre-defined syntactical structures are performed, and the system uses a fuzzy natural language process to provide answers. This process. uses the fuzzy translation rules of the meaning representation language PRUF, proposed by Zadeh (Intern. J. Man-Machine Studies 10 (1978) 395). The interface was built for a relational database of the 500 biggest non-financial Portuguese companies. The attributes considered are the economic and financial indicators. Examples of pseudo-natural language queries, such as "is company X very profitable?" or "are most private companies productive?", are presented to show the capabilities of this human-oriented interface.

TI Artificial intelligence to bring nanomedicine to life
SO ADVANCED DRUG DELIVERY REVIEWS
AB The technology of drug delivery systems (DDSs) has demonstrated an outstanding performance and effectiveness in production of pharmaceuticals, as it is proved by many FDA-approved nanomedicines that have an enhanced selectivity, manageable drug release kinetics and synergistic therapeutic actions. Nonetheless, to date, the rational design and high-throughput development of nanomaterial-based DDSs for specific purposes is far from a routine practice and is still in its infancy, mainly due to the limitations in scientists' capabilities to effectively acquire, analyze, manage, and comprehend complex and evergrowing sets of experimental data, which is vital to develop DDSs with a set of desired functionalities. At the same time, this task is feasible for the data-driven approaches, high throughput experimentation techniques, process automatization, artificial intelligence (AI) technology, and machine learning (ML) approaches, which is referred to as The Fourth Paradigm of scientific research. Therefore, an integration of these approaches with nanomedicine and nanotechnology can potentially accelerate the rational design and high-throughput development of highly efficient nanoformulated drugs and smart materials with pre-defined functionalities. In this Review, we survey the important results and milestones achieved to date in the application of data science, high throughput, as well as automatization approaches, combined with AI and ML to design and optimize DDSs and related nanomaterials. This manuscript mission is not only to reflect the state-of-art in data-driven nanomedicine, but also show how recent findings in the related fields can transform the nanomedicine's image. We discuss how all these results can be used to boost nanomedicine translation to the clinic, as well as highlight the future directions for the development, data-driven, high throughput experimentation-, and AI-assisted design, as well as the production of nanoformulated drugs and smart materials with pre-defined properties and behavior. This Review will be of high interest to the chemists involved in materials science, nanotechnology, and DDSs development for biomedical applications, although the general nature of the presented approaches enables knowledge translation to many other fields of science.

TI Near Infrared Spectral Analysis Algorithms for Traceability of Fishmeal
   Origin
SO SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
AB Fish meal is a kind of high-protein feed made up of one or more kinds of fish, which occupies a very important position in the aquaculture industry. In order to maintain market order, a method of tracing the origin of the fish meal should be established to identify and analyze the quality of the fish meal more accurately. In this paper, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and chemometrics are used to trace the origin of fish meal from different habitats quickly and accurately. The support vector machine with radial basis function (RBF-SVM) as the kernel function is used for pattern recognition, and the gray wolf algorithm is used to select the key parameters of RBF-SVM. By simulating the hunting behavior of wolves, a hierarchical system is set up according to the fitness level. The target parameters gradually approximate the movement of encirclement. After each movement, the adaptability is re-evaluated. The prey is finally captured through the iteration of wolf pack rank, and the optimal penalty factor and the radius of the kernel function are searched. Finally, the optimal parameters are used to establish the support vector machine model to trace the origin of fish meal from different origins. Grey Wolf algorithm can improve the speed and accuracy of selecting key parameters in the support vector machine algorithm, and improve the classification accuracy of support vector machine. In this paper, 144 spectra of fish meal samples from four fishmeal producing areas in ZhejiangWenling, Shandong Rongcheng, Shandong Weihai and Liaoning Dalian were obtained. The spectrum ranges from 3700 to 12500 cm(-1). The origin of fish meal was traced by the obtained spectra. Seventy percent of the samples from each producing area was randomly selected as the training sample set for modeling and 30 percent as the test sample set. First, the original near infrared spectra are pretreated, and the average spectra of all the collected spectra are calculated by multivariate scattering correction as "ideal spectra". The other spectra are linearly regressed, and the baseline correction of spectral translation and migration is carried out. The original signal is decomposed by wavelet transform, and the high-frequency signal is thresholded to eliminate the high-frequency noise so as to achieve the smooth denoising effect of the spectral curve. Ten parallel experiments were carried out by support vector machine to reduce error interference, and the classification results were obtained as follows: Zhejiang Wenling, Shandong Rongcheng, Shandong Weihai and Liaoning Dalian were 100% 98.89% 96.43% and 97.78% respectively. Compared with the grid search method, the Improved Grey Wolf algorithm searches for the penalty factor and the radius of the kernel function faster and more accurately, and the classification accuracy is high. It can be seen that the improved grey wolf algorithm's support vector machine (GWO-SVM) is feasible for tracing the origin of fish meal.

TI Advances in the computational and molecular understanding of the
   prostate cancer cell nucleus
SO JOURNAL OF CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Nuclear alterations are a hallmark of many types of cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa). Recent evidence shows that subvisual changes, ones that may not be visually perceptible to a pathologist, to the nucleus and its ultrastructural components can precede visual histopathological recognition of cancer. Alterations to nuclear features, such as nuclear size and shape, texture, and spatial architecture, reflect the complex molecular-level changes that occur during oncogenesis. Quantitative nuclear morphometry, a field that uses computational approaches to identify and quantify malignancy-induced nuclear changes, can enable a detailed and objective analysis of the PCa cell nucleus. Recent advances in machine learning-based approaches can now automatically mine data related to these changes to aid in the diagnosis, decision making, and prediction of PCa prognoses. In this review, we use PCa as a case study to connect the molecular-level mechanisms that underlie these nuclear changes to the machine learning computational approaches, bridging the gap between the clinical and computational understanding of PCa. First, we will discuss recent developments to our understanding of the molecular events that drive nuclear alterations in the context of PCa: the role of the nuclear matrix and lamina in size and shape changes, the role of 3-dimensional chromatin organization and epigenetic modifications in textural changes, and the role of the tumor microenvironment in altering nuclear spatial topology. We will then discuss the advances in the applications of machine learning algorithms to automatically segment nuclei in prostate histopathological images, extract nuclear features to aid in diagnostic decision making, and predict potential outcomes, such as biochemical recurrence and survival. Finally, we will discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with translation of the quantitative nuclear morphometry methodology into the clinical space. Ultimately, accurate identification and quantification of nuclear alterations can contribute to the field of nucleomics and has applications for computationally driven precision oncologic patient care.

TI A State-of-the-Art Survey on Deep Learning Theory and Architectures
SO ELECTRONICS
AB In recent years, deep learning has garnered tremendous success in a variety of application domains. This new field of machine learning has been growing rapidly and has been applied to most traditional application domains, as well as some new areas that present more opportunities. Different methods have been proposed based on different categories of learning, including supervised, semi-supervised, and un-supervised learning. Experimental results show state-of-the-art performance using deep learning when compared to traditional machine learning approaches in the fields of image processing, computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, art, medical imaging, medical information processing, robotics and control, bioinformatics, natural language processing, cybersecurity, and many others. This survey presents a brief survey on the advances that have occurred in the area of Deep Learning (DL), starting with the Deep Neural Network (DNN). The survey goes on to cover Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Auto-Encoder (AE), Deep Belief Network (DBN), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Additionally, we have discussed recent developments, such as advanced variant DL techniques based on these DL approaches. This work considers most of the papers published after 2012 from when the history of deep learning began. Furthermore, DL approaches that have been explored and evaluated in different application domains are also included in this survey. We also included recently developed frameworks, SDKs, and benchmark datasets that are used for implementing and evaluating deep learning approaches. There are some surveys that have been published on DL using neural networks and a survey on Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, those papers have not discussed individual advanced techniques for training large-scale deep learning models and the recently developed method of generative models.

TI Winning the Race With Ever-Smarter Machines
SO MIT SLOAN MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB Rapid advances in information technology computer hardware, software and networks are yielding applications that can do anything from answering game show questions to driving cars. But to gain true leverage from these ever-improving technologies, companies need new processes and business models.
   The authors observe that automated activities that once seemed impossible are becoming real, because of plentiful accurate data, powerful sensors, massive storage capacity and increasing processing power. The capabilities of computers are now improving so quickly that concepts can move from the realm of science fiction into everyday life in just a few years, rather than a lifetime.
   This remarkable progress is due to two concepts: Moore's Law (now generally accepted as the doubling of computing capacity every 18 months) and the power of exponential growth. The authors point out that digitization is an ongoing process of creative destruction that innovators use to make deep changes at the level of the task, the process and the organization itself. Its effects can be seen in all industries and sectors.
   Rather than positioning these changes as humans against machines, the authors propose that the key is to "win" by using machines to invent new organizational structures, processes and business models that mix human and machine capabilities. They detail several strategies, including creating processes that combine the speed of technology with human insight, leveraging IT to enable new forms of human collaboration and commerce, using human insight to apply IT in order to improve processes, and using IT to propagate the new processes that people develop. When businesses are based on bits instead of atoms, the possibilities for innovation are endless.
   This article also includes a list of new technologies to watch - such as voice recognition and translation software and one of skills that will remain in demand. As computers get better at pattern recognition, complex communication and other skills, many kinds of jobs will become obsolete. But computers' limitations - such as an inability to think "outside the box" or to empathize - ensure that skills such as negotiation, good writing and good management will continue to be needed.

TI Increased levels of nerve growth factor accompany oxidative load in
   recurrent pregnancy loss. Machine learning applied to FT-Raman spectra
   study
SO BIOPROCESS AND BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
AB The presented article is focused on developing and validating an efficient, credible, minimally invasive technique based on spectral signatures of blood serum samples in patients with diagnosed recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) versus healthy individuals who were followed at the Gynecology department. A total of 120 participants, RPL disease (n = 60) and healthy individuals (n = 60), participated in the study. First, we investigated the effect of circulating nerve growth factor (NGF) in RPL and healthy groups. To show NGF's effect, we measured the level of oxidative loads such as Total Antioxidant Level (TAS), Total Oxidant Level (TOS), and Oxidative Stress Index (OSI) with Beckman Coulter AU system and biochemical assays. We find a correlation between oxidative load and NGF level. Oxidative load mainly causes structural changes in the blood. Therefore, we obtained Raman measurements of the participant's serum. Then we selected two Raman regions, 800 and 1800 cm(-1), and between 2700 cm(-1) and 3000 cm(-1), to see chemical changes. We noted that Raman spectra obtained for RPL and healthy women differed. The findings confirm that the imbalance between reactive oxygen species and antioxidants has important implications for the pathogenesis of RPL and that NGF levels accompany the level of oxidative load in the RPL state. Biomolecular structure and composition were determined using Raman spectroscopy and machine learning methods, and the correlation of these parameters was studied alongside machine learning technologies to advance toward clinical translation. Here we determined and validated the development of instrumentation for the Analysis of RPL patients' serum that can differentiate from control individuals with an accuracy of 100% using the Raman region corresponding to structural changes. Furthermore, this study found a correlation between traditional biochemical parameters and Raman data. This suggests that Raman spectroscopy is a sensitive tool for detecting biochemical changes in serum caused by RPL or other diseases.

TI Semantic Matching in Search
SO FOUNDATIONS AND TRENDS IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL
AB Relevance is the most important factor to assure users' satisfaction in search and the success of a search engine heavily depends on its performance on relevance. It has been observed that most of the dissatisfaction cases in relevance are due to term mismatch between queries and documents (e.g., query "ny times" does not match well with a document only containing "New York Times"), because term matching, i.e., the bag-of-words approach, still functions as the main mechanism of modern search engines. It is not exaggerated to say, therefore, that mismatch between query and document poses the most critical challenge in search. Ideally, one would like to see query and document match with each other, if they are topically relevant. Recently, researchers have expended significant effort to address the problem. The major approach is to conduct semantic matching, i.e., to perform more query and document understanding to represent the meanings of them, and perform better matching between the enriched query and document representations. With the availability of large amounts of log data and advanced machine learning techniques, this becomes more feasible and significant progress has been made recently. This survey gives a systematic and detailed introduction to newly developed machine learning technologies for query document matching (semantic matching) in search, particularly web search. It focuses on the fundamental problems, as well as the state-of-the-art solutions of query document matching on form aspect, phrase aspect, word sense aspect, topic aspect, and structure aspect. The ideas and solutions explained may motivate industrial practitioners to turn the research results into products. The methods introduced and the discussions made may also stimulate academic researchers to find new research directions and approaches. Matching between query and document is not limited to search and similar problems can be found in question answering, online advertising, cross-language information retrieval, machine translation, recommender systems, link prediction, image annotation, drug design, and other applications, as the general task of matching between objects from two different spaces. The technologies introduced can be generalized into more general machine learning techniques, which is referred to as learning to match in this survey.

TI A machine learning approach for predicting methionine oxidation sites
SO BMC BIOINFORMATICS
AB Background: The oxidation of protein-bound methionine to form methionine sulfoxide, has traditionally been regarded as an oxidative damage. However, recent evidences support the view of this reversible reaction as a regulatory post-translational modification. The perception that methionine sulfoxidation may provide a mechanism to the redox regulation of a wide range of cellular processes, has stimulated some proteomic studies. However, these experimental approaches are expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, computational methods designed to predict methionine oxidation sites are an attractive alternative. As a first approach to this matter, we have developed models based on random forests, support vector machines and neural networks, aimed at accurate prediction of sites of methionine oxidation.
   Results: Starting from published proteomic data regarding oxidized methionines, we created a hand-curated dataset formed by 113 unique polypeptides of known structure, containing 975 methionyl residues, 122 of which were oxidation-prone (positive dataset) and 853 were oxidation-resistant (negative dataset). We use a machine learning approach to generate predictive models from these datasets. Among the multiple features used in the classification task, some of them contributed substantially to the performance of the predictive models. Thus, (i) the solvent accessible area of the methionine residue, (ii) the number of residues between the analyzed methionine and the next methionine found towards the N-terminus and (iii) the spatial distance between the atom of sulfur from the analyzed methionine and the closest aromatic residue, were among the most relevant features. Compared to the other classifiers we also evaluated, random forests provided the best performance, with accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 0.7468 +/- 0.0567, 0.6817 +/- 0.0982 and 0.7557 +/- 0.0721, respectively (mean +/- standard deviation).
   Conclusions: We present the first predictive models aimed to computationally detect methionine sites that may become oxidized in vivo in response to oxidative signals. These models provide insights into the structural context in which a methionine residue become either oxidation-resistant or oxidation-prone. Furthermore, these models should be useful in prioritizing methinonyl residues for further studies to determine their potential as regulatory post-translational modification sites.

TI Overlap method for the performance evaluation of coordinate measurement
   systems and the calibration of one-dimensional artifacts
SO MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB This article describes a method called 'overlap' to perform two main tasks. The first is the performance evaluation of a coordinate measurement system (CMS) with a measuring range larger than the length of artifacts. The second is the calibration of one-dimensional artifacts using a CMS with a measuring range smaller than the length of the artifacts. Examples of one-dimensional artifacts are ball bars, step gauges, or scale bars with lines or circle marks. For the first task, the method uses the translation between errors in a line inside the volume of the CMS. For the second task, it uses the rotation and translation between 3D coordinates of elements belonging to the artifact. Validation of the method for the first task is done by evaluating the performance of a coordinate measuring machine (CMM) in parallel lines to two of its axes. For this, we use a step gauge and a ball bar covering the range of the CMM's lines under evaluation not using overlap. Later, we evaluate the same lines using a segment of the same step gauge and ball bar but this time using overlap. For the second task, the validation is similar; we use a ball bar whose length falls inside the measurement range of a high-accuracy CMM, then the ball bar can be measured in its entire length with the CMM not using overlap and later in segments using overlap.

SO ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
AB Background: Advances in organ preservation, reconditioning and assessment have been driven by the increasing necessity to utilise organs from extended criteria donors, particularly donors after circulatory death. Research efforts in this area have aided translation of machine perfusion technology into clinical practice. Pigs are anatomically and physiologically similar to humans and are an excellent model. However, conducting large animal experimental research is challenging and typically limited by ethical and economic constraints. Here we describe a reproducible, cost-effective multi-organ abdominal procurement model of porcine organs from the slaughterhouse.
   Methods: Domestic pigs are electrically stunned and exsanguinated following the standard abattoir process. Via a longitudinal midline incision, the thoracoabdominal viscera are removed en bloc by incising along the anterior vertebral plane. The abdominal organs are isolated, perfused and separated preserving their respective vasculature, allowing individual organ use for specific experiments.
   Results: The warm ischaemic time is kept between 15-30 minutes. Using this highly protocolized procurement technique we have procured 12 livers, 162 kidneys and 12 pancreata for research, the majority of which have been utilized for ex situ perfusion experiments.
   Conclusions: We have described a reliable and reproducible procedure for abdominal multi-organ procurement from slaughterhouse pigs.

TI Brain Encoding and Decoding in fMRI with Bidirectional Deep Generative
   Models
SO ENGINEERING
AB Brain encoding and decoding via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are two important aspects of visual perception neuroscience. Although previous researchers have made significant advances in brain encoding and decoding models, existing methods still require improvement using advanced machine learning techniques. For example, traditional methods usually build the encoding and decoding models separately, and are prone to overfitting on a small dataset. In fact, effectively unifying the encoding and decoding procedures may allow for more accurate predictions. In this paper, we first review the existing encoding and decoding methods and discuss the potential advantages of a "bidirectional" modeling strategy. Next, we show that there are correspondences between deep neural networks and human visual streams in terms of the architecture and computational rules. Furthermore, deep generative models (e.g., variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs)) have produced promising results in studies on brain encoding and decoding. Finally, we propose that the dual learning method, which was originally designed for machine translation tasks, could help to improve the performance of encoding and decoding models by leveraging large-scale unpaired data.

TI MicroRNA Expression Profiles for Classification and Analysis of Tumor
   Samples
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB One kind of functional noncoding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), form a class of endogenous RNAs that can have important regulatory roles in animals and plants by targeting transcripts for cleavage or translation repression. Researches on both experimental and computational approaches have shown that miRNAs indeed involve in the human cancer development and progression. However, the miRNAs that contribute more information to the distinction between the normal and tumor samples (tissues) are still undetermined. Recently, the high-throughput microarray technology was used as a powerful technique to measure the expression level of miRNAs in cells. Analyzing this expression data can allow us to determine the functional roles of miRNAs in the living cells. In this paper, we present a computational method to ( 1) predicting the tumor tissues using high-throughput miRNA expression profiles; (2) finding the informative miRNAs that show strong distinction of expression level in tumor tissues. To this end, we perform a support vector machine (SVM) based method to deeply examine one recent miRNA expression dataset. The experimental results show that SVM-based method outperforms other supervised learning methods such as decision trees, Bayesian networks, and backpropagation neural networks. Furthermore, by using the miRNA-target information and Gene Ontology annotations, we showed that the informative miRNAs have strong evidences related to some types of human cancer including breast, lung, and colon cancer.

TI Biotechnology Applications of Cell-Free Expression Systems
SO LIFE-BASEL
AB Cell-free systems are a rapidly expanding platform technology with an important role in the engineering of biological systems. The key advantages that drive their broad adoption are increased efficiency, versatility, and low cost compared to in vivo systems. Traditionally, in vivo platforms have been used to synthesize novel and industrially relevant proteins and serve as a testbed for prototyping numerous biotechnologies such as genetic circuits and biosensors. Although in vivo platforms currently have many applications within biotechnology, they are hindered by time-constraining growth cycles, homeostatic considerations, and limited adaptability in production. Conversely, cell-free platforms are not hindered by constraints for supporting life and are therefore highly adaptable to a broad range of production and testing schemes. The advantages of cell-free platforms are being leveraged more commonly by the biotechnology community, and cell-free applications are expected to grow exponentially in the next decade. In this study, new and emerging applications of cell-free platforms, with a specific focus on cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS), will be examined. The current and near-future role of CFPS within metabolic engineering, prototyping, and biomanufacturing will be investigated as well as how the integration of machine learning is beneficial to these applications.

AB In order to recognize parts' pose on Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) correctly and fast, based on the translation of CMM, A single camera stereo vision measurement method for feature points' 3D coordinate on the measured parts is proposed. According to the double cameras stereo vision principle, a image of the part to be measured is captured by A CCD camera, which is driven by CMM along its X or Y axis, on two different position correspondly. Thus, the part's single camera stereo vision measurement is realized with the proposed image matching method, which is based on the centroid offset of image edge, on two images of the same feature point on the part, and each feature point's 3D coordinate in the camera coordinate system can be obtained. The measuring system is set up, and the experiment is conducted. The feature point's coordinate measuring time is 1.818s, and the difference value, which is between feature points' 3D coordinate calculated with the experiment result and that measured by CMM in the machine coordinate system, is less than 0.3mm. This measuring result can meet parts' pose real-time recognization requirement on the intelligent CMM, and also show that the method proposed in this paper is feasible.

AB Advances in digital speech processing are now supporting application and deployment of a variety of speech technologies for human/machine communication, In fact, new businesses are rapidly forming about these technologies, But these capabilities are of little use unless society can afford them, Happily, explosive advances in microelectronics over the past two decades have assured affordable access to this sophistication as well as to the underlying computing technology, The research challenges in speech processing remain in the traditionally identified areas of recognition, synthesis, and coding, These three areas have typically been addressed individually, often with significant isolation among the efforts. But they are all facets of the same fundamental issue-how to represent and quantify the information in the speech signal. This implies deeper understanding of the physics of speech production, the constraints that the conventions of language impose, and the mechanism for information processing in the auditory system, In ongoing research, therefore, we seek more accurate models of speech generation, better computational formulations of language, and realistic perceptual guides for speech processing-along with ways to coalesce the fundamental issues of recognition, synthesis, and coding, Successful solution will yield the long-sought dictation machine, high-quality synthesis from text, and the ultimate in low bit-rate transmission of speech, It will also open the door to language-translating telephony, where the synthetic foreign translation can be in the voice of the originating talker.

AB One of the reasons Transformer translation models are popular is that self-attention networks for context modelling can be easily parallelized at sequence level. However, the computational complexity of a self-attention network is O(n(2)), increasing quadratically with sequence length. By contrast, the complexity of LSTM-based approaches is only O(n). In practice, however, LSTMs are much slower to train than self-attention networks as they cannot be parallelized at sequence level: to model context, the current LSTM state relies on the full LSTM computation of the preceding state. This has to be computed n times for a sequence of length n. The linear transformations involved in the LSTM gate and state computations are the major cost factors in this. To enable sequence-level parallelization of LSTMs, we approximate full LSTM context modelling by computing hidden states and gates with the current input and a simple bag-of-words representation of the preceding tokens context. This allows us to compute each input step efficiently in parallel, avoiding the formerly costly sequential linear transformations. We then connect the outputs of each parallel step with computationally cheap element-wise computations. We call this the Highly Parallelized LSTM. To further constrain the number of LSTM parameters, we compute several small HPLSTMs in parallel like multi-head attention in the Transformer. The experiments show that our MHPLSTM decoder achieves significant BLEU improvements, while being even slightly faster than the self-attention network in training, and much faster than the standard LSTM.

TI Floating Search Methodology for Combining Classification Models for Site
   Recognition in DNA Sequences
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND BIOINFORMATICS
AB Recognition of the functional sites of genes, such as translation initiation sites, donor and acceptor splice sites and stop codons, is a relevant part of many current problems in bioinformatics. The best approaches use sophisticated classifiers, such as support vector machines. However, with the rapid accumulation of sequence data, methods for combining many sources of evidence are necessary as it is unlikely that a single classifier can solve this problem with the best possible performance. A major issue is that the number of possible models to combine is large and the use of all of these models is impractical. In this paper we present a methodology for combining many sources of information to recognize any functional site using "floating search", a powerful heuristics applicable when the cost of evaluating each solution is high. We present experiments on four functional sites in the human genome, which is used as the target genome, and use another 20 species as sources of evidence. The proposed methodology shows significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods. The results show an advantage of the proposed method and also challenge the standard assumption of using only genomes not very close and not very far from the human to improve the recognition of functional sites.

TI Novel therapeutic strategies for renal graft preservation and their
   potential impact on the future of clinical transplantation
SO CURRENT OPINION IN ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION
AB Purpose of review
   The current review aims to examine recent evidence about improvements, therapeutics and novel approaches for renal graft preservation along with presenting a pragmatic outlook on their potential for clinical translation.
   Recent findings
   Modifying established cold preservation methods (4 degrees C) with oxygenation, gene therapies and gasotransmitters such as hydrogen sulfide has been shown to improve renal graft outcomes with minimum modifications to current protocols. These strategies have also shown promise in the context of normothermic preservation (34-37 degrees C), which circumvents the damage caused by cold preservation. Although normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) is being evaluated in clinical trials, it is limited by high cost, the use of blood and the lack of standardized protocols. Recent studies confirmed that preservation at subnormothermic temperatures (similar to 20 degrees C) is effective with approved preservation solutions and, in conjunction with exogenous hydrogen sulfide therapy, this approach may expedite a static preservation alternative to NMP.
   Summary
   Progress has been made in investigating improvements and alternatives to cold preservation. Promising therapeutic strategies have also been studied in the context of cold, subnormothermic and normothermic preservation. Further research is needed to optimize clinical renal graft preservation.

TI STOCHASTIC EXPANSIONS USING CONTINUOUS DICTIONARIES: LEVY ADAPTIVE
   REGRESSION KERNELS
SO ANNALS OF STATISTICS
AB This article describes a new class of prior distributions for nonparametric function estimation. The unknown function is modeled as a limit of weighted sums of kernels or generator functions indexed by continuous parameters that control local and global features such as their translation, dilation, modulation and shape. Levy random fields and their stochastic integrals are employed to induce prior distributions for the unknown functions or, equivalently, for the number of kernels and for the parameters governing their features. Scaling, shape, and other features of the generating functions are location-specific to allow quite different function properties in different parts of the space, as with wavelet bases and other methods employing overcomplete dictionaries. We provide conditions under which the stochastic expansions converge in specified Besov or Sobolev norms. Under a Gaussian error model, this may be viewed as a sparse regression problem, with regularization induced via the Levy random field prior distribution. Posterior inference for the unknown functions is based on a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We compare the Levy Adaptive Regression Kernel (LARK) method to wavelet-based methods using some of the standard test functions, and illustrate its flexibility and adaptability in nonstationary applications.

SO FRONTIERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE
AB Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the principal cause of mortality and morbidity globally. With the pressures for improved care and translation of the latest medical advances and knowledge to an actionable plan, clinical decision-making for cardiologists is challenging. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field in computer science that studies the design of intelligent agents which take the best feasible action in a situation. It incorporates the use of computational algorithms which simulate and perform tasks that traditionally require human intelligence such as problem solving and learning. Whilst medicine is arguably the last to apply AI in its everyday routine, cardiology is at the forefront of AI revolution in the medical field. The development of AI methods for accurate prediction of CVD outcomes, non-invasive diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD), detection of malignant arrythmias through wearables, and diagnosis, treatment strategies and prediction of outcomes for heart failure (HF) patients, demonstrates the potential of AI in future cardiology. With the advancements of AI, Internet of Things (IoT) and the promotion of precision medicine, the future of cardiology will be heavily based on these innovative digital technologies. Despite this, ethical dilemmas regarding the implementation of AI technologies in real-world are still unaddressed.

TI PhaLP: A Database for the Study of Phage Lytic Proteins and Their

AB Phage lytic proteins are a clinically advanced class of novel enzyme-based antibiotics, so-called enzybiotics. A growing community of researchers develops phage lytic proteins with the perspective of their use as enzybiotics. A successful translation of enzybiotics to the market requires well-considered selections of phage lytic proteins in early research stages. Here, we introduce PhaLP, a database of phage lytic proteins, which serves as an open portal to facilitate the development of phage lytic proteins. PhaLP is a comprehensive, easily accessible and automatically updated database (currently 16,095 entries). Capitalizing on the rich content of PhaLP, we have mapped the high diversity of natural phage lytic proteins and conducted analyses at three levels to gain insight in their host-specific evolution. First, we provide an overview of the modular diversity. Secondly, datamining and interpretable machine learning approaches were adopted to reveal host-specific design rules for domain architectures in endolysins. Lastly, the evolution of phage lytic proteins on the protein sequence level was explored, revealing host-specific clusters. In sum, PhaLP can act as a starting point for the broad community of enzybiotic researchers, while the steadily improving evolutionary insights will serve as a natural inspiration for protein engineers.

AB The increased demand for machine learning applications made companies offer Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS). In MLaaS (a market estimated 8000M USD by 2025), users pay for well-performing ML models without dealing with the complicated training procedure. Among MLaaS, text-based applications are the most popular ones (e.g., language translators). Given this popularity, MLaaS must provide resiliency to adversarial manipulations. For example, a wrong translation might lead to a misunderstanding between two parties. In the text domain, state-of-the-art attacks mainly focus on strategies that leverage ML models' weaknesses. Unfortunately, not much attention has been given to the other pipeline' stages, such as the indexing stage (i.e., when a sentence is converted from a textual to a numerical representation) that, if manipulated, can significantly affect the final performance of the application.
   In this paper, we propose a novel text evasion technique called "Zero-Width attack" (ZeW) that leverages the injection of human non-readable characters, affecting indexing stage mechanisms. We demonstrate that our simple yet effective attack deceives MLaaS of "giants" such as Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft. Our case study, based on the manipulation of hateful tweets, shows that out of 12 analyzed services, only one is resistant to our injection strategy. We finally introduce and test a simple input validation defense that can prevent our proposed attack.

TI Synthetic laparoscopic video generation for machine learning-based

   virtual surgical instruments
SO COMPUTER METHODS IN BIOMECHANICS AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING-IMAGING AND
   VISUALIZATION
AB This paper proposes a synthetic laparoscopic image generation for machine-learning-based surgical instrument segmentation from laparoscopic videos. Recently surgical instrument extraction methods from laparoscopic videos have been studied using deep learning, fuelling the creation of a large amount of training data for better performance. However, it is difficult to collect a massive amount of data on surgical instruments that are used infrequently during surgery. Their recognition accuracy may be reduced by the lack of training data. This paper solves this problem by increasing the training data with an image synthesis technique. Pairs of synthetic laparoscopic videos and their labelled data are automatically generated by superimposing 3D virtual surgical instrument models on real laparoscopic videos. The synthetic laparoscopic images are translated using CycleGAN so that the appearance of the surgical instruments closely resembles those in the real laparoscopic videos. Additionally, we extracted surgical instruments from laparoscopic videos using 2D U-Net based network. This network was trained using both the synthetic laparoscopic images and the manually labelled, real laparoscopic video data. The trained model extracted the surgical instruments from the laparoscopic videos. Our experimental result showed that the recognition accuracy of the surgical instruments, which are used infrequently during surgery, was improved using synthetic laparoscopic images generated by our proposed method.

AB Minutiae used in most fingerprint recognition devices is robust to presentation attack, but generates a high false match rate. Thus, it is applied along with orientation map or skeleton images. There has been plenty of research on security vulnerability of minutiae, whereas few research has been conducted on orientation map or skeleton images. This study analyzes vulnerability of presentation attack for skeleton images. For this purpose, it proposes a new algorithm of recovering fingerprints with the use of machine learning and skeleton image features of fingerprints. In the proposed method, we suggest the new machine learning Pix2Pix model to generate more natural images. The suggested model is developed in the way of adding a latent vector to the conventional image-to-image translation model Pix2Pix. In the experiment, fingerprints were recovered with the use of the proposed Pix2Pix model, and it was found that a fingerprint recognition device which recognized the recovered fingerprints had a high success rate of recognition. Therefore, it was proved that a fingerprint recognition device using skeleton images as well was vulnerable to presentation attack. It is expected that the algorithm proposed in this study will be very useful to many different application areas related to image processing, including biometrics, fingerprint recognition and recovery, and image surveillance.

AB In High Performance Computing (HPC) the performance of applications is paramount, which is has led to a wide body of work on optimizing compilers. However, compilers alone are naturally limited in their potential, as they cannot exploit run-time information to specialize generated code. For this reason, run-time components to perform such specializations are gaining traction. In particular, application or use-case driven specializations have a high potential for optimizations, as they can benefit from explicit guidance from the application or the user, which allows for targeted changes incorporating specific knowledge. Because full compilers and sources are usually unavailable during computation, specializations have to be done at machine code level. However, existing libraries for binary specialization face structural limitations of separating optimization and code generation, in addition to numerous implementation gaps.
   In this paper, we describe BinOpt, a novel and robust library for performing application-driven binary optimization and specialization using LLVM. A machine code function is lifted directly to LLVM-IR, optimized in LLVM while making use of application-specified information, used to generate a new specialization for a function, and integrated back to the original code. We apply this technique to existing optimized code and show that significant performance improvements can be observed with only a small optimization time overhead.

TI Re-envisioning the design of nanomedicines: harnessing automation and
   artificial intelligence
SO EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG DELIVERY
AB IntroductionInterest in nanomedicines has surged in recent years due to the critical role they have played in the COVID-19 pandemic. Nanoformulations can turn promising therapeutic cargo into viable products through improvements in drug safety and efficacy profiles. However, the developmental pathway for such formulations is non-trivial and largely reliant on trial-and-error. Beyond the costly demands on time and resources, this traditional approach may stunt innovation. The emergence of automation, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools, which are currently underutilized in pharmaceutical formulation development, offers a promising direction for an improved path in the design of nanomedicines.Areas coveredthe potential of harnessing experimental automation and AI/ML to drive innovation in nanomedicine development. The discussion centers on the current challenges in drug formulation research and development, and the major advantages afforded through the application of data-driven methods.Expert opinionThe development of integrated workflows based on automated experimentation and AI/ML may accelerate nanomedicine development. A crucial step in achieving this is the generation of high-quality, accessible datasets. Future efforts to make full use of these tools can ultimately contribute to the development of more innovative nanomedicines and improved clinical translation of formulations that rely on advanced drug delivery systems.

TI Deep Learning for Load Forecasting: Sequence to Sequence Recurrent
   Neural Networks With Attention
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The biggest contributor to global warming is energy production and use. Moreover, a push for electrical vehicle and other economic developments are expected to further increase energy use. To combat these challenges, electrical load forecasting is essential as it supports energy production planning and scheduling, assists with budgeting, and helps identify saving opportunities. Machine learning approaches commonly used for energy forecasting such as feedforward neural networks and support vector regression encounter challenges with capturing time dependencies. Consequently, this paper proposes Sequence to Sequence Recurrent Neural Network (S2S RNN) with Attention for electrical load forecasting. The S2S architecture from language translation is adapted for load forecasting and a corresponding sample generation approach is designed. RNN enables capturing time dependencies present in the load data and S2S model further improves time modeling by combining two RNNs: encoder and decoder. The attention mechanism alleviates the burden of connecting encoder and decoder. The experiments evaluated attention mechanisms with different RNN cells (vanilla, LSTM, and GRU) and with varied time horizons. Results show that S2S with Bahdanau attention outperforms other models. Accuracy decreases as forecasting horizon increases; however, longer input sequences do not always increase accuracy.

TI An Effective NAT Traversal Mechanism for SIP/IMS Services in SDN-Enabled
   All-IP Mobile Networks
SO WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB Network Address Translation (NAT) is the major solution to ease the IP address shortage problem and support the upcoming demands of huge IP address from the Machine-to-Machine communications and Internet of Things . However, NAT breaks the peer-to-peer communications and blocks the Internet-oriented requests. In order to resolve the problems, lots of NAT traversal solutions such as Session Traversal Utilities for NAT, Universal Plug-and-Play, Traversal Using Relay NAT, Application-Layer Gateway (ALG) and Interactive Connectivity Establishment have been proposed. Among the NAT traversal solutions, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project adopts the ALG solution for SIP/IMS multimedia services in the mobile networks. The ALG solution does not require modifications to the clients (e.g., User Equipments). However, the ALG solution utilizes the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) proxy to translate the RTP packets, and thus this solution produces extra delay and packet loss possibility to the RTP packets. In this paper, we integrate Software-defined networking (SDN) to the All-IP mobile networks and propose a solution to improve the ALG solution in the SDN-enabled All-IP mobile networks. We derive the analytic models for analyzing the ALG solution and the proposed solution, and compare these two solutions in terms of the throughput, loss rate and delay.

   Videos
SO ROBOTICS: SCIENCE AND SYSTEMS XVI
CT 16th Conference on Robotics - Science and Systems
CY JUL 12-16, 2020
CL ELECTR NETWORK
AB Robotic reinforcement learning (RL) holds the promise of enabling robots to learn complex behaviors through experience. However, realizing this promise for long-horizon tasks in the real world requires mechanisms to reduce human burden in terms of defining the task and scaffolding the learning process. In this paper, we study how these challenges can be alleviated with an automated robotic learning framework, in which multi-stage tasks are defined simply by providing videos of a human demonstrator and then learned autonomously by the robot from raw image observations. A central challenge in imitating human videos is the difference in appearance between the human and robot, which typically requires manual correspondence. We instead take an automated approach and perform pixel-level image translation via CycleGAN to convert the human demonstration into a video of a robot, which can then be used to construct a reward function for a model-based RL algorithm. The robot then learns the task one stage at a time, automatically learning how to reset each stage to retry it multiple times without human-provided resets. This makes the learning process largely automatic, from intuitive task specification via a video to automated training with minimal human intervention. We demonstrate that our approach is capable of learning complex tasks, such as operating a coffee machine, directly from raw image observations, requiring only 20 minutes to provide human demonstrations and about 180 minutes of robot interaction.

TI Sign Language Generation System Based on Indian Sign Language Grammar
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB Sign Language (SL), also known as gesture-based language, is used by people with hearing loss to convey their messages. SL interpreters are required for people who do not have the knowledge of SL, but interpreters are not readily available. Thus, a machine-based translation system is required to translate the text into SL. In this article, a system is implemented for translating English text into Indian Sign Language (ISL). It acts as a tool for human-computer interaction and eliminates the need for an ISL human interpreter for communicating with people who have hearing loss. The system features a rich corpus of English words and commonly used sentences. It consists of components such as an ISL parser, the Hamburg Notation System, the Signing Gesture Mark-up Language, and 3D avatar animation for generating SL according to ISL grammar. The proposed system has been tested rigorously by SL users. The results proved that the proposed system is highly efficient and achieves an average score of accuracy (i.e., 4.2 for English words and 3.8 for sentences on a scale from 1 to 5). The performance of proposed system has also been evaluated using the BiLingual Evaluation Understudy score, which results in 0.95 accuracy. The proposed system and mobile application together has the potential to bring individuals with hearing loss and their entourage together.

TI Transformational invariance in compact process modeling
SO JOURNAL OF MICRO-NANOLITHOGRAPHY MEMS AND MOEMS
AB Background: Modern one-digit technological nodes demand strict reproduction of the optical proximity corrections for repeatable congruent patterns. To ensure this property, the optical and process simulations must be invariant to the geometrical transformations of the translation, rotation, and reflection. Simulators must support invariance both in theory, mathematically, and in practice, numerically. The invariance of compact modeling operators has never been scrutinized before.
   Aim: We aim to examine manner and conditions under which optical simulations preserve or violate intrinsic invariances of exact imaging. We analyze invariances of Volterra operators, which are widely used in compact process modeling. Our goal is to determine necessary and sufficient conditions under which such operators become fully invariant
   Approach: We use theoretical analysis to deduce full invariance conditions and numerical simulations to illustrate the results.
   Results: The linear fully invariant operators are convolutions with rotationally symmetrical kernels. The fully invariant quadratic operators have special functional form with two radial and one polar argument and are not necessarily rotationally symmetrical. We deduced invariance conditions for the kernels of high-order Volterra operators.
   Conclusions: We suggest to use fully invariant nonlinear Volterra operators as atomic construction blocks in machine learning and neural networks for compact process modeling. (C) 2020 Society of Photo Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI A syntactic approach to foundational proof-carrying code
SO JOURNAL OF AUTOMATED REASONING
AB Proof-carrying code (PCC) is a general framework for verifying the safety properties of machine-language programs. PCC proofs are usually written in a logic extended with language-specific typing rules; they certify safety but only if there is no bug in the typing rules. In foundational proof-carrying code (FPCC), on the other hand, proofs are constructed and verified by using strictly the foundations of mathematical logic, with no type-specific axioms. FPCC is more flexible and secure because it is not tied to any particular type system and it has a smaller trusted base. Foundational proofs, however, are much harder to construct. Previous efforts on FPCC all required building sophisticated semantic models for types. Furthermore, none of them can be easily extended to support mutable fields and recursive types. In this article, we present a syntactic approach to FPCC that avoids all of these difficulties. Under our new scheme, the foundational proof for a typed machine program simply consists of the typing derivation plus the formalized syntactic soundness proof for the underlying type system. The former can be readily obtained from a type-checker, while the latter is known to be much easier to construct than the semantic soundness proofs. We give a translation from a typed assembly language into FPCC and demonstrate the advantages of our new system through an implementation in the Coq proof assistant.

AB In this paper, we address the problem of modeling a printing-imaging channel built on a machine learning approach a.k.a. digital twin for anti-counterfeiting applications based on copy detection patterns (CDP). The digital twin is formulated on an information-theoretic framework called Turbo that uses variational approximations of mutual information developed for both encoder and decoder in two-directional information passage. The proposed model generalizes several state-of-the-art architectures such as adversarial autoencoder (AAE) [1], CycleGAN [2] and adversarial latent space auto-encoder (ALAE) [3]. This model can be applied to any type of printing and imaging and it only requires training data consisting of digital templates or artworks that are sent to a printing device and data acquired by an imaging device. Moreover, these data can be paired, unpaired or hybrid paired-unpaired which makes the proposed architecture very flexible and scalable to many practical setups. We demonstrate the impact of various architectural factors, metrics and discriminators on the overall system performance in the task of generation/prediction of printed CDP from their digital counterparts and vice versa. We also compare the proposed system with several state-of-the-art methods used for image-to-image translation applications. The code and extended results of the simulation are publicly available(1).

We will review the current state of the art for three existing resources and then propose a method to link them in addition to augment them in a manner that would render them even more useful for natural language processing whether targeting enabling technologies such as part of speech tagging or parsing, or applications such as Machine Translation, or Information Extraction. The unified lexical resource, Tharawat, meaning treasures, is an extension of our core unique resource Tharwa, which is a three way computational lexicon for Dialectal Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic, and English lemma correspondents. Tharawat will incorporate two other current resources namely SANA, our Arabic Sentiment Lexicon, and MuSTalAHAt, our Multiword Expression (MWE) version of Tharwa but instead of listing lemmas and their correspondents, it lists MWE and their correspondents. Moreover, we present a roadmap for incorporating links for Tharawat to existing English resources and corpora leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and crowd sourcing methods. Such resources are at the core of NLP technologies. Specifically, we believe that such a resource could lead to significant leaps and strides for Arabic NLP. Possessing them for a language such as Arabic could be quite impactful for the development of advanced scientific material and hence lead to an Arabic scientific and economic revolution.

TI Damped Least-Square Method Based on Chaos Anti-Control for Solving
   Forward Displacement of General 6-6-Type Parallel Mechanism
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED ROBOTIC SYSTEMS
AB Machine tools based on a Stewart platform are considered the machine tools of the 21st century. Difficult problems exist in the design philosophy, of which forward displacement analysis is the most fundamental. Its mathematical model is a kind of strongly nonlinear multivariable equation set with unique characteristics and a high level of difficulty. Different variable numbers and different solving speeds can be obtained through using different methods to establish the model of forward displacement analysis. The damped least-square method based on chaos anti-control for solving displacement analysis of the general 6-6-type parallel mechanism was built up through the rotation transformation matrixR, translation vector P and the constraint conditions of the rod length. The Euler equations describing the rotational dynamics of a rigid body with principle axes at the centre of mass were converted to a chaotic system by using chaos anti-control, and chaotic sequences were produced using the chaos system. Combining the characteristics of the chaotic sequence with the damped least-square method, all real solutions of forward displacement in nonlinear equations were found. A numerical example shows that the new method has some interesting features, such as fast convergence and the capability of acquiring all real solutions, and comparisons with other methods prove its effectiveness and validity.

TI Development of Robust Calibration Models Using Support Vector Machines

AB Sample-to-sample variability has proven to be a major challenge in achieving calibration transfer in quantitative biological Raman spectroscopy Multiple morphological and optical parameters, such as tissue absorption and scattering, physiological glucose dynamics and skin het erogeneity, vary significantly in a human population introducing nonanalyte specific features Into the calibration model In this paper, we show that fluctuations of such parameters in human subjects introduce curved (nonlinear) effects in the relationship between the concentrations of the analyte of interest and the mixture Raman spectra To account for these curved effects, we propose the use of support vector machines (SVM) as a nonlinear regression method over conventional linear regression techniques such as partial least-squares (PLS) Using transcutaneous blood glucose detection as an example, we demonstrate that application of SVM enables a significant improvement (at least 30%) in cross-validation accuracy over PLS when measurements from multiple human volunteers are employed in the calibration set Furthermore, using physical tissue models with randomized analyte concentrations and varying turbidities, we show that the fluctuations in turbidity alone causes curved effects which can only be adequately modeled using nonlinear regression techniques The enhanced levels of accuracy obtained with the SVM based calibration models opens up avenues for prospective prediction in humans and thus for clinical translation of the technology

   Recognition
SO IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS
AB With the advancement of machine learning techniques and the increased accessibility to computing power, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in image classification and, most recently, in video classification. The possibility of gesture recognition from a video source enables a more natural non-contact human-machine interaction, immersion when interacting in virtual reality environments and can even lead to sign language translation in the near future. However, the techniques utilized in video classification are usually computationally expensive, being prohibitive to conventional hardware. This work aims to study and analyze the applicability of continuous online gesture recognition techniques for embedded systems. This goal is achieved by proposing a new model based on 2D and 3D CNNs able to perform online gesture recognition, i.e. yielding a label while the video frames are still being processed, in a predictive manner, before having access to future frames of the video. This technique is of paramount interest to applications in which the video is being acquired concomitantly to the classification process and the issuing of the labels has a strict deadline. The proposed model was tested against three representative gesture datasets found in the literature. The obtained results suggest the proposed technique improves the state-of-the-art by yielding a quick gesture recognition process while presenting a high accuracy, which is fundamental for the applicability of embedded systems.

TI Investigation of Austenitic Stainless Steel Coatings on Mild Steel
   Produced by Friction Surfacing Using a Conventional CNC Machining Center
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH-IBERO-AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MATERIALS
AB The friction surfacing process allows deposition of similar and dissimilar coatings in the solid state, avoiding some of the problems associated with conventional coating methods in which fusion is involved. In the present work, a viability assessment of producing AISI 304 austenitic stainless steel coatings on AISI 1020 low-carbon steel substrates using a machining center with Computerized Numerical Control (CNC) instead of dedicated friction surfacing equipment was pursued. The influence of consumable rod rotation and translation speed, as well as substrate surface roughness on the geometry and adhesion of the coatings was evaluated. The microstructure of the stainless steel coatings was investigated by optical and scanning electron microscopy, while microhardness analysis was performed in order to evaluate properties near the coating-substrate interface. Finally, the electrochemical corrosion behavior of the coatings and the as-received AISI 304 steel consumables in 0.5M H2SO4 solution containing naturally dissolved O-2 was compared. The results revealed that the friction surfacing process can be applied in non-specialized machinery, since the manufactured coatings exhibited good adhesion and corrosion resistance. The formation of hard bands in the coatings was identified near the interface region and the adhesion of the coatings was found to be influenced by initial substrate roughness.

TI Human reliability analysis (HRA) techniques and observational clinical
   HRA
SO MINIMALLY INVASIVE THERAPY & ALLIED TECHNOLOGIES
AB This review explains the nature of human reliability analysis (HRA) methods developed and used for predicting safety in high-risk human activities. HRA techniques have evolved over the years and have become less subjective as a result of inclusion of (i) cognitive factors in the man-machine interface and (ii) high and low dependency levels between human failure events (HFEs). All however remain probabilistic in the assessment of safety. In the translation of these techniques, developed for assessment of safety of high-risk industries (nuclear, aerospace etc.) where catastrophic failures from the man-machine complex interface are fortunately rare, to the clinical operative surgery (with its high incidence of human errors), the system loses subjectivity since the documentation of HFEs can be assessed and studied prospectively on the basis of an objective data capture of errors enacted during a defined clinical activity. The observational clinical-HRA (OC-HRA) was developed specifically for this purpose, initially for laparoscopic general surgery. It has however been used by other surgical specialties. OC-HRA has the additional merit of objective determination of the proficiency of a surgeon in executing specific interventions and is adaptable to the evaluation of safety and proficiency in clinical activities within the preoperative and postoperative periods.

As a follow-up to our previous work (Aldana et al., 1998, Martinez-Mekler et al., 1999a,b), we approach this problem by considering the translocation properties of primitive molecular machines, which capture basic features of ribosomal/messenger RNA interactions, while operating under prebiotic conditions. Our model consists of a short one-dimensional chain of charged particles (rRNA antecedent) interacting with a polymer (mRNA antecedent) via electrostatic forces. The chain is subject to external forcing that causes it to move along the polymer which is fixed in a quasi-one-dimensional geometry. Our numerical and analytic studies of statistical properties of random chain/polymer potentials suggest that, under very general conditions, a dynamics is attained in which the chain moves along the polymer in steps of three monomers. By adjusting the model in order to consider present-day genetic sequences, we show that the above property is enhanced for coding regions. Intergenic sequences display a behavior closer to the random situation. We argue that this s dynamical property could be one of the underlying causes for the three-base codon structure of the genetic code (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB RNA-seq and Ribo-seq are popular techniques for quantifying cellular transcription and translation. These experiments use next-generation sequencing to produce genome-wide high-resolution snapshots of the total populations of mRNAs and translating ribosomes within the investigated samples. When performed in concert, these experiments yield valuable information about protein synthesis rates and translational efficiency. Due to their intricate experimental protocols and demanding data processing requirements, quality control and analysis of such experiments are often challenging. Therefore, methods for accurately assessing data quality, and for identifying contaminated samples, are greatly needed. In the following we use a novel negative selection inspired algorithm called Boundary Detection Using Nearest Neighbors (BDUNN), for the identification of corrupted samples. Our algorithm constructs a detector set and reduced training set that defines the boundaries between normal data points and potential anomalies. Subsequently, a nearest neighbor algorithm is used to classify unseen observations. We compare the performance of BDUNN with other popular negative selection and one-class classification algorithms, and show that BDUNN is capable of accurately and efficiently detecting anomalies in standard anomaly detection datasets and simulated RNA-seq and Ribo-seq data sets. Furthermore, we have implemented our method within an existing R Shiny platform for analyzing RNA-seq an Ribo-seq datasets, which permits downstream analysis of anomalous samples.

TI Riboproteomics of the hepatitis C virus internal ribosomal entry site
SO JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH
AB Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protein translation is mediated by a cis-acting RNA, an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES), located in the 5' nontranslated region of the viral RNA. To examine proteins bound to the IRES, which could include proteins important for its function as well as potential drug targets, we used shotgun peptide sequencing to identify proteins in quadruplicate protein affinity extracts of lysed Huh7 cells, obtained using a biotinylated IRES. Twenty-six proteins bound the HCV IRES but not a reversed complementary sequence RNA or vector RNA controls. These included five ribosomal subunits, nine eukaryotic initiation factor 3 subunits, and novel interacting proteins such as the cytoskeletal-related proteins actin, FHOS (formin homologue overexpressed in spleen) and MIP-T3 (microtubule interacting protein that associates with TRAF3). Other novel HCV IRES-binding proteins included UNR (upstream of N-ras), UNR-interacting protein, and the RNA-binding proteins PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor1) mRNA binding protein and Ewing sarcoma breakpoint 1 region protein EWS. A large set of additional proteins bound both the HCV IRES and a reversed complementary IRES sequence control, including the known HCV interactors PTB (polypyrimidine tract binding protein), the La autoantigen, and nucleolin. The discovery of these novel HCV IRES-binding proteins suggests links between IRES biology and the cytoskeleton, signal transduction, and other cellular functions.

AB In this paper, we compare AR glasses and head pose estimation performance. We train different pose estimation approaches for head pose estimation with the generated head pose labels to compare them to their AR glasses estimation accuracy. These include the state-of-art GlassPoseRN and P2P networks, as well as our novel CapsPose algorithm. We show that estimating the AR glasses pose is more accurate than the head pose in general. In a first analysis, we show the general regression performance of the models when the AR glasses and faces are both known to the network during training. We then analyze the driver generalization performance, where all glasses are known, but part of the drivers are unknown to the Neural Networks. There, the estimation of AR glasses pose again exceeds the head pose. Only in our third analysis, head pose estimation performs better than AR glasses pose estimation. In this case, a new glasses model is added, which was unknown to the Neural Network yet. In addition, we introduce a novel pose estimation network called CapsPose, which is the first network deploying Capsule Networks for 6-DoF pose estimation. We outperform the current state-of-the-art method GlassPoseRN on the HMDPose dataset by reducing the error by 46% for orientation and 51% for translation.

TI Combustion State Recognition of Flame Images Using Radial Chebyshev
   Moment Invariants Coupled with an IFA-WSVM Model
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Accurate combustion state recognition of flame images not only plays an important role in social security, but also contributes to increasing thermal efficiency and product quality. To improve the accuracy of feature extraction and achieve the combustion state recognition, a novel method based on radial Chebyshev moment invariants (RCMIs) and an improved firefly algorithm-wavelet support vector machine (IFA-WSVM) model is proposed. Firstly, the potential flame pixels and the potential flame contour are obtained in the pre-processing phase. Then, the rotation, translation and scaling (RTS) invariants of radial Chebyshev moments are derived. Combing the region and contour moments, the RCMIs of pre-processed and edge images are calculated to construct multi-feature vectors. To enhance the recognition performance, an IFA-WSVM model is built, where the IFA is applied to search the best parameters of WSVM. Then, the IFA-WSVM model is used to recognize the combustion state. Finally, the result for case studies show that the proposed method is superior to methods based on HMIs and ZMIs, achieving the highest rate of 99.07% in real time. The IFA algorithm also outperforms other benchmark algorithms. Even for the images transformed by RTS and small size of training sets, the proposed method continues to exhibit the best performance.

AB The aim of this paper is to develop a system that involves character recognition of Brahmi, Grantha and Vattezuthu characters from palm manuscripts of historical Tamil ancient documents, analyzed the text and machine translated the present Tamil digital text format. Though many researchers have implemented various algorithms and techniques for character recognition in different languages, ancient characters conversion still poses a big challenge. Because image recognition technology has reached near-perfection when it comes to scanning English and other language text. But optical character recognition (OCR) software capable of digitizing printed Tamil text with high levels of accuracy is still elusive. Only a few people are familiar with the ancient characters and make attempts to convert them into written documents manually. The proposed system overcomes such a situation by converting all the ancient historical documents from inscriptions and palm manuscripts into Tamil digital text format. It converts the digital text format using Tamil unicode. Our algorithm comprises different stages: i) image preprocessing, ii) feature extraction, iii) character recognition and iv) digital text conversion. The first phase conversion accuracy of the Brahmi script rate of our algorithm is 91.57% using the neural network and image zoning method. The second phase of the Vattezhuthu character set is to be implemented. Conversion accuracy of Vattezhuthu is 89.75%.

AB Femtosecond laser machining is a versatile materials processing technology suitable for fabricating a wide range micro- and nanostructures. Nondiffracting zero-order Bessel beams enable to answer two problems of ultrafast laser micromachining. First, in the case of surface laser nanostructuring, threshold effect allows for creating craters below the spot size but at cost of critical sample positioning. The long focal zone of Bessel beams render sample positioning non-critical. Ultrafast laser micromachining holds particular promise for microfluidics applications where high quality sub-10 pm channels are essential structures in the development of system-scale lab-on-chip and DNA analysis. Femtosecond microchannel machining in various glasses has been the subject of many previous studies and, whilst debris redeposition and tapering effects precludes high aspect ratio microchannel fabrication using simple front-surface illumination in air, several more sophisticated approaches have been developed. These include micromachining in vacuum, micromachining with filamentary propagation, micromachining combined with selective etching, and micromachining the reverse side of the sample using water immersion for debris removal. These previous studies, however, have all used femtosecond lasers with transverse Gaussian beam intensity profiles. In this paper, an alternative and original approach is described using high-aspect ratio Bessel beams to overcome many of the difficulties associated with femtosecond micromachining with Gaussian beams. Microchannels with aspect ratio 40 and diameter 2 pm can be drilled in glass without sample translation.

TI Computational methodologies for studying non-coding RNAs relevant to
   central nervous system function and dysfunction
SO BRAIN RESEARCH
AB Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a large and diverse group of transcripts that span the eukaryotic genome, of which less than 2% encodes proteins. Several distinct families of ncRNAs have been described and implicated in many aspects of central nervous system (CNS) function including translation, RNA metabolism, gene regulation, and development. The need to distinguish ncRNAs from sequence data, as well as potentially uncovering novel ncRNA families, has ignited the development of customized computational approaches and bioinformatic resources to handle these tasks. In this review, we provide an overview of the numerous procedures developed to predict ncRNAs based on their primary sequence and predicted secondary structure. These methodologies are broadly grouped into genome scanning algorithms, mixed approaches, and machine learning algorithms. Regulatory ncRNAs, particularly microRNAs (miRNAs), are a major focus of current research efforts and this review will therefore center on the prediction of miRNAs and the putative gene targets they act upon. With the advent of ultra high-throughput sequencing technologies 'deep sequencing' has emerged as the cutting-edge method for ncRNA identification and we will also touch on some computational resources that play a key role in analysis of this type of data.

TI Transformer-based Cross-Lingual Summarization using Multilingual Word
   Embeddings for English - Bahasa Indonesia
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB Cross-lingual summarization (CLS) is a process of generating a summary in the target language from a source document in another language. CLS is a challenging task because it involves two different languages. Traditionally, CLS is carried out in a pipeline scheme that involves two steps: summarization and translation. This approach has a problem, it introduces error propagation. To address this problem, we present a novel end-toend abstractive CLS without the explicit use of machine translation. The CLS architecture is based on Transformer which is proven to be able to perform text generation well. The CLS model is a jointly trained CLS task and monolingual summarization (MS) task. This is accomplished by adding a second decoder to handle the MS task, while the first decoder handles the CLS task. We also incorporated multilingual word embeddings (MWE) components into the architecture to further improve the performance of the CLS models. Both English and Bahasa Indonesia are represented by MWE whose embeddings have already been mapped into the same vector space. MWE helps to better map the relation between input and output that use different languages. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves improvement up to +0.2981 ROUGE-1, +0.2084 ROUGE-2, and +0.2771 ROUGE-L when compared to the pipeline baselines and up to +0.1288 ROUGE-1, +0.1185 ROUGE-2, and +0.1413 ROUGE-L when compared to the endto-end baselines.

AB Many advancements in computer vision and machine learning have shown potential for significantly improving the lives of people with disabilities. In particular, recent research has demonstrated that deep neural network models could be used to bridge the gap between the deaf who use sign language and hearing people. The major impediment to advancing such models is the lack of high-quality and large-scale training data. Moreover, previously released sign language datasets include few or no interrogative sentences compared to declarative sentences. In this paper, we introduce a new publicly available large-scale Korean Sign Language (KSL) dataset-KSL-Guide-that includes both declarative sentences and comparable interrogative sentences, which are required for a model to achieve high performance in real-world interactive tasks deployed on service applications. Our dataset contains a total of 121K sign language video samples featuring sentences and words spoken by native KSL speakers with extensive annotations (e.g., gloss, translation, keypoints, and timestamps). We exploit a multi-camera system to produce 3D human pose keypoints as well as 2D keypoints from multi-view RGB. Our experiments quantitatively demonstrate that the inclusion of interrogative sentences in training for sign language recognition and translation tasks greatly improves their performance. Furthermore, we empirically show the qualitative results by developing a prototype application using our dataset, providing an interactive guide service that helps to lower the communication barrier between sign language speakers and hearing people.

TI Peptide bond formation destabilizes Shine-Dalgarno interaction on the
   ribosome
SO NATURE
AB The ribosome is a molecular machine that translates the genetic code contained in the messenger RNA into an amino acid sequence through repetitive cycles of transfer RNA selection, peptide bond formation and translocation(1-3). Here we demonstrate an optical tweezer assay to measure the rupture force between a single ribosome complex and mRNA. The rupture force was compared between ribosome complexes assembled on an mRNA with and without a strong Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence - a sequence found just upstream of the coding region of bacterial mRNAs, involved in translation initiation(4,5). The removal of the SD sequence significantly reduced the rupture force in complexes carrying an aminoacyl tRNA, Phe-tRNA(Phe), in the A site, indicating that the SD interactions contribute significantly to the stability of the ribosomal complex on the mRNA before peptide bond formation. In contrast, the presence of a peptidyl tRNA analogue, N-acetyl-Phe-tRNA(Phe), in the A site, which mimicked the post-peptidyl transfer state, weakened the rupture force as compared to the complex with Phe-tRNA(Phe), and the resultant force was the same for both the SD-containing and SD-deficient mRNAs. These results suggest that formation of the first peptide bond destabilizes the SD interaction, resulting in the weakening of the force with which the ribosome grips an mRNA. This might be an important requirement to facilitate movement of the ribosome along mRNA during the first translocation step.

TI The DARC site: a database of aligned ribosomal complexes
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB The ribosome is a highly dynamic machine responsible for protein synthesis within the cell. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography structures of ribosomal particles, alone and in complex with diverse ligands (protein factors, RNAs and small molecules), have revealed the dynamic nature of the ribosome and provided much needed insight into translation and its regulation. In the past years, there has been exponential growth in the deposition of cryo-EM maps into the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) as well as atomic structures into the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Unfortunately, the deposited ribosomal particles usually have distinct orientations with respect to one another, which complicate the comparison of the available structures. To simplify this, we have developed a Database of Aligned Ribosomal Complexes, the DARC site (http://darcsite.genzentrum.lmu.de/darc/), which houses the available cryo-EM maps and atomic coordinates of ribosomal particles from the EMDB and PDB aligned within a common coordinate system. An easy-to-use, searchable interface allows users to access and download > 130 cryo-EM maps and > 300 atomic models in the format of brix and pdb files, respectively. The aligned coordinate system substantially simplifies direct visualization of conformational changes in the ribosome, such as subunit rotation and head-swiveling, as well as direct comparison of bound ligands, such as antibiotics or translation factors.

TI The Bacterial ClpXP-ClpB Family Is Enriched with RNA-Binding Protein
   Complexes
SO CELLS
AB In the matrix of bacteria/mitochondria/chloroplasts, Lon acts as the degradation machine for soluble proteins. In stress periods, however, proteostasis and survival depend on the strongly conserved Clp/Hsp100 family. Currently, the targets of ATP-powered unfoldases/disaggregases ClpB and ClpX and of peptidase ClpP heptameric rings are still unclear. Trapping experiments and proteome profiling in multiple organisms triggered confusion, so we analyzed the consistency of ClpP-trap targets in bacteria. We also provide meta-analyses of protein interactions in humans, to elucidate where Clp family members are enriched. Furthermore, meta-analyses of mouse complexomics are provided. Genotype-phenotype correlations confirmed our concept. Trapping, proteome, and complexome data retrieved consistent coaccumulation of CLPXP with GFM1 and TUFM orthologs. CLPX shows broad interaction selectivity encompassing mitochondrial translation elongation, RNA granules, and nucleoids. CLPB preferentially attaches to mitochondrial RNA granules and translation initiation components; CLPP is enriched with them all and associates with release/recycling factors. Mutations in CLPP cause Perrault syndrome, with phenotypes similar to defects in mtDNA/mtRNA. Thus, we propose that CLPB and CLPXP are crucial to counteract misfolded insoluble protein assemblies that contain nucleotides. This insight is relevant to improve ClpP-modulating drugs that block bacterial growth and for the treatment of human infertility, deafness, and neurodegeneration.

TI Translational medical research and liver transplantation: systematic

SO TRANSLATIONAL GASTROENTEROLOGY AND HEPATOLOGY
AB Translational medicine has become a priority, but there is still a big difference between the arrival of new treatments and investment. Basic science should not be neglected because the translation from basic research is not sustained in the absence of basic research. The purpose of this literature review was to analyze the translational medicine in the liver transplant field: liver ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), immunosuppression, clinical and surgical complications, small-for-size syndrome (SFSS), rejection, and ongoing innovations (liver machine, liver preservation, artificial livers, and regenerative medicine). We performed a systematic literature review that were updated in October 2016. The searches were performed in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Review, PubMed/Medline, Embase, and LILACS databases. All the selected studies on the management of translational medical research in liver transplantation (LT) were analyzed. Initially the search found 773 articles. Methodological viewing and analysis of the articles, followed by the application of scientific models, including translational medicine in the liver transplant field.

TI Review of failure risk and outage prediction in power system under wind
   hazards
SO ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH
AB Given that wind hazards pose a considerable damage to power system in various countries, researchers have developed methods for disaster prevention to diminish the vulnerabilities. This paper attempts to review the failure analysis procedure under the impact of wind hazards, considering the following attributes: wind field generation method, wind-induced electrical component failure model in transmission system, and building outage prediction model from data-driven view in distribution system. First, we compare the calculation of circulation and translation wind speed, with geographical, temporal and uncertainty factors of wind speed considered. Then, we introduce the wind-induced component failure models derived by wind load calculation and fragility curves. The application of the series reliability model in multiple cluster failures is briefly described. Finally, we summarize the applications of data analysis in building outage prediction models. The reviewed literature contains the statistical learning methods and machine learning methods. It is concluded that the frameworks for component-level failure model and user-level outage prediction model are well established. However, most of the studies still develop two models, separately. Future researchers may target at the hybrid application of both models to better provide fault analysis, prediction and emergency in power system under wind hazards.

TI A low-power band of neuronal spiking activity dominated by local single
   units improves the performance of brain-machine interfaces
SO NATURE BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB The large power requirement of current brain-machine interfaces is a major hindrance to their clinical translation. In basic behavioural tasks, the downsampled magnitude of the 300-1,000 Hz band of spiking activity can predict movement similarly to the threshold crossing rate (TCR) at 30 kilo-samples per second. However, the relationship between such a spiking-band power (SBP) and neural activity remains unclear, as does the capability of using the SBP to decode complicated behaviour. By using simulations of recordings of neural activity, here we show that the SBP is dominated by local single-unit spikes with spatial specificity comparable to or better than that of the TCR, and that the SBP correlates better with the firing rates of lower signal-to-noise-ratio units than the TCR. With non-human primates, in an online task involving the one-dimensional decoding of the movement of finger groups and in an offline two-dimensional cursor-control task, the SBP performed equally well or better than the TCR. The SBP may enhance the decoding performance of neural interfaces while enabling substantial cuts in power consumption.
   The 300-1,000 Hz band of spiking activity, dominated by local single-unit spikes, can enhance the decoding performance of neural interfaces.

AB Gears are machine elements that transmit rotary motion and power by the successive engagements of teeth on their periphery'. Gears commonly in use include: spur gears; bevel gears; helical gears; internal gears and worm gears. They are widely used in automotive, aerospace, power generation and even medical applications. The manufacturing process of metal gears usually involves cutting, hobbing, shaving, milling, grinding and honing(2). Although gears have been used for many years in industry, the evaluation of their surface texture and the relationship between surface parameters and surface functionality are not well understood. Conventional profile measurements and surface roughness parameters, such as Ra and Rq, are still predominantly used in the industry. However, increasing investigations show that 2D profile measurements and data analyses cannot represent the surface condition due to non-uniformity of measured surfaces. In this study, we use a new mathematical tool for the characterisation of the surface irregularities, namely the scattering transform, recently introduced by S. Mallat(3). This new transform is almost invariant to group actions such as rotation and translation of the image and has been successfully applied to machine learning problems such as classification. This approach is applied to the characterisation of gear surfaces. Results obtained on areal surface data based measurements from focus variation instruments and conventional tactile CMM are presented and discussed.

TI Decision support system for bioleaching processes
SO HYDROMETALLURGY
AB The use of information available in the organizations to understand what good performance looks like has been proposed for improving the decreased productivity in mine sector. Detailed monitoring has been performed at the heap bioleaching process in Minera Escondida since the start of the industrial operation in 2006. The huge industrial data recorded represents an opportunity to raise knowledge about complex bioleaching processes for improving the technology. A systematic approach using machine learning tools for the analysis of High Dimensional Feature Space is now being developed to deliver experience-based learning with the aim to serve as the foundation for optimal production planning and operational decision making, in the presence of inherent process variations. The construction of a Decision Support System (DSS) is reported, which considers a Real Time PCR array, a database for data logging and storage, the application of suitable statistical and computational tools for knowledge acquiring and finally the creation of a system of knowledge translation to transform it into action by applying recommendations that come to terms with operational limitations. The user can accurately retrieve data and design similar matches to the historic operation to get, for instance the expected metallurgical performance (such as copper recovery, acid consumption and bacterial activity) and recommendations. The process followed to construct the base of knowledge of the DSS is discussed.

AB Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is considered one of the most important problems in Natural Language Processing [1]. Et is claimed that WSD is essential for those applications that require of language comprehension modules such as search engines, machine translation systems, automatic answer machines, second life agents, etc. Moreover, with the huge amounts of information in Internet and the fact that this information is continuosly growing in different languages, we are encourage to deal with cross-lingual scenarios where WSD systems are also needed. On the other hand, Lexical Substitution (LS) refers to the process of finding a substitute word for a source word in a given sentence. The LS task needs to be approached by firstly disambiguating the source word, therefore, these two tasks (WSD and LS) are somehow related. In this paper, we present a naive approach to tackle the problem of cross-lingual WSD and cross-lingual lexical substitution. We use a bilingual statistical dictionary, which is calculated with Giza++ by using the EUROPARL parallel corpus, in order to calculate the probability of a source word to be translated to a target word (which is assumed to be the correct sense of the source word but in a different language). Two versions of the probabilistic model are tested: unweighted and weighted. The results were compared with those of an international competition, obtaining a good performance.

TI UCat: heterogeneous memory management for unikernels
SO FRONTIERS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Unikernels provide an efficient and lightweight way to deploy cloud computing services in application-specialized and single-address-space virtual machines (VMs). They can efficiently deploy hundreds of unikernel-based VMs in a single physical server. In such a cloud computing platform, main memory is the primary bottleneck resource for high-density application deployment. Recently, non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies has become increasingly popular in cloud data centers because they can offer extremely large memory capacity at a low expense. However, there still remain many challenges to utilize NVMs for unikernel-based VMs, such as the difficulty of heterogeneous memory allocation and high performance overhead of address translations. In this paper, we present UCat, a heterogeneous memory management mechanism that support multi-grained memory allocation for unikernels. We propose front-end/back-end cooperative address space mapping to expose the host memory heterogeneity to unikernels. UCat exploits large pages to reduce the cost of two-layer address translation in virtualization environments, and leverages slab allocation to reduce memory waste due to internal memory fragmentation. We implement UCat based on a popular unikernel-OSv and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate its efficiency. Experimental results show that UCat can reduce the memory consumption of unikernels by 50% and TLB miss rate by 41%, and improve the throughput of real-world benchmarks such as memslap and YCSB by up to 18.5% and 14.8%, respectively.

TI Massive Exploration of Pseudo Data for Grammatical Error Correction
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Collecting a large amount of training data for grammatical error correction (GEC) models has been an ongoing challenge in the field of GEC. Recently, it has become common to use data demanding deep neural models such as an encoder-decoder for GEC; thus, tackling the problem of data collection has become increasingly important. The incorporation of pseudo data in the training of GEC models is one of the main approaches for mitigating the problem of data scarcity. However, a consensus is lacking on experimental configurations, namely, (i) the methods for generating pseudo data, (ii) the seed corpora used as the source of the pseudo data, and (iii) the means of optimizing the model. In this study, these configurations are thoroughly explored through massive amount of experiments, with the aim of providing an improved understanding of pseudo data. Our main experimental finding is that pretraining a model with pseudo data generated by back-translation-based method is the most effective approach. Our findings are supported by the achievement of state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark test sets (the CoNLL-2014 test set and the official test set of the BEA-2019 shared task) without requiring any modifications to the model architecture. We also perform an in-depth analysis of our model with respect to the grammatical error type and proficiency level of the text. Finally, we suggest future directions for further improving model performance.

TI Analysis of Worldwide Research Trends on the Impact of Artificial
   Intelligence in Education
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In today's world, artificial intelligence (AI) and human intelligence coexist, and no field is free from the impact of AI. At present, education cannot be discussed without mentioning AI, which has an omnidirectional impact on all its areas, including the purpose, content, method, and evaluation system. This study aimed to explore the future direction of education by examining the current impact and predicting future impacts of AI. It also examined research trends and collaboration status by country through network analysis, topic modeling and global research trends in AI in education (AIED), by applying the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm. Over the past 20 years, the number of papers on AIED has steadily increased, with a dramatic rise since 2015. The research can be broadly classified into eight topics, including "changes in the content of teaching and learning." Using a linear regression model, three hot topics, two cold topics and trend changes for each research topic were identified. The study found that AIED research should be more thematically diversified and in-depth; this directly applies AI algorithms and technologies to education, which should be further promoted. This study provides a reference for exploring the direction of future AIED research.

TI Advancing Drug Discovery for Neurological Disorders Using iPSC-Derived
   Neural Organoids
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB In the last decade, different research groups in the academic setting have developed induced pluripotent stem cell-based protocols to generate three-dimensional, multicellular, neural organoids. Their use to model brain biology, early neural development, and human diseases has provided new insights into the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders, including microcephaly, autism, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. However, the adoption of organoid technology for large-scale drug screening in the industry has been hampered by challenges with reproducibility, scalability, and translatability to human disease. Potential technical solutions to expand their use in drug discovery pipelines include Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) to create isogenic models, single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize the model at a cellular level, and machine learning to analyze complex data sets. In addition, high-content imaging, automated liquid handling, and standardized assays represent other valuable tools toward this goal. Though several open issues still hamper the full implementation of the organoid technology outside academia, rapid progress in this field will help to prompt its translation toward large-scale drug screening for neurological disorders.

AB One of the first steps in the utterance interpretation pipeline of many task-oriented conversational AI systems is to identify user intents and the corresponding slots. Since data collection for machine learning models for this task is time-consuming, it is desirable to make use of existing data in a high-resource language to train models in low-resource languages. However, development of such models has largely been hindered by the lack of multilingual training data. In this paper, we present a new data set of 57k annotated utterances in English (43k), Spanish (8.6k) and Thai (5k) across the domains weather, alarm, and reminder. We use this data set to evaluate three different cross-lingual transfer methods: (1) translating the training data, (2) using cross-lingual pre-trained embeddings, and (3) a novel method of using a multilingual machine translation encoder as contextual word representations. We find that given several hundred training examples in the the target language, the latter two methods outperform translating the training data. Further, in very low-resource settings, multilingual contextual word representations give better results than using cross-lingual static embeddings. We also compare the cross-lingual methods to using monolingual resources in the form of contextual ELMo representations and find that given just small amounts of target language data, this method outperforms all cross-lingual methods, which highlights the need for more sophisticated cross-lingual methods.

AB Despite increasing needs for the coalition-based resource sharing, establishing trusted coalition of nodes in an untrusted computing environment is a long-standing yet increasingly important issue to be solved. The Trusted virtual domain (TVD) is a new model for establishing trusted coalitions over heterogeneous and highly decentralized computing environment. The key technology to enable TVD is the integrity assurance mechanism, which allows a remote challenger to verify the configuration and state of a node.
   A modern computer system consists of a multi-layer stack of software, such as a hypervisor, a virtual machine, an operating system, middleware, etc. The integrity assurance of software components is established by chains of assurance from the trusted computing base (TCB) at the lowest layer, while the communication interface provided by nodes should be properly abstracted at a higher layer to support interoperable communication and the fine-grained handling of expressive messages.
   To fill the gap between "secure communication between nodes" and "secure communication between trusted components", a notion of "Secure Message Router (SMR)", domain-independent, easy to verify, multifunctional communication wrapper for secure communication is introduced in this paper. The SMR provides essential features to establish TVDs : end-to-end secure channel establishment, policy-based message translation and routing, and attestability using fixed clean implementation. A virtual machine-based implementation with a Web service interface is also discussed.

TI Wearable High-Density MXene-Bioelectronics for Neuromuscular
   Diagnostics, Rehabilitation, and Assistive Technologies
SO SMALL METHODS
AB High-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) allows noninvasive muscle monitoring and disease diagnosis. Clinical translation of current HDsEMG technologies is hampered by cost, limited scalability, low usability, and minimal spatial coverage. Here, this study presents, validates, and demonstrates the broad clinical applicability of dry wearable MXene HDsEMG arrays (MXtrodes) fabricated from safe and scalable liquid-phase processing of Ti3C2Tx. The fabrication scheme allows easy customization of array geometry to match subject anatomy, while the gel-free and minimal skin preparation enhance usability and comfort. The low impedance and high conductivity of the MXtrode arrays allow detection of the activity of large muscle groups at higher quality and spatial resolution than state-of-the-art wireless electromyography sensors, and in realistic clinical scenarios. To demonstrate the clinical applicability of MXtrodes in the context of neuromuscular diagnostics and rehabilitation, simultaneous HDsEMG and biomechanical mapping of muscle groups across the whole calf during various tasks, ranging from controlled contractions to walking is shown. Finally, the integration of HDsEMG acquired with MXtrodes with a machine learning pipeline and the accurate prediction of the phases of human gait are shown. The results underscore the advantages and translatability of MXene-based wearable bioelectronics for studying neuromuscular function and disease, as well as for precision rehabilitation.

TI Prediction of Synaptically Localized RNAs in Human Neurons Using
   Developmental Brain Gene Expression Data
SO GENES
AB In the nervous system, synapses are special and pervasive structures between axonal and dendritic terminals, which facilitate electrical and chemical communications among neurons. Extensive studies have been conducted in mice and rats to explore the RNA pool at synapses and investigate RNA transport, local protein synthesis, and synaptic plasticity. However, owing to the experimental difficulties of studying human synaptic transcriptomes, the full pool of human synaptic RNAs remains largely unclear. We developed a new machine learning method, called PredSynRNA, to predict the synaptic localization of human RNAs. Training instances of dendritically localized RNAs were compiled from previous rodent studies, overcoming the shortage of empirical instances of human synaptic RNAs. Using RNA sequence and gene expression data as features, various models with different learning algorithms were constructed and evaluated. Strikingly, the models using the developmental brain gene expression features achieved superior performance for predicting synaptically localized RNAs. We examined the relevant expression features learned by PredSynRNA and used an independent test dataset to further validate the model performance. PredSynRNA models were then applied to the prediction and prioritization of candidate RNAs localized to human synapses, providing valuable targets for experimental investigations into neuronal mechanisms and brain disorders.

AB Recent studies in the field of adversarial machine learning have highlighted the poor robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to small, carefully crafted variations of the inputs. Previous work in this area has largely been focused on very small image perturbations and how these completely throw off the classifier output and cause CNNs to make high-confidence misclassifications while leaving the image visually unchanged for a human observer. These attacks modify individual pixels of each image and are unlikely to exist in a natural environment. More recent work has demonstrated that CNNs are also vulnerable to simple transformations of the input image, such as rotations and translations. These 'natural' transformations are much more likely to occur, either accidentally or intentionally, in a real-world scenario. In fact, humans experience and successfully recognize countless objects under these types of transformations every day. In this paper, we study the effect of these transformations on CNN accuracy when classifying 3D face-like objects (Greebles). Furthermore, we visualize the learned feature representations by CNNs and analyze how robust these learned representations are and how they compare to the human visual system. This work serves as a basis for future research into understanding the differences between CNN and human object recognition, particularly in the context of adversarial examples.

SO PROTEIN SCIENCE
AB RNA plays a fundamental, ubiquitous role as either substrate or functional component of many large cellular complexesmolecular machinesused to maintain and control the readout of genetic information, a functional landscape that we are only beginning to understand. The cellular mechanisms for the spatiotemporal organization of the plethora of RNAs involved in gene expression are particularly poorly understood. Intracellular single-molecule fluorescence microscopy provides a powerful emerging tool for probing the pertinent mechanistic parameters that govern cellular RNA functions, including those of protein coding messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Progress has been hampered, however, by the scarcity of efficient high-yield methods to fluorescently label RNA molecules without the need to drastically increase their molecular weight through artificial appendages that may result in altered behavior. Herein, we employ T7 RNA polymerase to body label an RNA with a cyanine dye, as well as yeast poly(A) polymerase to strategically place multiple 2-azido-modifications for subsequent fluorophore labeling either between the body and tail or randomly throughout the tail. Using a combination of biochemical and single-molecule fluorescence microscopy approaches, we demonstrate that both yeast poly(A) polymerase labeling strategies result in fully functional mRNA, whereas protein coding is severely diminished in the case of body labeling.

AB Lexical resources are very important in nowadays society, with the globalization and the increase of world communication and exchanges. There are dearly identified needs, both for humans and machines. Nevertheless, very few efforts are actually done in this domain. Consequently, there is an important lack of freely available good quality resources, especially for under-resourced languages. Furthermore, the majority of existing bilin. gual dictionaries is built with one language as English. Therefore, if one wants to translate from one language (that is not English) to another, it uses English as a pivot. And even for English native speakers, it creates a lot of misunderstandings that can be critical in many situations. In order to create and extend freely available good quality rich lexical resources for under-resourced languages online with a community of voluntary contributors, Jibiki, an online generic platform for managing (lookup, editing, import, export) any kind of lexical resources encoded in XML, has been developed. This platform is successfully used in several dictionary construction projects. Concerning the data, a serious game has been launched in order to collect precious lexical information such as collocations that will be integrated later into dictionary entries. Work is now done on extending our platform in order to reuse the resulting resources and enriching them by synchronization with the other systems (language learners and translators environments, machine translation systems, etc.).

TI An Application of wt-Distances to Characterize Complete b-Metric Spaces
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB summarization (CLS) is a process of generating a summary in the target language from a source document in another language. CLS is a challenging task because it involves two different languages. Traditionally, CLS is carried out in a pipeline scheme that involves two steps: summarization and translation. This approach has a problem, it introduces error propagation. To address this problem, we present a novel end-toend abstractive CLS without the explicit use of machine translation. The CLS architecture is based on Transformer which is proven to be able to perform text generation well. The CLS model is a jointly trained CLS task and monolingual summarization (MS) task. This is accomplished by adding a second decoder to handle the MS task, while the first decoder handles the CLS task. We also incorporated multilingual word embeddings (MWE) components into the architecture to further improve the performance of the CLS models. Both English and Bahasa Indonesia are represented by MWE whose embeddings have already been mapped into the same vector space. MWE helps to better map the relation between input and output that use different languages. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves improvement up to +0.2981 ROUGE-1, +0.2084 ROUGE-2, and +0.2771 ROUGE-L when compared to the pipeline baselines and up to +0.1288 ROUGE-1, +0.1185 ROUGE-2, and +0.1413 ROUGE-L when compared to the endto-end baselines.

   Networks
SO FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Protein localization in cells has been analyzed by fluorescent labeling using indirect immunofluorescence and fluorescent protein tagging. However, the relationships between the localization of different proteins had not been analyzed using artificial intelligence. Here, we applied convolutional networks for the prediction of localization of the cytoskeletal proteins from the localization of the other proteins. Lamellipodia are one of the actin-dependent subcellular structures involved in cell migration and are mainly generated by the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)-family verprolin homologous protein 2 (WAVE2) and the membrane remodeling I-BAR domain protein IRSp53. Focal adhesion is another actin-based structure that contains vinculin protein and promotes lamellipodia formation and cell migration. In contrast, microtubules are not directly related to actin filaments. The convolutional network was trained using images of actin filaments paired with WAVE2, IRSp53, vinculin, and microtubules. The generated images of WAVE2, IRSp53, and vinculin were highly similar to their real images. In contrast, the microtubule images generated from actin filament images were inferior without the generation of filamentous structures, suggesting that microscopic images of actin filaments provide more information about actin-related protein localization. Collectively, this study suggests that image translation by the convolutional network can predict the localization of functionally related proteins, and the convolutional network might be used to describe the relationships between the proteins by their localization.

TI The Model and Training Algorithm of Compact Drone Autonomous Visual
   Navigation System
SO DATA
AB Trainable visual navigation systems based on deep learning demonstrate potential for robustness of onboard camera parameters and challenging environment. However, a deep model requires substantial computational resources and large labelled training sets for successful training. Implementation of the autonomous navigation and training-based fast adaptation to the new environment for a compact drone is a complicated task. The article describes an original model and training algorithms adapted to the limited volume of labelled training set and constrained computational resource. This model consists of a convolutional neural network for visual feature extraction, extreme-learning machine for estimating the position displacement and boosted information-extreme classifier for obstacle prediction. To perform unsupervised training of the convolution filters with a growing sparse-coding neural gas algorithm, supervised learning algorithms to construct the decision rules with simulated annealing search algorithm used for finetuning are proposed. The use of complex criterion for parameter optimization of the feature extractor model is considered. The resulting approach performs better trajectory reconstruction than the well-known ORB-SLAM. In particular, for sequence 7 from the KITTI dataset, the translation error is reduced by nearly 65.6% under the frame rate 10 frame per second. Besides, testing on the independent TUM sequence shot outdoors produces a translation error not exceeding 6% and a rotation error not exceeding 3.68 degrees per 100 m. Testing was carried out on the Raspberry Pi 3+ single-board computer.

AB Image-based generative methods, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) have already been able to generate realistic images with much context control, specially when they are conditioned. However, most successful frameworks share a common procedure which performs an image-to-image translation with pose of figures in the image untouched. When the objective is reposing a figure in an image while preserving the rest of the image, the state-of-the-art mainly assumes a single rigid body with simple background and limited pose shift, which can hardly be extended to the images under normal settings. In this paper, we introduce an image "inner space" preserving model that assigns an interpretable low-dimensional pose descriptor (LDPD) to an articulated figure in the image. Figure reposing is then generated by passing the LDPD and the original image through multi-stage augmented hourglass networks in a conditional GAN structure, called inner space preserving generative pose machine (ISP-GPM). We evaluated ISP-GPM on reposing human figures, which are highly articulated with versatile variations. Test of a state-of-the-art pose estimator on our reposed dataset gave an accuracy over 80% on PCK0.5 metric. The results also elucidated that our ISP-GPM is able to preserve the background with high accuracy while reasonably recovering the area blocked by the figure to be reposed.

TI BaPipe: Balanced Pipeline Parallelism for DNN Training
SO PARALLEL PROCESSING LETTERS
AB The size of deep neural networks (DNNs) grows rapidly as the complexity of the machine learning algorithm increases. Distributed deep learning based on model parallelism has been widely used to satisfy the requirements of DNN training related to computation and memory. In this paper, we propose a training framework for pipeline parallelism called BaPipe (Balanced Pipeline) that can automatically explore methods to schedule pipeline parallelism and balanced partition strategies for DNN training on heterogeneous accelerator clusters. In BaPipe, each accelerator calculates the forward and backward propagation for the assigned partition of networks to implement an intra-batch pipeline parallelism strategy. By considering the parameters of DNN models as well as the computation, memory, and communication resources of each accelerator, BaPipe automatically selects the most suitable method of pipeline scheduling from among multiple proposed scheduling modes. It also uses a novel strategy to automatically investigate load balancing in the context of inter-layer partition, intra-layer partition, and coarse-grained partition. We trained such DNNs as VGG-16, ResNet-50, and Google's Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) on GPU clusters, and simulated the training-related performance of FPGA clusters. Compared with the state-of-the-art frameworks for data parallelism (DP) and pipeline parallelism, BaPipe provides a speedup of 3.2x and 4x of memory reduction on various homogeneous and heterogeneous platforms.

   gaps and a call for rigorous validation studies
SO CLINICAL TRANSPLANTATION
AB Transcriptomics generates pathogenetic insights not obtainable by histology, but translation of these insights into diagnostic tests is not a trivial task. This opinion-piece critically appraises declarative MMDx statements, such as the infallibility of machine learning algorithms, measurements of gene expression with >99% precision, and "unambiguous reclassifications" of contentious biopsies such as those with borderline change, polyomavirus nephropathy, chronic active T-cell or mixed rejection, isolated intimal arteritis, and renal medullary pathology.
   It is shown that molecular diagnoses that do not agree with histology cannot be attributed primarily to pathology reading errors. Neither can all molecular calls derived from arbitrary binary thresholds be automatically accepted as the ground truth. Important other sources of discrepancies between clinico-pathologic and molecular calls include: (a) organ being studied, (b) disease definition, (c) clinical histologic, and gene expression heterogeneity within the same diagnostic label, (d) size and composition of comparator groups, (e) molecular noise, (f) variability in output of different machine learning algorithms, and (g) the nonavailability of a molecular classifier for chronic active TCMR. Carefully designed clinical trials are needed to determine which of the proposed indications of MMDx provide incremental value over existing standard of care protocols.

AB Named entities carry essential meanings and information in natural language. Therefore, Named Entity Recognition has many applications in different Natural Language Processing tasks such as Information Retrieval, Information Extraction, Machine Translation, and Question Answering. State-of-the-art Named Entity Recognition systems are based on supervised machine learning algorithms which require huge amounts of training data. The main problem, however, is that constructing named entity annotated corpora is an expensive, labor-intensive, and time-consuming task. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an approach to improve monolingual Named Entity Recognition systems by exploiting an existing unannotated English-Chinese bilingual corpus. The system jointly recognizes named entities in both English and Chinese sentences through the use of bilingual constraints. Experimental results show an improvement in Named Entity Recognition of both Chinese and English compared to the strong baseline StanfordNER. In particular, Chinese Named Entity Recognition improves significantly by 20.81% in term of F-1-score. As for the English language, Named Entity Recognition F-1-score increases slightly from 75.75% to 76.08%. When comparing to the state-of-the-art system in improving Named Entity Recognition based on bilingual resources, we manage to outperform in Chinese Named Entity Recognition task by 5.99% and achieve comparable results for the English side. Our proposed method can also be generalized to apply to resource-limited languages.

SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB In the alloy design and development process, a wealth of atomically resolved structural high-resolution trans-mission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images are produced. Identifying the different nano-precipitate phases and tracking their evolution under various compositions and during manufacturing or post-processing requires hundreds of HRTEM images and thousands of precipitates. The nanoscopic phase information labeling and analysis purely relies on humans are prohibitively costly and time-consuming, sometimes not reliable because of the lack of authoritative knowledge. Here, we develop a novel unsupervised machine learning approach coupled with adaptive computer vision techniques with features in the Fourier space to automatically determine the number of phases and segment/quantify the phases with nanoscale resolution, allowing for quantitative corre-lation between nanostructure formation, processing and functional properties. To automate the phase extraction/ quantification and ascertain its applicability, we have applied the developed framework to the HRTEM images from several alloy systems, processing conditions, image magnifications, and phase types and morphologies (precipitates, nano-twins, stacking faults, crystalline matrix, and amorphous structures) for verification. This study paves the road for compression, visualization, and translation of raw image structural data into physically relevant information in real-time with minimal human supervision. It shows the promise of enabling high -throughput materials characterization for the acceleration of alloy manufacturing and design.

TI Small RNA sequences derived from pre-microRNAs in the supraspliceosome
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate the expression and translation of genes in healthy and diseased tissues. Herein, we characterize short RNAs from human HeLa cells found in the supraspliceosome, a nuclear dynamic machine in which pre-mRNA processing occurs. We sequenced small RNAs (<200 nt) extracted from the supraspliceosome, and identified sequences that are derived from 200 miRNAs genes. About three quarters of them are mature miRNAs, whereas the rest account for various defined regions of the pre-miRNA, and its hairpin-loop precursor. Out of these aligned sequences, 53 were undetected in cellular extract, and the abundance of additional 48 strongly differed from that in cellular extract. Notably, we describe seven abundant miRNA-derived sequences that overlap non-coding exons of their host gene. The rich collection of sequences identical to pre-miRNAs at the supraspliceosome suggests overlooked nuclear functions. Specifically, the abundant hsa-mir-99b may affect splicing of LINC01129 primary transcript through base-pairing with its exon-intron junction. Using suppression and overexpression experiments, we show that hsa-mir-7704 negatively regulates the level of the lncRNA HAGLR. We claim that in cases of extended base-pairing complementarity, such supraspliceosomal pre-miRNA sequences might have a role in transcription attenuation, maturation and processing.

AB Most of the reported fluorescence imaging methods and systems highlight the need for three-dimensional information of the inspected region surface geometry. The scope of this manuscript is to introduce an epi-illumination fluorescence imaging system, which has been enhanced with a binocular machine vision system for the translation of the inverse problem solution to the global coordinates system. The epi-illumination fluorescence imaging system is consisted of a structured scanning excitation source, which increases the spatial differentiation of the measured data, and a telecentric lens, which increases the angular differentiation. On the other hand, the binocular system is based on the projection of a structured light pattern on the inspected area, for the solution of the correspondence problem between the stereo pair. The functionality of the system has been evaluated on tissue phantoms and calibration objects. The reconstruction accuracy of the fluorophores distribution, as resulted from the root mean square error between the actual distribution and the outcome of the forward solver, was more than 80%. On the other hand, the surface three-dimensional reconstruction of the inspected region presented 0.067 +/- 0.004 mm accuracy, as resulted from the mean Euclidean distance between the three-dimensional position of the real world points and those reconstructed.

SO MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING
AB The aim of this study was to compare methods for feature extraction and classification of EEG signals for a brain-computer interface (BCI) driven by auditory and spatial navigation imagery. Features were extracted using autoregressive modeling and optimized discrete wavelet transform. The features were selected with exhaustive search, from the combination of features of two and three channels, and with a discriminative measure (r (2)). Moreover, Bayesian classifier and support vector machine (SVM) with Gaussian kernel were compared. The results showed that the two classifiers provided similar classification accuracy. Conversely, the exhaustive search of the optimal combination of features from two and three channels significantly improved performance with respect to using r (2) for channel selection. With features optimally extracted from three channels with optimized scaling filter in the discrete wavelet transform, the classification accuracy was on average 72.2%. Thus, the choice of features had greater impact on performance than the choice of the classifier for discrimination between the two non-motor imagery tasks investigated. The results are relevant for the choice of the translation algorithm for an on-line BCI system based on non-motor imagery.

TI Automated machine learning optimizes and accelerates predictive modeling
   from COVID-19 high throughput datasets
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB COVID-19 outbreak brings intense pressure on healthcare systems, with an urgent demand for effective diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic procedures. Here, we employed Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) to analyze three publicly available high throughput COVID-19 datasets, including proteomic, metabolomic and transcriptomic measurements. Pathway analysis of the selected features was also performed. Analysis of a combined proteomic and metabolomic dataset led to 10 equivalent signatures of two features each, with AUC 0.840 (CI 0.723-0.941) in discriminating severe from non-severe COVID-19 patients. A transcriptomic dataset led to two equivalent signatures of eight features each, with AUC 0.914 (CI 0.865-0.955) in identifying COVID-19 patients from those with a different acute respiratory illness. Another transcriptomic dataset led to two equivalent signatures of nine features each, with AUC 0.967 (CI 0.899-0.996) in identifying COVID-19 patients from virus-free individuals. Signature predictive performance remained high upon validation. Multiple new features emerged and pathway analysis revealed biological relevance by implication in Viral mRNA Translation, Interferon gamma signaling and Innate Immune System pathways. In conclusion, AutoML analysis led to multiple biosignatures of high predictive performance, with reduced features and large choice of alternative predictors. These favorable characteristics are eminent for development of cost-effective assays to contribute to better disease management.

TI RUNTIME AND LANGUAGE SUPPORT FOR COMPILING ADAPTIVE IRREGULAR PROGRAMS
   ON DISTRIBUTED-MEMORY MACHINES
SO SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB In many scientific applications, arrays containing data are indirectly indexed through indirection arrays. Such scientific applications are called irregular programs and are a distinct class of applications that require special techniques for parallelization.
   This paper presents a library called CHAOS, which helps users implement irregular programs on distributed-memory message-passing machines, such as the paragon, Delta, CM-5 and SP-1. The CHAOS library provides efficient runtime primitives for distributing data and computation over processors; it supports efficient index translation mechanisms and provides users high-level mechanisms for optimizing communication. CHAOS subsumes the previous PARTI library and supports a larger class of applications. In particular, it provides efficient support for parallelization of adaptive irregular programs where indirection arrays are modified during the course of computation. To demonstrate the efficacy of CHAOS, two challenging real-life adaptive applications were parallelized using CHAOS primitives: a molecular dynamics code, CHARMM, and a particle-in-cell code, DSMC.
   Besides providing runtime support to users, CHAOS tan also be used by compilers to automatically parallelize irregular applications. This paper demonstrates how CHAOS can be effectively used in such a framework. By embedding CHAOS primitives in the Syracuse Fortran 90D/HPF compiler, kernels taken from the CHARMM and DSMC codes have been automatically parallelized.

TI How and Why the Cerebellum Recodes Input Signals: An Alternative to
   Machine Learning
SO NEUROSCIENTIST
AB Mossy fiber input to the cerebellum is received by granule cells where it is thought to be recoded into internal signals received by Purkinje cells, which alone carry the output of the cerebellar cortex. In any neural network, variables are contained in groups of signals as well as signals themselves-which cells are active and how many, for example, and statistical variables coded in rates, such as the mean and range, and which rates are strongly represented, in a defined population. We argue that the primary function of recoding is to confine translation to an effect of some variables and not others-both where input is recoded into internal signals and the translation downstream of internal signals into an effect on Purkinje cells. The cull of variables is harsh. Internal signaling is group coded. This allows coding to exploit statistics for a reliable and precise effect despite needing to work with high-dimensional input which is a highly unpredictably variable. An important effect is to normalize eclectic input signals, so that the basic, repeating cerebellar circuit, preserved across taxa, does not need to specialize (within regional variations). With this model, there is no need to slavishly conserve or compute data coded in single signals. If we are correct, a learning algorithm-for years, a mainstay of cerebellar modeling-would be redundant.

TI Rotation Equivariant Convolutional Neural Networks for Hyperspectral
   Image Classification
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Detection of surface material based on hyperspectral imaging (HSI) analysis is an important and challenging task in remote sensing. It is widely known that spectral-spatial data exploitation performs better than traditional spectral pixel-wise procedures. Nowadays, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown to be a powerful deep learning (DL) technique due their strong feature extraction ability. CNNs not only combine spectral-spatial information in a natural way, but have also shown to be able to learn translation-equivariant representations, i.e. a translation of input features into an equivalent internal CNN feature map. This provides great robustness to spatial feature locations. However, as far as we know, CNNs do not exhibit a natural way to exploit rotation equivariance, i.e. make use of the fact that data patches in a HSI data cube are observed in different orientations due to their orientation or on the varying paths/orbits of the airborne/spaceborne spectrometers. This article presents a rotation-equivariant CNN2D model for HSI analysis, where traditional convolution kernels have been replaced by circular harmonic filters (CHFs). The obtained results over three well-known HSI datasets showcase the potential of the approach.

TI Towards Computational Models and Applications of Insect Visual Systems
   for Motion Perception: A Review
SO ARTIFICIAL LIFE
AB Motion perception is a critical capability determining a variety of aspects of insects' life, including avoiding predators, foraging, and so forth. A good number of motion detectors have been identified in the insects' visual pathways. Computational modeling of these motion detectors has not only been providing effective solutions to artificial intelligence, but also benefiting the understanding of complicated biological visual systems. These biological mechanisms through millions of years of evolutionary development will have formed solid modules for constructing dynamic vision systems for future intelligent machines. This article reviews the computational motion perception models originating from biological research on insects' visual systems in the literature. These motion perception models or neural networks consist of the looming-sensitive neuronal models of lobula giant movement detectors (LGMDs) in locusts, the translation-sensitive neural systems of direction-selective neurons (DSNs) in fruit flies, bees, and locusts, and the small-target motion detectors (STMDs) in dragonflies and hoverflies. We also review the applications of these models to robots and vehicles. Through these modeling studies, we summarize the methodologies that generate different direction and size selectivity in motion perception. Finally, we discuss multiple systems integration and hardware realization of these bio-inspired motion perception models.

TI Rational swept surface constructions based on differential and integral
   sweep curve properties
SO COMPUTER AIDED GEOMETRIC DESIGN
AB A swept surface is generated from a profile curve and a sweep curve by employing the latter to define a continuous family of transformations of the former. By using polynomial or rational curves, and specifying the homogeneous coordinates of the swept surface as bilinear forms in the profile and sweep curve homogeneous coordinates, the outcome is guaranteed to be a rational surface compatible with the prevailing data types of CAD systems. However, this approach does not accommodate many geometrically intuitive sweep operations based on differential or integral properties of the sweep curve - such as the parametric speed, tangent, normal, curvature, arc length, and offset curves - since they do not ordinarily have a rational dependence on the curve parameter. The use of Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) sweep curves surmounts this limitation, and thus makes possible a much richer spectrum of rational swept surface types. A number of representative examples are used to illustrate the diversity of these novel swept surface forms - including the oriented-translation sweep, offset-translation sweep, generalized conical sweep, and oriented-involute sweep. In many cases of practical interest, these forms also have rational offset surfaces. Considerations related to the automated CNC machining of these surfaces, using only their high-level procedural definitions, are also briefly discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cuneiform tablets appertain to the oldest textual artifacts and are in extent comparable to texts written in Latin or ancient Greek. The Cuneiform Commentaries Project (CPP) from Yale University provides tracings of cuneiform tablets with annotated transliterations and translations. As a part of our work analyzing cuneiform script computationally with 3D-acquisition and word-spotting, we present a first approach for automatized learning of transliterations of cuneiform tablets based on a corpus of parallel lines. These consist of manually drawn cuneiform characters and their transliteration into an alphanumeric code. Since the Cuneiform script is only available as raster-data, we segment lines with a projection profile, extract Histogram of oriented Gradients (HoG) features, detect outliers caused by tablet damage, and align those features with the transliteration. We apply methods from part-of-speech tagging to learn a correspondence between features and transliteration tokens. We evaluate point-wise classification with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM); sequence classification with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and a Structured Support Vector Machine (SVM-HMM). Analyzing our findings, we reach the conclusion that the sparsity of data, inconsistent labeling and the variety of tracing styles do currently not allow for fully automatized transliterations with the presented approach. However, the pursuit of automated learning of transliterations is of great relevance as manual annotation in larger quantities is not viable, given the few experts capable of transcribing cuneiform tablets.

TI Evolution of cell cycle control: Same molecular machines, different
   regulation
SO CELL CYCLE
AB Decades of research has together with the availability of whole genomes made it clear that many of the core components involved in the cell cycle are conserved across eukaryotes, both functionally and structurally. These proteins are organized in complexes and modules that are activated or deactivated at specific stages during the cell cycle through a wide variety of mechanisms including transcriptional regulation, phosphorylation, subcellular translocation and targeted degradation. In a series of integrative analyses of different genome-scale data sets, we have studied how these different layers of regulation together control the activity of cell cycle complexes and how this regulation has evolved. The results show surprisingly poor conservation of both the transcriptional and the post-translation regulation of individual genes and proteins; however, the changes in one layer of regulation are often mirrored by changes in other layers, implying that independent layers of control coevolve. By taking a bird's eye view of the cell cycle, we demonstrate how the modular organization of cellular systems possesses a built-in flexibility, which allows evolution to find many different solutions for assembling the same molecular machines just in time for action.

TI floodGAN: Using Deep Adversarial Learning to Predict Pluvial Flooding in
   Real Time
SO WATER
AB Using machine learning for pluvial flood prediction tasks has gained growing attention in the past years. In particular, data-driven models using artificial neuronal networks show promising results, shortening the computation times of physically based simulations. However, recent approaches have used mainly conventional fully connected neural networks which were (a) restricted to spatially uniform precipitation events and (b) limited to a small amount of input data. In this work, a deep convolutional generative adversarial network has been developed to predict pluvial flooding caused by nonlinear spatial heterogeny rainfall events. The model developed, floodGAN, is based on an image-to-image translation approach whereby the model learns to generate 2D inundation predictions conditioned by heterogenous rainfall distributions-through the minimax game of two adversarial networks. The training data for the floodGAN model was generated using a physically based hydrodynamic model. To evaluate the performance and accuracy of the floodGAN, model multiple tests were conducted using both synthetic events and a historic rainfall event. The results demonstrate that the proposed floodGAN model is up to 10(6) times faster than the hydrodynamic model and promising in terms of accuracy and generalizability. Therefore, it bridges the gap between detailed flood modelling and real-time applications such as end-to-end early warning systems.

TI Fingerprint-inspired graphene pressure sensor with wrinkled structure
SO EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS
AB Nowadays, flexible pressure sensors have broad applications in healthcare monitoring, wearable electronics and so on. However, conventional fabrications are mostly time-consuming, complicated and even use toxic chemical reagents. It is in urgent need to fabricate pressure sensors with high sensitivity in a facile way. In nature, the fingertip skin of human has many epidermal ridges, which can sense small external stimuli. Here, inspired from the fingerprint, we propose a new type of pressure sensor made with reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The rGO film is designed to form a wrinkled structure by a facile stretching-releasing process, which mimics the morphology of fingertip skin. Owing to the fingertip-skin-like wrinkled structure, the pressure sensor exhibits high sensitivity of 5.77 kPa(-1) (0 - 490 Pa). It also has a lot of attractive properties, such as fast response (< 100 ms), small detecting pressure (3 Pa) and good repeatability. We show the ability of the pressure sensor in small pressure detecting, human motion monitoring and motion pattern recognition. Furthermore, a translation system and a multi-touch device with spatially resolved detection based on the pressure sensor are developed. This pressure sensor is hopeful to have potential applications in wearable electronics and human-machine interaction systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Modern time-domain astronomy is capable of collecting a staggeringly large amount of data on millions of objects in real time. This makes it almost impossible for objects to be identified manually. Therefore the production of methods and systems for the automated classification of time-domain astronomical objects is of great importance. The Liverpool Telescope has a number of wide-field image gathering instruments mounted upon its structure. Utilizing a database established by a pre-processing operation upon these images, containing millions of candidate variable stars with multiple time-varying magnitude observations, we applied a method designed to extract time-translation invariant features from the time-series light curves. These efforts were met with limited success due to noise and uneven sampling within the time-series data. Additionally, finely surveying these light curves is a processing intensive task. Fortunately, these algorithms are capable of multi-threaded implementations based on available resources. Therefore we propose a new system designed to utilize multiple intelligent agents that distribute the data analysis across multiple machines whilst simultaneously a powerful intelligence service operates to constrain the light curves and eliminate false signals due to noise and local alias periods.

AB The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has identified natural language policies as the preferred expression of policy and implicitly called for an automated translation of ABAC natural language access control policy (NLACP) to a machine-readable form. An essential step towards this automation is to automate the extraction of ABAC attributes from NLACPs, which is the focus of this paper. We, therefore, raise the question of: how can we automate the task of attributes extraction from natural language documents? Our proposed solution to this question is built upon the recent advancements in natural language processing and machine learning techniques. For such a solution, the lack of appropriate data often poses a bottleneck. Therefore, we decouple the primary contributions of this work into: (1) developing a practical framework to extract ABAC attributes from natural language artifacts, and (2) generating a set of realistic synthetic natural language access control policies (NLACPs) to evaluate the proposed framework. The experimental results are promising with regard to the potential automation of the task of interest. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN), we achieved - in average - an F1-score of 0.96 when extracting the attributes of subjects, and 0.91 when extracting the objects' attributes from natural language access control policies.

TI Evaluation of Machine Learning Techniques to Predict the Likelihood of
   Mental Health Conditions Following a First mTBI
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB ObjectiveLimited research has evaluated the utility of machine learning models and longitudinal data from electronic health records (EHR) to forecast mental health outcomes following a traumatic brain injury (TBI). The objective of this study is to assess various data science and machine learning techniques and determine their efficacy in forecasting mental health (MH) conditions among active duty Service Members (SMs) following a first diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Materials and MethodsPatient demographics and encounter metadata of 35,451 active duty SMs who have sustained an initial mTBI, as documented within the EHR, were obtained. All encounter records from a year prior and post index mTBI date were collected. Patient demographics, ICD-9-CM and ICD-10 codes, enhanced diagnostic related groups, and other risk factors estimated from the year prior to index mTBI were utilized to develop a feature vector representative of each patient. To embed temporal information into the feature vector, various window configurations were devised. Finally, the presence or absence of mental health conditions post mTBI index date were used as the outcomes variable for the models. ResultsWhen evaluating the machine learning models, neural network techniques showed the best overall performance in identifying patients with new or persistent mental health conditions post mTBI. Various window configurations were tested and results show that dividing the observation window into three distinct date windows [-365:-30, -30:0, 0:14] provided the best performance. Overall, the models described in this paper identified the likelihood of developing MH conditions at [14:90] days post-mTBI with an accuracy of 88.2%, an AUC of 0.82, and AUC-PR of 0.66. DiscussionThrough the development and evaluation of different machine learning models we have validated the feasibility of designing algorithms to forecast the likelihood of developing mental health conditions after the first mTBI. Patient attributes including demographics, symptomatology, and other known risk factors proved to be effective features to employ when training ML models for mTBI patients. When patient attributes and features are estimated at different time window, the overall performance increase illustrating the importance of embedding temporal information into the models. The addition of temporal information not only improved model performance, but also increased interpretability and clinical utility. ConclusionPredictive analytics can be a valuable tool for understanding the effects of mTBI, particularly when identifying those individuals at risk of negative outcomes. The translation of these models from retrospective study into real-world validation models is imperative in the mitigation of negative outcomes with appropriate and timely interventions.

TI Semantic Relations Predict the Bracketing of Three-Component Multiword
   Terms
SO PROCESAMIENTO DEL LENGUAJE NATURAL
AB For English multiword terms (MWTs) of three or more constituents (e.g., sea level rise), a semantic analysis, based on linguistic and domain knowledge, is necessary to resolve the dependency between components. This structural disambiguation, often known as bracketing, involves the grouping of the dependent components so that the MWT is reduced to its basic form of modifier+head, as in [sea level] [rise]. Knowledge of these dependencies facilitates the comprehension of an MWT and its accurate translation into other languages. Moreover, the resolution of MWT bracketing provides a higher overall accuracy in machine translation systems and sentence parsers. This paper thus presents a pilot study that explored whether the bracketing of a ternary compound, when used as an argument in a sentence, can be predicted from the semantic information encoded in that sentence. It is shown that, with a random forest model, the semantic relation of the MWT to another argument in the same sentence, the lexical domain of the predicate, and the semantic role of the MWT were able to predict the bracketing of the 190 ternary compounds used as arguments in a sample of 188 semantically annotated sentences from a Coastal Engineering corpus (100% F-1-score). Furthermore, only the semantic relation of an MWT to another argument in the same sentence proved enormous capability to predict ternary compound bracketing with a binary decision-tree model (94.12% F-1-score).

TI Chinese students' perceptions of using Google Translate as a
   translingual CALL tool in EFL writing
SO COMPUTER ASSISTED LANGUAGE LEARNING
AB This study investigates the effectiveness of using Google Translate as a translingual CALL tool in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) writing, keyed to the perceptions of both more highly proficient Chinese English major university students and less-proficient non-English majors. After watching a 5-minute passage from a movie, each cohort of students was asked to write an extemporaneous reflective essay. Students first wrote a text in Chinese, then composed a corresponding text in English, submitted their Chinese text to Google Translate (GT), compared the translated English GT text with their own self-written (SW) text, and finally revised their self-written English (RSW) text by referring to their GT text. Student perceptions of the activity were elicited by a questionnaire. Two types of online computational assessments evaluated students' writing performance for all the SW, GT and RSW versions. Results indicate that GT texts showed significantly better writing performance in delivering more enriched content, using more advanced vocabulary and making fewer spelling and grammatical errors than the SW texts. RSW texts showed a significant improvement over SW versions, especially for the non-English major students. Students using Google Translate as a revision tool displayed better L2 performance in written language and content than in their self-writing, and especially non-English major students showed significantly more positive attitudes towards the use of Google Translate than English major students.

TI Evaluating the pronunciation component of text-to-speech systems for
   English: a performance comparison of different approaches
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB The automatic derivation of word pronunciations from input text is a central task for any text-to-speech system. For general English text at least, this is often thought to be a solved problem, with manually-derived linguistic rules assumed capable of handling "novel" words missing from the system dictionary. Data-driven methods, based on machine learning of the regularities implicit in a large pronouncing dictionary, have received considerable attention recently but are generally thought to perform less well. However, these tentative beliefs are at best uncertain without powerful methods for comparing text-to-phoneme subsystems. This paper contributes to the development of such methods by comparing the performance of four representative approaches to automatic phonemization on the same test dictionary. As well as rule-based approaches, three data-driven techniques are evaluated: pronunciation by analogy (PbA), NETspeak and IB1-IG (a modified k-nearest neighbour method). Issues involved in comparative evaluation are detailed and elucidated. The data-driven techniques outperform rules in accuracy of letter-to-phoneme translation by a very significant margin but require aligned text-phoneme training data and are slower. Best translation results are obtained with PbA at approximately 72% words correct on a resonably large pronouncing dictionary, compared with something like 26% words correct for the rules, indicating that automatic pronunciation of text is not a solved problem.

TI Machine Vision-Based Positioning and Inspection Using
   Expectation-Maximization Technique
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT
AB Precision positioning is very important for automatic assembly and inspection in the electronic manufacturing process. In this paper, we propose a fast image alignment method using the expectation-maximization (E-M) technique. The proposed algorithm is especially applied to positioning and defect inspection of printed circuit boards (PCBs). It can well handle deformed or incomplete object shapes with translation, rotation, and scale changes. The Canny edge detector is used to generate the edge maps of images. The E-step of the E-M procedure finds mutual edge points in both compared images by assigning weights to individual edge points. The mutual edge points give larger weights, while the foreign edge points in two images have smaller weights. The M-step then calculates the geometric transformation parameters using the weighted edge points in individual images. For an edge point in one image, a fast spiral search is proposed to find its corresponding edge point with the shortest distance in the other image. The spiral search is carried out by a predetermined lookup table, and no computation is involved in the search process. The weight of each edge point is inversely proportional to the neighboring distance. Experimental results indicate that the proposed E-M positioning method can achieve a translation error less than 1 pixel and a rotation error smaller than 1 degrees for PCB positioning.

AB In this paper, we present a part of our work related to an ongoing ambitious project funded by the Saudi National plan for Sciences and Technologies, to build a virtual translator from Arabic Text to Saudi Sign Language. This project comprises two main parts. The first part concerns the mapping between words (or morphemes) in the input text and their equivalent signs, and will rely on the sentence structure in both source and target languages. This part represents a pure translation problem, and will be based on transformational grammar. The second part is concerned by the use of avatar-based software to render the resulting sequence of signs. Appropriate tools are used for both pre-creating animated sign-symbols and then signing them at end of the conversion process. This second part is related to the graphical creation and animation of sign language. As a first step toward this end, a bilingual parallel corpus is being developed in an appropriate domain. It is used to build a well founded dictionary, which can be used as a basis of our works. We focus on this paper on the construction of such a dictionary and the creation of 3D animation of its related signs using avatar technologies. A collaborative strategy for enhancing and enlarging the dictionary in an incremental way will also be presented.

   Hippel-Lindau disease
SO HUMAN MUTATION
AB Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a hereditary cancer syndrome where individuals are predisposed to tumor development in the brain, adrenal gland, kidney, and other organs. It is caused by pathogenic variants in the VHL tumor suppressor gene. Standardized disease information has been difficult to collect due to the rarity and diversity of VHL patients. Over 4100 unique articles published until October 2019 were screened for germline genotype-phenotype data. Patient data were translated into standardized descriptions using Human Genome Variation Society gene variant nomenclature and Human Phenotype Ontology terms and has been manually curated into an open-access knowledgebase called Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer. In total, 634 unique VHL variants, 2882 patients, and 1991 families from 427 papers were captured. We identified relationship trends between phenotype and genotype data using classic statistical methods and spectral clustering unsupervised learning. Our analyses reveal earlier onset of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma and retinal angiomas, phenotype co-occurrences and genotype-phenotype correlations including hotspots. It confirms existing VHL associations and can be used to identify new patterns and associations in VHL disease. Our database serves as an aggregate knowledge translation tool to facilitate sharing information about the pathogenicity of VHL variants.

TI Hierarchical, rotation-equivariant neural networks to select structural
   models of protein complexes
SO PROTEINS-STRUCTURE FUNCTION AND BIOINFORMATICS
AB Predicting the structure of multi-protein complexes is a grand challenge in biochemistry, with major implications for basic science and drug discovery. Computational structure prediction methods generally leverage predefined structural features to distinguish accurate structural models from less accurate ones. This raises the question of whether it is possible to learn characteristics of accurate models directly from atomic coordinates of protein complexes, with no prior assumptions. Here we introduce a machine learning method that learns directly from the 3D positions of all atoms to identify accurate models of protein complexes, without using any precomputed physics-inspired or statistical terms. Our neural network architecture combines multiple ingredients that together enable end-to-end learning from molecular structures containing tens of thousands of atoms: a point-based representation of atoms, equivariance with respect to rotation and translation, local convolutions, and hierarchical subsampling operations. When used in combination with previously developed scoring functions, our network substantially improves the identification of accurate structural models among a large set of possible models. Our network can also be used to predict the accuracy of a given structural model in absolute terms. The architecture we present is readily applicable to other tasks involving learning on 3D structures of large atomic systems.

TI The future is now? Clinical and translational aspects of "Omics"
   technologies
SO IMMUNOLOGY AND CELL BIOLOGY
AB Big data has become a central part of medical research, as well as modern life generally. "Omics" technologies include genomics, proteomics, microbiomics and increasingly other omics. These have been driven by rapid advances in laboratory techniques and equipment. Crucially, improved information handling capabilities have allowed concepts such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to enter the research world. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown how quickly information can be generated and analyzed using such approaches, but also showed its limitations. This review will look at how "omics" has begun to be translated into clinical practice. While there appears almost limitless potential in using big data for "precision" or "personalized" medicine, the reality is that this remains largely aspirational. Oncology is the only field of medicine that is widely adopting such technologies, and even in this field uptake is irregular. There are practical and ethical reasons for this lack of translation of increasingly affordable techniques into the clinic. Undoubtedly, there will be increasing use of large data sets from traditional (e.g. tumor samples, patient genomics) and nontraditional (e.g. smartphone) sources. It is perhaps the greatest challenge of the health-care sector over the coming decade to integrate these resources in an effective, practical and ethical way.

TI Identifying N-6-methyladenosine sites using multi-interval nucleotide
   pair position specificity and support vector machine
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) refers to methylation of the adenosine nucleotide acid at the nitrogen-6 position. It plays an important role in a series of biological processes, such as splicing events, mRNA exporting, nascent mRNA synthesis, nuclear translocation and translation process. Numerous experiments have been done to successfully characterize m(6)A sites within sequences since high-resolution mapping of m(6)A sites was established. However, as the explosive growth of genomic sequences, using experimental methods to identify m(6)A sites are time-consuming and expensive. Thus, it is highly desirable to develop fast and accurate computational identification methods. In this study, we propose a sequence-based predictor called RAM-NPPS for identifying m(6)A sites within RNA sequences, in which we present a novel feature representation algorithm based on multi-interval nucleotide pair position specificity, and use support vector machine classifier to construct the prediction model. Comparison results show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art predictors on three benchmark datasets across the three species, indicating the effectiveness and robustness of our method. Moreover, an online webserver implementing the proposed predictor has been established at http://server.malab.cn/RAM-NPPS/. It is anticipated to be a useful prediction tool to assist biologists to reveal the mechanisms of m(6)A site functions.

SO SYNTHETIC AND SYSTEMS BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Cell-free expression system is a technology for the synthesis of proteins in vitro. The system is a platform for several bioengineering projects, e.g. cell-free metabolic engineering, evolutionary design of experiments, and synthetic minimal cell construction. Bacterial cell-free protein synthesis system (CFPS) is a robust tool for synthetic biology. The bacteria lysate, the DNA, and the energy module, which are the three optimized sub-systems for in vitro protein synthesis, compose the integrated system. Currently, an optimized E. coli cell-free expression system can produce up to similar to 2.3 mg/mL of a fluorescent reporter protein. Herein, I will describe the features of ATP-regeneration systems for in vitro protein synthesis, and I will present a machine-learning experiment for optimizing the protein yield of E. coli cell-free protein synthesis systems. Moreover, I will introduce experiments on the synthesis of a minimal cell using liposomes as dynamic containers, and E. coli cell-free expression system as biochemical platform for metabolism and gene expression. CFPS can be further integrated with other technologies for novel applications in environmental, medical and material science. (c) 2017 The Author.

TI Machine Learning in Computer-Aided Synthesis Planning
SO ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH
AB CONSPECTUS: Computer-aided synthesis planning (GASP) is focused on the goal of accelerating the process by which chemists decide how to synthesize small molecule compounds. The ideal CASP program would take a molecular structure as input and output a sorted list of detailed reaction schemes that each connect that target to purchasable starting materials via a series of chemically feasible reaction steps. Early work in this field relied on expert-crafted reaction rules and heuristics to describe possible retrosynthetic disconnections and selectivity rules but suffered from incompleteness, infeasible suggestions, and human bias. With the relatively recent availability of large reaction corpora (such as the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), Reaxys, and SciFinder databases), consisting of millions of tabulated reaction examples, it is now possible to construct and validate purely data-driven approaches to synthesis planning. As a result, synthesis planning has been opened to machine learning techniques, and the field is advancing rapidly.
   In this Account, we focus on two critical aspects of CASP and recent machine learning approaches to both challenges. First, we discuss the problem of retrosynthetic planning, which requires a recommender system to propose synthetic disconnections starting from a target molecule. We describe how the search strategy, necessary to overcome the exponential growth of the search space with increasing number of reaction steps, can be assisted through a learned synthetic complexity metric. We also describe how the recursive expansion can be performed by a straightforward nearest neighbor model that makes clever use of reaction data to generate high quality retrosynthetic disconnections. Second, we discuss the problem of anticipating the products of chemical reactions, which can be used to validate proposed reactions in a computer-generated synthesis plan (i.e., reduce false positives) to increase the likelihood of experimental success. While we introduce this task in the context of reaction validation, its utility extends to the prediction of side products and impurities, among other applications. We describe neural network-based approaches that we and others have developed for this forward prediction task that can be trained on previously published experimental data.
   Machine learning and artificial intelligence have revolutionized a number of disciplines, not limited to image recognition, dictation, translation, content recommendation, advertising, and autonomous driving. While there is a rich history of using machine learning for structure-activity models in chemistry, it is only now that it is being successfully applied more broadly to organic synthesis and synthesis design. As reported in this Account, machine learning is rapidly transforming CASP, but there are several remaining challenges and opportunities, many pertaining to the availability and standardization of both data and evaluation metrics, which must be addressed by the community at large.

TI Sparse representations for fault signatures via hybrid regularization in
   adaptive undecimated fractional spline wavelet transform domain
SO MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Recent studies on vibration-based machine diagnostics have highlighted the role played by the wavelet transform (WT). However, common WT-based denoising methods (e.g. wavelet thresholding and non-penalty regularization) are often challenging in attaining accurate sparse representations of fault signatures in practice due to artifacts. In this paper, a method via hybrid regularization in the adaptive undecimated fractional spline WT (AUFrSWT) domain is introduced to achieve the accurate sparse representations of fault signatures from strong noise environments. The method promotes wavelet sparsity by two aspects: wavelet basis design and wavelet coefficient processing. For the former, a new wavelet family, i.e. a fractional spline wavelet, is used, and the AUFrSWT is originally proposed to customize the optimal wavelet basis and meanwhile address the translation-invariant issue. For the latter, the wavelet coefficients are estimated by minimizing a single convex model function with hybrid regularization, where nonconvex arctangent penalty is employed for wavelet sparsity promoting and total variation is used to improve the reconstruction performance of the shrunken coefficients. The method is validated by the analysis of actual bearing and gear vibration data from fault-injection experiments. Analysis and comparison results show great potential for signal sparse representations and machinery fault diagnostics.

TI Cross-Lingual Knowledge Transferring by Structural Correspondence and
   Space Transfer
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS
AB The cross-lingual sentiment analysis (CLSA) aims to leverage label-rich resources in the source language to improve the models of a resource-scarce domain in the target language, where monolingual approaches based on machine learning usually suffer from the unavailability of sentiment knowledge. Recently, the transfer learning paradigm that can transfer sentiment knowledge from resource-rich languages, for example, English, to resource-poor languages, for example, Chinese, has gained particular interest. Along this line, in this article, we propose semisupervised learning with SCL and space transfer (ssSCL-ST), a semisupervised transfer learning approach that makes use of structural correspondence learning as well as space transfer for cross-lingual sentiment analysis. The key idea behind ssSCL-ST, at a high level, is to explore the intrinsic sentiment knowledge in the target-lingual domain and to reduce the loss of valuable knowledge due to the knowledge transfer via semisupervised learning. ssSCL-ST also features in pivot set extension and space transfer, which helps to enhance the efficiency of knowledge transfer and improve the classification accuracy in the target language domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of ssSCL-ST to the state-of-the-art approaches without using any parallel corpora.

AB Automating the translation between point cloud data and building information model (BIM) has been an interest of construction industry. Recently, with the development of novel scanning technologies, comparing the applicability of the point clouds produced by these technologies and investigating the potential of automatic workflow have become possible. Previous research has been devoted to investigating the methodology of point cloud segmentation and point cloud comparison. However, there has not been sufficient study into the workflow of implementing those methods and integrating them with available technologies. The aims of this study were to develop a semi-automatic workflow of converting point cloud data to Autodesk Revit BIM model, which represents the locations and the dimensions of key structural elements (e.g., ceiling, floor, and walls, etc.). While the traditional method is to use rule-based algorithm to complete classification, recent advancement in machine learning research has shown promising future in these areas. A hybrid approach that uses machine learning algorithm to perform transformation and deterministic algorithm to perform parameterization is proposed. We also developed a close-loop workflow based on existing BIM model to calibrate the segmentation and parametrization algorithm. The semi-automatic work represents a significant reduction in time consumed to produce the structural BIM representation. This innovative workflow shows a promising future of fully automatic workflow in the construction industry.

TI Iris Recognition Using Localized Zernike's Feature and SVM
SO INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Iris recognition is an approach that identifies people based on unique patterns within the region surrounding the pupil of the eye. Rotation, scale and translation invariant, are very important in image recognition. Some approaches of rotation invariant features have been introduced Zernike Moments (ZMs) are the most widely used family of orthogonal moments due to their extra property of being invariant to an arbitrary rotation of the images. These moment invariants have been successfully used in the pattern recognition. For designing a high accuracy recognition system, a new and accurate way for feature extraction is inevitable. In order to have an accurate algorithm, after image segmentation, ZMs were used for feature extraction. After feature extraction, a classifier is needed; Support Vector Machine (SVM) can serve as a good classifier. For the N-class problem in iris classification, SVM applies N two-class machines. Indeed, in this type of validation, data are divided into K subsets. At any given moment, one is for testing and the other one is exclusively for validation. This method is called K-fold cross validation (Leave one out) and each subset is considered as an original series. Simulation stage was accomplished with HT database and the comparison between of this method and some other methods, shows a high recognition rate of 98.61% on this database.

AB Magnetic resonance imaging is a leading image modality for many clinical applications; however, a significant drawback is the lengthy data acquisition. This motivates the development of methods for reconstruction of sparsely sampled image data. One such technique is the Variational Network (VN), a machine learning method that generalizes traditional iterative reconstruction techniques, learning the regularization term from large amounts of image data. Previously, with the VN technique, reconstruction of 4-fold accelerated knee images was shown to be highly successful. In this work we extend the VN approach to applications beyond knee imaging and evaluate the classic VN and a newly developed Unet-VN in 5 different anatomical regions. We evaluate the networks trained individually for each anatomical area as well as jointly trained with data from all anatomical areas. The VN and Unet-VN were trained to reconstruct 4-fold accelerated images of knees, brains, hips, ankles and shoulders. SSIM was calculated to quantitatively evaluate the reconstructed images. Results show that the Unet-VN outperforms the classic VN, both quantitatively - in terms of structural similarity - and qualitatively. The networks jointly trained with multi-anatomy data approach the performance of the individually trained networks and offer the simplicity of a single network for a range of clinical applications which has substantial benefit for clinical translation.

AB Hierarchy and compositionality are common latent properties in many natural and scientific image datasets. Determining when a deep network's hidden activations represent hierarchy and compositionality is important both for understanding deep representation learning and for applying deep networks in domains where interpretability is crucial. However, current benchmark machine learning datasets either have little hierarchical or compositional structure, or the structure is not known. This gap impedes precise analysis of a network's representations and thus hinders development of new methods that can learn such properties. To address this gap, we developed a new benchmark dataset with known hierarchical and compositional structure. The Hangul Fonts Dataset (HFD) is comprised of 35 fonts from the Korean writing system (Hangul), each with 11,172 blocks (syllables) composed from the product of initial, medial, and final glyphs. All blocks can be grouped into a few geometric types which induces a hierarchy across blocks. In addition, each block is composed of individual glyphs with rotations, translations, scalings, and naturalistic style variation across fonts. We find that both shallow and deep unsupervised methods show only modest evidence of hierarchy and compositionality in their representations of the HFD compared to supervised deep networks. Thus, HFD enables the identification of shortcomings in existing methods, a critical first step toward developing new machine learning algorithms to extract hierarchical and compositional structure in the context of naturalistic variability.

AB Virtual machine introspection (VMI) is one compelling technique to enhance system security in clouds. It is able to provide strong isolation between untrusted guests and security tools placed in guests, thereby enabling dependability of the security tools even if the guest has been compromised. Due to this benefit, VMI has been widely used for cloud security such as intrusion detection, security monitoring, and tampering forensics. However, existing VMI solutions suffer significant performance degradation mainly due to the high overhead upon frequent memory address translations and context-switches. This drawback limits its usage in many real-world scenarios, especially when fine-grained monitoring is desired. In this paper, we present ShadowMonitor, an effective VMI framework that enables efficient in-VM monitoring without imposing significant overhead. ShadowMonitor decomposes the whole monitoring system into two compartments and then assigns each compartment with isolated address space. By placing the monitored components in the protected compartment, ShadowMonitor guarantees the safety of both monitoring tools and guests. In addition, ShadowMonitor employs hardware-enforced instructions to design the gates across two compartments, thereby providing efficient switching between compartments. We have implemented ShadowMonitor on QEMU/KVM exploiting several hardware virtualization features. The experimental results show that ShadowMonitor could prevent several types of attacks and achieves 10x speedup over the existing method in terms of both event monitoring and overall application performance.

TI Machine learning-based patient specific prompt-gamma dose monitoring in
   proton therapy
SO PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
AB Online dose monitoring in proton therapy is currently being investigated with prompt-gamma (PG) devices. PG emission was shown to be correlated with dose deposition. This relationship is mostly unknown under real conditions. We propose a machine learning approach based on simulations to create optimized treatment-specific classifiers that detect discrepancies between planned and delivered dose. Simulations were performed with the Monte-Carlo platform Gate/Geant4 for a spot-scanning proton therapy treatment and a PG camera prototype currently under investigation. The method first builds a learning set of perturbed situations corresponding to a range of patient translation. This set is then used to train a combined classifier using distal falloff and registered correlation measures. Classifier performances were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves and maximum associated specificity and sensitivity. A leave-one-out study showed that it is possible to detect discrepancies of 5 mm with specificity and sensitivity of 85% whereas using only distal falloff decreases the sensitivity down to 77% on the same data set. The proposed method could help to evaluate performance and to optimize the design of PG monitoring devices. It is generic: other learning sets of deviations, other measures and other types of classifiers could be studied to potentially reach better performance. At the moment, the main limitation lies in the computation time needed to perform the simulations.
