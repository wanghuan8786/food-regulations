AB The very large machine tools now available for applications ranging from aerospace to composite material castings present a new set of challenges when trying to match the traditional machining accuracies of the mechanical workshop.
   An optical system for the automatic recalibration of the machine during the machining process has been developed. While conventional linear and rotary optical encoders are used to control axes positioning, and their resolution is already more than compliant with the needed accuracies, our optical system provides a further error signal during operation in order to compensate for structural deformations of axis and sliding parts. Those signals are used in order to reach a global positioning error vector under 50 microns on a 3-axis translation stage. The system has been installed on a test machine, with a total range on the 3-axis of 3, 1.6 and 1.2 meters. The device increases ranging measurement accuracy by decreasing the dependence of the position to the temperature variation and other deformations. To achieve such results, collimated diode lasers and 2D position-sensing devices have been installed to the machine. In order to provide signals which are least affected by electrical noise, transimpedance amplifiers and analog to digital converters have been integrated close to the detectors. The tests performed on the prototype demonstrate the capability of mapping the actual distance from the ideal linear translation with an error of 25 um along the full axis travel for a tracing capability of +/- 3.5 mm in both directions on each of the three detectors. This result is within the requirements of the end users, manufactures of travelling column type boring and milling machines.

AB Adversaries may look to steal or attack black-box NLP systems, either for financial gain or to exploit model errors. One setting of particular interest is machine translation (MT), where models have high commercial value and errors can be costly. We investigate possible exploitations of black-box MT systems and explore a preliminary defense against such threats. We first show that MT systems can be stolen by querying them with monolingual sentences and training models to imitate their outputs. Using simulated experiments, we demonstrate that MT model stealing is possible even when imitation models have different input data or architectures than their target models. Applying these ideas, we train imitation models that reach within 0.6 BLEU of three production MT systems on both high-resource and low-resource language pairs. We then leverage the similarity of our imitation models to transfer adversarial examples to the production systems. We use gradient-based attacks that expose inputs which lead to semanticallyincorrect translations, dropped content, and vulgar model outputs. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we propose a defense that modifies translation outputs in order to misdirect the optimization of imitation models. This defense degrades the adversary's BLEU score and attack success rate at some cost in the defender's BLEU and inference speed.

AB At AMTA-2002 we presented a deployed application of Machine Translation (MT) at Ford Motor Company in the domain of vehicle assembly process planning. This application uses an MT system developed by SYSTRAN to translate Ford's manufacturing process build instructions from English to Spanish, German, Dutch and Portuguese. Our MT system has already translated over 2 million instructions into these target languages and is an integral part of our manufacturing process planning to support Ford's assembly plants in Europe, Mexico and South America. A major component of the MT system development was the creation of a set of technical glossaries for the correct translation of automotive and Ford-specific terminology. Due to the dynamic nature of the automobile industry we need to keep these technical glossaries current as our terminology frequently changes due to the introduction of new manufacturing technologies, vehicles and vehicle features. In addition, our end-users need to be able to test and modify translations and see these results deployed in a timely manner. In this paper we will discuss the tools and business process that we have developed in conjunction with SYSTRAN in order to maintain and customize our MT system and improve its performance in the face of an ever-changing business environment.

First, software components can be derived form B abstract machines according to their relativity. Then, by using, proved translation rules the elicited software components are translated into code directlty. Finally, all the software components are assembled into a whole system with correct assembly rides. The trustworthiness of generated code is insured by the correctness of B abstract machines and the assembly strategies. Component based approach is used to ease complex verification among different B abstract machines and it also facilitates the software reuse.

TI THE IXM2 PARALLEL ASSOCIATIVE PROCESSOR FOR AI
SO COMPUTER
AB Although researchers have been studying associative memory and associative processing for 30 years, the importance of associative memories as SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) devices has not been sufficiently recognized.  Part of this is because large associative memories are difficult to develop, and the small associatiative memories available so far have allowed much less parallelism than needed to demonstrate effective SIMD processing on associative memories.
   The authors describe the IXM2 associative processor and its main application, speech-to-speech translation.  The IXM2 began as a faithful implementation of the NETL semantic network machine and grew into a massively parallel SIMD machine that demonstrates the power of large associative memories.
   The social implications of successful automatic translation are enormous.  Persons who speak different languages could communicate in real time by using interpreting telephony.
   This translation involves many computing operations because it requires such features as real-time response and a very large capacity for handling vocabulary.  The article focuses on memory-based models of speech-to-speech translation that view episodic memory as the foundation of intelligence.  This view naturally leads to implementing intelligent associative memories.  The authors first discuss the application as an illustration of associative processing and then shift to an exploration of the IXM2 itself, giving performance results.

SO BABEL-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE LA TRADUCTION-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF
   TRANSLATION
AB Anyone who learns a second language realizes that beyond phonology, morphology, syntax, and lexicon, there are variations of style between different tongues. One notable manifestation is word choice, particularly in writing. Writers may repeat vocabulary for efficiency and clarity, or they may choose synonyms to promote variety and creativity. When the latter practice is carried to extremes, it is known as elegant variation and is largely stigmatized in English, whereas such flexibility is widely valued among writers of Romance languages such as Spanish. While this phenomenon has been noted anecdotally, the present study explores it empirically. The main focus is journalistic prose in two U.S. and two Mexican newspapers, followed by a briefer examination of English and Spanish literature. Although elegant variation occurs in various word classes, this study centers on specific nouns and verbs. While the results demonstrating the vast difference between English and Spanish are interesting in their own right, there follows a discussion of their practical impact on translation, including the preservation of idiomaticity. This is especially relevant in light of the vastly improved capabilities of Google Translate, a development that calls for a reevaluation of the role of both humans and machines in the translation process.

TI Machine-learning based automatic assessment of communication in
   interpreting
SO FRONTIERS IN COMMUNICATION
AB Communication assessment in interpreting has developed into an area with new models and continues to receive growing attention in recent years. The process refers to the assessment of messages composed of both "verbal" and "nonverbal" signals. A few relevant studies revolving around automatic scoring investigated the assessment of fluency based on objective temporal measures, and the correlation between the machine translation metrics and human scores. There is no research exploring machine-learning-based automatic scoring in-depth integrating parameters of delivery and information. What remains fundamentally challenging to demonstrate is which parameters, extracted through an automatic methodology, predict more reliable results. This study presents an original study with the aim to propose and test a machine learning approach to automatically assess communication in English/Chinese interpreting. It proposes to build predictive models using machine learning algorithms, extracting parameters for delivery, and applying a translation quality estimation model for information assessment to describe the final model. It employs the K-nearest neighbour algorithm and support vector machine for further analysis. It is found that the best machine-learning model built with all features by Support Vector Machine shows an accuracy of 62.96%, which is better than the K-nearest neighbour model with an accuracy of 55.56%. The assessment results of the pass level can be accurately predicted, which indicates that the machine learning models are able to screen the interpretations that pass the exam. The study is the first to build supervised machine learning models integrating both delivery and fidelity features to predict quality of interpreting. The machine learning models point to the great potential of automatic scoring with little human evaluation involved in the process. Automatic assessment of communication is expected to complete multi-tasks within a brief period by taking both holistic and analytical approaches to assess accuracy, fidelity and delivery. The proposed automatic scoring system might facilitate human-machine collaboration in the future. It can generate instant feedback for students by evaluating input renditions or abridge the workload for educators in interpreting education by screening performance for subsequent human scoring.

AB The performance of embedded Java virtual machine can be improved by ahead-of-time compiler ( AOTC), which translates bytecode into machine code in the server and installs the machine code on the client device. Although AOTC is more advantageous than just-in-time compiler (JITC) due to its absence of the translation overhead, AOTC cannot be applicable to dynamically downloaded classes at runtime. This paper proposes client-AOTC (c-AOTC) which performs AOTC on the client device using the JITC module installed on the device, complementing the server-AOTC. The machine code of a method translated by JITC is cached on a persistent memory of the device, and when the method is invoked again in a later run of the program, the machine code is loaded and executed directly without the translation and interpretation overhead. One of major issues in c-AOTC is relocation because some of the addresses used by the cached machine code are not correct when the machine code is loaded and used in a different run; those addresses should be corrected before they are used. Constant pool resolution and inlining complicate the relocation problem and we propose our solutions. We developed a c-AOTC on Sun's CDC VM reference implementation ( RI) and our evaluation results indicate that cAOTC can improve the performance significantly, as much as an average of 12%. We also experiment with the issue of reducing the number of c-AOTC methods to be cached when the persistent space is tight, with a graceful degradation of performance.

TI MAKING ABSTRACT MACHINES LESS ABSTRACT
SO LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB We consider a class of abstract machines used for specifying the evaluation of intermediate-level programming languages, and demonstrate how various abstract aspects of these machines can be made concrete, providing for their direct implementation in a low-level microcoded architecture. We introduce the concept of stored programs and data to abstract machines. We demonstrate how machines that dynamically manipulate programs with abstract operations can be translated into machines that only need to read instructions from a fixed program. We show how familiar architectural features, such as a program counter, instruction register and a display can all be introduced very naturally into an abstract machine architecture once programs are represented as objects stored in memory. This translation lowers the level of the abstract machine, making it less abstract or, equivalently, more concrete. The resulting machines bear a close resemblance to a microcoded architecture in which the abstract machine instructions are defined in terms of a small set of micro-instructions that manipulate registers and memory. This work provides a further basis for the formal construction and implementation of abstract machines used for implementing programming languages. We demonstrate our results on an abstract machine that is a slight variant of the Categorical Abstract Machine.

TI Fine-tuning machine translation quality-rating scales for new digital
   genres: The case of user-generated content
SO ESTUDIOS DE LINGUISTICA-UNIVERSIDAD DE ALICANTE-ELUA
AB With the active participation of users in product review platforms, online consumer-generated content, and, more specifically, user-generated reviews, have become a clear reference in purchasing decision-making processes, which sometimes exceed the impact of advertising campaigns. A common feature of most tourism review platforms is the use of machine translation (MT) systems to immediately make reviews available to users in various languages. However, the quality of the MT output of these reviews varies greatly, primarily due to the subjective and unstructured nature of this digital genre. Different studies confirm that there are no universal quality rating scales. The assessment of MT output quality usually depends on factors such as the purpose of the text or the value given to the immediacy of the translation. New neural MT systems have been a revolution in the quality increase of the translated output; however, new lines of research are opening up to verify whether the quality of this new paradigm of MT can be assessed with the existing scales, mainly from previous rule-based systems and statistical translation, or whether it is necessary to develop new quality metrics specifically for these new intelligent systems. On the other hand, one of the questions that remain to be resolved in this new context of neural MT is whether the use of large amounts of textual data in the training of these systems is as effective as the use of less data but of higher quality and better-adjusted to the specialty and type of text for which it is used. Based on the hypothesis that each genre requires specific quality rating scales, this work identifies the error patterns and textual characteristics of online user reviews from a corpus-based approach analysis that will contribute to adapting quality rating scales to this specific digital genre.

TI Syntactically lexicalized phrase-based SMT
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Until quite recently, extending phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBSMT) with syntactic knowledge caused system performance to deteriorate. The most recent successful enrichments of PBSMT with hierarchical structure either employ nonlinguistically motivated syntax for capturing hierarchical reordering phenomena, or extend the phrase translation table with redundantly ambiguous syntactic structures over phrase pairs. In this paper, we present an extended, harmonized account of our previous work which showed that incorporating linguistically motivated lexical syntactic descriptions, called supertags, can yield significantly better PBSMT systems at insignificant extra computational cost. We describe a novel PBSMT model that integrates supertags into the target language model and the target side of the translation model. Two kinds of supertags are employed: those from lexicalized tree-adjoining grammar and combinatory categorial grammar. Despite the differences between the two sets of supertags, they give similar improvements. In addition to integrating the Markov supertagging approach in PBSMT, we explore the utility of a new surface grammaticality, measure based on combinatory operators. We perform various experiments on the Arabic-to-English NIST 2005 test set addressing the issues of sparseness, scalability, and the utility of system subcomponents. We show that even when the parallel training data grows very large, the supertagged system retains a relatively stable absolute performance advantage over the unadorned PBSMT system. Arguably, this hints at a performance gap that cannot be bridged by acquiring more phrase pairs. Our best result shows a relative improvement of 6.1% over a state-of-the-art PBSMT model, which compares favorably with the leading systems on the NIST 2005 task. We also demonstrate that the advantages of a supertag-based system carry over to German-English, where improvements of up to 8.9% relative to the baseline system are observed.

TI Improving the Rate of Translation of Tissue Engineering Products
SO ADVANCED HEALTHCARE MATERIALS
AB Over 100 000 research articles and 9000 patents have been published on tissue engineering (TE) in the past 20 years. Yet, very few TE products have made their way to the market during the same period. Experts have proposed a variety of strategies to address the lack of translation of TE products. However, since these proposals are guided by qualitative insights, they are limited in scope and impact. Machine learning is utilized in the current study to analyze the entire body of patents that have been published over the past twenty years and understand patenting trends, topics, areas of application, and exemplifications. This analysis yields surprising and little-known insights about the differences in research priorities and perceptions of innovativeness of tissue engineers in academia and industry, as well as aids to chart true advances in the field during the past twenty years. It is hoped that this analysis and subsequent proposal to improve translational rates of TE products will spur much needed dialogue about this important pursuit.

AB In this paper, we propose to extend the recently introduced model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm (MAML, Finn et al., 2017) for low-resource neural machine translation (NMT). We frame low-resource translation as a meta-learning problem, and we learn to adapt to low-resource languages based on multilingual high-resource language tasks. We use the universal lexical representation (Gu et al., 2018b) to overcome the input-output mismatch across different languages. We evaluate the proposed meta-learning strategy using eighteen European languages (Bg, Cs, Da, De, El, Es, Et, Fr, Hu, It, Lt, Nl, Pl, Pt, Sk, Sl, Sv and Ru) as source tasks and five diverse languages (Ro, Lv, Fi, Tr and Ko) as target tasks. We show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the multilingual, transfer learning based approach (Zoph et al., 2016) and enables us to train a competitive NMT system with only a fraction of training examples. For instance, the proposed approach can achieve as high as 22.04 BLEU on Romanian-English WMT'16 by seeing only 16,000 translated words (similar to 600 parallel sentences).

AB Fine-grained control of machine translation (MT) outputs along multiple attributes is critical for many modern MT applications and is a requirement for gaining users' trust. A standard approach for exerting control in MT is to prepend the input with a special tag to signal the desired output attribute. Despite its simplicity, attribute tagging has several drawbacks: continuous values must be binned into discrete categories, which is unnatural for certain applications; interference between multiple tags is poorly understood. We address these problems by introducing vector-valued interventions which allow for fine-grained control over multiple attributes simultaneously via a weighted linear combination of the corresponding vectors. For some attributes, our approach even allows for fine-tuning a model trained without annotations to support such interventions. In experiments with three attributes (length, politeness and monotonicity) and two language pairs (English to German and Japanese) our models achieve better control over a wider range of tasks compared to tagging, and translation quality does not degrade when no control is requested. Finally, we demonstrate how to enable control in an already trained model after a relatively cheap fine-tuning stage.

AB Machine translation systems achieve near human-level performance on some languages, yet their effectiveness strongly relies on the availability of large amounts of parallel sentences, which hinders their applicability to the majority of language pairs. This work investigates how to learn to translate when having access to only large monolingual corpora in each language. We propose two model variants, a neural and a phrase-based model. Both versions leverage a careful initialization of the parameters, the denoising effect of language models and automatic generation of parallel data by iterative back-translation. These models are significantly better than methods from the literature, while being simpler and having fewer hyper-parameters. On the widely used WMT'14 English-French and WMT'16 German-English benchmarks, our models respectively obtain 28.1 and 25.2 BLEU points without using a single parallel sentence, outperforming the state of the art by more than 11 BLEU points. On low-resource languages like English-Urdu and English-Romanian, our methods achieve even better results than semi-supervised and supervised approaches leveraging the paucity of available bitexts. Our code for NMT and PBSMT is publicly available.(1)

AB At Facebook, machine learning provides a wide range of capabilities that drive many aspects of user experience including ranking posts, content understanding, object detection and tracking for augmented and virtual reality, speech and text translations. While machine learning models are currently trained on customized data-center infrastructure, Facebook is working to bring machine learning inference to the edge. By doing so, user experience is improved with reduced latency (inference time) and becomes less dependent on network connectivity. Furthermore, this also enables many more applications of deep learning with important features only made available at the edge. This paper takes a data-driven approach to present the opportunities and design challenges faced by Facebook in order to enable machine learning inference locally on smartphones and other edge platforms.

AB Automated source code summarization is a popular software engineering research topic wherein machine translation models are employed to "translate" code snippets into relevant natural language descriptions. Most evaluations of such models are conducted using automatic reference-based metrics. However, given the relatively large semantic gap between programming languages and natural language, we argue that this line of research would benefit from a qualitative investigation into the various error modes of current state-of-the-art models. Therefore, in this work, we perform both a quantitative and qualitative comparison of three recently proposed source code summarization models. In our quantitative evaluation, we compare the models based on the smoothed BLEU-4, METEOR, and ROUGE-L machine translation metrics, and in our qualitative evaluation, we perform a manual open-coding of the most common errors committed by the models when compared to ground truth captions. Our investigation reveals new insights into the relationship between metric-based performance and model prediction errors grounded in an empirically derived error taxonomy that can be used to drive future research efforts.(1)

AB Large mobility datasets collected from various sources have allowed us to observe, analyze, predict and solve a wide range of important urban challenges. In particular, studies have generated place representations (or embeddings) from mobility patterns in a similar manner to word embeddings to better understand the functionality of different places within a city. However, studies have been limited to generating such representations of cities in an individual manner and has lacked an inter-city perspective, which has made it difficult to transfer the insights gained from the place representations across different cities. In this study, we attempt to bridge this research gap by treating cities and languages analogously. We apply methods developed for unsupervised machine language translation tasks to translate place representations across different cities. Real world mobility data collected from mobile phone users in 2 cities in Japan are used to test our place representation translation methods. Translated place representations are validated using landuse data, and results show that our methods were able to accurately translate place representations from one city to another.

AB The model checking problem is defined over Kripke structures. However, hardware designers often handle other models, such as Moore machines. When model checking their designs using CTL as a logic, they must translate them into Kripke structures. A given CTL property may be believed to be true (conversely false) over the Moore machine and in fact be false (conversely true) on the derived Kripke structure. This may lead to ambiguities if the designer does not fully understand the translation scheme he uses, which may be the case if he uses automatic tools. We present iCTL, a logic specifically designed to work with Moore machines, which extends CTL to help the designer removing possible ambiguities when model checking Moore machines. We show that it is strictly more expressive than CTL.

AB Approximations based on random Fourier features have recently emerged as an efficient and elegant methodology for designing large-scale kernel machines [4]. By expressing the kernel as a Fourier expansion, features are generated based on a finite set of random basis projections with inner products that are Monte Carlo approximations to the original kernel. However, the original Fourier features are only applicable to translation-invariant kernels and are not suitable for histograms that are always non-negative. This paper extends the concept of translation-invariance and the random Fourier feature methodology to arbitrary, locally compact Abelian groups. Based on empirical observations drawn from the exponentiated chi(2) kernel, the state-of-the-art for histogram descriptors, we propose a new group called the skewed-multiplicative group and design translation-invariant kernels on it. Experiments show that the proposed kernels outperform other kernels that can be similarly approximated. In a semantic segmentation experiment on the PASCAL VOC 2009 dataset, the approximation allows us to train large-scale learning machines more than two orders of magnitude faster than previous nonlinear SVMs.

AB By embedding the function of automatically correcting nearly free format English translations of given Japanese sentences, we have developed a new ILTS(intelligent language tutoring system) for improving English Writing Skills in a L2 tutoring environment. In addition to a diagnostic engine capable of identifying grammatical, lexical and word usage errors of students' input translations and returning error contingent feedback, we have developed a simple table look-up parser for displying the grammar trees. The table look-up parser parses a user input, which is always erronous, by simply matching the extended part-of-speech tag sequence of a closing sentence in a template of ILTS to the entries of a look-up-table, in which each extended part-of-speech tag array corresponds to one grammar tree. The complexity of the table look-up parser is O(n), where n denotes the length of a sentence. This shows a marked improvement over the general purpose parser of which the complexity is O(n(3)).

SO MARKETING LETTERS
AB Machine learning is bringing us self-driving cars, medical diagnoses, and language translation, but how can machine learning help marketers improve marketing decisions? Machine learning models predict extremely well, are scalable to "big data," and are a natural fit to analyze rich media content, such as text, images, audio, and video. Examples of current marketing applications include identification of customer needs from online data, accurate prediction of consumer response to advertising, personalized pricing, and product recommendations. But without the human input and insight-the soul-the applications of machine learning are limited. To create competitive or cooperative strategies, to generate creative product designs, to be accurate for "what-if" and "but-for" applications, to devise dynamic policies, to advance knowledge, to protect consumer privacy, and avoid algorithm bias, machine learning needs a soul. The brightest future is based on the synergy of what the machine can do well and what humans do well. We provide examples and predictions for the future.

TI Automatic Calibration Algorithm for English Text Translation Based on

SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB At present, the existing methods of English article flip calibration neglect to extract English semantic features, which leads to errors in English flip results and has a great impact on the accuracy and time consumption of translation sentence calibration. Therefore, a semantic feature-based automatic text flipping calibration algorithm is proposed. According to the features of semantic information in machine translation, a semantic grammar tree is constructed to complete the machine turning of English articles. The CARTdecision tree attribute is obtained, and the random forest method is introduced to extract the input matrix and output matrix of the corpus feature as samples to determine the spatial attribute feature of the mistranslated sentences. Choose 10000 English sentences about human body parts as the experimental object and design the simulation experiment. The experimental results show that the minimum and maximum accuracy rates are 95.4% and 100.0%, respectively. The proposed algorithm is time-consuming, and the KSMR value is lower than that of the traditional method. It is proved that the error rate of English article flipping is significantly reduced.

AB Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have provably enhanced the state-of-the-art Neural Machine Translation (NMT) with their capability in modeling complex functions and capturing complex linguistic structures. However NMT systems with deep architecture in their encoder or decoder RNNs often suffer from severe gradient diffusion due to the non-linear recurrent activations, which often make the optimization much more difficult. To address this problem we propose novel linear associative units (LAU) to reduce the gradient propagation length inside the recurrent unit. Different from conventional approaches (LSTM unit and GRU), LAUs utilizes linear associative connections between input and output of the recurrent unit, which allows unimpeded information flow through both space and time direction. The model is quite simple, but it is surprisingly effective. Our empirical study on Chinese-English translation shows that our model with proper configuration can improve by 11.7 BLEU upon Groundhog and the best reported results in the same setting. On WMT14 English-German task and a larger WMT14 English-French task, our model achieves comparable results with the state-of-the-art.

AB Almost all existing machine translation models are built on top of character-based vocabularies: characters, subwords or words. Rare characters from noisy text or character-rich languages such as Japanese and Chinese however can unnecessarily take up vocabulary slots and limit its compactness. Representing text at the level of bytes and using the 256 byte set as vocabulary is a potential solution to this issue. High computational cost has however prevented it from being widely deployed or used in practice. In this paper, we investigate byte-level subwords, specifically byte-level BPE (BBPE), which is compacter than character vocabulary and has no out-of-vocabulary tokens, but is more efficient than using pure bytes only is. We claim that contextualizing BBPE embeddings is necessary, which can be implemented by a convolutional or recurrent layer. Our experiments show that BBPE has comparable performance to BPE while its size is only 1/8 of that for BPE. In the multilingual setting, BBPE maximizes vocabulary sharing across many languages and achieves better translation quality. Moreover, we show that BBPE enables transferring models between languages with non-overlapping character sets.

AB Learning target side syntactic structure has been shown to improve Neural Machine Translation (NMT). However, incorporating syntax through latent variables introduces additional complexity in inference, as the models need to marginalize over the latent syntactic structures. To avoid this, models often resort to greedy search which only allows them to explore a limited portion of the latent space.
   In this work, we introduce a new latent variable model, LaSyn, that captures the codependence between syntax and semantics, while allowing for effective and efficient inference over the latent space. LaSyn decouples direct dependence between successive latent variables, which allows its decoder to exhaustively search through the latent syntactic choices, while keeping decoding speed proportional to the size of the latent variable vocabulary. We implement LaSyn by modifying a transformer-based NMT system and design a neural expectation maximization algorithm that we regularize with part-of-speech information as the latent sequences. Evaluations on four different MT tasks show that incorporating target side syntax with LaSyn improves both translation quality, and also provides an opportunity to improve diversity.

Approximately 240,000 documents were collected and aligned using the Hunalign tool. We demonstrate the capability of our developed corpus by training Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) and Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models for both language directions, followed by a comparison with Google Translate (GT). Both translation models presented better BLEU scores than GT, with NMT system being the most accurate one. Sentence alignment was also manually evaluated, presenting an average of 82.30% correctly aligned sentences. Our parallel corpus is freely available in TMX format, with complementary information regarding document metadata.

AB Word alignment is the most important part of the statistical machine translation system. The translation model and the ordinal model in statistical machine translation are constructed on the basis of word alignment results, and the errors in the word alignment stage will continue to these models. In the model, even larger mistakes may be caused in these models due to word alignment errors. The research of word alignment technology provides basic construction for corpus construction, speech recognition, bilingual dictionary compilation and information retrieval in the field of natural language processing. However, the research on word alignment technology in Chinese-Uighur is relatively late. We mainly study the alignment of Chinese and Uighur words based on the sentence level and apply the bilingual corpus filtering method based on the degree of alignment perplexity to the alignment of Chinese-Uighur words. The experimental results show that the method is feasible and has achieved the expected results in the primary stage, and the method provides a certain basis for the follow-up research of word alignment techniques.

AB We describe the design of an autonomous agent that can teach itself how to translate from a foreign language, by first assembling its own training set, then using it to improve its vocabulary and language model. The key idea is that a Statistical Machine Translation package can be used for the Cross-Language Retrieval Task of assembling a training set from a vast amount of available text (e.g. a large multilingual corpus, or the Web) and then train on that data, repeating that process several times. The stability issues related to such a feedback loop are addressed by a mathematical model, connecting statistical and control-theoretic aspects of the system. We test it on real-world tasks, showing that indeed this agent can improve its translation performance autonomously and in a stable fashion, when seeded with a very small initial training set. The modelling approach we develop for this agent is general, and we believe will be useful for an entire class of self-learning autonomous agents working on the Web.

TI Improving Non-Autoregressive Machine Translation Using Sentence-Level
   Semantic Agreement
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Theinference stage can be accelerated significantly using a Non-Autoregressive Transformer (NAT). However, the training objective used in the NAT model also aims to minimize the loss between the generated words and the golden words in the reference. Since the dependencies between the target words are lacking, this training objective computed at word level can easily cause semantic inconsistency between the generated and source sentences. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new method, Sentence-Level Semantic Agreement (SLSA), to obtain consistency between the source and generated sentences. Specifically, we utilize contrastive learning to pull the sentence representations of the source and generated sentences closer together. In addition, to strengthen the capability of the encoder, we also integrate an agreement module into the encoder to obtain a better representation of the source sentence. The experiments are conducted on three translation datasets: the WMT 2014 EN -> DE task, the WMT 2016 EN -> RO task, and the IWSLT 2014 DE -> DE task, and the improvement in the NAT model's performance shows the effect of our proposed method.

TI Sign Language Avatars: A Question of Representation
SO INFORMATION
AB Given the achievements in automatically translating text from one language to another, one would expect to see similar advancements in translating between signed and spoken languages. However, progress in this effort has lagged in comparison. Typically, machine translation consists of processing text from one language to produce text in another. Because signed languages have no generally-accepted written form, translating spoken to signed language requires the additional step of displaying the language visually as animation through the use of a three-dimensional (3D) virtual human commonly known as an avatar. Researchers have been grappling with this problem for over twenty years, and it is still an open question. With the goal of developing a deeper understanding of the challenges posed by this question, this article gives a summary overview of the unique aspects of signed languages, briefly surveys the technology underlying avatars and performs an in-depth analysis of the features in a textual representation for avatar display. It concludes with a comparison of these features and makes observations about future research directions.

AB Vision-and-language pre-training has achieved impressive success in learning multimodal representations between vision and language. To generalize this success to non-English languages, we introduce UC2, the first machine translation-augmented framework for cross-lingual cross-modal representation learning. To tackle the scarcity problem of multilingual captions for image datasets, we first augment existing English-only datasets with other languages via machine translation (MT). Then we extend the standard Masked Language Modeling and Image-Text Matching training objectives to multilingual setting, where alignment between different languages is captured through shared visual context (i.e., using image as pivot). To facilitate the learning of a joint embedding space of images and all languages of interest, we further propose two novel pre-training tasks, namely Masked Region-to-Token Modeling (MRTM) and Visual Translation Language Modeling (VTLM), leveraging MT-enhanced translated data. Evaluation on multilingual image-text retrieval and multilingual visual question answering benchmarks demonstrates that our proposed framework achieves new state of the art on diverse non-English benchmarks while maintaining comparable performance to monolingual pre-trained models on English tasks.

AB This paper presents a novel method of phrasetable construction based on topicmodel. Firstly, latent Dirichlet allocation model is adopted for text corpora to generate the distribution of words in different documents of different topics. Then phrase pairs are extracted according to some rules and constraints. Finally, phrasetable with semantic information of.topics are generated based on previous steps. This kind of phrasetable has obvious semantic hierarchy. During decoding, the topic of source translation unit should be determined at first, then the final candidate for source phrase with multiple target phrases could be selected as a priority if its topic is identical with the source unit; this method could enhance the efficiency and quality of translation.

TI Squibs and discussions - Decoding complexity in word-replacement
   translation models
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Statistical machine translation is a relatively new approach to the long-standing problem of translating human languages by computer. Current statistical techniques uncover translation rules from bilingual training texts and use those rules to translate new tests. The general architecture is the source-channel model: an English string is statistically generated (source), then statistically transformed into French (channel). In order to translate (or "decode") a French string, we look for the most likely English source. We show that for the simplest form of statistical models, this problem is NP-complete, i.e., probably exponential in the length of the observed sentence. We trace this complexity to factors not present in other decoding problems.

The linguistic were obtained from 160 Malaysian Facebook users with an extracted textual data derived from 12573 wall-posted statuses. The jury method is used to assign each word to its correct category by comparing the direct translation of the word in Malay versus the English word in the English psychometric dictionary. LIWC classifies words by categories thus assigning the correct ones to the most precise translations and usage are essential. The work successfully categorized 2820 Malay words from the Malaysian Facebook statuses. This methodological note declares the creation of the Malay language version of the LIWC and the exemplary application of the dictionary in classifying personality of extraversion of the Malaysian Facebook users. The constructed Malay LIWC dictionary can be applied to any natural language processing framework or machine learning area that focuses on mining the Malay text language.

AB A neural machine translation (NMT) system is expensive to train, especially with high-resource settings. As the NMT architectures become deeper and wider, this issue gets worse and worse. In this paper, we aim to improve the efficiency of training an NMT by introducing a novel norm-based curriculum learning method. We use the norm (aka length or module) of a word embedding as a measure of 1) the difficulty of the sentence, 2) the competence of the model, and 3) the weight of the sentence. The norm-based sentence difficulty takes the advantages of both linguistically motivated and model-based sentence difficulties. It is easy to determine and contains learning-dependent features. The norm-based model competence makes NMT learn the curriculum in a fully automated way, while the norm-based sentence weight further enhances the learning of the vector representation of the NMT. Experimental results for the WMT'14 English-German and WMT'17 Chinese-English translation tasks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines in terms of BLEU score (+1.17/+1.56) and training speedup (2.22x/3.33x).

AB For machine translation, a vast majority of language pairs in the world are considered low-resource because they have little parallel data available. Besides the technical challenges of learning with limited supervision, it is difficult to evaluate methods trained on low-resource language pairs because of the lack of freely and publicly available benchmarks. In this work, we introduce the FLORES evaluation datasets for Nepali-English and SinhalaEnglish, based on sentences translated from Wikipedia. Compared to English, these are languages with very different morphology and syntax, for which little out-of-domain parallel data is available and for which relatively large amounts of monolingual data are freely available. We describe our process to collect and cross-check the quality of translations, and we report baseline performance using several learning settings: fully supervised, weakly supervised, semi-supervised, and fully unsupervised. Our experiments demonstrate that current state-of-the-art methods perform rather poorly on this benchmark, posing a challenge to the research community working on low-resource MT.

AB Performance of n-gram language models depends to a large extent on the amount of training text material available for building the models and the degree to which this text matches the domain of interest. The language modeling community is showing a growing interest in using large collections of auxiliary textual material to supplement sparse in-domain resources. One of the problems in using such auxiliary corpora is that they may differ significantly from the specific nature of the domain of interest. In this paper, we propose three different methods for adapting language models for a Speech to Speech (S2S) translation system when auxiliary corpora are of different genre and domain. The proposed methods are based on centroid similarity, n-gram ratios and resampled language models. We show how these methods can be used to select out of domain textual data such as newswire text to improve a S2S system. We were able to achieve an overall relative improvement of 3.8% in BLEU score over a baseline system that uses only in-domain conversational data.

TI Complexity of European Union languages: A comparative approach
SO JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE LINGUISTICS
AB In this article, we are studying the differences between the European Union languages using statistical and unsupervised methods. The analysis is conducted in the different levels of language: the lexical, morphological and syntactic. Our premise is that the difficulty of the translation could be perceived as differences or similarities in different levels of language. The results are compared to linguistic groupings. Two approaches are selected for the analysis. A Kolmogorov complexity-based approach is used to compare the language structure in syntactic and morphological levels. A morpheme-level comparison is conducted based on an automated segmentation of the languages into morpheme-like units. The way the languages convey information in these levels is taken as a measure of similarity or dissimilarity between languages and the results are compared to classical linguistic classifications. The results have a significant impact on the design of (statistical) machine translation systems. If the source language conveys information in the morphological level and the target language in the syntactic level, it is clear that the machine translation system must be able to transfer the information from one level to another.

   signature in Escherichia coli selects for inactivation of the ClpXP
   protease
SO MOLECULAR GENETICS AND GENOMICS
AB Trans-translation is a process that adds a hydrophobic peptide tag to the C-terminus of polypeptides, which causes them to become unstable. We designed a genetic screen to identify factors involved in the degradation of trans-translated products, using the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the transtranslation tag as a reporter. Two screens were devised to identify insertional mutants that stabilize such substrates. Only disruption of the clpX or clpP gene resulted in stabilization of the tagged substrates. The sspB gene product was recently shown to be a specificity-enhancing factor for the ClpXP degradation machine. In the wildtype background, targeted inactivation of the sspB gene failed to stabilize the tagged substrate. These results indicate that the ATP-dependent ClpXP protease is probably the only main component involved in the degradation of cytoplasmic trans-translated proteins in Escherichia coli that can be completely inactivated.

AB Bilingual word alignment is to find the corresponding word-level translation between the source and the target language sentences. It is widely used in the area of natural language processing, like machine translation, cross-language information retrieval, bilingual dictionary compilation. However, bilingual word alignment is a very difficult task involving many challenges such as morphology, syntax, semantics, human translation habits, and the inherent difference between English and Chinese. In this paper, a new algorithm is proposed By adopting a multilayered matching and disambiguation strategy, the bilingual word-alignment task is transformed to an iterative solution of anchor word-pair. The positive experimental results of 93.5% precision, 77.3% recall, and 84.2% F-score show the algorithm's effectiveness.

AB Pre-training and fine-tuning have become the de facto paradigm in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, compared to other NLP tasks, neural machine translation (NMT) aims to generate target language sentences through the contextual representation from the source language counterparts. This characteristic means the optimization objective of NMT is far from that of the universal pre-trained models (PTMs), leading to the standard procedure of pretraining and fine-tuning does not work well in NMT. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to deep fuse the pretrained representation into NMT, fully exploring the potential of PTMs in NMT. Specifically, we directly replace the randomly initialized Transformer encoder with a pre-trained encoder and propose a layer-wise coordination structure to coordinate PTM and NMT decoder learning. Then, we introduce a partitioned multi-task learning method to fine-tune the pretrained parameter, reducing the gap between PTM and NMT by progressively learning the task-specific representation. Experimental results show that our approach achieves considerable improvements on WMT14 En2De, WMT14 En2Fr, and WMT16 Ro2En translation benchmarks and outperforms previous work in both autoregressive and non-autoregressive NMT models.

AB In machine translation, document alignment refers to finding correspondences between documents which are exact translations of each other. We define pseudo-alignment as the task of finding topical-as opposed to exact-correspondences between documents in different languages. We apply semisupervised methods to pseudo-align multilingual corpora. Specifically, we construct a topic-based graph for each language. Then, given exact correspondences between a subset of documents, we project the unaligned documents into a shared lower-dimensional space. We demonstrate that close documents in this lower-dimensional space tend to share the same topic. This has applications in machine translation and cross-lingual information analysis. Experimental results show that pseudo-alignment of multilingual corpora is feasible and that the document alignments produced are qualitatively sound. Our technique requires no linguistic knowledge of the corpus. On average when 10% of the corpus consists of exact correspondences, an on-topic correspondence occurs within the top 5 foreign neighbors in the lower-dimensional space while the exact correspondence occurs within the top 10 foreign neighbors in this this space. We also show how to substantially improve these results with a novel method for incorporating language-independent information.

AB Word alignment and machine translation are two closely related tasks. Neural translation models, such as RNN-based and Transformer models, employ a target-to-source attention mechanism which can provide rough word alignments, but with a rather low accuracy. High-quality word alignment can help neural machine translation in many different ways, such as missing word detection, annotation transfer and lexicon injection. Existing methods for learning word alignment include statistical word aligners (e.g. GIZA++) and recently neural word alignment models. This paper presents a bidirectional Transformer based alignment (BTBA) model for unsupervised learning of the word alignment task. Our BTBA model predicts the current target word by attending the source context and both leftside and right-side target context to produce accurate target-to-source attention (alignment). We further fine-tune the target-to-source attention in the BTBA model to obtain better alignments using a full context based optimization method and self-supervised training. We test our method on three word alignment tasks and show that our method outperforms both previous neural word alignment approaches and the popular statistical word aligner GIZA++.

TI The Mizar Mathematical Library in OMDoc: Translation and Applications
SO JOURNAL OF AUTOMATED REASONING
AB The Mizar Mathematical Library is one of the largest libraries of formalized and mechanically verified mathematics. Its language is highly optimized for authoring by humans. As in natural languages, the meaning of an expression is influenced by its (mathematical) context in a way that is natural to humans, but harder to specify for machine manipulation. Thus its custom file format can make the access to the library difficult. Indeed, the Mizar system itself is currently the only system that can fully operate on the Mizar library. This paper presents a translation of the Mizar library into the OMDoc format (Open Mathematical Documents), an XML-based representation format for mathematical knowledge. OMDoc is geared towards machine support and interoperability by making formula structure and context dependencies explicit. Thus, the Mizar library becomes accessible for a wide range of OMDoc-based tools for formal mathematics and knowledge management. We exemplify interoperability by indexing the translated library in the MathWebSearch engine, which provides an "applicable theorem search" service (almost) out of the box.

TI MACHINE PROCESSING OF A NATURAL-LANGUAGE WITH INTERCHANGEABLE PHRASES
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Machine processing of natural languages has been a difficult problem in the intelligent systems research area for the last four decades. Early approaches to machine processing of natural languages failed, partly because of interaction effects of complex phenomena that made the machine process appear to be unmanageable. Recent approaches to the problem have been more successful but are limited on many language-specific rules related to rigid word order of the languages. Many machine processing systems depend heavily on the language-specific rigid word order. The problem addressed in this paper is the construction of a machine processing system relying on language-specific imprecise computations. This paper presents an alternative approach to machine processing of natural languages. The system relies on interchangeable phrases and flexible word order. The application of imprecise computation for machine translation problems is approached by examining Sinhalese. The design and implementation of the system are described and illustrated with detailed examples of overall system operation.

AB We address the problem of automatically cleaning a large-scale Translation Memory (TM) in a fully unsupervised fashion, i.e. without human-labelled data. We approach the task by: i) designing a set of features that capture the similarity between two text segments in different languages, ii) use them to induce reliable training labels for a subset of the translation units (TUs) contained in the TM, and iii) use the automatically labelled data to train an ensemble of binary classifiers. We apply our method to clean a test set composed of 1,000 TUs randomly extracted from the English-Italian version of MyMemory, the world's largest public TM. Our results show competitive performance not only against a strong baseline that exploits machine translation, but also against a state-of-the-art method that relies on human-labelled data.

AB Machine Translation (MT), the way of translating texts or documents from a source language to a target language automatically without human intervention, has gained popularity in the growing information technology-based era of globalization. Bangla is a major language, and several MT studies with different tools and techniques have been investigated in the last two decades. Considering the importance of the Bangla language and its prospects in MT studies, this study provides a comprehensive review of existing Bangla MT studies to meet the timely demand. Specifically, at first, the basic ideas of different MT methods (Rule-based, Example-based, Statistical, Neural, and Hybrid) and performance measures of MT are presented as a background study of the present review. Then an overview of the Bangla language and a brief description of the available Bangla-English corpora are provided. Next, a description of the existing Bangla MT studies is provided categorically following the common strategic fashion to create a valuable reference for current researchers in the field that is also suitable for non-expert users. The achieved performances of individual methods are also compared in a tabular form. Finally, a number of future research prospects are revealed from the studies, encouraging researchers and practitioners to develop a better and comprehensive Bangla MT system.

TI Dancing with technology: translators' narratives on the dance of human
   and machinic agency in translation work
SO TRANSLATOR
AB This article examines translators' emotional narratives of their interaction with technology, focusing on how translators describe the machine's actions and agency as either diverging from or converging with their own, and whether this is experienced as positive or negative. The material comes from an exploratory project where the respondents were asked to write a short love letter/break-up letter' to a tool, application or aspect of work. Of the collected 106 letters dealing with technology, 61 assigned agency to technology; the relatively low number suggests that humans may be reluctant to consider the machine an agent. Expectedly, machinic agency is mostly viewed in a positive light in the letters reporting a convergence with that of the human user and, conversely, diverging agency is typically considered negative. However, letters deviating from this pattern suggest that the dance of agency between the human and the machine can be viewed in more complex terms. For example, a tool can do something unexpected but rewarding or change the human user in a positive way - or be too accommodating or passive when the user would wish for a more active partner. Further research from a non-anthropocentric perspective should provide relevant insights into translator-computer interaction.

We use a unified transformer architecture for our MultiST model, so that the data from different modalities (i.e., speech and text) and different tasks (i.e., Speech Recognition, Machine Translation, and Speech Translation) can be exploited to enhance the model's ability. Specifically, speech and text inputs are firstly fed to different feature extractors to extract acoustic and textual features, respectively. Then, these features are processed by a shared encoder-decoder architecture. We apply several training techniques to improve the performance, including multi-task learning, task-level curriculum learning, data augmentation, etc. Our final system achieves significantly better results than bilingual baselines on supervised language pairs and yields reasonable results on zero-shot language pairs.

TI EDA: An evolutionary decoding algorithm for statistical machine
   translation
SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB In a statistical machine translation system ( SMTS), decoding is the process of finding the most likely translation based on a statistical model, according to previously learned parameters. The success of an SMTS is strongly dependent on the quality of its decoder. Most of the SMTS's published in current literature use approaches based on traditional optimization methods and heuristics. On the other hand, over the last few years there has been a rapid increase in the use of metaheuristics. These kinds of techniques have shown to be able to solve difficult search problems in an efficient way for a wide number of applications.
   This paper proposes a new approach based on evolutionary hybrid algorithms to translate sentences in a specific technical context. The algorithm has been enhanced by adaptive parameter control. The tests are carried out in the context of Spanish and then translated to English.
   The experimental results validate the superior performance of our method in contrast to a statistical greedy decoder. We also compare our new approach to the existing public domain general translators.

Our proposed system employs soft alignment of word-region for multimodal neural machine translation (MNMT). The experimental results evaluated on the BLEU metric provided by the WAT 2021 evaluation site show that the TMEKU system has achieved the best performance among all the participated systems. Further analysis of the case study demonstrates that leveraging word-region alignment between the textual and visual modalities is the key to performance enhancement in our TMEKU system, which leads to better visual information use.

AB Any natural language is regarded as a representation of semantic language. The translation between two languages (I, J) is regarded as a transformation between two representations. A natural language-I is translated into another natural language-J only by two steps. One is semantic-analysis of language-I based on "semantic-element-representation-base of language-I", the other is deploying into the representation of language-J based on "semantic-element-representation-base of language-J". For translating in N natural languages, it is needed to develop N translation systems only, rather than (N(N-1))/(2), or 2N systems.

AB Generating machine translations via beam search seeks the most likely output under a model. However, beam search has been shown to amplify demographic biases exhibited by a model. We aim to address this, focusing on gender bias resulting from systematic errors in grammatical gender translation. Almost all prior work on this problem adjusts the training data or the model itself. By contrast, our approach changes only the inference procedure.
   We constrain beam search to improve gender diversity in n-best lists, and rerank n-best lists using gender features obtained from the source sentence. Combining these strongly improves WinoMT gender translation accuracy for three language pairs without additional bilingual data or retraining. We also demonstrate our approach's utility for consistently gendering named entities, and its flexibility to handle new gendered language beyond the binary.

With the aim to foster research into massive multilingual ST and ST for low resource languages, we release CoVoST 2, a large-scale multilingual ST corpus covering translations from 21 languages into English and from English into 15 languages. This represents the largest open dataset available to date for volume and language coverage. Data checks provide evidence about the data quality. We provide extensive speech recognition (ASR), machine translation (MT) and ST baselines. We demonstrate the value of CoVoST 2 for multilingual ST research by leveraging it in 4 investigations: simplify multilingual training by removing ASR pretraining, study multilingual model scaling properties and investigate zero-shot and transfer learning capabilities of models trained on CoVoST 2.

We take the approach of statistical machine translation (SMT) to "translate" from ASR results into transcript-style text. We introduce two novel modeling techniques in this framework: a context-dependent translation model, which allows for usage of context to accurately model translation probabilities, and log-linear interpolation of conditional and joint probabilities, which allows for frequently observed translation patterns to be given higher priority. The system is implemented using weighted finite state transducers (WFST). On an evaluation using ASR results and manual transcripts of meetings of the Japanese Diet (national congress), the proposed methods showed a significant increase in accuracy over traditional modeling techniques.

SO COMPUTER ASSISTED LANGUAGE LEARNING
AB With a significant number of students using machine translation (MT) for academic purposes in recent years, language teachers can no longer ignore it in their classrooms. Although an increasing number of studies have reported its pedagogical benefits, studies have also revealed that language teachers are still sceptical about using MT for various reasons. Most of all, they have limited trust in MT quality and the effectiveness of using MT in foreign language (FL) learning. Hence, the current study examined these issues to provide an overview and a guide to language teachers regarding the use of MT in FL education. The study examined 87 MT studies related to FL education published between 2000 and 2019. It employed both systematic review (primary) and meta-analysis (secondary) as research methods for a robust data analysis. The results showed that the number of publications in this area has increased in recent years and that MT quality has been significantly enhanced. Most studies also reported the positive impacts of using MT in FL learning, particularly for writing. However, this study also found that students had mixed emotions about MT and that there are disparities in perceptions between instructors and students. Based on the results, the present study presents several pedagogical implications and suggestions for future research on MT.

AB As systems that deploy machine learning models become more and more pervasive, there is an urgent need to ensure their reliability and safety. While recent years have seen a lot of progress in techniques for verification and validation of machine learning models, reasoning about and explaining their behaviors remains challenging. This paper introduces a new approach for creating machine learning models where instead of the traditional supervised learning using data, the models are directly synthesized from specifications, and thus, are correct by construction. Our focus is binary classifiers with boolean features. Specifically, our approach translates relational specifications written in the well-known modeling language Alloy to neural networks that run on the widely used Tensorflow backend. Our key insight is that a slight enhancement of traditional boolean gates can provide a rich intermediate representation that readily translates to neural networks. To translate the enhanced gates to neural networks, we employ a state-of-the-art program synthesis framework that allows us to find minimal neural networks. The translation of Alloy specifications then follows the standard translation to boolean logic with the exception of utilizing the enhanced boolean gates, followed by a translation to neural networks. We embody our approach in a prototype tool and use it for experimental evaluation. The experimental results show that our approach allows synthesis of neural networks that are hard to create using traditional training methods.

TI Grammatical and context-sensitive error correction using a statistical
   machine translation framework
SO SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB Producing electronic rather than paper documents has considerable benefits such as easier organizing and data management. Therefore, existence of automatic writing assistance tools such as spell and grammar checker/correctors can increase the quality of electronic texts by removing noise and correcting the erroneous sentences. Different kinds of errors in a text can be categorized into spelling, grammatical and real-word errors. In this article, we present a language-independent approach based on a statistical machine translation framework to develop a proofreading tool, which detects grammatical errors as well as context-sensitive spelling mistakes (real-word errors). A hybrid model for grammar checking is suggested by combining the mentioned approach with an existing rule-based grammar checker. Experimental results on both English and Persian languages indicate that the proposed statistical method and the rule-based grammar checker are complementary in detecting and correcting syntactic errors. The results of the hybrid grammar checker, applied to some English texts, show an improvement of about 24% with respect to the recall metric with almost similar value for precision. Experiments on real-world data set show that state-of-the-art results are achieved for grammar checking and context-sensitive spell checking for Persian language.

AB The problem of unknown words in neural machine translation (NMT), which not only affects the semantic integrity of the source sentences but also adversely affects the generating of the target sentences. The traditional methods usually replace the unknown words according to the similarity of word vectors, these approaches are difficult to deal with rare words and polysemous words. Therefore, this paper proposes a new method of unknown words processing in NMT based on the semantic concept of the source language. Firstly, we use the semantic concept of source language semantic dictionary to find the candidate in-vocabulary words. Secondly, we propose a method to calculate the semantic similarity by integrating the source language model and the semantic concept network, to obtain the best replacement word. Experiments on English to Chinese translation task demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve more than 2.6 BLEU points over the conventional NMT method. Compared with the traditional method based on word vector similarity, our method can also obtain an improvement by nearly 0.8 BLEU points.

AB Multi-task learning with an unbalanced data distribution skews learning towards high resource tasks, especially when model capacity is fixed and fully shared across all tasks. Sparse scaling architectures, such as BASE-Layers, provide flexible mechanisms for tasks to have a variable number of parameters, which can be useful to counterbalance skewed data distributions. However, we find that that BASELayers sparse model for multilingual machine translation can perform poorly out of the box, and propose two straightforward techniques to mitigate this - a temperature heating mechanism and dense pre-training. Overall, these methods improve performance on two multilingual translation benchmarks compared to standard BASELayers and dense scaling baselines, and in combination, more than 2x model convergence speed.

TI Alignment-consistent recursive neural networks for bilingual phrase
   embeddings
SO KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS
AB Learning semantic representations of bilingual phrases is very important for statistical machine translation to overcome data sparsity and exploit semantic information. In this paper, we consider word alignments as a semantic bridge between the source and target phrases, and propose two neural networks based on the conventional recursive autocoder, which exploit word alignments to generate alignment-consistent bilingual phrase structures: One is Alignment Enhanced Recursive Autoencoder that incorporates a word-alignment-related error into the final objective function; The other is Alignment Guided Recursive Neural Network which treats word alignments as direct signals to guide phrase structure constructions. Then, we further establish the semantic correspondences between the source and target nodes of the generated bilingual phrase structures via word alignments. By jointly minimizing recursive autoencoder reconstruction errors, structural alignment consistency errors and cross-lingual reconstruction errors, our model not only generates alignment-consistent phrase structures, but also captures different levels of semantic correspondences within bilingual phrases. Experiments on the NIST Chinese-English translation task show that our model achieves significant improvements over the baseline.

TI Exploiting Inactive Examples for Natural Language Generation With Data
   Rejuvenation
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Recent years have witnessed the success of natural language generation (NLG) accomplished by deep neural networks, which require a large amount of training data for optimization. With the constant increase of data scale, the complex patterns and potential noises make training NLG models difficult. In order to fully utilize large-scale training data, we explore inactive examples in the training data and propose to rejuvenate the inactive examples for improving the performance of NLG models. Specifically, we define inactive examples as those sentence pairs that contribute less to the performance of NLG models, and show that their existence is independent of model variants but mainly determined by the data distribution. We further introduce data rejuvenation to improve the training of NLG models by re-labeling the inactive examples. The rejuvenated examples and active examples are combined to train a final NLG model. We evaluate our approach by experiments on machine translation (MT) and text summarization (TS) tasks, and achieve significant improvements of performance. Extensive analyses reveal that inactive examples are more difficult to learn than active ones and rejuvenation can reduce the learning difficulty, which stabilizes and accelerates the training process of NLG models and results in models with better generalization capability.

Our framework leverages recent breakthroughs in cross-lingual pretrained language modeling resulting in highly multilingual and adaptable MT evaluation models that exploit information from both the source input and a target-language reference translation in order to more accurately predict MT quality. To showcase our framework, we train three models with different types of human judgements: Direct Assessments, Human-mediated Translation Edit Rate and Multidimensional Quality Metrics. Our models achieve new state-ofthe-art performance on the WMT 2019 Metrics shared task and demonstrate robustness to high-performing systems.

AB In this paper, we explore several methods of improving the estimation of translation model probabilities for phrase-based statistical machine translation given in-domain data sparsity. We introduce a hierarchical variant of maximum a posteriori (MAP) adaptation for domain adaptation with an arbitrary number of out-of-domain models. We note that domain adaptation can have a smoothing effect, and we explore the interaction between smoothing and the incorporation of out-of-domain data. We find that the relative contributions of smoothing and interpolation depend on the datasets used. For both the IWSLT 2011 and WMT 2011 English-French datasets, the MAP adaptation method we present improves on a baseline system by 1.5+ BLEU points.

TI Constraining a Generative Word Alignment Model with Discriminative
   Output
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB We present a method to constrain a statistical generative word alignment model with the output from a discriminative model. The discriminative model is trained using a small set of hand-aligned data that ensures higher precision in alignment. On the other hand, the generative model improves the recall of alignment. By combining these two models, the alignment output becomes more suitable for use in developing a translation model for a phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) system. Our experimental results show that the joint alignment model improves the translation performance. The improvement in average of BLEU and METEOR scores is around 1.0-3.9 points.

AB It has been observed that humans can translate nearly four times as quickly with little loss in accuracy simply by dictating, as opposed to typing, their translations.  In this paper, we consider the integration of speech recognition into a translator's workstation.  In particular, we show how to combine statistical models of speech, language and translation into a single system that decodes a sequence of words in a target language from a sequence of words in a source language together with an utterance of the target language sequence.  Results are provided which demonstrate that the difficulty of the speech recognition task can be reduced by making use of information contained in the source text being translated.

AB Online alignment in machine translation refers to the task of aligning a target word to a source word when the target sequence has only been partially decoded. Good online alignments facilitate important applications such as lexically constrained translation where user-defined dictionaries are used to inject lexical constraints into the translation model. We propose a novel posterior alignment technique that is truly online in its execution and superior in terms of alignment error rates compared to existing methods. Our proposed inference technique jointly considers alignment and token probabilities in a principled manner and can be seamlessly integrated within existing constrained beam-search decoding algorithms. On five language pairs, including two distant language pairs, we achieve consistent drop in alignment error rates. When deployed on seven lexically constrained translation tasks, we achieve significant improvements in BLEU specifically around the constrained positions.

AB Decompounding has been found to improve information retrieval (IR) effectiveness in general domains for languages such as German or Dutch. We investigate if cross-language patent retrieval can profit from decompounding. This poses two challenges: i) There may be few resources such as parallel corpora available for training an machine translation system for a compounding language. ii) Patents have a specific writing style and vocabulary ("patentese"), which may affect the performance of decompounding and translation methods. Experiments on data from the CLEF-IP 2010 task show that decompounding patents for translation can overcome out-of-vocabulary problems (OOV) and that decompounding improves IR performance significantly for small training corpora.

AB In the last years, deep learning algorithms have highly revolutionized several areas including speech, image and natural language processing. The specific field of Machine Translation (MT) has not remained invariant. Integration of deep learning in MT varies from re-modeling existing features into standard statistical systems to the development of a new architecture. Among the different neural networks, research works use feed-forward neural networks, recurrent neural networks and the encoder-decoder schema. These architectures are able to tackle challenges as having low-resources or morphology variations.
   This extended abstract focuses on describing the foundational works on the neural MT approach; mentioning its strengths and weaknesses; and including an analysis of the corresponding challenges and future work. The full manuscript [Costa-jussa, 2018] describes, in addition, how these neural networks have been integrated to enhance different aspects and models from statistical MT, including language modeling, word alignment, translation, reordering, and rescoring; and on describing the new neural MT approach together with recent approaches on using subword, characters and training with multilingual languages, among others.

AB Deep learning has demonstrated performance advantages in a wide range of natural language processing tasks, including neural machine translation (NMT). Transformer NMT models are typically strengthened by deeper encoder layers, but deepening their decoder layers usually results in failure. In this paper, we first identify the cause of the failure of the deep decoder in the Transformer model. Inspired by this discovery, we then propose approaches to improving it, with respect to model structure and model training, to make the deep decoder practical in NMT. Specifically, with respect to model structure, we propose a cross-attention drop mechanism to allow the decoder layers to perform their own different roles, to reduce the difficulty of deep-decoder learning. For model training, we propose a collapse reducing training approach to improve the stability and effectiveness of deep-decoder training. We experimentally evaluated our proposed Transformer NMT model structure modification and novel training methods on several popular machine translation benchmarks. The results showed that deepening the NMT model by increasing the number of decoder layers successfully prevented the deepened decoder from degrading to an unconditional language model. In contrast to prior work on deepening an NMT model on the encoder, our method can deepen the model on both the encoder and decoder at the same time, resulting in a deeper model and improved performance.

TI Effects of using machine translation to mediate the revision process of
   Korean university students' academic writing
SO RECALL
AB In recent years, marked gains in the accuracy of machine translation (MT) outputs have greatly increased its viability as a tool to support the efforts of English as a foreign language (EFL) students to write in English. This study examines error corrections made by 58 Korean university students by comparing their original L2 texts to that of MT outputs. Based on the results of the error analysis, the error types were categorized into 12 categories. Students were divided into three distinctive groups to determine differences among them according to the frequency of errors in their writing. The t-test results reveal that the numbers of errors significantly decreased in the revised versions for most of the error types among all groups. The results of the regression analysis also reveal a positive correlation relationship between the number of changes and the reduction of errors. However, the results also indicate that although all groups made error corrections at similar rates, students who less frequently committed errors in their L2 texts (higher language proficiency groups) generally tended to correct a higher proportion of errors. Based on the findings, pedagogical implications are discussed regarding how EFL teachers can effectively incorporate MT into the classroom.

AB While parallel corpora are an indispensable resource for data-driven multilingual natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, they are limited in quantity, quality and coverage. As a result, learning translation models from non-parallel corpora has become increasingly important nowadays, especially for low-resource languages. In this work, we propose a joint model for iteratively learning parallel lexicons and phrases from non-parallel corpora. The model is trained using a Viterbi EM algorithm that alternates between constructing parallel phrases using lexicons and updating lexicons based on the constructed parallel phrases. Experiments on Chinese-English datasets show that our approach learns better parallel lexicons and phrases and improves translation performance significantly.

AB Translation is one of the areas where word disambiguation must be solved in order to find out adequate translations for such words in the contexts where they occur. In this paper, a Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) approach using Word Sense Clustering within a cross-lingual strategy is proposed. Available sentence-aligned parallel corpora are used as a reliable knowledge source. English is taken as the source language, and Portuguese, French or Spanish as the targets. Clusters are built based on the correlation between senses, which is measured by a language-independent algorithm that uses as features the words near the ambiguous word and its translation in the parallel sentences, together with their relative positions. Clustering quality reached 81% (V-measure) and 92% (F-measure) in average for the three language pairs. Learned clusters are then used to train a support vector machine, whose classification results are used for sense disambiguation. Classification tests showed an average (for the three languages) F-measure of 81%.

AB To improve the data resource of low-resource English-Myanmar-Thai language pairs, we build the first parallel medical corpus, named as En-My-Th medical corpus which is composed of total 14,592 parallel sentences. In our paper, we make experiments on the English-Myanmar language pair of new En-My-Th medical corpus and in addition, English-Thai and Thai-Myanmar language pairs from the existing ASEAN-MT corpus. The experiments of SwitchOut data augmentation algorithm and the baseline attention-based sequence to sequence model are trained on the aforementioned language pairs in both directions. Experimental results show that combination of SwitchOut algorithm with the baseline model outperforms the baseline only model in the translation of most language pairs for both corpora. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of the baseline model and baseline+SwitchOut model by adding or removing word dropout at the recurrent layers, at which baseline+SwitchOut model with the dropout increases around (+1.0) BLEU4 and GLEU scores in some of language pairs.

AB Neural machine translation usually adopts autoregressive models and suffers from exposure bias as well as the consequent error propagation problem. Many previous works have discussed the relationship between error propagation and the accuracy drop (i.e., the left part of the translated sentence is often better than its right part in left-to-right decoding models) problem. In this paper, we conduct a series of analyses to deeply understand this problem and get several interesting findings. (1) The role of error propagation on accuracy drop is overstated in the literature, although it indeed contributes to the accuracy drop problem. (2) Characteristics of a language play a more important role in causing the accuracy drop: the left part of the translation result in a right-branching language (e.g., English) is more likely to be more accurate than its right part, while the right part is more accurate for a left-branching language (e.g., Japanese). Our discoveries are confirmed on different model structures including Transformer and RNN, and in other sequence generation tasks such as text summarization.

AB We present a selection of results produced in a project called Media Map. The project aims at developing an intuitive user interface to a library information system containing data on projects and publications. The user interface is a two-dimensional visual display created with the Self-Organizing Map algorithm. The map has been computed using the hierarchical self-organizing map, and a specific graphical design supports the visualization and use of the map interface. In the design, there are specific iconic representations for the projects, publications and persons displayed on the map. The novel aspects in this WEBSOM-type of document map are that the texts on the map are written in different languages, and there are different types of textual objects mapped on the same map. The interlingual mapping is based on applying machine translation on non-English documents. Even when the translation is not fully correct, the approach works well when large enough proportion of relevant terminology has become translated.

AB This paper presents a method aimed at classification of the environmental sounds in the visual domain by using the scale and translation invariance. We present a new approach that extracts visual features from sound spectrograms. We suggest to apply support vector machines (SVM's) in order to address sound classification. Indeed, in the proposed method we explore sound spectrograms as texture images, and extracts the time-frequency structures by using a translation-invariant wavelet transform and a patch transform alternated with local maximum and global maximum to pursuit scale and translation invariance. We illustrate the performance of this method on an audio database, which composed of 10 sounds classes. The obtained recognition rate is of the order 91.82 % with the multiclass decomposition method: One-Against-One.

AB Certifying compilation provides a means to ensure that untrusted mobile code satisfies its functional specification. A certifying compiler generates code as well as a machine-checkable "certificate", i.e. a formal proof that establishes adherence of the code to specified properties. While certificates for safety properties can be built fully automatically, certificates for more expressive and complex properties often require the use of interactive code verification. We propose a technique to provide code consumers with the benefits of interactive source code verification. Our technique, certificate translation, extends program transformations by offering the means to turn certificates of functional correctness for programs in high-level languages into certificates for executable code. The article outlines the principles of certificate translation, using specifications written in first order logic. This translation is instantiated for standard compiler optimizations in the context of an intermediate RTL Language.

AB Gender bias in natural language processing (NLP) applications, particularly machine translation, has been receiving increasing attention. Much of the research on this issue has focused on mitigating gender bias in English NLP models and systems. Addressing the problem in poorly resourced, and/or morphologically rich languages has lagged behind, largely due to the lack of datasets and resources. In this paper, we introduce a new corpus for gender identification and rewriting in contexts involving one or two target users (I and/or You) - first and second grammatical persons with independent grammatical gender preferences. We focus on Arabic, a gender-marking morphologically rich language. The corpus has multiple parallel components: four combinations of 1st and 2nd person in feminine and masculine grammatical genders, as well as English, and English to Arabic machine translation output. This corpus expands on Habash et al. (2019)'s Arabic Parallel Gender Corpus (APGC v1.0) by adding second person targets as well as increasing the total number of sentences over 6.5 times, reaching over 590K words. Our new dataset will aid the research and development of gender identification, controlled text generation, and post-editing rewrite systems that could be used to personalize NLP applications and provide users with the correct outputs based on their grammatical gender preferences. We make the Arabic Parallel Gender Corpus (APGC v2.0) publicly available.

AB The present study focuses on the definition of an Interlingua for the French topological prepositions "dans(in)", "sur(on)", "a(at)" and their equivalent in German "in", "auf", "an" with a view to their use in French German machine translation and second language acquisition systems. Both languages have a concept of preposition but with a different lexical use. In the same spatial situation, not always equivalent prepositions are used. The French and German prepositions can cover the description of a certain spatial situation, although its meanings can overlap themselves only partially. The choice of the appropriate preposition in a target language depends on the meaning of the topological preposition. With the second language acquisition of spatial prepositions mistakes frequently occur, because one preposition in French does not correspond necessarily to a same basic meaning of a preposition ill German. Regarding the machine translation of spatial prepositions, their meanings in a target language can not be defined in the same lexical way. Therefore the machine translation and the second language acquisition of spatial expressions must be occur not directly on a language dependent, i.e. linguistic, but on a language independent level, i.e. conceptual level. The definition of an Interlingua assumes that the meaning of French and German topological prepositions can be expressed in common neutral concepts.

In this paper, we show how to integrate ME models efficiently within a maximum likelihood training scheme of statistical machine translation models. Specifically, we define a set of context-dependent ME lexicon models and we present how to perform an efficient training of these ME models within the conventional expectation-maximization (EM) training of statistical translation models. Experimental results are also given in order to demonstrate how these ME models improve the results obtained with the traditional translation models. The results are presented by means of alignment quality comparing the resulting alignments with manually annotated reference alignments.

AB With an increase in Geospatial Linked Open Data being adopted and published over the web, there is a need to develop intuitive interfaces and systems for seamless and efficient exploratory analysis of such rich heterogeneous multi-modal datasets. This work is geared towards improving the exploration process of Earth Observation (EO) Linked Data by developing a natural language interface to facilitate querying. Questions asked over Earth Observation Linked Data have an inherent spatio-temporal dimension and can be represented using GeoSPARQL. This paper seeks to study and analyze the use of RNN-based neural machine translation with attention for transforming natural language questions into GeoSPARQL queries. Specifically, it aims to assess the feasibility of a neural approach for identifying and mapping spatial predicates in natural language to GeoSPARQL's topology vocabulary extension including - Egenhofer and RCC8 relations. The queries can then be executed over a triple store to yield answers for the natural language questions. A dataset consisting of mappings from natural language questions to GeoSPARQL queries over the Corine Land Cover(CLC) Linked Data has been created to train and validate the deep neural network. From our experiments, it is evident that neural machine translation with attention is a promising approach for the task of translating spatial predicates in natural language questions to GeoSPARQL queries.

TI Unsupervised Quality Estimation Model for English to German Translation
   and Its Application in Extensive Supervised Evaluation
SO SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL
AB With the rapid development of machine translation (MT), the MT evaluation becomes very important to timely tell us whether the MT system makes any progress. The conventional MT evaluation methods tend to calculate the similarity between hypothesis translations offered by automatic translation systems and reference translations offered by professional translators. There are several weaknesses in existing evaluation metrics. Firstly, the designed incomprehensive factors result in language-bias problem, which means they perform well on some special language pairs but weak on other language pairs. Secondly, they tend to use no linguistic features or too many linguistic features, of which no usage of linguistic feature draws a lot of criticism from the linguists and too many linguistic features make the model weak in repeatability. Thirdly, the employed reference translations are very expensive and sometimes not available in the practice. In this paper, the authors propose an unsupervised MT evaluation metric using universal part-of-speech tagset without relying on reference translations. The authors also explore the performances of the designed metric on traditional supervised evaluation tasks. Both the supervised and unsupervised experiments show that the designed methods yield higher correlation scores with human judgments.

TI An investigation of machine translation output quality and the
   influencing factors of source texts
SO RECALL
AB The use of machine translation (MT) in the academic context has increased in recent years. Hence, language teachers have found it difficult to ignore MT, which has led to some concerns. Among the concerns, its accuracy has become a major factor that shapes language teachers' pedagogical decision to use MT in their language classrooms. Despite the urgency of the issue, studies on MT output quality in foreign language education remain scarce. Moreover, as MT is advancing every year, updated studies are imperative. Therefore, the present study investigated the quality of MT outputs (Google Translate) from Korean to English by comparing it with the English-translated texts of intermediate English as a foreign language students. The study also examined the factors within the source texts that affect the quality of MT outputs. Five trained evaluators examined multiple aspects of MT output samples (N = 104) and students' English texts (N = 104), including mechanics, vocabulary, grammar, and context. The results showed that both texts were equally comprehensible, but MT outperformed the students in most aspects under investigation. The study further found that only two factors in the source texts - punctuation and sentence complexity - influenced MT output quality, whereas lexical and grammatical accuracy, lexical diversity, and contextual understanding did not affect it. Based on the results, the study presents classroom implications for using MT for educational purposes.

AB One of the fundamental problems with the static analysis of binary (executable) code is that of recognizing, in a machine-independent way, the target addresses of n-conditional branches implemented via a jump table. Without these addresses, the decoding of the machine instructions for a given procedure is incomplete, leading to imprecise analysis of the code.
   In this paper we present a technique for recovering jump tables and their target addresses in a machine and compiler independent way. The technique is based on slicing and copy propagation. The assembly code of a procedure that contains an indexed jump is transformed into a normal form which allows us to determine where the jump table is located and what information it contains (e.g, offsets from the table or absolute addresses).
   The presented technique has been implemented and tested on SPARC and Pentium code generated by C, C++, Fortran and Pascal compilers. Our tests show that up to 89% more of the code in a text segment can be found by using this technique, when compared against the standard method of decoding. The technique was developed as part of our retargetable binary translation framework UQBT; however, it is also suitable for other binary-manipulation and analysis tools such as binary profilers, instrumentors and decompilers.

AB Automatic image captioning has received increasing attention in recent years. Although there are many English datasets developed for this problem, there is only one Turkish dataset and it is very small compared to its English counterparts. Creating a new dataset for image captioning is a very costly and time consuming task. This work is a first step towards transferring the available, large English datasets into Turkish. We translated English captioning datasets into Turkish by using an automated translation tool and we trained an image captioning model on the automatically obtained Turkish captions. Our experiments show that this model yields the best performance so far on Turkish captioning.

AB The principal task in supervised neural machine translation (NMT) is to learn to generate target sentences conditioned on the source inputs from a set of parallel sentence pairs, and thus produce a model capable of generalizing to unseen instances. However, it is commonly observed that the generalization performance of the model is highly influenced by the amount of parallel data used in training. Although data augmentation is widely used to enrich the training data, conventional methods with discrete manipulations fail to generate diverse and faithful training samples. In this paper, we present a novel data augmentation paradigm termed Continuous Semantic Augmentation (CSANMT), which augments each training instance with an adjacency semantic region that could cover adequate variants of literal expression under the same meaning. We conduct extensive experiments on both rich-resource and low-resource settings involving various language pairs, including WMT14 English ->{German,French}, NIST Chinese -> English and multiple low-resource IWSLT translation tasks. The provided empirical evidences show that CSANMT sets a new level of performance among existing augmentation techniques, improving on the state-of-the-art by a large margin.(1)

The task provides a testbed representing challenges facing MT models deployed in the real world, and facilitates new approaches to improve models' robustness to noisy input and domain mismatch. We focus on two language pairs (English-French and English-Japanese), and the submitted systems are evaluated on a blind test set consisting of noisy comments on Reddit(1) and professionally sourced translations. As a new task, we received 23 submissions by 11 participating teams from universities, companies, national labs, etc. All submitted systems achieved large improvements over baselines, with the best improvement having +22.33 BLEU. We evaluated submissions by both human judgment and automatic evaluation (BLEU), which shows high correlations (Pearson's r = 0.94 and 0.95). Furthermore, we conducted a qualitative analysis of the submitted systems using compare-mt(2), which revealed their salient differences in handling challenges in this task. Such analysis provides additional insights when there is occasional disagreement between human judgment and BLEU, e.g. systems better at producing colloquial expressions received higher score from human judgment.

AB This paper is a study of the forcing translation through the proofs as programs correspondence in classical logic, following the methodology introduced by Krivine in [12], [14]. For that, we introduce an extension of (classical) higherorder arithmetic suited to express the forcing translation, called PA omega(+). We present the proof system of PA omega(+)-based on Currystyle proof terms with call/cc-as well as the corresponding classical realizability semantics. Then, given a poset of conditions (represented in PA omega(+) as an upwards closed subset of a fixed meet semi-lattice), we define the forcing translation A -> (p vertical bar proves A) (where A ranges over propositions) and show that the corresponding transformation of proofs is induced by a simple program transformation t -> t* defined on raw proof-terms (i.e. independently from the derivation). From an analysis of the computational behavior of transformed programs, we show how to avoid the cost of the transformation by introducing an extension of Krivine's abstract machine devoted to the execution of proofs constructed by forcing. We show that this machine induces new classical realizability models and present the corresponding adequacy results.

AB This paper describes the official runs of TNO TPD for CLEF-2001. We participated in the monolingual, bilingual and multilingual tasks. The main contribution of this paper is a systematic comparison of three types of translation resources for bilingual retrieval based on query translation. We compared several techniques based on machine readable dictionaries, statistical dictionaries generated from parallel corpora with a baseline of the Babelfish MT service, which is available on the web. The study showed that the topic set is too small to draw reliable conclusions. All three methods have the potential to reach about 90% of the monolingual baseline performance, but the effectiveness is not consistent across language pairs and topic collections. Because each of the individual methods are quite sensitive to missing translations, we tested a combination approach, which yielded consistent improvements up to 98% of the monolingual baseline.

AB The prediction of the translation initiation site in an mRNA or cDNA sequence is an essential step in gene prediction and an open research problem in bioinformatics. Although recent approaches perform well, more effective and reliable methodologies are solicited. We developed an adaptable data mining method, called StackTIS, which is modular and consists of three prediction components that are combined into a meta-classification system, using stacked generalization, in a highly effective framework. We performed extensive experiments on sequences of two diverse eukaryotic organisms (Homo sapiens and Oryza sativa), indicating that StackTIS achieves statistically significant improvement in performance.

AB Camera motion classification is an important issue in content-based video retrieval. In this paper, a robust and hierarchical camera motion classification approach is proposed. As the Support Vector Machine (SVM) has a very good learning capacity with limited sample set and does not require any heuristic parameter, the SVM is first employed to classify camera motions into translation and non-translation motions in preliminary classification. In this step, four features are extracted as input of the SVM. Then, zoom and rotation motions are further classified by analyzing the motion vectors' distribution. And the directions of translation motions are also identified. The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a good performance.

AB Machine translation is going through a radical revolution, driven by the explosive development of deep learning techniques using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). In this paper, we consider a special case in machine translation problems, targeting to convert natural language into Structured Query Language (SQL) for data retrieval over relational database. Although generic CNN and RNN learn the grammar structure of SQL when trained with sufficient samples, the accuracy and training efficiency of the model could be dramatically improved, when the translation model is deeply integrated with the grammar rules of SQL. We present a new encoder-decoder framework, with a suite of new approaches, including new semantic features fed into the encoder, grammar-aware states injected into the memory of decoder, as well as recursive state management for sub-queries. These techniques help the neural network better focus on understanding semantics of operations in natural language and save the efforts on SQL grammar learning. The empirical evaluation on real world database and queries show that our approach outperform state-of-the-art solution by a significant margin.

TI Find the errors, get the better: Enhancing machine translation via word
   confidence estimation
SO NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING
AB This paper presents two novel ideas of improving the Machine Translation (MT) quality by applying the word-level quality prediction for the second pass of decoding. In this manner, the word scores estimated by word confidence estimation systems help to reconsider the MT hypotheses for selecting a better candidate rather than accepting the current sub-optimal one. In the first attempt, the selection scope is limited to the MT N-best list, in which our proposed re-ranking features are combined with those of the decoder for re-scoring. Then, the search space is enlarged over the entire search graph, storing many more hypotheses generated during the first pass of decoding. Over all paths containing words of the N-best list, we propose an algorithm to strengthen or weaken them depending on the estimated word quality. In both methods, the highest score candidate after the search becomes the official translation. The results obtained show that both approaches advance the MT quality over the one-pass baseline, and the search graph re-decoding achieves more gains (in BLEU score) than N-best List Re-ranking method.

TI Assembly partitioning along simple paths: the case of multiple
   translations
SO ADVANCED ROBOTICS
AB We consider the following problem that arises in mechanical assembly planning: given an assembly, identify a subassembly that can be removed as a rigid object without disturbing the rest of the assembly. This is the assembly partitioning problem. Specifically, we consider planar assemblies of simple polygons and subassembly removal paths consisting of a single finite translation followed by a translation to infinity. Such paths are typical of the capabilities of simple actuators in fixed automation and other high-volume assembly machines. We present a polynomial-time algorithm to identify such a subassembly and removal path or report that none exists. In addition, we extend this algorithm and analysis to removal paths consisting of a small number k > 2 of translations. We discuss extending the algorithm to three dimensions and to other types of motions typical in non-robotic automated assembly.

In the evaluation of the first prototype through a wizard-of-Oz-experiment. the presented AR solution received a high acceptance rate among deaf and hard-of-hearing persons. However, the machine learning based method used to generate sign language from video still lacks the required accuracy for fully preserving comprehensibility. Signed sentences with large recognisable arm movements were understood better than sentences relying mainly on linger movements. where only a small interaction space is visible.

AB Image-to-image translation is a hot field in the machine learning with the emergency of the generative adversarial networks. Most of the latest models easily lead to changes in the overall image and overfitting when they are used to local feature translation. To address these limitations, this article adds a suppressor and proposes a double adversarial CycleGAN. The suppressor is added to suppress the change of images, and the suppressor and generator form a new adversarial relationship. We hope it will achieve Nash equilibrium that is the change of image focus on the local feature. Finally, a contrast experiment was conducted. In the case of image local feature transfer, the change of image is focused on the local features and the overfitting phenomenon can be well resolved.

AB Recent advances in sequence modeling have highlighted the strengths of the transformer architecture, especially in achieving state-of-the-art machine translation results. However, depending on the up-stream systems, e.g., speech recognition, or word segmentation, the input to translation system can vary greatly. The goal of this work is to extend the attention mechanism of the transformer to naturally consume the lattice in addition to the traditional sequential input. We first propose a general lattice transformer for speech translation where the input is the output of the automatic speech recognition (ASR) which contains multiple paths and posterior scores. To leverage the extra information from the lattice structure, we develop a novel controllable lattice attention mechanism to obtain latent representations. On the LDC Spanish-English speech translation corpus, our experiments show that lattice transformer generalizes significantly better and outperforms both a transformer baseline and a lattice LSTM. Additionally, we validate our approach on the WMT 2017 Chinese-English translation task with lattice inputs from different BPE segmentations. In this task, we also observe the improvements over strong baselines.

AB The correct prediction of protein translation initiation from messenger RNA (mRNA) is an important activity for genomic annotation. This problem is known to be highly imbalanced, since each molecule has a single mRNA translation initiation site and several others which are not initiator AUGs.
   In this context, the present work has focused on undersampling methods for balancing class distribution proposed to solve such problem. Here, we present the results obtained from the Condensed Nearest Neighbor Rule (CNN), Tomek, and random sampling methods already known in the literature, and introduce a new one for balancing, namely C-Blocks, which is based on clustering. Using the concept of Bagging [1], the results of these classifiers is combined to obtain a final ranking of the sequence.

TI Error Minimization in Layered Manufacturing Parts by Stereolithography
   File Modification Using a Vertex Translation Algorithm
SO JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME
AB Layered manufacturing (LM) machines use stereolithography (STL) files to build parts by creating continuous slices on top of each other. An STL file approximates the surface of a part with planar triangles. This results in geometric errors being introduced in the part surface during the conversion from the CAD model to the STL file format, which in turn leads to errors in the LM manufactured part. CAD packages have built-in export options to reduce this CAD to STL conversion error. However, this is applied to the entire part geometry which leads to an increase in the file size and preprocessing time in LM machines. This paper presents a new approach to locally reduce this CAD to STL translation error. This approach, referred to as vertex translation algorithm (VTA), compares an STL facet to its corresponding CAD surface, computes the chordal error at multiple points on the STL surface, and translates the point with the maximum chordal error until it lies on the design surface. This translation results in the reduction of the chordal error locally without unnecessarily increasing the size of the STL file. In addition, a facet isolation algorithm (FIA) has also been developed and presented in this paper. This isolation algorithm extracts the STL facets corresponding to the surfaces and features of the part that have to be modified by the translation algorithm. The VTA is applied in conjunction with the FIA on a sample service part to reduce the form and profile error of critical features of the part in order to satisfy the tolerance callouts on the part.

We performed an evaluation of automatic translations for a total of 10 language directions, namely, zh/en, en/zh, fr/en, en/fr, de/en, en/de, pt/en, en/pt, es/en, and en/es. We provided training data based on MEDLINE abstracts for eight of the 10 language pairs and test sets for all of them. In addition to that, we offered a new sub-task for the translation of terms in biomedical terminologies for the en/es language direction. Higher BLEU scores (close to 0.5) were obtained for the es/en, en/es and en/pt test sets, as well as for the terminology sub-task. After manual validation of the primary runs, some submis- sions were judged to be better than the reference translations, for instance, for de/en, en/es and es/en.

AB For many of the world's languages, the Bible is the only significant bilingual, or even monolingual, text, making it a unique training resource for tasks such as translation, named entity analysis, and transliteration. Given the Bible's small size, however, the output of standard word alignment tools can be extremely noisy, making downstream tasks difficult. In this work, we develop and release a novel resource of 1129 aligned Bible person and place names across 591 languages, which was constructed and improved using several approaches including weighted edit distance, machine-translation-based transliteration models, and affixal induction and transformation models. Our models outperform a widely used word aligner on 97% of test words, showing the particular efficacy of our approach on the impactful task of broadly multilingual named-entity alignment and translation across a remarkably large number of world languages. We further illustrate the utility of our translation matrix for the multilingual learning of name-related affixes and their semantics as well as transliteration of named entities.

TI Capsuloligamentous restraints to dorsal and palmar carpal translation
SO JOURNAL OF HAND SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME
AB Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine biomechanically the relative contributions of the dorsal and palmar capsuloligamentous structures to dorsal and palmar carpal stability.
   Methods: Seven fresh-frozen cadaver specimens were tested using a testing machine (MTS, Eden Prairie, MN) with low loads applied perpendicular to the axis of the radial diaphysis. We determined the loads required to achieve dorsal and palmar translation of the carpus on the radius as palmar and dorsal ligaments and capsule were sectioned sequentially. The relative contributions of the dorsal and palmar capsuloligamentous structures to dorsal and palmar stability were determined.
   Results: The palmar structures provided a statistically significantly greater restraint (61%) to dorsal translation of the carpus than did the dorsal structures (2%). The palmar structures also provided a statistically greater restraint (48%) to palmar translation of the carpus than did the dorsal structures (6%).
   Conclusions: The palmar capsuloligamentous structures provided greater restraint to both dorsal and palmar translation of the carpus. We suggest that surgeons consider repair or reconstruction of traumatic injuries to these structures.

TI Multi-Round Transfer Learning for Low-Resource NMT Using Multiple
   High-Resource Languages
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB Neural machine translation (NMT) has made remarkable progress in recent years, but the performance of NMT suffers from a data sparsity problem since large-scale parallel corpora are only readily available for high-resource languages (HRLs). In recent days, transfer learning (TL) has been used widely in low-resource languages (LRLs) machine translation, while TL is becoming one of the vital directions for addressing the data sparsity problem in low-resource NMT. As a solution, a transfer learning method in NMT is generally obtained via initializing the low-resource model (child) with the high-resource model (parent). However, leveraging the original TL to low-resource models is neither able to make full use of highly related multiple HRLs nor to receive different parameters from the same parents. In order to exploit multiple HRLs effectively, we present a language-independent and straightforward multi-round transfer learning (MRTL) approach to low-resource NMT. Besides, with the intention of reducing the differences between high-resource and low-resource languages at the character level, we introduce a unified transliteration method for various language families, which are both semantically and syntactically highly analogous with each other. Experiments on low-resource datasets show that our approaches are effective, significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods, and yield improvements of up to 5.63 BLEU points.

The educational genre (videolectures subtitles, forums discussions, course assignments), the type of text (segmentation, misspellings, syntax errors, specialized terminology, scientific formulas, limited knowledge on context) of the source data, and the multilingual approach of the involved activities (the focus is on a total of 12 European and BRIC languages) provides a challenging setting for the success of the project. Experimental trials reveal significant findings for the purposes of Language Technology research as well as limitations in crowdsourcing linguistic data collections for multilingual tasks.

AB Standard automatic metrics, e.g., BLEU, are not reliable for document-level MT evaluation. They can neither distinguish document-level improvements in translation quality from sentence-level ones, nor identify the discourse phenomena that cause context-agnostic translations. This paper introduces a novel automatic metric BLONDE1 to widen the scope of automatic MT evaluation from the sentence to the document level. BLONDE takes discourse coherence into consideration by categorizing discourse-related spans and calculating the similarity-based F1 measure of categorized spans. We conduct extensive comparisons on a newly constructed document-level translation dataset BWB. The experimental results show that BLONDE possesses better selectivity and interpretability at the document-level, and is more sensitive to document-level nuances. In a large-scale human study, BLONDE also achieves significantly higher Pearson's r correlation with human judgments compared to previous metrics.

We again applied our hallmark technique for combating language diversity and morphological complexity: character n-gram tokenization. This year we participated in the ad hoe cross-language track and submitted both monolingual and bilingual runs. Our experimental results this year agree with our previous reports that n-grams perform especially well in linguistically complex languages, notably Bulgarian and Hungarian, where monolingual improvements of 27% and 70% respectively were observed compared to space-delimited word forms. As in CLEF 2005, our bilingual submissions made use of subword translation, statistical translation of character n-grams using aligned corpora, when parallel data were available, and web-based machine translation, when no suitable data was available to us.

AB In a dictionary-based query translation for cross-language text retrieval, transfer ambiguity is one of the main causes of performance deterioration, but the problem has not received significant attention in this field. To resolve transfer ambiguity, this paper proposes a two-phase query translation based on term reweighting, which uses a bilingual transfer dictionary, originally designed for machine translation. In general, source language query terms each show some word association with others, so that their correct translations should be more likely to co-occur in target documents. Based on this simple intuition, the first phase discriminates more relevant target documents from the others. Using statistical and ranking information from the highly relevant documents, the second phase then converts a translated query vector into reweighted form to add an extra weight on probably correct target terms. In experiments, the results were remarkable: the proposed method achieved almost the same performance as the monolingual IR system, actually contributing to an improvement of precision by about 9% over a baseline system.

SO CELL
AB The ability to sequence genomes has far outstripped approaches for deciphering the information they encode. Here we present a suite of techniques, based on ribosome profiling (the deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments), to provide genome-wide maps of protein synthesis as well as a pulse-chase strategy for determining rates of translation elongation. We exploit the propensity of harringtonine to cause ribosomes to accumulate at sites of translation initiation together with a machine learning algorithm to define protein products systematically. Analysis of translation in mouse embryonic stem cells reveals thousands of strong pause sites and unannotated translation products. These include amino-terminal extensions and truncations and upstream open reading frames with regulatory potential, initiated at both AUG and non-AUG codons, whose translation changes after differentiation. We also define a class of short, polycistronic ribosome-associated coding RNAs (sprcRNAs) that encode small proteins. Our studies reveal an unanticipated complexity to mammalian proteomes.

The spherically symmetrical properties of the translation coefficients K-lm,K-l'm' for SH obtained in the present paper and, the rotation coefficients T-lm,l'm'(lambda), the two-center overlap integrals over arbitrary atomic orbitals S-nlm,S-n'l'm' and the translation coefficients V-nlm,n'l'm'(N) for Slater-type orbitals (STO's) given recently by the author [I.I. Guseinov, J. Mel. Struct. (Theochem), 343 (1995) 173] are the same. The analytical formulas also have been derived for translation coefficients of SH in terms of binomial coefficients. The final results are especially useful for machine computations of arbitrary multi-electron molecular integrals for which the series expansion formulas have recently been derived by the author.

In view of the free access to this online encyclopedia, on the one hand, and the richness of texts (in Polish and Dutch) with a cultural content on the other, we investigated to what extent Wikipedia translation can be successfully used as a tool in L2 translation classes. The increasing importance of technological tools (such as electronic dictionaries, terminological databases, and machine translation software) for translation and its use in language teaching, on the one hand, and, on the other, the fact that Polish graduates in Dutch philology often work as translators, were the starting point for this research, which was conducted as a preliminary phase (case study) of a more extensive study into the practical application of Wikipedia translation activities in language acquisition classes.

AB A conventional approach to improving the performance of end-to-end speech translation (E2E-ST) models is to leverage the source transcription via pre-training and joint training with automatic speech recognition (ASR) and neural machine translation (NMT) tasks. However, since the input modalities are different, it is difficult to leverage source language text successfully. In this work, we focus on sequence-level knowledge distillation (SeqKD) from external text-based NMT models. To leverage the full potential of the source language information, we propose backward SeqKD, SeqKD from a target-to-source backward NMT model. To this end, we train a bilingual E2E-ST model to predict paraphrased transcriptions as an auxiliary task with a single decoder. The paraphrases are generated from the translations in bitext via back-translation. We further propose bidirectional SeqKD in which SeqKD from both forward and backward NMT models is combined. Experimental evaluations on both autoregressive and non-autoregressive models show that SeqKD in each direction consistently improves the translation performance, and the effectiveness is complementary regardless of the model capacity.

TI Better Document-Level Machine Translation with Bayes' Rule
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB We show that Bayes' rule provides an effective mechanism for creating document translation models that can be learned from only parallel sentences and monolingual documents-a compelling benefit because parallel documents are not always available. In our formulation, the posterior probability of a candidate translation is the product of the unconditional (prior) probability of the candidate output document and the "reverse translation probability'' of translating the candidate output back into the source language. Our proposed model uses a powerful autoregressive language model as the prior on target language documents, but it assumes that each sentence is translated independently from the target to the source language. Crucially, at test time, when a source document is observed, the document language model prior induces dependencies between the translations of the source sentences in the posterior. The model's independence assumption not only enables efficient use of available data, but it additionally admits a practical left-to-right beam-search algorithm for carrying out inference. Experiments show that our model benefits from using cross-sentence context in the language model, and it outperforms existing document translation approaches.

AB Byte pair encoding(BPE) is an approach that segments the corpus in such a way that frequent sequence of characters are combined; it results to having word surface forms divided into its' root word and affix. It alone handles out-of-vocabulary words, but tends to not consistently segment inflected words. Controlled byte pair encoding (CBPE) allowed our word-level neural machine translation (NMT) model to easily recognize inflected words which are prevalent in morphologically-rich languages. It prevented BPE from merging affixes in a word to other characters in the word. Our resulting NMT models from CBPE consistently evaluates affixes that could've been segmented with variations in BPE. In our experiments, we considered 119,969 English-Filipino parallel language pairs from an existing dataset, with Filipino as a morphologically-rich language. The results show that BPE and CBPE both showed improvements in the BLEU scores from 38.31 to 44.82 and 44.07 for English -> Filipino, and from 32.17 to 35.25 and 35.98 for Filipino -> English, respectively. The lower scores in the Filipino -> English can be attributed to other language characteristics of Filipino such as free word order, one-to-many relationship in translating from English to Filipino, and some transliterations in the parallel corpus. CBPE also performed slightly better for English -> filipino than for Filipino -> Anglish.

In the present study, we give a quantitative theory for translation rate and show that the ribosome behaves more like a Brownian Ratchet motor.

TI Word translation disambiguation using bilingual bootstrapping
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB This article proposes a new method for word translation disambiguation, one that uses a machine-learning technique called bilingual bootstrapping. In learning to disambiguate words to be translated, bilingual bootstrapping makes use of a small amount of classified data and a large amount of unclassified data in both the source and the target languages. It repeatedly constructs classifiers in the two languages in parallel and boosts the performance of the classifiers by classifying unclassified data in the two languages and by exchanging information regarding classified data between the two languages. Experimental results indicate that word translation disambiguation based on bilingual bootstrapping consistently and significantly outperforms existing methods that are based on monolingual bootstrapping.

Network paging, which is relatively new and is based on a type of network-address translation (NAT), is focused on. This architecture requires smaller packet size and has several more advantages over the conventional architecture (i.e., network segmentation).

TI Reclassification of Signs A translation semiotics perspective
SO CHINESE SEMIOTIC STUDIES
AB Previous semiotic research classified human signs into linguistic signs and non-linguistic signs, with reference to human language and the writing system as the core members of the sign family. However, this classification cannot cover all the types of translation in the broad sense in terms of sign transformation activities. Therefore, it is necessary to reclassify the signs that make meaning into tangible signs and intangible signs based on the medium of the signs. Whereas tangible signs are attached to the outer medium of the physical world, intangible signs are attached to the inner medium of the human cerebral nervous system. The three types of transformation, which are namely from tangible signs into tangible signs, from tangible signs into intangible signs, and from intangible signs into tangible signs, lay a solid foundation for the categorization of sign activities in translation semiotics. Such a reclassification of signs can not only enrich semiotic theories of sign types, human communication, and sign-text interpretation, but also inspire new research on translation types, the translation process, translators' thinking systems and psychology, and the mechanism of machine translation.

Since there is no explicitly cross-lingual signal, pre-training and synthetic sentence pairs are significant to the success of UNMT. In this work, we empirically study the core training procedure of UNMT to analyze the synthetic sentence pairs obtained from back-translation. We introduce new losses to UNMT to regularize the synthetic sentence pairs by training the UNMT objective and the regularization objective jointly. Our comprehensive experiments support that our method can generally improve the performance of currently successful models on three similar pairs {French, German, Romanian} <-> English and one dissimilar pair Russian <-> English with acceptably additional cost.

TI A dictionary for translation from natural to formal data model language
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
AB The paper describes our current research activities and results related to developing knowledge-based systems to support the creation of entity-relationship (ER) models. The authors based obtaining an ER model in textual form on translation from one language into another, that is, from an English controlled natural language into the formalized language of an ER data model. Our translation method consisted of creating translation rules of sentential form parts into ER model constructs based on the textual and character patterns detected in the business descriptions. To enable the computer analyses necessary for creating translation mechanisms, we created a linguistic corpus that contains lists of the business descriptions and the texts of other business materials. From the corpus, we then created a specific dictionary and linguistic rules to automate the business descriptions' translation into the ER data model language. Before that, however, the corpus was enriched by adding annotations to the words related to ER data model constructs. In this paper, we also present the main issues uncovered during the translation process and offer a possible solution with utility evaluation: applying information-extraction performance measures to a set of sentences from the corpus.

TI Molecular optimization by capturing chemist's intuition using deep
   neural networks
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS
AB A main challenge in drug discovery is finding molecules with a desirable balance of multiple properties. Here, we focus on the task of molecular optimization, where the goal is to optimize a given starting molecule towards desirable properties. This task can be framed as a machine translation problem in natural language processing, where in our case, a molecule is translated into a molecule with optimized properties based on the SMILES representation. Typically, chemists would use their intuition to suggest chemical transformations for the starting molecule being optimized. A widely used strategy is the concept of matched molecular pairs where two molecules differ by a single transformation. We seek to capture the chemist's intuition from matched molecular pairs using machine translation models. Specifically, the sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism, and the Transformer model are employed to generate molecules with desirable properties. As a proof of concept, three ADMET properties are optimized simultaneously: logD, solubility, and clearance, which are important properties of a drug. Since desirable properties often vary from project to project, the user-specified desirable property changes are incorporated into the input as an additional condition together with the starting molecules being optimized. Thus, the models can be guided to generate molecules satisfying the desirable properties. Additionally, we compare the two machine translation models based on the SMILES representation, with a graph-to-graph translation model HierG2G, which has shown the state-of-the-art performance in molecular optimization. Our results show that the Transformer can generate more molecules with desirable properties by making small modifications to the given starting molecules, which can be intuitive to chemists. A further enrichment of diverse molecules can be achieved by using an ensemble of models.

AB The Transformer architecture is widely used for machine translation tasks. However, its resource-intensive nature makes it challenging to implement on constrained embedded devices, particularly where available hardware resources can vary at run-time. We propose a dynamic machine translation model that scales the Transformer architecture based on the available resources at any particular time. The proposed approach, 'Dynamic-HAT', uses a HAT SuperTransformer as the backbone to search for SubTransformers with different accuracy-latency trade-offs at design time. The optimal SubTransformers are sampled from the SuperTransformer at run-time, depending on latency constraints. The Dynamic-HAT is tested on the Jetson Nano and the approach uses inherited SubTransformers sampled directly from the SuperTransformer with a switching time of <1s. Using inherited SubTransformers results in a BLEU score loss of <= 1.5% because the SubTransformer configuration is not retrained from scratch after sampling. However, to recover this loss in performance, the dimensions of the design space can be reduced to tailor it to a family of target hardware. The new reduced design space results in a BLEU score increase of approximately 1% for sub-optimal models from the original design space, with a wide range for performance scaling between 0356s - 1.526s for the GPU and 2.9s - 7.31s for the CPU.

This self- replication process is achieved by translation and transcription of a configuration information in a three-dimensional data and signals cellular automaton (DSCA).

TI The Cap-Binding Complex CBC and the Eukaryotic Translation Factor eIF4E:
   Co-Conspirators in Cap-Dependent RNA Maturation and Translation
SO CANCERS
AB Simple Summary To produce the proteins needed for the cell to survive, the information in the DNA is converted to a mobile form known as messenger RNA, which exits the cell nucleus and binds to machines that convert RNAs into proteins in a process referred to as translation. Importantly, the RNA message can be altered at any point in its journey prior to translation. These alterations constitute changes to the chemical nature of the messenger RNA and modulate the ability of mRNAs to be converted into proteins and even lead to the production of proteins with different functionalities than those encoded by their original forms. Here we provide a conceptual framework for the integration of these mRNA maturation steps with translation with a focus on the proteins that escort these mRNAs through these steps and into the translation machines. We discuss the relevance to cancer and therapeutic strategies to target these in malignancy. The translation of RNA into protein is a dynamic process which is heavily regulated during normal cell physiology and can be dysregulated in human malignancies. Its dysregulation can impact selected groups of RNAs, modifying protein levels independently of transcription. Integral to their suitability for translation, RNAs undergo a series of maturation steps including the addition of the m(7)G cap on the 5 ' end of RNAs, splicing, as well as cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA). Importantly, each of these steps can be coopted to modify the transcript signal. Factors that bind the m(7)G cap escort these RNAs through different steps of maturation and thus govern the physical nature of the final transcript product presented to the translation machinery. Here, we describe these steps and how the major m(7)G cap-binding factors in mammalian cells, the cap binding complex (CBC) and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E, are positioned to chaperone transcripts through RNA maturation, nuclear export, and translation in a transcript-specific manner. To conceptualize a framework for the flow and integration of this genetic information, we discuss RNA maturation models and how these integrate with translation. Finally, we discuss how these processes can be coopted by cancer cells and means to target these in malignancy.

AB The paper describes BUT's English to German offline speech translation (ST) systems developed for IWSLT2021. They are based on jointly trained Automatic Speech Recognition-Machine Translation models. Their performances is evaluated on MustC-Common test set. In this work, we study their efficiency from the perspective of having a large amount of separate ASR training data and MT training data, and a smaller amount of speech-translation training data. Large amounts of ASR and MT training data are utilized for pretraining the ASR and MT models. Speechtranslation data is used to jointly optimize ASR-MT models by defining an end-to-end differentiable path from speech to translations. For this purpose, we use the internal continuous representations from the ASR-decoder as the input to MT module. We show that speech translation can be further improved by training the ASR-decoder jointly with the MT-module using large amount of text-only MT training data. We also show significant improvements by training an ASR module capable of generating punctuated text, rather than leaving the punctuation task to the MT module.

AB We report on search errors and model errors in neural machine translation (NMT). We present an exact inference procedure for neural sequence models based on a combination of beam search and depth-first search. We use our exact search to find the global best model scores under a Transformer base model for the entire WMT15 English-German test set. Surprisingly, beam search fails to find these global best model scores in most cases, even with a very large beam size of 100. For more than 50% of the sentences, the model in fact assigns its global best score to the empty translation, revealing a massive failure of neural models in properly accounting for adequacy. We show by constraining search with a minimum translation length that at the root of the problem of empty translations lies an inherent bias towards shorter translations. We conclude that vanilla NMT in its current form requires just the right amount of beam search errors, which, from a modelling perspective, is a highly unsatisfactory conclusion indeed, as the model often prefers an empty translation.

AB We extend the previous work measuring the entropy of written English to include the following written natural languages: Arabic, Chinese, French, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Spanish. We observe that translations of the same document have approximately the same size when compressed, even though they have widely varying uncompressed sizes. This provides further evidence of the popular linguistic postulate that different natural languages have the same descriptive ability. It also provides a possible tool to identify poor machine translations.
   Our motivation is the following natural thought experiment. Linguistic theory has suggested that all natural languages are equally expressive. Under this assumption, and further assuming that PPM works well across many languages, we would expect that the same document translated into different languages would compress to approximately the same size. If this were not the case, we would have evidence either that different natural languages differ in expressiveness, that PPM is language-specific, or that the translations we are dealing with are poor. Each of these results would be interesting.
   Our experiments follow those by Teahan and Cleary for English. We first clean the texts to a smaller alphabet. For English this alphabet consists of the 26 letters (without case) and the space character. We perform an analogous operation for each language. We then use efficient compression algorithms, in this case PPMD+, PPMZ, and BZIP2, to compress the given texts, and compare the resulting sizes.
   We used two corpora to perform our experiments, the Bible and a set of United Nations treaties. We obtained human-generated translations of these texts in the languages mentioned above. For each corpus, the uncompressed size varies greatly across languages. For the Bible, the trend in compressed sizes is largely as we hypothesized: the better the compression algorithm, the closer the compressed sizes. The UN treaties do not match our hypothesis as closely. We speculate that this may be caused by the nature of the documents, legal jargon may be more concise in English. This result is an interesting starting point for future work.
   We also performed similar experiments with machine translations. We found that machine translation often fails when it comes across an unknown word, in which case it outputs the word untranslated. This skews compression results, causing large variance in the compressed sizes. Based on our findings, we suggest that compression can be used as a tool to find poor translations.
   The results of our experiments, while preliminary, support our hypothesis that translation preserves information content. We believe that our work opens the door for future research concerning the relationship between compression and translation.

SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF

AB Today, Mg2+ is an essential cofactor with diverse structural and functional roles in life's oldest macromolecular machine, the translation system. We tested whether ancient Earth conditions (low O-2, high Fe2+, and high Mn2+) can revert the ribosome to a functional ancestral state. First, SHAPE (selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension) was used to compare the effect of Mg2+, Fe2+, and Mn2+ on the tertiary structure of rRNA. Then, we used in vitro translation reactions to test whether Fe2+ or Mn2+ could mediate protein production, and quantified ribosomal metal content. We found that (i) Mg2+, Fe2+, and Mn2+ had strikingly similar effects on rRNA folding; (ii) Fe2+ and Mn2+ can replace Mg2+ as the dominant divalent cation during translation of mRNA to functional protein; and (iii) Fe and Mn associate extensively with the ribosome. Given that the translation system originated and matured when Fe2+ and Mn2+ were abundant, these findings suggest that Fe2+ and Mn2+ played a role in early ribosomal evolution.

AB Using top-ranked documents retrieved in response to a query of a user has been shown to be an effective approach to improve the quality of query translation in dictionary-based cross-language information retrieval. In this paper, we propose a new method for dictionarybased query translation based on dimension projection of embedded vectors from the pseudo-relevant documents in the source language to their equivalents in the target language. To this end, first we learn lowdimensional vectors of the words in the pseudo-relevant collections separately and then aim to find a query-dependent transformation matrix between the vectors of translation pairs appeared in the collections. At the next step, the representation of each query term is projected to the target language and then, after using a softmax function, a translation model is built. Finally, the model is used for query translation. Our experiments on four CLEF collections in French, Spanish, German, and Italian demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms competitive baselines including a word embedding baseline based on bilingual shuffling. The proposed method reaches up to 87% performance of machine translation (MT) in short queries and considerable improvements in verbose queries.

AB This study invited a group of Taiwanese English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) tertiary-level students to help Google Translate (GT) Community to refine its translation output. The participants engaged in 5 types of translation refinement tasks by responding to the input provided by GT Community (the first four tasks) or entering translation suggestions when encountering inappropriate translation generated by GT (the fifth task). The results indicated that the participants were able to generate highly accurate output for the first four tasks. With regard to the fifth task, many students entered proverbs, idioms, cultural expressions or slang for GT to translate and deemed GT's inability to translate beyond literal meaning as something to be improved upon. There were also nearly 25% of over-correction due to students' excessive scrutiny. All in all, students generally enjoyed the experience of helping GT to improve its translation quality. As students took the role of active contributors of knowledge, they developed competence and gained experience of participating in the digital world. Their participation also helped them to refine their language knowledge and developed their research abilities. The current study ends with a few possible directions for future research.

AB Source-target attention mechanism (briefly, source attention) has become one of the key components in a wide range of sequence generation tasks, such as neural machine translation, image caption, and open-domain dialogue generation. In these tasks, the attention mechanism, typically in control of information flow from the encoder to the decoder, enables to generate every component in the target sequence relying on different source components. While source attention mechanism has attracted many research interests, few of them turn eyes to if the generation of target sequence can additionally benefit from attending back to itself, which however is intuitively motivated by the nature of attention. To investigate the question, in this paper, we propose a new target-target attention mechanism (briefly, target attention). Along the progress of generating target sequence, target attention mechanism takes into account the relationship between the component to generate and its preceding context within the target sequence, such that it can better keep the coherent consistency and improve the readability of the generated sequence. Furthermore, it complements the information from source attention so as to further enhance semantic adequacy. After designing an effective approach to incorporate target attention in encoder-decoder framework, we conduct extensive experiments on both neural machine translation and image caption. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our design of integrating both source and target attention for sequence generation tasks.

AB This paper describes a compound unit (CU) recognizer as a pattern-based approach and its hybridization with rule-based translation. A compound unit is a combined concept including collocations, idioms, and compound nouns. CU recognition reduces part of speech ambiguities by combining several words into a unit and consequently lessening the parsing load. It also provides pretranslated natural equivalents. Our focus in this paper is to obtain flexibility and efficiency from pattern-based machine translation, and high-quality translation by hybridization. A modified trie, our search index structure using "method" strategy is used to manage heterogeneous property of the constituents. Syntactic verification is integrated to obtain precise CU recognition by means of pruning wrongly recognized units that are caused by improper variable hypotheses. The experimental result with verification shows that the precision of CU recognition is increased to 99.69% with 31 CFG rules on the cyclic trie structure for 1,268 Wall Street Journal articles of the Penn Treebank. Another experiment with CU recognition also shows that it raises the understandability of translation for Web documents.

TI MAIN DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATING CONTRACTUAL DOCUMENTATION
   (ENGLISH/RUSSIAN)
SO JOURNAL OF TEACHING ENGLISH FOR SPECIFIC AND ACADEMIC PURPOSES
AB The article is devoted to one of the most common translation problems in the sphere of law, namely finding the adequate equivalents in vocabulary, especially it concerns foreign terminology, in grammar and in text structure.
   While it is well-known that equivalence is one of the key concepts in translation, the research on practical applications of this principle in different professional spheres is still limited. With the rise of the interest to the machine translation, the special attention to the most common translation problems in the sphere of law can contribute to the overall understanding of the translation process. The methodological approach taken in this study is a mixed methodology based on comparative, structural, socio-linguistic and socio-cultural aspects of translation. The material presented in the article is based on the original contracts developed in English and Russian for the major oil and gas projects to be implemented in Russia 2006-2009. The examples of vocabulary, grammar and text structures equivalents can show the reasons for emergence of the main translation difficulties - polysemantic structure of some terms, absence of concept in either language, dependence of the meaning of the term on the context, idiomatic expressions, historically established traditions in legal text formation - emphasizing the idea that equivalence principle should be considered as a priority when translating contractual documentation.

AB In this work, we develop SimulSpeech, an end-to-end simultaneous speech to text translation system which translates speech in source language to text in target language concurrently. SimulSpeech consists of a speech encoder, a speech segmenter and a text decoder, where 1) the segmenter builds upon the encoder and leverages a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss to split the input streaming speech in real time, 2) the encoder-decoder attention adopts a wait-k strategy for simultaneous translation. SimulSpeech is more challenging than previous cascaded systems (with simultaneous automatic speech recognition (ASR) and simultaneous neural machine translation (NMT)). We introduce two novel knowledge distillation methods to ensure the performance: 1) Attention-level knowledge distillation transfers the knowledge from the multiplication of the attention matrices of simultaneous NMT and ASR models to help the training of the attention mechanism in SimulSpeech; 2) Data-level knowledge distillation transfers the knowledge from the full-sentence NMT model and also reduces the complexity of data distribution to help on the optimization of SimulSpeech. Experiments on MuST-C English-Spanish and English-German spoken language translation datasets show that SimulSpeech achieves reasonable BLEU scores and lower delay compared to full-sentence end-to-end speech to text translation (without simultaneous translation), and better performance than the two-stage cascaded simultaneous translation model in terms of BLEU scores and translation delay.

AB Non-autoregressive translation (NAT) models remove the dependence on previous target tokens and generate all target tokens in parallel, resulting in significant inference speedup but at the cost of inferior translation accuracy compared to autoregressive translation (AT) models. Considering that AT models have higher accuracy and are easier to train than NAT models, and both of them share the same model configurations, a natural idea to improve the accuracy of NAT models is to transfer a well-trained AT model to an NAT model through fine-tuning. However, since AT and NAT models differ greatly in training strategy, straightforward fine-tuning does not work well. In this work, we introduce curriculum learning into fine-tuning for NAT. Specifically, we design a curriculum in the fine-tuning process to progressively switch the training from autoregressive generation to non-autoregressive generation. Experiments on four benchmark translation datasets show that the proposed method achieves good improvement (more than 1 BLEU score) over previous NAT baselines in terms of translation accuracy, and greatly speed up (more than 10 times) the inference process over AT baselines.

AB The training objective of neural machine translation (NMT) is to minimize the loss between the words in the translated sentences and those in the references. In NMT, there is a natural correspondence between the source sentence and the target sentence. However, this relationship has only been represented using the entire neural network and the training objective is computed in word-level. In this paper, we propose a sentence-level agreement module to directly minimize the difference between the representation of source and target sentence. The proposed agreement module can be integrated into NMT as an additional training objective function and can also be used to enhance the representation of the source sentences. Empirical results on the NIST Chinese-to-English and WMT English-to-German tasks show the proposed agreement module can significantly improve the NMT performance.

AB Yoruba is a widely spoken West African language with a writing system rich in tonal and orthographic diacritics. With very few exceptions, diacritics are omitted from electronic texts, due to limited device and application support. Diacritics provide morphological information, are crucial for lexical disambiguation, pronunciation and are vital for any Yoruba text-to-speech (TTS), automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Reframing Automatic Diacritic Restoration (ADR) as a machine translation task, we experiment with two different attentive Sequence-to-Sequence neural models to process undiacritized text. On our evaluation dataset, this approach produces diacritization error rates of less than 5%. We have released pre-trained models, datasets and source-code as an open-source project to advance efforts on Yoruba language technology.

TI A 2-LEVEL KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION FOR MACHINE TRANSLATION - LEXICAL
   SEMANTICS AND TENSE ASPECT
SO LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB This paper proposes a two-level model that integrates contemporary theories of tense and aspect with lexical semantics. The model is intended to be extensible to realms outside of the temporal domain (e.g., the spatial domain). The integration of tense and aspect with lexical-semantics is especially critical in machine translation because of the lexical selection process during generation: there is often a number of lexical connective and tense/aspect possibilities that may be produced from a lexical semantic representation, which, as defined in the model presented here, is largely underspecified. Temporal/aspectual information from the source-language sentence constrains the choice of target-language terms. In turn, the target-language terms limit the possibilities for generation of tense and aspect. Thus, there is a two-way communication channel between the two processes.

AB We discuss the translation of a simple imperative programming language, high-level random access machines, to the rule-based graph programming language GP 2. By proving the correctness of the translation and using GP 2 programs for encoding and decoding between arbitrary graphs and so-called register graphs, we show that GP 2 is computationally complete in a strong sense: every computable graph function can be directly computed with a GP 2 program which transforms input graphs into output graphs. Moreover, by carefully restricting the form of rules and control constructs in translated programs, we identify simple graph programs as a computationally complete sublanguage of GP 2. Simple programs use unconditional rules and abandon, besides other features, the non deterministic choice of rules. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this paper we propose Translation based Face Recognition using Fusion of LL and SV coefficients. The novel concept of translating many sample images of a single person into one sample per person is introduced. The face database images are preprocessed using Gaussian filter and DWT to generate LL coefficients. The support vectors (SV) are obtained from support vector machine (SVM) for LL coefficients. The LL and SVs are fused using arithmetic addition to generate final features. The face database and test face image features are compared using Euclidean Distance (ED) to compute the performance parameters. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Retrieval Effectiveness of Machine Translated Queries
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB This article describes and evaluates various information retrieval models used to search document collections written in English through submitting queries written in various other languages, either members of the Indo-European family (English, French, German, and Spanish) or radically different language groups such as Chinese. This evaluation method involves searching a rather large number of topics (around 300) and using two commercial machine translation systems to translate across the language barriers. In this study, mean average precision is used to measure variances in retrieval effectiveness when a query language differs from the document language. Although performance differences are rather large for certain languages pairs, this does not mean that bilingual search methods are not commercially viable. Causes of the difficulties incurred when searching or during translation are analyzed and the results of concrete examples are explained.

SO MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Sign language (SL) is the best suited communication medium for hearing impaired people. Even with the advancement of technology, there is a communication gap between the hearing impaired and hearing people. The aim of this research work is to bridge this gap by developing an automatic system that translates the speech to Indian Sign Language using Avatar (SISLA). The whole system works in three phases: (i) The first phase includes the speech recognition (SR) of isolated words for English, Hindi and Punjabi in speaker independent environment (ii) The second phase translates the source language into Indian Sign Language (ISL) (iii) HamNoSys based 3D avatar represents the ISL gestures. The four major implementation modules for SISLA include: requirement analysis, data collection, technical development and evaluation. The multi-lingual feature makes the system more efficient. The training and testing speech sample files for English (12,660, 4218), Hindi (12,610, 4211) and Punjabi (12,600, 4193) have been used to train and test the SR models. Empirical results of automatic machine translation show that the proposed trained models have achieved the minimum accuracy of 91%, 89% and 89% for English, Punjabi and Hindi respectively. Sign language experts have also been used to evaluate the sign error rate through feedback. Future directions to enhance the proposed system using non-manual SL features along with the sentence level translation has been suggested. Usability testing based on survey results confirm that the proposed SISLA system is suitable for education as well as communication purpose for hearing impaired people.

AB The scarcity of parallel data is a major limitation for Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems, in particular for translation into morphologically rich languages (MRLs). An important way to overcome the lack of parallel data is to leverage target monolingual data, which is typically more abundant and easier to collect. We evaluate a number of techniques to achieve this, ranging from back-translation to random token masking, on the challenging task of translating English into four typologically diverse MRLs, under low-resource settings. Additionally, we introduce Inflection Pre-Training (or PT-Inflect), a novel pre-training objective whereby the NMT system is pre-trained on the task of re-inflecting lemmatized target sentences before being trained on standard source-to-target language translation. We conduct our evaluation on four typologically diverse target MRLs, and find that PT-Inflect surpasses NMT systems trained only on parallel data. While PT-Inflect is outperformed by back-translation overall, combining the two techniques leads to gains in some of the evaluated language pairs.

AB Reward mechanism of reinforcement learning alleviates the inconsistency between training and evaluation in neural machine translation. However, the model still incapable to learn ideal parameters when rewards are sparse or a weak sampling strategy is adopted. Therefore, we propose a reinforcement learning method based on prioritized experience replay to deal with the problems. The model experiences are obtained through reinforcement learning. Then they are stored in a experience buffer and assigned priorities according to the value of experience. The experience with higher priority in buffer will be extracted by model to optimize the parameters during training phase. To verify the robustness of our method, we not only conduct experiments on English-German and Chinese-English, but also perform on agglutinative language Mongolian-Chinese. Experimental results show that our work consistently outperforms the baselines.

AB Neural machine translation (NMT) goes through rapid development because of the application of various deep learning techs. Especially, how to construct a more effective structure of NMT attracts more and more attention. Transformer is a state-of-the-art architecture in NMT. It replies on the self-attention mechanism exactly instead of recurrent neural networks (RNN). The Multi-head attention is a crucial part that implements the self-attention mechanism, and it also dramatically affects the scale of the model. In this paper, we present a new Multi-head attention by combining convolution operation. In comparison with the base Transformer, our approach can reduce the number of parameters effectively. And we perform a reasoned experiment. The result shows that the performance of the new model is similar to the base model.

AB Automatic image annotation provides means for users to search image collections on the semantic level using natural language queries. In the past, statistical machine translation models have been successfully applied to automatic image annotation. A problem with this approach is that, due to the skewed distribution of term frequency for annotation words, common words have been overly favored, which leaves little room for uncommon words to be used in auto-annotations. In contrast, studies on information retrieval have revealed that uncommon words are at least as important as common words since they are also often used in users' queries. Unlike the previous studies where a single type of statistical translation model is considered for automatic image annotation, in this paper, we studied two types of statistical translation models: a forward translation model, which translates visual information into textual words, and a backward model, which translates textual words into visual images. In particular, we propose a new statistical translation model, named regularization-based symmetric statistical translation model, which combines strength of forward and backward models to alleviate the problem of overly favoring common words. Our empirical studies with the Corel dataset have shown that the proposed model performs considerably better than the existing translation model and a state-of-the-art approach for automatic image annotation.

AB Sentence correction has been an important emerging issue in computer-assisted language learning. However, existing techniques based on grammar rules or statistical machine translation are still not robust enough to tackle the common errors in sentences produced by second language learners. In this paper, a relative position language model and a parse template language model are proposed to complement traditional language modeling techniques in addressing this problem. A corpus of erroneous English-Chinese language transfer sentences along with their corrected counterparts is created and manually judged by human annotators. Experimental results show that compared to a state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical machine translation system, the error correction performance of the proposed approach achieves a significant improvement using human evaluation.

AB Chunk analysis method is a new idea proposed in recent years in developing new machine translation methods. Chinese chunk analysis plays a very important role in machine translation from Chinese to foreign languages. The automatic segmentation of Chinese chunks is the basis of Chinese chunk analysis. It is important for processing real text and corpus construction. This paper presents a method for automatic segmentation of Chinese chunks based on 3-layers neural networks. The corpus we used has been processed with Chinese word segmentation and phrase identification and tagging. In the neural networks model, the input data is the segmentation situation of every character and its combinations with neighbor characters in a Chinese sentence. The output is the segmentation results of every character in a Chinese sentence. The preliminary results show that the method is feasible and effective.

AB Round-trip Machine Translation (MT) is a popular choice for paraphrase generation, which leverages readily available parallel corpora for supervision. In this paper, we formalize the implicit similarity function induced by this approach, and show that it is susceptible to nonparaphrase pairs sharing a single ambiguous translation. Based on these insights, we design an alternative similarity metric that mitigates this issue by requiring the entire translation distribution to match, and implement a relaxation of it through the Information Bottleneck method. Our approach incorporates an adversarial term into MT training in order to learn representations that encode as much information about the reference translation as possible, while keeping as little information about the input as possible. Paraphrases can be generated by decoding back to the source from this representation, without having to generate pivot translations. In addition to being more principled and efficient than round-trip MT, our approach offers an adjustable parameter to control the fidelity-diversity trade-off, and obtains better results in our experiments.

AB This paper presents the utilisation of Response Surface Methodology (RSM) as the prediction tool for the laser micro-machining process. Laser internal micro-channels machined using pulsed Nd:YVO4 laser in polycarbonate were investigated. The experiments were carried out according to 3 3 factorial Design of Experiment (DoE). In this work the three input process set as control parameters were laser power, P; pulse repetition frequency, PRF; and sample translation speed, U. Measured responses were the channel width and the micro-machining operating cost per metre of produced micro-channels. The responses were sufficiently predicted within the set micro-machining parameters limits. Two factorial interaction (2FI) and quadratic polynomial regression equations for both responses were constructed. It is proposed that the developed prediction equations can be used to find locally optimal micro-machining process parameters under experimental and operational conditions.

This research aims to study and collect necessary features to construct the Korean-Thai lexicon for natural language processing (NLP) and speech processing researches. The research method used for study was that of (1) creating Korean-Thai lexicon consisting of 7 parts : Korean words, Korean Revised Romanization, part of speech, sub part of speech, special characteristic, Thai meaning and description of meaning (2) Korean transcription. According to lack of useful tools for the Korean-Thai machine translation, therefore we have a proposal for creating Korean-Thai lexicon for machine translation. The Korean-Thai lexicon consists of 36,000 Korean words. As it would take a lot of time and effort to gather enough Korean words to cover all domains, Korean Revised Romanization was applied for some words such as terminology, names and places.

TI Machine Normalization: Bringing Social Media Text from Non-Standard to
   Standard Form
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB User-generated text in social media communication (SMC) is mainly characterized by non-standard form. It may contain code switching (CS) text, a widespread phenomenon in SMC, in addition to noisy elements used, especially in written conversations (use of abbreviations, symbols, emoticons) or misspelled words. All of these factors constitute a wall in front of text mining applications. Common text mining tools are dedicated to standard use of standard languages but cannot deal with other forms, especially written text in social media. To overcome these problems, in this work we present our solution for the normalization of nonstandard use of standard and non-standard languages (dialects) in SMC text with the use of existent resources and tools. The main processing in our solution consists of CS normalization from multiple to one language by the use of a machine translation-like approach. This processing relies on a linguistic approach of CS, which aims at identifying automatically the translation source and target languages (without human intervention). The remaining processing operations concern the normalization of SMC special expressions and spelling correction of out-of-vocabulary words. To preserve the coded-switched sentence meaning across translation, we adopt a knowledge-based approach for word sense translation disambiguation reinforced with a multilingual vertical context. All of these processes are embedded in what we refer to as the machine normalization system. Our solution can be used as a front-end of text mining processing, enabling the analysis of SMC noisy text. The conducted experiments show that our system performs better than considered baselines.

TI Human-machine interface-based wheelchair control using piezoelectric
   sensors based on face and tongue movements
SO HELIYON
AB Hand-free control of assistive mobility devices has been developed to serve people with movement disabilities at all levels. In this study, we demonstrate a human???machine interface (HMI) system that uses piezoelectric sensors to translate face and tongue movements. This study addresses two issues. First, we used six piezoelectric sensors to acquire muscular facial signals to observe the sensor positions and features during winking and tongue movements. Second, we verified the proposed HMI for online simulated wheelchair control. Twelve volunteers participated in the experiment. A maximum classification accuracy of 98.0% from the maximum and mean parameters could be achieved using the linear discriminant analysis and K-nearest neighbors classification algorithms. Using the proposed algorithm, command translation patterns for command translation reached more than 95% of the average classification accuracy with 0.5 s of the window for command creation. For online control of the simulated wheelchair, the results showed high efficiency based on the time condition. The combination of winking and tongue actions results in a steering time of the same magnitude as that of joystick-based control, which is less than twice the time of a joystick. Hence, the proposed system can be further implemented in a powered wheelchair for quadriplegic patients who retain control in the face or tongue muscles.

TI Translation of pronominal anaphora between English and Spanish:
   Discrepancies and evaluation
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
AB This paper evaluates the different tasks carried out in the translation of pronominal anaphora in a machine translation (MT) system. The MT interlingua approach named AGIR (Anaphora Generation with an Interlingua Representation) improves upon other proposals presented to date because it is able to translate intersentential anaphors, detect co-reference chains, and translate Spanish zero pronouns into English-issues hardly considered by other systems. The paper presents the resolution and evaluation of these anaphora problems in AGIR with the use of different kinds of knowledge (lexical, morphological, syntactic, and semantic). The translation of English and Spanish anaphoric third-person personal pronouns (including Spanish zero pronouns) into the target language has been evaluated on unrestricted corpora. We have obtained a precision of 80.4% and 84.8% in the translation of Spanish and English pronouns, respectively. Although we have only studied the Spanish and English languages, our approach can be easily extended to other languages such as Portuguese, Italian, or Japanese.

TI Domain Adaptation and Multi-Domain Adaptation for Neural Machine
   Translation: A Survey
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
AB The development of deep learning techniques has allowed Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models to become extremely powerful, given sufficient training data and training time. However, systems struggle when translating text from a new domain with a distinct style or vocabulary. Fine-tuning on in-domain data allows good domain adaptation, but requires sufficient relevant bilingual data. Even if this is available, simple fine-tuning can cause overfitting to new data and catastrophic forgetting of previously learned behaviour. We survey approaches to domain adaptation for NMT, particularly where a system may need to translate across multiple domains. We divide techniques into those revolving around data selection or generation, model architecture, parameter adaptation procedure, and inference procedure. We finally highlight the benefits of domain adaptation and multi -domain adaptation techniques to other lines of NMT research.

TI The Development Strategy of the Multimedia Fusion Mode of Big Data
   Technology in Japanese Translation Teaching
SO ADVANCES IN MULTIMEDIA
AB With the in-depth development of economic globalization, the connection and communication between China and other countries in the world are increasingly deepened, so the task of cultivating translation talents in various languages is particularly important. In the teaching process, teachers mainly focus on explaining theoretical knowledge and lack of classroom interaction, resulting in a boring and dull classroom atmosphere. At the same time, it does not pay attention to the practice of translation after class and often pays attention to interpretation and neglects written translation, which leads many students to think that Japanese translation is difficult and boring, which greatly reduces students' enthusiasm for learning. In view of this situation, the application of multimedia technology in Japanese translation teaching proposes that the application of multimedia technology in Japanese teaching can improve the interest of students in Japanese learning and improve the teaching effect of Japanese teaching. Firstly, this paper constructs a logistic semantic ontology model based on automatic calibration of Japanese translation, extracts Japanese semantic features through this model, and performs relational mapping on the extracted Japanese semantic features. Starting from each aspect, optimize the automatic calibration algorithm of Japanese translation, find the best semantic relevance feature in each sentence, and realize automatic optimization, thereby improving the automatic calibration of Japanese translation machines and the registration of subject words.

TI Paraphrase Identification by Using Clause-Based Similarity Features and
   Machine Translation Metrics
SO COMPUTER JOURNAL
AB Paraphrase identification is a semantic text similarity task which is an important part of many natural language processing applications. Existing methods use vector space models, word co-occurrence information, lexical databases, parsers and machine translation (MT) evaluation metrics to find text similarity. However, other aspects such as negations, inverse relations and semantic roles of the sentences are also very much important in identifying paraphrases. Furthermore, the semantics of the sentences are hidden when the sentences are complex. We propose an approach to find similarity between pair of texts by considering all these factors. We have used an approach to determine set of clauses present in the texts by resolving conjunctions in complex sentences that identify hidden triples from the text. The approach extracts clause-based similarity features namely concept score, relation score, proposition score and word score from the texts. We have combined these similarity features along with MT metrics features to identify whether the texts are paraphrases or not using Support Vector Machine model. We have evaluated our methodology to measure the paraphrase similarity for Microsoft Research corpus. The statistical tests namely -fold paired -test and McNemar's test show that including clause-based features significantly improved the performance. Also, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, 1-measure and f1-measure.

AB Translation of named entities (NE), including proper names, temporal and numerical expressions, is very important in multilingual natural language processing, like crosslingual information retrieval and statistical machine translation. In this paper we present an integrated approach to extract a named entity translation dictionary from a bilingual corpus while at the same time improving the named entity annotation quality.
   Starting from a bilingual corpus where the named entities are extracted independently for each language, a statistical alignment model is used to align the named entities. An iterative process is applied to extract named entity pairs with higher alignment probability. This leads to a smaller but cleaner named entity translation dictionary and also to a significant improvement of the monolingual named entity annotation quality for both languages. Experimental result shows that the dictionary size is reduced by 51.8% and the annotation quality is improved from 70.03 to 78.15 for Chinese and 73.38 to 81.46 in terms of F-score.

SO BILINGUALISM-LANGUAGE AND COGNITION
AB The masked translation priming effect was examined in Chinese-English bilinguals using lexical decision and semantic categorization tasks in an effort to understand why the two tasks seem to produce different patterns of results. A machine-learning approach was used to assess the participant-based factors that contribute to the sizes of translation priming effects in these tasks. As expected, the participant-based factors that predicted translation priming effects did vary across tasks. Priming effects in lexical decision were associated with higher self-rated listening, reading, and writing abilities in English. Priming effects in semantic categorization were associated with more frequent use of English in daily life, spoken English proficiency, and self-rated listening proficiency in English. These results are discussed within the framework of Multilink, the logic of which is then expanded in an attempt to account for these task differences.

AB We present the task of Simultaneous Translation and Paraphrasing for Language Education (STAPLE). Given a prompt in one language, the goal is to generate a diverse set of correct translations that language learners are likely to produce. This is motivated by the need to create and maintain large, high-quality sets of acceptable translations for exercises in a language-learning application, and synthesizes work spanning machine translation, MT evaluation, automatic paraphrasing, and language education technology.
   We developed a novel corpus with unique properties for five languages (Hungarian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, and Vietnamese), and report on the results of a shared task challenge which attracted 20 teams to solve the task. In our meta-analysis, we focus on three aspects of the resulting systems: external training corpus selection, model architecture and training decisions, and decoding and filtering strategies. We find that strong systems start with a large amount of generic training data, and then fine-tune with in-domain data, sampled according to our provided learner response frequencies.

TI A method for reinforcing noun countability prediction
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB This paper proposes a method for reinforcing noun countability prediction, which plays a crucial role in demarcating correct determiners in machine translation and error detection. The proposed method reinforces countability prediction by introducing a novel heuristics called one countability per discourse. It claims that when a noun appears more than once in a discourse, all instances will share identical countability. The basic idea of the proposed method is that mispredictions can be corrected by efficiently using one countability per discourse heuristics. Experiments show that the proposed method successfully reinforces countability prediction and outperforms other methods used for comparison. In addition to its performance, it has two advantages over earlier methods: (i) it is applicable to any countability prediction method, and (ii) it requires no human intervention to reinforce countability prediction.

AB Hard Science Linguistics (HSL) is a new linguistic theory, first worked out in Yngve [1], developed from the insights into human language gained during the history of machine translation and similar efforts. Unlike most linguistic theories, HSL concerns itself with the details of how people communicate rather than on how sentences are parsed. From the start, HSL developed with an eye toward making its results scientifically valid, not in the sense of other linguistic theories but in the sense of physics or chemistry. Both the historical basis in machine translation for HSL and the attention paid to a scientifically valid formalism make HSL an attractive candidate for the development of large-scale computer models of communicative behavior. In this paper, I will use some "mixed domain" terminology in order to more quickly explain HSL in the space available.

AB The development of an experimental platform for studying Vortex Machining is presented. This process uses oscillating probes to generate localized vortices in polishing slurry in a region near to a workpiece surface. These vortices create material removal footprints having lateral dimensions typically measuring tens of micrometers. From studies of the process variables and subsequent machining footprints a number of process controls have been implemented and are discussed herein. These include a localized metrology frame to control specimen to probe position, coarse-fine translation axes for submicrometer motion control, closed-loop control of probe oscillation, and a slurry height control system. To illustrate the fidelity of these additional controls, the evolution from early machining footprints to the recent production of footprint arrays are presented. While process stability issues remain, machining footprints of near Gaussian shape having dimensions of 10-20 mu m diameter and 40 nm depth after machining for 30 min can be reproduced.

TI Modernizing historical documents: A user Study
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS
AB Accessibility to historical documents is mostly limited to scholars. This is due to the language barrier inherent in human language and the linguistic properties of these documents. Given a historical document, modernization aims to generate a new version of it, written in the modern version of the document's language. Its goal is to tackle the language barrier, decreasing the comprehension difficulty and making historical documents accessible to a broader audience. In this work, we proposed a new neural machine translation approach that profits from modern documents to enrich its systems. We tested this approach with both automatic and human evaluation, and conducted a user study. Results showed that modernization is successfully reaching its goal, although it still has room for improvement. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents an approach to model checking abstract state machines (ASMs) without the need for translation of the ASM specification into the modeling language of an existing model checker. Instead, our model checker [MC] SQUARE uses the Simulation capabilities of COREASM to build the state space, there by directly Supporting ASMs and circumventing a possible loss of expressiveness in a. translation process. This enables our approach to present. counterexamples and witnesses directly as sequences of ASM states and at the same time supports, the major features of COREASM like distributed ASMs, n-ary functions or extended rule forms. We show the applicability of this approach in a case study that also reveals possible improvements desirable for minimizing the duration needed for building the state space and its memory consumption.

AB Machine transliteration is an automatic method to generate characters or words in one alphabetical system for the corresponding characters in another alphabetical system. There has been increasing concern on machine transliteration as an assistant of machine translation and information retrieval. Three machine transliteration models, including "grapheme-based model", "phoneme-based model", and "hybrid model", have been proposed. However, there are few works trying to make use of correspondence between source grapheme and phoneme, although the correspondence plays an important role in machine transliteration. Furthermore there are few works, which dynamically handle source grapheme and phoneme. In this paper, we propose a new transliteration model based on an ensemble of grapheme and phoneme. Our model makes use of the correspondence and dynamically uses source grapheme and phoneme. Our method shows better performance than the previous works about 15 similar to 23% in English-to-Korean transliteration and about 15 similar to 43% in English-to-Japanese transliteration.

AB In the last decade, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) has experienced rapid growth in the software development community. In this context, model transformation occupies an important place that automates the transitions between development steps during the application production. To implement this transformation process, we require mastering languages and tools, but more importantly the semantic equivalence between the involved input and output metamodels. This knowledge is in general difficult to acquire, which makes transformation writing complex, time-consuming, and error-prone. In this paper, we propose a new model transformation by example approach to simplify model transformations, using Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). Our approach exploits the power of SMT by converting models in natural language texts and by processing them using models trained with IBM1 model.

AB System combination is an effective strategy to boost retrieval performance, especially in complex applications such as cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) where the aspects of translation and retrieval have to be optimized jointly. We focus on machine learning-based approaches to CUR that need large sets of relevance-ranked data to train high-dimensional models. We compare these models under various measures of orthogonality, and present an experimental evaluation on two different domains (patents, Wikipedia) and two different language pairs (Japanese-English, German-English). We show that gains of over 10 points in MAP/NDCG can be achieved over the best single model by a linear combination of the models that contribute the most orthogonal information, rather than by combining the models with the best standalone retrieval performance.

TI Ribosome heterogeneity in stem cells and development
SO JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY
AB Translation control is critical to regulate protein expression. By directly adjusting protein levels, cells can quickly respond to dynamic transitions during stem cell differentiation and embryonic development. Ribosomes are multisubunit cellular assemblies that mediate translation. Previously seen as invariant machines with the same composition of components in all conditions, recent studies indicate that ribosomes are heterogeneous and that different ribosome types can preferentially translate specific subsets of mRNAs. Such heterogeneity and specialized translation functions are very important in stem cells and development, as they allow cells to quickly respond to stimuli through direct changes of protein abundance. In this review, we discuss ribosome heterogeneity that arises from multiple features of rRNAs, including rRNA variants and rRNA modifications, and ribosomal proteins, including their stoichiometry, compositions, paralogues, and posttranslational modifications. We also discuss alterations of ribosome-associated proteins (RAPS), with a particular focus on their consequent specialized translational control in stem cells and development.

AB Corpus-based technology is very promising for speech-to-speech translation. However, the problem is that it is prohibitively expensive to build the vital resource, a large-scale corpus of bilingual dialogues covering many domains. We propose to substitute a combination of two different types of bilingual corpora: (1) a large-scale collection of basic sentences that covers many domains and (2) a small-scale collection of spoken dialogues that reflects the characteristics of the spoken utterances for the large-scale corpus of dialogues.
   With these two corpora, we have been building a translation module for a speech-to-speech translation system. By using the basic sentence corpus, we have achieved high-quality translations with several machine-learning approaches. Based on an analysis of the spoken dialogue corpus, we found that splitting utterances into parts and concatenating the translated parts is an effective way to translate the longer utterances that are inherent in a spoken dialogue.

This paper throws a glimpse into the strides made by such researchers. As UNL provides a language independent platform it eases out the decision making by accessing the valuable and meaningful information, which is otherwise a challenging errand. Thus it captures information and finds its major application in Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain. The paper is written with the intent to introduce its readers to the UNL framework and explain how it is being used to solve some real world problems.

AB Multiple morphological interpretations of word-forms is a bottleneck for different level of syntactico-semantic analyses of Natural Language (NL) sentences. Common vocabulary words of morphologically rich languages typically have more than one morphological analyses. However, if a word contains multiple morphological alternatives, one of them is appropriate with respect to the context where the word is used. Different text processing tasks including rule-based Machine Translation (MT) require morphological features of each surface word-form of the sentence. Therefore, given a context, an efficient procedure is needed to choose the appropriate morphological analysis of each word having multiple alternatives. In this paper, we propose a method to identify correct morphological analysis of each Bengali word-form by cancelling (or pruning) all such analyses which show context incompatibility.

AB It is a common practice in India to mix the words of English in Hindi and vice-versa. There are social, historical and political factors, that have contributed to such an usage. This has become much more prevalent with globalization and movement of people in metropolises.
   It is observed that the grammatical rules in construction of gender, number, verb-nominalization or forms, conform to that for the language (Hindi or English) used irrespective of their origin. The case of mixing of English verbs in a Hindi sentence is more complex in interpretation as compared to mixing of other parts of speech. In this paper, we present a strategy for translating verb forms that use English verbs in a Hindi sentence. We consider translating to pure Hindi and pure English forms.

AB State-of-the-art machine translation (MT) systems are typically trained to generate "standard" target language; however, many languages have multiple varieties (regional varieties, dialects, sociolects, non-native varieties) that are different from the standard language. Such varieties are often low-resource, and hence do not benefit from contemporary NLP solutions, MT included. We propose a general framework to rapidly adapt MT systems to generate language varieties that are close to, but different from, the standard target language, using no parallel (source-variety) data. This also includes adaptation of MT systems to low-resource typologically-related target languages.1 We experiment with adapting an English-Russian MT system to generate Ukrainian and Belarusian, an English-Norwegian Bokmal system to generate Nynorsk, and an English-Arabic system to generate four Arabic dialects, obtaining significant improvements over competitive baselines.

AB The standards for translating texts in specialized fields have become particularly rigorous with the increasing complexity of material and growing demand for its translation. While translations simply aimed at communication and produced by machine translation are proliferating, the need for reliable and high-quality translations is also increasing. The demand for expert-dependable legal translation is higher than ever, requiring competence-based training in the field of legal translation. This paper describes a guided-task framework for developing subject area competence at the earliest stage of an English-Arabic legal translation course. It presents the three most problematic phases of concept processing in legal translation in terms of: (a) legal systems; (b) branches of law; and (c) genre-based phraseology. The approach presented below is part of a more general study that aims to describe the first course in a series of three graduate courses on legal translation, each of them motivated by a guided-task framework that has the aim of developing three specific competences in legal translation: (a) legal concept processing=>subject area competence; (b) documentary research=>instrumental competence; and (c) legal rhetorics=>communicative and textual competence. In this paper we intend to focus on the first course of legal concept processing as a key prerequisite for legal knowledge development. We illustrate the relevance of addressing specific variables (legal systems, branches of law and genre-based phraseology) when analysing legal concepts in the text that is to be translated, before proceeding to the information search and communication, according to established formulae and conventions.

AB The use of Transformer based architectures has been extended in recent years, reaching the level of State of the Art (SOTA) in numerous tasks in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, despite the advantages of this architecture, it has some negative factors, such as the high number of parameters it uses. That is why the use of this type of architecture can become expensive for research teams with limited resources. New variants have emerged with the purpose of improving the efficiency of the Transformer architecture, addressing different aspects of it. In this paper we will focus on the development of a new architecture that seeks to reduce the memory consumption of the Transformer, meanwhile is able to achieve a SOTA result in two different datasets [14] for the Neural Machine Translation (NMT) task.

TI Dynamic regulation of eEF1A1 acetylation affects colorectal
   carcinogenesis
SO BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The dysregulation of the translation elongation factor families which are responsible for reprogramming of mRNA translation has been shown to contribute to tumor progression. Here, we report that the acetylation of eukaryotic Elongation Factor 1 Alpha 1 (eEF1A1/EF1A1) is required for genotoxic stress response and maintaining the malignancy of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. The evolutionarily conserved site K439 is identified as the key acetylation site. Tissue expression analysis demonstrates that the acetylation level of eEF1A1 K439 is higher than paired normal tissues. Most importantly, hyperacetylation of eEF1A1 at K439 negatively correlates with CRC patient survival. Mechanistically, CBP and SIRT1 are the major acetyltransferase and deacetylase of eEF1A1. Hyperacetylation of eEF1A1 at K439 shows a significant tumor-promoting effect by increasing the capacity of proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cells. Our findings identify the altered post-translational modification at the translation machines as a critical factor in stress response and susceptibility to colorectal carcinogenesis.

AB As technology advances, new hardware approaches are proposed to speed up software execution. However, every new added hardware feature must not change the underlying instruction set architecture (ISA), in order to avoid adaptation or recompilation of existing code. As binary translation allows the execution of binary codes of already compiled applications on different architectures, it opens new possibilities for designers, previously tied to a specific ISA and all its legacy hardware issues. The problem with binary translation is its inherent performance penalty: it will always take more cycles than the simple execution on the native machine. To address that, we propose a new mechanism based on a dynamic two-level binary translation system. While the first level is responsible for the BT de facto (in our first implemented case study, X86 to MIPS translations), the second level optimizes the already translated instructions to be executed on a dynamically adaptable reconfigurable architecture. This way, both software portability and performance are maintained.

AB The Web provides the largest data collection, which reflects language use in daily life. With the advent of new technology and the flood of information on the Web, it has become quite common to create new terms supporting new concepts and translate these terms into non-Latin languages with "transliteration" referring to "translation by sound". Cross-language natural language processing applications, such as machine translation and cross-language information retrieval, usually need a translation dictionary, which affects the quality of the applications. However, the transliteration lexicons are usually unregistered in the translation dictionary. To address the problem, here, we present a transliteration lexicon acquisition model that mines the Web for transliteration lexicons. In this paper we describe techniques of comparing phonetic-similarity to recognize transliteration pair candidates on the Web and of finding the correct transliteration pairs based on joint-validation. The techniques were evaluated against manually constructed transliteration lexicons. Our experiments revealed that the techniques effectively found transliteration lexicons on the Web.

TI Controlling Roma refugees with 'Google-Hungarian': Indexing deviance,
   contempt, and belonging in Toronto's linguistic landscape
SO LANGUAGE IN SOCIETY
AB This article investigates signage in the linguistic landscape of Toronto that is addressed to Hungarian-speaking Roma asylum applicants, focusing on multilingual public-order signs that convey warnings or prohibitions. Such signs are produced by institutional agents who often use machine translation (Google Translate), yielding ungrammatical texts in ostensible Hungarian. Drawing on ethnographic interviews, the article explores the indexicalities that such multilingual signs have for different groups of participants, including Roma addressees and English-speaking overreaders'. While institutions may view the production of multilingual signs as indexical of open-mindedness towards migrants, Roma interviewees may see public-order signs as indexing racial stereotypes by presupposing deviant behavior, and may view ungrammaticality as indexing an unwillingness to engage in face-to-face interaction.

AB Non-autoregressive translation (NAT) predicts all the target tokens in parallel and significantly speeds up the inference process. The Conditional Masked Language Model (CMLM) is a strong baseline of NAT. It decodes with the Mask-Predict algorithm which iteratively refines the output. Most works about CMLM focus on the model structure and the training objective. However, the decoding algorithm is equally important. We propose a simple, effective, and easy-to-implement decoding algorithm that we call MaskRepeat-Predict (MR-P). The MR-P algorithm gives higher priority to consecutive repeated tokens when selecting tokens to mask for the next iteration and stops the iteration after target tokens converge. We conduct extensive experiments on six translation directions with varying data sizes. The results show that MR-P significantly improves the performance with the same model parameters. Specifically, we achieve a BLEU increase of 1.39 points in the WMT'14 En-De translation task. Our code is available at https : / / github . com/chynphh/MaskRepeat-Predict.

AB Question answering (QA) over a knowledge graph (KG) is a task of answering a natural language (NL) query using the information stored in KG. In a real-world industrial setting, this involves addressing multiple challenges including entity linking, multi-hop reasoning over KG, etc. Traditional approaches handle these challenges in a modularized sequential manner where errors in one module lead to the accumulation of errors in downstream modules. Often these challenges are inter-related and the solutions to them can reinforce each other when handled simultaneously in an end-to-end learning setup. To this end, we propose a multi-task BERT based Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to address these challenges. Through experimental analysis, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach on one publicly available and one proprietary dataset.

AB Pronouns are frequently omitted in pro-drop languages, such as Chinese, generally leading to significant challenges with respect to the production of complete translations. To date, very little attention has been paid to the dropped pronoun (DP) problem within neural machine translation (NMT). In this work, we propose a novel reconstruction-based approach to alleviating DP translation problems for NMT models. Firstly, DPs within all source sentences are automatically annotated with parallel information extracted from the bilingual training corpus. Next, the annotated source sentence is reconstructed from hidden representations in the NMT model. With auxiliary training objectives, in terms of reconstruction scores, the parameters associated with the NMT model are guided to produce enhanced hidden representations that are encouraged as much as possible to embed annotated DP information. Experimental results on both Chinese English and Japanese English dialogue translation tasks show that the proposed approach significantly and consistently improves translation performance over a strong NMT baseline, which is directly built on the training data annotated with DPs.

AB Neural machine translation often adopts the fine-tuning approach to adapt to specific domains. However, nonrestricted fine-tuning can easily degrade on the general domain and over-fit to the target domain. To mitigate the issue, we propose PRUNE-TUNE, a novel domain adaptation method via gradual pruning. It learns tiny domain-specific sub-networks during fine-tuning on new domains. PRUNE-TUNE alleviates the over-fitting and the degradation problem without model modification. Furthermore, PRUNE-TUNE is able to sequentially learn a single network with multiple disjoint domain-specific sub-networks for multiple domains. Empirical experiment results show that PRUNE-TUNE outperforms several strong competitors in the target domain test set without sacrificing the quality on the general domain in both single and multi-domain settings. The source code and data are available at https://github.com/ohlionel/Prune-Tune.

AB We consider the problem of making efficient use of heterogeneous training data in neural machine translation (NMT). Specifically, given a training dataset with a sentence-level feature such as noise, we seek an optimal curriculum, or order for presenting examples to the system during training. Our curriculum framework allows examples to appear an arbitrary number of times, and thus generalizes data weighting, filtering, and fine-tuning schemes. Rather than relying on prior knowledge to design a curriculum, we use reinforcement learning to learn one automatically, jointly with the NMT system, in the course of a single training run. We show that this approach can beat uniform baselines on Paracrawl and WMT English-to-French datasets by +3.4 and +1.3 BLEU respectively. Additionally, we match the performance of strong filtering baselines and hand-designed, state-of-the-art curricula.

AB One challenge of Myanmar-English statistical machine translation system is that the output (translated English sentence) can often be ungrammatical. To address this issue, this paper presents an ongoing grammar checker as a second language by using trigram language model and rule based model. It is able to solve distortion, deficiency and make smooth the translated English sentences. We identify the sentences with chunk types and generate context free grammar (CFG) rules for recognizing grammatical relations of chunks. There are three main tasks to reduce grammar errors: detecting the sentence patterns in chunk level, analyzing the chunk errors and correcting the errors. Such a three level scheme is a useful framework for a chunk based grammar checker. Experimental results show that the proposed grammar checker can improve the correctness of translated English sentences.

These designs have been developed using the knowledge of the different manufacturing process and defects that occur in mould and die tools. The similarities in the two novel hybrid manipulators are: Nearly all used serial kinematics chains that implement parallelograms nonlinear translations. The designs differ in the manner the -pallelograms are used to achieve linear translations. Moreover, motions are achieved differently in these designs.
   The mechanical architectures and kinematics capabilities of the serial manipulators are presented. Finally, the kinematics capabilities of the developed manipulators are compared with those of selected 5 axis milling machine.

AB Zero pronouns (ZPs) are frequently omitted in pro-drop languages, but should be recalled in non-pro-drop languages. This discourse phenomenon poses a significant challenge for machine translation (MT) when translating texts from pro-drop to non-pro-drop languages. In this paper, we propose a unified and discourse-aware ZP translation approach for neural MT models. Specifically, we jointly learn to predict and translate ZPs in an end-to-end manner, allowing both components to interact with each other. In addition, we employ hierarchical neural networks to exploit discourse-level context, which is beneficial for ZP prediction and thus translation Experimental results on both Chinese)English and Japanese)English data show that our approach significantly and accumulatively improves both translation performance and ZP prediction accuracy over not only baseline but also previous works using external ZP prediction models. Extensive analyses confirm that the performance improvement comes from the alleviation of different kinds of errors especially caused by subjective ZPs.

AB Few studies have been performed within cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) in the field of psychology and psychotherapy. The aim of this paper is to to analyze and assess the quality of available query translation methods for CLIR on a health portal for psychology. A test base of 100 user queries, 50 Multi Word Units (WUs) and 50 Single WUs, was used. Swedish was the source language and English the target language. Query translation methods based on machine translation (MT) and dictionary look-up were utilized in order to submit query translations to two search engines: Google Site Search and Quick Ask. Standard IR evaluation measures and a qualitative analysis were utilized to assess the results. The lexicon extracted with word alignment of the portal's parallel corpus provided better statistical results among dictionary look-ups. Google Translate provided more linguistically correct translations overall and also delivered better retrieval results in MT.

TI Efficient and Retargetable Dynamic Binary Translation on Multicores
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
AB Dynamic binary translation (DBT) is a core technology to many important applications such as system virtualization, dynamic binary instrumentation, and security. However, there are several factors that often impede its performance: 1) emulation overhead before translation; 2) translation and optimization overhead; and 3) translated code quality. The issues also include its retargetability that supports guest applications from different instruction-set architectures (ISAs) to host machines also with different ISAs-an important feature to system virtualization. In this work, we take advantage of the ubiquitous multicore platforms, and use a multithreaded approach to implement DBT. By running the translator and the dynamic binary optimizer on different cores with different threads, it could off-load the overhead incurred by DBT on the target applications; thus, afford DBT of more sophisticated optimization techniques as well as its retargetability. Using QEMU (a popular retargetable DBT for system virtualization) and Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) as our building blocks, we demonstrated in a multithreaded DBT prototype, called Hybrid-QEMU (HQEMU), that it could improve QEMU performance by a factor of 2.6x and 4.1x on the SPEC CPU2006 integer and floating point benchmarks, respectively, for dynamic translation of x86 code to run on x86-64 platforms. For ARM codes to x86-64 platforms, HQEMU can gain a factor of 2.5x speedup over QEMU for the SPEC CPU2006 integer benchmarks. We also address the performance scalability issue of multithreaded applications across ISAs. We identify two major impediments to performance scalability in QEMU: 1) coarse-grained locks used to protect shared data structures, and 2) inefficient emulation of atomic instructions across ISAs. We proposed two techniques to mitigate those problems: 1) using indirect branch translation caching (IBTC) to avoid frequent accesses to locks, and 2) using lightweight memory transactions to emulate atomic instructions across ISAs. Our experimental results show that for multithread applications, HQEMU achieves 25x speedups over QEMU for the PARSEC benchmarks.

TI Biochemical aspects of bacterial strategies for handling the incomplete
   translation processes
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB During protein synthesis in cells, translating ribosomes may encounter abnormal situations that lead to retention of immature peptidyl-tRNA on the ribosome due to failure of suitable termination processes. Bacterial cells handle such situations by employing three systems that rescue the stalled translation machinery. The transfer messenger RNA/small protein B (tmRNA/SmpB) system, also called the trans-translation system, rescues stalled ribosomes by initiating template switching from the incomplete mRNA to the short open reading frame of tmRNA, leading to the production of a protein containing a C-terminal tag that renders it susceptible to proteolysis. The ArfA/RF2 and ArfB systems rescue stalled ribosomes directly by hydrolyzing the immature peptidyl-tRNA remaining on the ribosome. Here, the biochemical aspects of these systems, as clarified by recent studies, are reviewed.

TI Small and Large Ribosomal Subunit Deficiencies Lead to Distinct Gene
   Expression Signatures that Reflect Cellular Growth Rate
SO MOLECULAR CELL
AB Levels of the ribosome, the conserved molecular machine that mediates translation, are tightly linked to cellular growth rate. In humans, ribosomopathies are diseases associated with cell-type-specific pathologies and reduced ribosomal protein (RP) levels. Because gene expression defects resulting from ribosome deficiency have not yet been experimentally defined, we systematically probed mRNA, translation, and protein signatures that were either unlinked from or linked to cellular growth rate in RP-deficient yeast cells. Ribosome deficiency was associated with altered translation of gene subclasses, and profound general secondary effects of RP loss on the spectrum of cellular mRNAs were seen. Among these effects, growth-defective 60S mutants increased synthesis of proteins involved in proteasome-mediated degradation, whereas 40S mutants accumulated mature 60S subunits and increased translation of ribosome biogenesis genes. These distinct signatures of protein synthesis suggest intriguing and currently mysterious differences in the cellular consequences of deficiency for small and large ribosomal subunits.

AB Various language modeling issues in a speech-to-speech translation system are described in this paper. First, the language models for the speech recognizer need to be adapted to the specific domain to improve the recognition performance for in-domain utterances, while keeping the domain coverage as broad as possible. Second, when a maximum entropy based statistical natural language generation model is used to generate target language sentence as the translation output, serious inflection and synonym issues arise, because the compromised solution is used in semantic representation to avoid data sparseness problem. We use N-gram models as a post-processing step to enhance the generation performance. When an interpolated language model is applied to a Chinese-to-English translation task, the translation performance, measured by an objective metric of BLEU, improves substantially to 0.514 from 0.318 when we use the correct transcription as input. Similarly, the BLEU score is improved to 0.300 from 0.194 for the same task when the input is speech data.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB We present ResMLP, an architecture built entirely upon multi-layer perceptrons for image classification. It is a simple residual network that alternates (i) a linear layer in which image patches interact, independently and identically across channels, and (ii) a two-layer feed-forward network in which channels interact independently per patch. When trained with a modern training strategy using heavy data-augmentation and optionally distillation, it attains surprisingly good accuracy/complexity trade-offs on ImageNet. We also train ResMLP models in a self-supervised setup, to further remove priors from employing a labelled dataset. Finally, by adapting our model to machine translation we achieve surprisingly good results. We share pre-trained models and our code based on the Timm library.

AB Enriching a pronunciation dictionary with phonological variation is a challenging task, not yet solved despite several decades of research, in particular for speech-to-text transcription of real world data where it is important to cover different pronunciation variants. This paper proposes two alternative methods, inspired by machine translation, to derive pronunciation variants from an initial lexicon with limited variations. In the first case, an n-best pronunciation list is extracted directly from a machine translation tool, used as a grapheme-to-phoneme (g2p) converter. The second is a novel method based on a pivot approach, previously used for the paraphrase extraction task, and here applied as a post-processing step to the g2p converter. Some preliminary speech recognition experiments with the automatically generated pronunciation variants are reported using Quaero development data.

AB Despite constant improvements in machine translation quality, automatic poetry translation remains a challenging problem due to the lack of open-sourced parallel poetic corpora, and to the intrinsic complexities involved in preserving the semantics, style and figurative nature of poetry. We present an empirical investigation for poetry translation along several dimensions: 1) size and style of training data (poetic vs. non-poetic), including a zeroshot setup; 2) bilingual vs. multilingual learning; and 3) language-family-specific models vs. mixed-language-family models. To accomplish this, we contribute a parallel dataset of poetry translations for several language pairs. Our results show that multilingual fine-tuning on poetic text significantly outperforms multilingual fine-tuning on non-poetic text that is 35X larger in size, both in terms of automatic metrics (BLEU, BERTScore, COMET) and human evaluation metrics such as faithfulness (meaning and poetic style). Moreover, multilingual fine-tuning on poetic data outperforms bilingual fine-tuning on poetic data. (1)

AB In this paper we describe our joint submission (JU-Saarland) from Jadavpur University and Saarland University in the WMT 2019 news translation shared task for English-Gujarati language pair within the translation task subtrack. Our baseline and primary submissions are built using a Recurrent neural network (RNN) based neural machine translation (NMT) system which follows attention mechanism followed by fine-tuning using in-domain data. Given the fact that the two languages belong to different language families and there is not enough parallel data for this language pair, building a high quality NMT system for this language pair is a difficult task. We produced synthetic data through back-translation from available monolingual data. We report the automatic evaluation scores of our English-Gujarati and Gujarati-English NMT systems trained at word, byte-pair and character encoding levels where RNN at word level is considered as the baseline and used for comparison purpose. Our English-Gujarati system ranked in the second position in the shared task.

TI Concept-based speech-to-speech translation using maximum entropy models
   for statistical natural concept generation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB The IBM Multilingual Automatic Speech-To-Speech TranslatOR (MASTOR) system is a research prototype developed for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Babylon/CAST speech-to-speech machine translation program. The system consists of cascaded components of large-vocabulary conversational spontaneous speech recognition, statistical machine translation, and concatenative text-to-speech synthesis. To achieve highly accurate and robust conversational spoken language translation, a unique concept-based speech-to-speech translation approach is proposed that performs the translation by first understanding the meaning of the automatically recognized text. A decision-tree based statistical natural language understanding algorithm extracts the semantic information from the input sentences, while a natural language generation (NLG) algorithm predicts the translated text via maximum-entropy-based statistical models. One critical component in our statistical NLG approach is natural concept generation (NCG). The goal of NCG is not only to generate the correct set of concepts in the target language, but also to produce them in an appropriate order. To improve maximum-entropy-based concept generation, a set of new approaches is proposed. One approach improves concept sequence generation in the target language via forward-backward modeling, which selects the hypothesis with the highest combined conditional probability based on both the forward and backward generation models. This paradigm allows the exploration of both the left and right context information in the source and target languages during concept generation. Another approach selects bilingual features that enable maximum-entropy-based model training on the preannotated parallel corpora. This feature is augmented with word-level information in order to achieve higher NCG accuracy while minimizing the total number of distinct concepts and, hence, greatly reducing the concept annotation and natural language understanding effort. These features are further expanded to multiple sets to enhance model robustness. Finally, a confidence threshold is introduced to alleviate data sparseness problems in our training corpora. Experiments show a dramatic concept generation error rate reduction of more than 40% in our speech translation corpus within limited domains significant improvements of both word error rate and BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score are also achieved in our experiments on speech-to-speech translation.

AB The task of sentence and paragraph alignment is essential for preparing parallel texts that are needed in applications such as machine translation. The lack of sufficient linguistic data for under-resourced languages like Persian is a challenging issue. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid sentence and paragraph alignment model on Persian-English parallel documents based on simple linguistic features as well as length similarity between sentences and paragraphs of source and target languages. We apply a small bilingual dictionary of Persian-English nouns, punctuation marks, and length similarity as alignment metrics. We combine these features in a linear model and use genetic algorithm to learn the linear equation weights. Evaluation results show that the extracted features improve the baseline model which is only a length-based one.

TI Web-based pattern learning for named entity translation in
   Korean-Chinese cross-language information retrieval
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB Named entity (NE) translation plays an important role in many applications, such as information retrieval and machine translation, In this paper, we focus on translating NEs from Korean to Chinese in order to improve Korean-Chinese cross-language information retrieval (KCIR). The ideographic nature of Chinese makes NE translation difficult because one syllable may map to several Chinese characters. We propose a hybrid NE translation system. First, we integrate two online databases to extend the coverage of our bilingual dictionaries. We use Wikipedia as a translation tool based on the inter-language links between the Korean edition and the Chinese or English editions. We also use Naver.com's people search engine to find a query name's Chinese or English translation. The second component of our system is able to learn Korean-Chinese (K-C), Korean-English (K-E), and English-Chinese (E-C) translation patterns from the web. These patterns can be used to extract K-C, K-E and E-C pairs from Google snippets. We found KCIR performance using this hybrid configuration over five times better than that a dictionary-based configuration using only Naver people search. Mean average precision was as high as 0.3385 and recall reached 0.7578. Our method can handle Chinese, Japanese. Korean. and non-CJK NE translation and improve performance of KCIR substantially.

AB In order to recognize shaft orbits exactly and quickly, a novel recognition method based on Walsh spectrum and support vector machine is proposed in this paper. Firstly, distance vector between the point on the shaft orbit and its center is calculated and obtained. Secondly, the distance vector is transformed by Walsh orthogonal matrix, and obtained Walsh spectrum has property of invariance to rotation, scaling and translation. Thirdly, Walsh spectrum, as feature of shaft orbit, is trained by support vector machine, and classfing functions are obtained. Finally, the remaining samples are tested by the classfing functions, and experimental results are encouraging which demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.

AB The revival of artificial intelligence (AI) a few years ago has often been attributed to the success of machine learning (ML), especially the branch of ML known as deep learning (DL). Since the introduction of workable DL, numerous success stories have been widely reported: board games, autonomous driving vehicles, natural language translation, voice recognition, etc. However, for machines to exhibit a high degree of intelligence, they need more than the ability to learn. Indeed, heavy reliance on ML has resulted in widely publicized mishaps that negatively affect people in unexpected ways. For healthcare and other mission-critical applications, intelligent machines need to perform dependably to earn and maintain the trust of human users. To this end, it is necessary to take a holistic view toward AI, one that encompasses multiple facets of what constitutes intelligence. Specifically, this paper previews what thinking machines would be capable of by taking into consideration a machine's ability to abstract and reason, in addition to its ability to learn.

AB Though computer technology has brought about virtual manufacturing to expedite design and analysis through simulation and visualization, machines remain essential, as ultimately products need to be made. This paper presents a new type of 5-axis parallel machine tool based on a 3 degrees of freedom parallel platform manipulator with base mounted prismatic actuators. This machine tool is different from the Stewart platform type parallel machine tool in that its feed motion in X-direction is realized by the worktable on which work-piece is fixed and the parallel manipulator sliding on the gantry structure of the machine tool is responsible for the translation along Y-direction instead of the movable platform of the manipulator. Due to this special architecture, the workspace in X-direction and Y-direction of the new machine tool is enlarged greatly. And its rigidity is higher because of the adaptation of gantry structure. This machine tool is controlled by a PC based NC system in simultaneous 5 axes control mode.

SO NEURAL COMPUTATION
AB In classical computation, rational-and real-weighted recurrent neural networks were shown to be respectively equivalent to and strictly more powerful than the standard Turing machine model. Here, we study the computational power of recurrent neural networks in a more biologically oriented computational framework, capturing the aspects of sequential interactivity and persistence of memory. In this context, we prove that so-called interactive rational-and real-weighted neural networks show the same computational powers as interactive Turing machines and interactive Turing machines with advice, respectively. A mathematical characterization of each of these computational powers is also provided. It follows from these results that interactive real-weighted neural networks can perform uncountably many more translations of information than interactive Turing machines, making them capable of super-Turing capabilities.

AB We address the problem of Transliteration Equivalence. determining whether a pair or works in two different languages (e.g. Auden,) are name transliterations or not. This problem is at, the heart of Alining Name Transliterations (MINT) From various sources or multilingual text. data including parallel, comparable. and non-comparable corpora and multilingual ne vs streams. MINT is useful ill several cross-language tasks including Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR), Machine Translation (NIT), anti Cross-Language Named Entity Retrieval. We propose a novel approach to Transliteration Equivalence using language-neutral representations of names. The key idea is to consider name transliterations in two languages as two views of same semantic object and compute a low-dimensional common feature space using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). Similarity of the mimes in the common feature space forms the basis for classifying a pair of names as transliterations. We show v that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in the CUR task for (3 collections) and Tamil-English (2 collections)

TI Investigation of micro-cutting operations
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS & MANUFACTURE
AB The miniaturization of machine components is perceived by many as a requirement for the future technological development of a broad spectrum of products. Miniature components can provide smaller footprints, lower power consumption and higher heat transfer, since their surface-to-volume ratio is very high. To create these components, micro-meso-scale fabrication using miniaturized mechanical material removal processes has a unique advantage in creating 3D components using a variety of engineering materials. The motivation for micro-mechanical cutting stems from the translation of the knowledge obtained from the macro-machining domain to the micro-domain. However, there are challenges and limitations to micro-machining, and simple scaling cannot be used to model the phenomena of micro-machining operations. This paper surveys the current efforts in mechanical micro-machining research and applications, especially for micro-milling operations, and suggests areas from macro-machining that should be examined and researched for application to the improvement of micro-machining processes.

TI Multilingual Topic Models for Bilingual Dictionary Extraction
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB A machine-readable bilingual dictionary plays a crucial role in many natural language processing tasks, such as statistical machine translation and cross-language information retrieval. In this article, we propose a framework for extracting a bilingual dictionary from comparable corpora by exploiting a novel combination of topic modeling and word aligners such as the IBM models. Using a multilingual topic model, we first convert a comparable document-aligned corpus into a parallel topic-aligned corpus. This novel topic-aligned corpus is similar in structure to the sentence-aligned corpus frequently employed in statistical machine translation and allows us to extract a bilingual dictionary using a word alignment model.
   The main advantages of our framework is that (1) no seed dictionary is necessary for bootstrapping the process, and (2) multilingual comparable corpora in more than two languages can also be exploited. In our experiments on a large-scale Wikipedia dataset, we demonstrate that our approach can extract higher precision dictionaries compared to previous approaches and that our method improves further as we add more languages to the dataset.

AB Zero-day Web attacks are arguably the most serious threats to Web security, but are very challenging to detect because they are not seen or known previously and thus cannot be detected by widely-deployed signature-based Web Application Firewalls (WAFs). This paper proposes ZeroWall, an unsupervised approach, which works with an existing WAF in pipeline, to effectively detecting zero-day Web attacks. Using historical Web requests allowed by an existing signature-based WAF, a vast majority of which are assumed to be benign, ZeroWall trains a self-translation machine using an encoder-decoder recurrent neural network to capture the syntax and semantic patterns of benign requests. In real-time detection, a zero-day attack request (which the WAF fails to detect), not understood well by self-translation machine, cannot be translated back to its original request by the machine, thus is declared as an attack. In our evaluation using 8 real-world traces of 1.4 billion Web requests, ZeroWall successfully detects real zero-day attacks missed by existing WAFs and achieves high F1-scores over 0.98, which significantly outperforms all baseline approaches.

AB Recapture can be used to hide the traces left by some operations such as JPEG compression, copy-move, etc. However, various detectors have been proposed to detect recaptured images. To counter these techniques, in this paper, we propose a method that can translate recaptured images to fake "original images" to fool both human and machines. Our method is proposed based on Cycle-GAN which is a classic frame-work for image translation. To obtain better results, two improvements are proposed: (1) Considering that the difference between original and recaptured images focuses on the part of high frequency, high pass filter are used in the generator and discriminator to improve the performance. (2) In order to guarantee that the images content is not changed too much, a penalty term is added on the loss function which is the L1 norm of the difference between images before and after translation. Experimental results show that the proposed method can not only eliminate traces left by recapturing in visual effect but also change the statistical characteristics effectively.

TI HSPT: Practical Implementation and Efficient Management of Embedded

AB Cross-ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) system-level virtual machine has a significant research and practical value. For example, several recently announced virtual smart phones for iOS which run smart phone applications on x86 based PCs are deployed on cross-ISA system level virtual machines. Also, for mobile device application development, by emulating the Android/ARM environment on the more powerful x86-64 platform, application development and debugging become more convenient and productive. However, the virtualization layer often incurs high performance overhead. The key overhead comes from memory virtualization where a guest virtual address (GVA) must go through multilevel address translation to become a host physical address (HPA). The Embedded Shadow Page Table (ESPT) approach has been proposed to effectively decrease this address translation cost. ESPT directly maps GVA to HPA, thus avoid the lengthy guest virtual to guest physical, guest physical to host virtual, and host virtual to host physical address translation.
   However, the original ESPT work has a few drawbacks. For example, its implementation relies on a loadable kernel module (LKM) to manage the shadow page table. Using LKMs is less desirable for system virtual machines due to portability, security and maintainability concerns. Our work proposes a different, yet more practical, implementation to address the shortcomings. Instead of relying on using LKMs, our approach adopts a shared memory mapping scheme to maintain the shadow page table (SPT) using only "mmap" system call. Furthermore, this work studies the support of SPT for multi-processing in greater details. It devices three different SPT organizations and evaluates their strength and weakness with standard and real Android applications on the system virtual machine which emulates the Android/ ARM platform on x86-64 systems.

TI Identifying clinically applicable machine learning algorithms for glioma
   segmentation: recent advances and discoveries
SO NEURO-ONCOLOGY ADVANCES
AB Background While there are innumerable machine learning (ML) research algorithms used for segmentation of gliomas, there is yet to be a US FDA cleared product. The aim of this study is to explore the systemic limitations of research algorithms that have prevented translation from concept to product by a review of the current research literature.
   Methods We performed a systematic literature review on 4 databases. Of 11 727 articles, 58 articles met the inclusion criteria and were used for data extraction and screening using TRIPOD.
   Results We found that while many articles were published on ML-based glioma segmentation and report high accuracy results, there were substantial limitations in the methods and results portions of the papers that result in difficulty reproducing the methods and translation into clinical practice.
   Conclusions In addition, we identified that more than a third of the articles used the same publicly available BRaTS and TCIA datasets and are responsible for the majority of patient data on which ML algorithms were trained, which leads to limited generalizability and potential for overfitting and bias.

TI ISCG: An Intelligent Sensing and Caption Generation System for Object
   Detection and Captioning Using Deep Learning
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
AB Artificial intelligence has paved the way for different areas of computing such as speech recognition and translation, object detection, machine translation, and others. One of the goals of artificial general intelligence is to simulate human thinking and rationality within machines such that they are able to perceive their environment and then perform reasonable actions based on their perception. Creating a single model that performs every single task from visual perception to actuation is currently impossible. The system must be divided into several models each of which functions independently as well also contribute to the operation of the whole intelligent machine. In this paper, an intelligent sensing and caption generation (ISCG) system is proposed which is capable of detecting living/non-living objects and states of motion in images. The system consists of two separate modules of caption generator and intelligence engine with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for determining the different objects in the images. Our model yields state-of-the-art performance on benchmarked dataset.

AB Most apps available in the market for learning a new language are severely limited in terms of the number of languages users can learn on the platform ("target language"), as well as the language in which users can receive instruction ("source language"). Users are also limited by the fixed sets of lessons or the curriculum provided by these apps.
   In this work, we present an app framework which allows users free choice of source and target languages, as well as the flexibility in learning any input word, phrase or sentence of their choice using machine translation, whose performance and coverage of new languages is continuously improving. The app provides real-time feedback on the correctness of user pronunciation for any input using a text-based similarity metric, and helps learners practice their pronunciation until they perfect it. The app also provides a conversation platform where intermediate and advanced learners can engage in simple, real-time conversations with a chatbot on topics they are most likely to engage in while learning a new language. The conversation platform uses machine translation and speech-to-text tools to convert user query in any source language into an English query, gets the chatbot response and converts it back to the source language. This simple and novel approach allows users to freely converse in any language they want to practice, while having the chatbot trained only on English language-based corpus. The chatbot also integrates a novel intent classification module that classifies user query into one of several available topics, thereby enabling the chatbot to continue conversation with the user in the same topic. Finally, the chatbot is also capable of integrating search capability for specific queries (e.g., weather) with the help of available public domain resources so that it can provide users with real-time updates for such queries, thus making language learning fun and interesting.

   transformer framework
SO AICHE JOURNAL
AB Discovering and designing novel materials is a challenging problem as it often requires searching through a combinatorially large space of potential candidates, typically requiring great amounts of effort, time, expertise, and money. The ability to predict reaction outcomes without performing extensive experiments is, therefore, important. Toward that goal, we report an approach that uses context-free grammar-based representations of molecules in a neural machine translation framework. This involves discovering the transformations from the source sequence (comprising the reactants and agents) to the target sequence (comprising the major product) in the reaction. The grammar ontology-based representation hierarchically incorporates rich molecular-structure information, ensures syntactic validity of predictions, and overcomes over-parameterization in complex machine learning architectures. We achieve an accuracy of 80.1% (86.3% top-2 accuracy) and 99% syntactic validity of predictions on a standard reaction dataset. Moreover, our model is characterized by only a fraction of the number of training parameters used in other similar works in this area.

AB Recently, Deep Learning has been showing promising results in various Artificial Intelligence applications like image recognition, natural language processing, language modeling, neural machine translation, etc. Although, in general, it is computationally more expensive as compared to classical machine learning techniques, their results are found to be more effective in some cases. Therefore, in this paper, we investigated and compared one of the Deep Learning Architecture called Deep Neural Network (DNN) with the classical Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm for the malware classification. We studied the performance of the classical RF and DNN with 2, 4 & 7 layers architectures with the four different feature sets, and found that irrespective of the features inputs, the classical RF accuracy outperforms the DNN.

TI Semantic similarity and machine learning with ontologies
SO BRIEFINGS IN BIOINFORMATICS
AB Ontologies have long been employed in the life sciences to formally represent and reason over domain knowledge and they are employed in almost every major biological database. Recently, ontologies are increasingly being used to provide background knowledge in similarity-based analysis and machine learning models. The methods employed to combine ontologies and machine learning are still novel and actively being developed. We provide an overview over the methods that use ontologies to compute similarity and incorporate them in machine learning methods; in particular, we outline how semantic similarity measures and ontology embeddings can exploit the background knowledge in ontologies and how ontologies can provide constraints that improve machine learning models. The methods and experiments we describe are available as a set of executable notebooks, and we also provide a set of slides and additional resources at https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/machine-learning-with-ontologies.

AB The use of hand gestures is one of the commonly used communication approaches in human daily life, especially for the deaf and dumb. Hand gesture recognition can be adopted in human-computer interaction for converting hand gestures into words or sentences. Unfortunately, the same gesture may have diverse meanings in different countries. With the aim of eliminating the communication barriers between hearing-impaired communities and the general people, an efficient interaction user interface created with the augmented reality technique and leap motion controller for hand gesture recognition and translation is proposed in this paper. Five hand gestures captured by a leap motion controller were used for learning and recognizing through machine learning methodologies, including Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Convolutional Neural Network, Deep Neural Network and Decision Tree. The experimental results from different classifiers reveal the practicability of employing hand gesture recognition in text translation. The hand gesture recognition system should be capable of reducing the communication gap between hearing disabilities and the public so as to avoid deaf and mute people being isolated from society.

AB Dynamic binary analysis is difficult and burdensome. In practice, analysts always develop dynamic binary analyzers (DBAs) based on binary instrumentation tools (BITs), which are responsible for extracting information from a binary, monitoring or altering the execution of the binary. However, existing BITs either expose machine instructions to analysts or lack user-friendly APIs. Such problems result in a steep learning curve to grasp BITs and difficulties in eliminating bugs in DBAs. This work designs DBAF, a dynamic binary analysis framework that instruments binaries dynamically, conducts an online translation from machine code into an easy-to-handle intermediate representation (IR) and provides tens of APIs for IR processing. With DBAF, analysts can process binaries in the level of IR without the troubles to interpret machine instructions. Then, we develop five DBAs on top of DBAF, which are a division-by-zero protector, an IR counter, a memory tracer, a taint analyzer and a concolic executor. It demonstrates that DBAF can reduce the development effort for DBAs, especially the ones requiring semantic interpretation of instructions. Experiments show that DBAF brings about reasonable overhead in online translation.

SO PRECISION ENGINEERING-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR PRECISION
   ENGINEERING
AB Modeling of manufacturing tolerances for machining of a monolithic flexure hinge mechanism is presented. This modeling uses a computer-based method to generate the equations of motion for the mechanism and to predict the induced motion errors for various types of machining imperfections. This paper describes the modeling and the quantitative analysis of the motion errors using a well-known simple compound linear spring as an example. Based on the simulation results of the example problem, effects of the machining imperfection types on motion errors are generalized. The simulation demonstrates that the imperfection of the center position and the size of a machined hole provide an in-plane motion error X, Y, theta(Z). In addition, the machining error in the perpendicularity of the hole with respect to the plate also provides an out-of-plane parasitic error Z, theta(X), theta(Y). (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.

The formalisation focuses on a fragment of SysML used in the railway standardisation project EULYNX. It comprises the semantics of state machines, communication between objects via ports, and an action language called ASAL. It turns out that the generic execution model of SysML state machines can be elegantly specified using the rich data and process languages of mCRL2. This is a big step towards an automated translation as the generic model can be configured with a formal description of a specific set of state machines in a straightforward manner.

TI A comparison of different machine transliteration models
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
AB Machine transliteration is a method for automatically converting words in one language into phonetically equivalent ones in another language. Machine transliteration plays an important role in natural language applications such as information retrieval and machine translation, especially for handling proper nouns and technical terms. Four machine transliteration models - grapheme-based transliteration model, phoneme-based transliteration model, hybrid transliteration model, and correspondence-based transliteration model have been proposed by several researchers. To date, however, there has been little research on a framework in which multiple transliteration models can operate simultaneously. Furthermore, there has been no comparison of the four models within the same framework and using the same data. We addressed these problems by 1) modeling the four models within the same framework, 2) comparing them under the same conditions, and 3) developing a way to improve machine transliteration through this comparison. Our comparison showed that the hybrid and correspondence-based models were the most effective and that the four models can be used in a complementary manner to improve machine transliteration performance.

This data sets can effectively be used to address complex machine translation, multilingual terminology extraction, text-mining, or to benchmark information retrieval systems. Despite of the services offered by the user-friendliness of the web site that is made available to the public to access the publishing of the EU call for tenders, collecting and managing such kind of data is a great burden and consumes a lot of time and computing resources. This could explain why such a resource is not very (if any) exploited today by computer scientists or engineers in NLP. The aim of this paper is to describe two documented and easy-to-use multilingual corpora (one of them is a parallel corpus), extracted from the TED web source that we will release for the benefit of the NLP community.

TI Minimization strategies for maximally parallel multiset rewriting
   systems
SO THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Maximally parallel multiset rewriting systems (MPMRS) give a convenient way to express relations between unstructured objects. The functioning of various computational devices may be expressed in terms of MPMRS (e.g., register machines and many variants of P systems). In particular, this means that MPMRS are Turing universal; however, a direct translation leads to quite a large number of rules. Like for other classes of computationally complete devices, there is a challenge to find a universal system having the smallest number of rules. In this article we present different rule minimization strategies for MPMRS based on encodings and structural transformations. We apply these strategies to the translation of a small universal register machine (Korec (1996) 191) and we show that there exists a universal MPMRS with 23 rules. Since MPMRS are identical to a restricted variant of P systems with antiport rules, the results we obtained improve previously known results on the number of rules for those systems.

AB Commit messages can be regarded as the documentation of software changes. These messages describe the content and purposes of changes, hence are useful for program comprehension and software maintenance. However, due to the lack of time and direct motivation, commit messages sometimes are neglected by developers. To address this problem Jiang et al. proposed an approach (we refer to it as NMT), which leverages a neural machine translation algorithm to automatically generate short commit messages from code. The reported performance of their approach is promising, however, they did not explore why their approach performs well. Thus, in this paper, We first perform an in depth analysis of their experimental results. We find that (1) Most of the test diffd from which NMT can generate high-quality messages are similar to one or more training diffg at the token level. (2) About 16% of the commit messages in Jiang et alf s dataset are noisy due to being automatically generated or due to them describing repetitive trivial changes. (3) The performance of NMT declines by a large amount after removing such noisy commit messages. In addition, ALAIT is complicated and tune consuming Inspired by our first finding, we proposed a simpler and faster approach. named NNGen (Nearest Neighbor Generator), to generate concise commit messages using the nearest neighbor algorithm. Our experimental results show that NNGeri is over 2,600 times faster than NMT. and outperforms MIT in terms of BLEU fan accuracy measure that is widely used to evaluate machine translation systems) by 217, Finally, we also discuss some observations for the road ahead for automated commit message generation to inspire other researchers.

TI A Linguistic Analysis Metric in Detecting Ransomware Cyber-attacks
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB Originating and striking from anywhere, cyber-attacks have become ever more sophisticated in our modern society and users are forced to adopt increasingly good and vigilant practices to protect from them. Among these, ransomware remains a major cyber-attack whose major threat to end users (disrupted operations, restricted files, scrambled sensitive data, financial demands, etc.) does not particularly lie in number but in severity. In this study we explore the possibility of real-time detection of ransomware source through a linguistic analysis that examines machine translation relative to the Levenshtein Distance and may thereby provide important indications as to attacker's language of origin. Specifically, the aim of our research is to advance a metric to assist in determining whether an external ransom text is an indicator of either a human- or a machine-generated cyber-attack. Our proposed method works its argument on a set of Eastern European languages but is applicable to a large(r) range of languages and/or probabilistic patterns, being characterized by usage of limited resources and scalability properties.

AB Grammatically incorrect sentences result either from an unknown (possibly misspelled) word, an incorrect word order or even an omitted / redundant word. Sentences with these errors are a bottle-neck to NLP systems because they cannot be parsed correctly. Human beings are able to overcome this problem (either occurring in spoken or written language) since they are capable of doing a semantic similarity search to find out if a similar utterance has been heard before or a syntactic similarity search for a stored utterance that shares structural similarities with the input. If the syntactic and semantic analysis of the rest of the input can be done correctly, then a 'gap' that exists in the utterance, can be uniquely identified. In this paper, a system named SAUCOLA which is based on a concept lattice, that mimics human skills in resolving knowledge gaps that exist in written language is presented. The preliminary results show that correct stored sentences can be retrieved based on the words contained in the incorrect input sentence.

AB In this paper, a new structured-light machine vision technique based on radial basis function (RBF) neural network Is proposed and an inspection system Is established. General structured-light machine vision technique is usually based on accurate mathematical model and has some unavoidable and inexpressible errors. The proposed new technique is based on the training and learning of high-accuracy samples and overcomes the disadvantages of general technique and considerably improves the accuracy of machine vision Inspection systems. The experiment of applying this new technique to Inspect the position-control accuracy of a step-motor controlled stage with one linear translation axis shows that the RBF artificial neural network (ANN) is quite suitable to structured-light machine vision inspection system and structured-light machine vision Inspection technique Is really a novel and effective means for the inspection of position-control accuracy of motor control systems.

TI Post-editing machine translated subtitles: examining the effects of
   non-verbal input on student translators' effort
SO PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATION THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB Despite the potential productivity benefits of post-editing machine-translated outputs, post-editing practices have rarely been integrated into the workflow of subtitle production. This study examines the usefulness of employing post-editing methods during the subtitle production process by comparing student translators' translations to post-editing machine-translated subtitles. The amount of non-verbal input originating from the provided audiovisual materials was also included as an independent variable to identify its potential effect on the subtitle post-editing process. An experiment was then conducted that utilized an English-Chinese language pair and eye-tracking and keystroke-logging techniques to estimate student translators' effort during both translation and post-editing processes. The results of the study reveal that there is a significantly shorter production duration and fewer keystrokes typed during the post-editing process, with texts that contained increased non-verbal input proving to be significantly less cognitively demanding as evidenced by this study's observations of the fixation count and the overall duration.

AB In this study we investigate the potential of cross-lingual video retrieval for how-to questions. How-to questions are the most frequent among wh-questions and constitute almost 1% of the entire query stream. At the same time, how-to videos are popular on video sharing services. We analyzed a dataset of 500M+ Russian how-to questions. First, we carried out manual labelling of 1,000 queries that shows that about two thirds of all how-to question queries are potentially suitable for answers in the form of video in a language other than the language of the query. Then, we evaluated video retrieval quality for original and machine translated queries on a crowdsourcing platform. The evaluation reveals that machine translated questions yield video search quality comparable to the quality for original questions. Cross-lingual video search for how-to queries can improve recall and diversity of search results, as well as compensate the shortage of original content in emerging markets.

Then traditional template-based spike sorting is applied to discriminate single units. We investigate the effect of discriminating between identified units on Brain Machine Interface (BMI) decoding performance. We infer the stability of LIFE based on decoding performance with and without current BMI methods to counter-act electrode neural signal degradation.

AB Online video lecture repositories are rapidly growing and becoming established as fundamental knowledge assets. However, most lectures are neither transcribed nor translated because of the lack of cost-effective solutions that can give accurate enough results. In this paper, we describe a system architecture that supports the cost-effective transcription and translation of large video lecture repositories. This architecture has been adopted in the EU project transLectures and is now being tested on a repository of more than 9000 video lectures at the Universitat Politecnica de Valencia. Following a brief description of this repository and of the transLectures project, we describe the proposed system architecture in detail. We also report empirical results on the quality of the transcriptions and translations currently being maintained and steadily improved.

Inspired by recent ideas of data selection in machine translation, we develop a novel sample re-weighting scheme to assign sample-specific weights to the loss. Empirical study shows that our approach can be applied to many existing MRC models. Combined with contextual representations from pre-trained language models (such as ELMo), we achieve new state-of-the-art results on a set of MRC benchmark datasets.

We motivate and explain the concept of ISMs and describe their graphical representation with the CASE tool AutoFocus. The semantics of ISMs is defined using Higher-Order Logic within the theorem prover Isabelle. ISMs can be seen as high-level variants of Input/Output Automata, therefore we give also a semantic translation from ISMs to IOAs. By the "benchmark" example of Lowe's fix of the Needham-Schroeder protocol we demonstrate the strengths of the ISM approach to express and prove security properties in a both elegant and machine-checked way.

TI A Three-axis Translation Stage Using Opposing Wedges with Error

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRECISION ENGINEERING AND MANUFACTURING
AB We describe the development of a three-axis translation stage using wedges and its motion error compensation. The three-axis stage uses three wedges and is capable of translation in the vertical and longitudinal directions by controlling the horizontal separation of two opposing wedges. An independent linear translation stage is used to achieve displacement along the third axis. Compensation for straightness and positioning errors is achieved using the combined motion of the two opposing wedges and the motion of an independent linear stage. The straightness error in the vertical and horizontal directions through the longitudinal axis was 0.83 mu m and 1.65 mu m, respectively, before compensation and 0.22 mu m and 0.29 mu m with error compensation. The positioning error through the longitudinal axis was reduced from 8.96 mu m to 0.85 mu m.

AB Large, high-quality, sentence aligned parallel corpora are hard to come by, and this makes the Statistical Machine Translation enterprise more difficult. Even noisy corpora can provide useful translation resources not otherwise available though. Many investigations have used statistical methods to find word correspondences. Often such methods suffer from overgeneration, so to correct this we filter relevant translation candidates using a lexical post-process. This dictionary lookup is so effective in fact that it brings into question the value of the statistical methods. Using a dictionary lookup against all combinations of phrase pairs as a baseline, we compare three statistical methods and report the results. The three methods are (1) Mutual Information; (2) Expectation Maximization over word co-occurrence frequencies; and (3) EM over word alignments in every sentence. We also apply the dictionary lookup as a postprocess, to tackle overgeneration.

AB Translating legal text is generally considered to be difficult because legal text has some characteristics that make it different from other daily-use documents and legal text is usually long and complicated. In order boost the legal text translation quality, splitting an input sentence becomes mandatory. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on the logical structure of legal text sentence for dividing and translating legal text. We use a statistical learning method-Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) with rich linguistic information to recognize the logical structure of legal text sentence. We adapt the logical structure of legal text sentence to divide the sentence. By doing so, translation quality improves. Our experiments show that our approach can achieve better result for both Japanese-English and English-Japanese legal text translation by BLEU, NIST and TER score.

TI Partnering with AI: Intelligent writing assistance and instructed
   language learning
SO LANGUAGE LEARNING & TECHNOLOGY
AB In recent years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to significantly improved, or in some cases, completely new digital tools for writing. Systems for writing assessment and assistance based on automated writing evaluation (AWE) have been available for some time. That is the case for machine translation as well. More recent are synchronous feedback tools, such as Grammarly. That tool incorporates, as do others, predictive text technology, supplying automated sentence completion. Emerging writing assistance goes further, generating an entire text in response to a brief prompt. That capacity, along with significantly improved performance of both automated feedback systems and machine translation, is enabled through advances in AI, built on ever larger datasets and deep machine learning. While they differ in interface, functionality, and target audience, the available and emerging set of intelligent writing tools can be used to help learners improve the quality of their written texts. However, their use in instructional language learning has in some cases been controversial. In this column, we will be examining AI-enabled writing tools, reviewing the findings from research studies, and discussing their use in instructional settings. When integrated into writing instruction and practice, these digital tools have been found to offer significant benefits to both students and teachers. Teacher mediation aids learners in becoming informed consumers of language technology, as well as helping them to gain meta-linguistic knowledge. For researchers, intelligent writing tool use is optimally analyzed from a broad ecological perspective that examines the dynamic interplay of learner, software, and instructional environment.

AB Multilinguality permeates the web so that multilingual resources are fundamental in several NLP applications as cross language information retrieval as well as machine translation. Nonetheless the manual creation of such resources is very expensive. Semantic Web technologies can represent a great enhancement for NLP applications. In this paper, we show how Semantic Web technologies as an upper ontology based on well-founded semiotic theories can be applied to build multilingual lexical resources as Machine Readable Dictionaries (MRDs).

TI A Cross-ISA Kernelized High-Performance Parallel Emulator
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PARALLEL PROGRAMMING
AB Cross instruction-set-architecture (cross-ISA) virtual machine is the core technology to many important applications. However, traditional cross-ISA virtual machines have encountered several bottlenecks: (1) they cannot effectively utilize the host machine's peripheral hardware, (2) the utilization ratio of CPU for traditional virtual machines is low, (3) it is difficult to debug traditional cross-ISA virtual machines and (4) the traditional virtual machine emulates multicore processor sequentially. To solve these problems, a retargetable and high-performance system xKEMU is proposed in this paper. By reusing QEMU (Bellard in QEMU, a fast and portable dynamic translator. In: USENIX Annual Technical Conference, FREENIX Track, 2005) and Linux kernel http://www.kernel.org, 2015) as components, xKEMU could improve QEMU performance by a factor of about 1.24x on integer and memory performance for x86-64 to x86 emulation. The performance of virtual devices is also enhanced due to pass-through in the emulation of peripheral devices.

AB Translation tasks, including bilingual concordancing, demand an efficient space/time trade-off, which is not always easy to get due to the usage of huge text collections and the space consuming nature of time efficient text indexes. We propose a compact representation for monotonically aligned parallel texts, based on known compressed text indexes for representing the texts and additional uncompressed structures for the alignment. The proposed framework is able to index a collection of texts in main memory, occupying less space than the text size and with efficient query response time. The proposal supports any type of alignment granularity, a novelty in concordancing applications, allowing a flexible environment for linguistics working in all phases of a translation process. We present two alternatives for self-indexing the texts, and two alternatives for supporting the alignment, comparing the alternatives in terms of space/time performance.

AB Bilingual collocation correspondence is helpful to machine translation and second language learning. Existing techniques for identifying Chinese-English collocation correspondence suffer from two major problems. They are sensitive to the coverage of the bilingual dictionary and the insensitive to semantic and contextual information. This paper presents the ICT (Improved Collocation Translation) method to overcome these problems. For a given Chinese collocation, the word translation candidates extracted from a bilingual dictionary are expanded to improve the coverage. A new translation model, which incorporates statistics extracted from monolingual corpora, word semantic similarities from monolingual thesaurus and bilingual context similarities, is employed to estimate and rank the probabilities of the collocation correspondence candidates. Experiments show that ICT is robust to the coverage of bilingual dictionary. It achieves 50.1% accuracy for the first candidate and 73.1% accuracy for the top-3 candidates.

AB Cross-lingual natural language processing relies on translation, either by humans or machines, at different levels, from translating training data to translating test sets. However, compared to original texts in the same language, translations possess distinct qualities referred to as translationese. Previous research has shown that these translation artifacts influence the performance of a variety of cross-lingual tasks. In this work, we propose a novel approach to reducing translationese by extending an established bias-removal technique. We use the Iterative Null-space Projection (INLP) algorithm, and show by measuring classification accuracy before and after debiasing, that translationese is reduced at both sentence and word level. We evaluate the utility of debiasing translationese on a natural language inference (NLI) task, and show that by reducing this bias, NLI accuracy improves. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to debias translationese as represented in latent embedding space.

Our offline ST submission includes the direct end-to-end system and the so-called posterior tight integrated model, which is akin to the cascade system but is trained in an end-to-end fashion, where all the cascaded modules are end-to-end models themselves. For simultaneous ST, we combine hybrid automatic speech recognition (ASR) with a machine translation (MT) approach whose translation policy decisions are learned from statistical word alignments. Compared to last year, we improve general quality and provide a wider range of quality/latency trade-offs, both due to a data augmentation method making the MT model robust to varying chunk sizes. Finally, we present a method for ASR output segmentation into sentences that introduces a minimal additional delay.

AB Context-aware machine translation models are designed to leverage contextual information, but often fail to do so. As a result, they inaccurately disambiguate pronouns and polysemous words that require context for resolution. In this paper, we ask several questions: What contexts do human translators use to resolve ambiguous words? Are models paying large amounts of attention to the same context? What if we explicitly train them to do so? To answer these questions, we introduce SCAT (Supporting Context for Ambiguous Translations), a new English-French dataset comprising supporting context words for 14K translations that professional translators found useful for pronoun disambiguation. Using SCAT, we perform an in-depth analysis of the context used to disambiguate, examining positional and lexical characteristics of the supporting words. Furthermore, we measure the degree of alignment between the model's attention scores and the supporting context from SCAT, and apply a guided attention strategy to encourage agreement between the two.(1)

We participated in the Finnish -> English direction and got the best BLEU(33.0) score among all the participants. Our system is based on the self-attentional Transformer networks, into which we integrated the most recent effective strategies from academic research (e.g., BPE, back translation, multi-features data selection, data augmentation, greedy model ensemble, reranking, ConMBR system combination, and post-processing). Furthermore, we propose a novel augmentation method Cycle Translation and a data mixture strategy Big/Small parallel construction to entirely exploit the synthetic corpus. Extensive experiments show that adding the above techniques can make continuous improvements of the BLEU scores, and the best result outperforms the baseline (Transformer ensemble model trained with the original parallel corpus) by approximately 5.3 BLEU score, achieving the state-of-the-art performance.

AB Image Description Translation (IDT) is a task to automatically translate the image captions (i.e., image descriptions) into the target language. Current statistical machine translation (SMT) cannot perform as well as usual in this task because there is lack of topic information provided for translation model generation. In this paper, we focus on acquiring the possible contexts of the captions so as to generate topic models with rich and reliable information. The image matching technique is utilized in acquiring the relevant Wikipedia texts to the captions, including the captions of similar Wikipedia images, the full articles that involve the images and the paragraphs that semantically correspond to the images. On the basis, we go further to approach topic modelling using the obtained contexts. Our experimental results show that the obtained topic information enhances the SMT of image caption, yielding a performance gain of no less than 1% BLUE score.

AB Kinds of admissible support vector kernel called scaling kernels are presented in this paper. In fact, scaling kernels are the multi-dimensional scaling function with translation vectors and they are a set of complete basis in the sub-space of the square and integrable space. Hence, the goal of support vector machines (SVMs) based on scaling kernels is to find the optimal scaling coefficients in a scaling space. In term of theory, SVMs based on scaling kernels can approximate any objective function in some space by any precision. The results obtained by our simulations show the feasibility and validity of scaling kernels.

AB Recent studies have shown that translation quality of NMT systems can be improved by providing document-level contextual information. In general sentence-based NMT models are extended to capture contextual information from large-scale document-level corpora which are difficult to acquire. Domain adaptation on the other hand promises adapting components of already developed systems by exploiting limited in-domain data. This paper presents FIWU's system submission at WNGT, we specifically participated in Document level MT task for German-English translation. Our system is based on context-aware Transformer model developed on top of original NMT architecture by integrating contextual information using attention networks. Our experimental results show that providing previous sentences as context significantly improves the BLEU score as compared to a strong NMT baseline. We also studied the impact of domain adaptation on document level translation and were able to improve results by adapting the systems according to the testing domain.

We developed an end-to-end system to read a scanned hand-written Nyushu article, segment it into characters, link them to standard characters, and then translate the article into Mandarin Chinese. We propose several novel methods to address the new challenges introduced by noisy input and low resources, including Nyushu-specific feature selection for character segmentation and linking, and character linking lattice based Machine Translation. The end-to-end system performance indicates that the system is a promising approach and can serve as a standard benchmark.

   Control
SO TRENDS IN GENETICS
AB The ability of cells to grow and divide, differentiate and function, and even senesce is dependent on the fine-tuning of both gene and protein expression. Protein concentration in the cell is regulated not only at the transcriptional and post-translational levels, but also at the level of translation. Ribosomes, the molecular machines behind translation, were once considered to be an invariant driving force behind protein expression. However, studies over the past decade paint a rather different picture; namely, that ribosomes constitute an additional layer of regulatory control that might define which subsets of mRNAs are translated, to what extent, and to what purpose. Recent works summarized herein directly implicate ribosome heterogeneity and, in particular, ribosomal protein (RP) paralog specificity in regulating mRNA translation and control of the cellular translatome.

AB Machine transliteration is to translate the proper nouns in the source language according to its pronunciation into the target language. Recent orthographical based approach has improved the performance of machine translation significantly. Focusing on the transliteration unit alignment that provides a fundamental parameter for the model, this paper adopts a semi-supervised EMD approach-applying discriminative model over the original EM results. The experiment results prove it is substantial to the improvement of the transliteration performance.

AB Manually constructing a Wordnet is a difficult task, needing years of experts' time. As a first step to automatically construct full Wordnets, we propose approaches to generate Wordnet synsets for languages both resource-rich and resource-poor, using publicly available Wordnets, a machine translator and/or a single bilingual dictionary. Our algorithms translate synsets of existing Wordnets to a target language T, then apply a ranking method on the translation candidates to find best translations in T. Our approaches are applicable to any language which has at least one existing bilingual dictionary translating from English to it.

AB The design of a new six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) parallel-kinematics machine (PKM) has been proposed. Different from the conventional Stewart-Gough platform which has six extensible legs, the new PKM employs three identical RPRS legs to support the moving platform. Since all joint axes, excluding the three spherical joints at the leg ends, are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the base plane, this 6-DOF PKM presents a promising platform structure with decoupled-motion architecture (DMA) such that translation in a horizontal plane and rotation about a vertical axis are driven by the three active revolute joints, while translation in the vertical direction and rotation about horizontal axes are driven by the three active prismatic joints. As a result, this 6-DOF 3RPRS PKM with DMA has simple kinematics, large cylindrical reachable workspace, and high stiffness in the vertical direction. These features make it appropriate for light machining and heavy parts assembly tasks. Because of the DMA, a projection technique is employed for its kinematics analysis. By projecting the manipulator onto horizontal directions and vertical planes, the kinematics issues such as the displacement, singularity, and workspace analysis are significantly simplified.

We aim at improving multilingual translation and zero-shot performance in the constrained setting (without using any extra training data) through methods that encourage transfer learning and larger capacity modeling with advanced neural components. We build our end-to-end multilingual ST model based on Transformer, integrating techniques including adaptive speech feature selection, language-specific modeling, multi-task learning, deep and big Transformer, sparsified linear attention and root mean square layer normalization. We adopt data augmentation using machine translation models for ST which converts the zero-shot problem into a zero-resource one. Experimental results show that these methods deliver substantial improvements, surpassing the official baseline by > 15 average BLEU and outperforming our cascading system by > 2 average BLEU. Our final submission achieves competitive performance (runner up).(1)

We took part in the offline End-to-End English to German l'ED lectures translation task. We based our solution on our last year's submission(Potapczyk et al., 2019). We used a slightly altered Transformer(Vaswani et al., 2017) architecture with ResNet-like(He et al., 2016) convolutional layer preparing the audio input to Transformer encoder. To improve the model's quality of translation we introduced two regularization techniques and trained on machine translated Librispeech(Panayotov et al., 2015) corpus in addition to iwsltcorpus, TEDLIUM2(Rousseau et al., 2014) and Must_C(Di Gangi et al., 2019) corpora. Our best model scored almost 3 BLEU higher than last year's model. To segment 2020 test set we used exactly the same procedure as last year.

TI Dynamic binary translation and optimization
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS
AB We describe a VLIW architecture designed specifically as a target for dynamic compilation of an existing instruction set architecture. This design approach offers the simplicity and high performance of statically scheduled architectures, achieves compatibility with an established architecture, and makes use of dynamic adaptation. Thus, the original architecture is implemented using dynamic compilation, a process we refer to as DAISY (Dynamically Architected Instruction Set from Yorktown). The dynamic compiler exploits runtime profile information to optimize translations so as to extract instruction level parallelism. This work reports different design trade-offs in the DAISY system and their impact on final system performance. The results show high degrees of instruction parallelism with reasonable translation overhead and memory usage.

This paper proposes a novel method to extract parallel phrases from English-Vietnamese parallel corpora. In this method, we use predefined syntactic patterns and phrase translation probabilities for determining parallel phrases. The experiments are conducted on English-Vietnamese parallel corpora and have shown that our method increases 79.72% of F-score for obtaining parallel phrases in comparison with a baseline.

TI A roadmap to neural automatic post-editing: an empirical approach
SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB In a translation workflow, machine translation (MT) is almost always followed by a human post-editing step, where the raw MT output is corrected to meet required quality standards. To reduce the number of errors human translators need to correct, automatic post-editing (APE) methods have been developed and deployed in such workflows. With the advances in deep learning, neural APE (NPE) systems have outranked more traditional, statistical, ones. However, the plethora of options, variables and settings, as well as the relation between NPE performance and train/test data makes it difficult to select the most suitable approach for a given use case. In this article, we systematically analyse these different parameters with respect to NPE performance. We build an NPE "roadmap" to trace the different decision points and train a set of systems selecting different options through the roadmap. We also propose a novel approach for APE with data augmentation. We then analyse the performance of 15 of these systems and identify the best ones. In fact, the best systems are the ones that follow the newly-proposed method. The work presented in this article follows from a collaborative project between Microsoft and the ADAPT centre. The data provided by Microsoft originates from phrase-based statistical MT (PBSMT) systems employed in production. All tested NPE systems significantly increase the translation quality, proving the effectiveness of neural post-editing in the context of a commercial translation workflow that leverages PBSMT.

AB jHISC is an object-oriented processor with RISC core and architectural support for object instructions. It is a three-addressing machine instead of a stack machine as JVM. With instruction folding techniques, several JVM operations could be translated into fewer or one jHISC three-address machine code, and they execute more effectively. This paper presents an improved folding algorithm for jHISC V4.0 in which the bytecodes are divided into six types and treat the intermediate operation result as P type operations and our instruction folding algorithm is further implemented in hardware level to further reduce the translation burden in software level.

SO ISIS
AB Three years after Guidobaldo del Monte, marchese of Montebaroccio, published his Mechanicorum liber (1577), Count Giulio Savorgnano, a military engineer and general of Venetian artillery, had the work translated into Italian. An analysis of the process of this literal translation under the auspices of an engineer reveals a series of intellectual and material translations through which mechanics became a powerful, paradigmatic science-translations between ancient and contemporary knowledge, between geometrical and physical demonstration, between elite and practical learning, and between philosophy and political economy. For Guidobaldo, each of these transformations both depended on and defined how the texts of mechanics were positioned in relation to the everyday practices and temporal goals of mechanical work. This study centers on Guidobaldo's articulation of mechanics from his perspective as a nobleman in the duchy of Urbino and examines his use of social, mathematical, and philosophical authority in his own authorship of mechanical science.

The systems and languages communities have built many tools for error detection, fault isolation, architecture translation, performance measurement, simulation, and optimization using this approach of modifying executables. Currently, however tools of this sort are difficult and time-consuming to write and are usually closely tied to a particular machine and operating system. EEL supports a machine- and system-independent editing model that enables tool builders to modify an executable without being aware of the derails of the underlying architecture or operating system or being concerned with the consequences of deleting instructions or adding foreign code.

TI STEMMING IMPACT ANALYSIS ON INDONESIAN QURAN TRANSLATION AND THEIR
   EXEGESIS CLASSIFICATION FOR ONTOLOGY INSTANCES
SO IIUM ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The current gap that appears in the Quran ontology population domain is stemming impact analysis on Indonesian Quran translation and its exegesis (Tafsir) to develop ontology instances. The existing studies of stemming effect analysis were performed in various languages, datasets, stemming methods, cases, and classifiers. However, there is a lack of literature that studies the stemming influence on instance classification for Quran ontology with different datasets, classifiers, Quran translations, and their exegesis in Indonesian. Based on this problem, our study aims to investigate and analyse the stemming impact on instance classification results using Indonesian Quran translation and their exegesis as datasets with multiple supervised classifiers. Our classification framework consists of text pre-processing, feature extraction, and text classification stage. Sastrawi stemmer was used to perform stemming operation in the text pre-processing stage. Based on our experiment results, it was found that Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and stemming operation owns the best classification performance, i.e., 70.75% for average accuracy and 71.55% for average precision in Indonesian Quran translation dataset on 20% test data size. While in 30% test data size, SVM and TF-IDF with stemming process own the best classification performance, i.e., 67.30% for average accuracy and 68.10% for average precision in Ministry of Religious Affairs Indonesia dataset. Furthermore, in this study, it was also discovered that the Backpropagation Neural Network has the most precision and accuracy reduction due to the negative impact of stemming operations.

TI Reciprocal secretion of proteins by the bacterial type III machines of
   plant and animal pathogens suggests universal recognition of mRNA
   targeting signals
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Bacterial pathogens of both animals and plants use type III secretion machines to inject virulence proteins into host cells. Although many components of the secretion machinery are conserved among different bacterial species, the substrates for their type III pathways are not. The Yersinia type III machinery recognizes some secretion substrates via a signal that is encoded within the first 15 codons of yop mRNA. These signals can be altered by frameshift mutations without affecting secretion of the encoded polypeptides, suggesting a mechanism whereby translation of yop mRNA is coupled to the translocation of newly synthesized polypeptide. We report that the type III machinery of Erwinia chrysanthemi cloned in Escherichia coli recognizes the secretion signals of yopE and yopQ. Pseudomonas syringae AvrB and AvrPto, two proteins exported by the recombinant Erwinia machine, can also be secreted by the Yersinia type II pathway. Mapping AvrPto sequences sufficient for the secretion of reporter fusions in Yersinia revealed the presence of an mRNA secretion signal. We propose that II conserved components of type III secretion machines may recognize signa is that couple mRNA translation to polypeptide secretion.

AB Virtual machine technology is rapidly emerging as an important component of future computer systems. Full virtualization with dynamic binary translation outperforms paravirtualization and hardware assisted virtualization in x86 CPU virtualization. Previous full virtualization techniques are implemented in software without any hardware assist. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a novel hardware assisted full virtualization technique-Dynamic Binary Translation in DIMM (DBTIM. We integrate a reconfigurable dynamic binary translation chip into a DIMM. DBTIM could be inserted to the mainboard as a normal DIMM, hence easily making the host CPU virtualizable. We also implement a DBTIM prototype on FPGA. We analyze our new approach and compare it with other modern virtualization techniques. We demonstrate that the new technique in this paper could provide full virtualization to all kinds of CPU architectures, including x86, with better virtualization capability, better software and hardware compatibility, better performance and lower overheads.

We explored both cascade and end-to-end system on three language tracks (en-de, en-zh and en-ja), and we chose the cascade one as our primary submission. For the automatic speech recognition (ASR) model of cascade system, there are three ASR models including Conformer, S2T-Transformer and U2 trained on the mixture of five datasets. During inference, transcripts are generated with the help of domain controlled generation strategy. Context-aware reranking and ensemble based robustness enhancement strategy are proposed to produce better ASR outputs. For machine translation part, we pretrained three translation models on WMT21 dataset and fine-tuned them on indomain corpora. Our cascade system shows more competitive performance than the known offline systems in the industry and academia.

AB It is generally agreed that the ultimate goal of research into Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is to provide a technology which can benefit applications; however, most of the work in this area has focused on the development of application-independent models. Taking Machine Translation as the application, we argue that this strategy is not appropriate, since many aspects of algorithm design, such as the sense repository, depend on the application. We present evidence for this by investigating the disambiguation of nine verbs in English-Portuguese translations.

AB In this paper, we propose a Java accelerator named Javelin (Java enhanced language interpreter) based on a hardware translation method. To overcome performance hurdles in translation based accelerators, we assign registers in the host processor for frequently accessed pointers, entries of the stack, local variables, and intermediate values during bytecode execution. We propose an operand exchange unit (OPEXU) for maximizing compatibility and a stack management unit (SMU) with a smart exception handler for minimizing the overhead by stack exceptions. Javelin increases hardware cost less than 9,000 gates including a 256-byte SRAM and does not decrease the clock frequency of host processor. In our experiments, Javelin provides approximately 24.3 times better performance than that of the pure software VM in terms of execution time and it also reduces the memory traffic during Java processing about 81.9%. Consequently, Javelin provides an energy efficient solution for Java processing.

AB Statistical speech translation can be achieved by an integrated search procedure that produces speech recognition and translation at the same time. Based on finite-state transducers and Viterbi search, the approach forces the rewriting of the target language in a set of modified units (with zero, one or more original words) to preserve the monotonicity of the search over the speech signal without changing the word order in the target language. In this paper, we analyse the effect of non-monotonic word alignments in two different Spanish to English translation tasks (speech-aimed small-vocabulary Verbmobil task and text-aimed large-vocabulary European Parliament task), revealing the most frequent cross patterns and experimenting with reordering strategies to improve the transducer probabilities. In addition, some prelimiary results are presented on introducing POS-tagging and lemmatization, as well as some preprocessing such as categorization, to help improving the training of the system.

AB Textual entailment (TE) relation determines whether a text can be inferred from another. Given two texts, one is called the "Text" denoted as T and the other one is called "Hypothesis" denoted as H, the process of textual entailment is to decide whether or not the meaning of H can be logically inferred from the meaning of T. Different semantic, lexical and vector based similarity metrics are used as features for different machine learning classifiers to take the entailment decision in this study. We also considered two machine translation evaluation metrics, namely BLEU and METEOR, as similarity metrics for this task. We carried out the experiments on the datasets released in the shared tasks on textual entailment organized in RTE-1, RTE-2, and RTE-3. We experimented with different feature combinations. Best accuracies were obtained on different feature combinations by different classifiers. The best classification accuracies obtained by our system on the RTE-1, RTE-2 and RTE-3 dataset are 55.91%, 58.88% and 63.38% respectively. MT evaluation metrics based feature alone produced the best classification accuracies of 53.9%, 59.3%, and 62.8% on the RTE-1, RTE-2, and RTE-3 datasets respectively.

TI A Systematic Literature Review on Multimodal Machine Learning:
   Applications, Challenges, Gaps and Future Directions
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Multimodal machine learning (MML) is a tempting multidisciplinary research area where heterogeneous data from multiple modalities and machine learning (ML) are combined to solve critical problems. Usually, research works use data from a single modality, such as images, audio, text, and signals. However, real-world issues have become critical now, and handling them using multiple modalities of data instead of a single modality can significantly impact finding solutions. ML algorithms play an essential role in tuning parameters in developing MML models. This paper reviews recent advancements in the challenges of MML, namely: representation, translation, alignment, fusion and co-learning, and presents the gaps and challenges. A systematic literature review (SLR) was applied to define the progress and trends on those challenges in the MML domain. In total, 1032 articles were examined in this review to extract features like source, domain, application, modality, etc. This research article will help researchers understand the constant state of MML and navigate the selection of future research directions.

AB The World Health Organization estimates that approximately 466 million people have some level of hearing loss. This significant portion of the world population faces several challenges in accessing information. The main problem is that the languages in which the deaf community can perceive and produce in a natural way are sign languages (SL). An alternative to dealing with this would be the translation of the content from an oral language to SL. However, when it comes to accessing online content, it is necessary to consider translating SL not only for audio or video content, but also for more complex text on websites. This is already a difficult task by itself for the volume involved, and it also addresses some additional challenges, related to the high cost of human interpreter service and the great dynamism of Internet content. In this context, one of the most promising approaches to such scenarios is the use of machine translation applications from oral to sign language. This work evaluates the use of neural network models usually used in natural language processing for the production of LIBRAS glosses from texts in Portuguese. Using a 2(k) factorial experiment design, we evaluated the impact of several aspects such as database size, types of models and training parameters in the quality of automatic translation obtained. The results of the experiments were very promising and point to an initial superiority of the LightConv model in most of the evaluated scenarios.

The aim of this system is to eliminate the language barriers in emergency situation. It translates spoken questions from English into French, Japanese and Finnish in three medical sub-domains (headache, chest pain and abdominal pain), using a vocabulary of about 250-400 words per sub-domain. The architecture is a compromise between fixed-phrase translation on one hand and complex linguistically-based systems oil the other. Recognition is guided by a Context Free Grammar Language Model compiled front a general unification grammar, automatically specialised for the domain. We present an evaluation of this initial prototype that shows the advantages of this grammar-based approach for this particular translation task in term of both reliability and use.

AB Blockchain replicates the execution of transactions in a decentralized network of machines, supporting trust since each machine, by itself, cannot violate the rules for the transactions. Many applications of blockchains are related to the exchange of tokens, ie. valuable units that can be native, such as bitcoin and ether, or implemented in software, through smart contracts. Standards ensure token interoperability among decentralized applications of a certain platform, but they are general enough to be used in other contexts as well. A trend in blockchain is to implement such standards from a platform to another one, easing the design challenges with trusted and widely-used specifications. Exploiting the target language semantic can result in technological advantages with more efficient contracts. This paper presents a re-engineering of OpenZeppelin's implementation of the ERC-20 standard for fungible tokens on Takamaka, a subset of Java for programming smart contracts in the Hotmoka blockchain. It starts with a literal translation from Solidity to Takamaka, but then describes a novel implementation for making snapshots of tokens, based on tree maps, that is possible in Java, but not in Solidity, and shows that it is much more efficient than the literal translation in Java from Solidity, within the Java Virtual Machine.

Dialog-level context is used to predict whether the Iraqi response is likely to contain names and the intra-sentence context is used to determine words that are named entities. While we do not address the problem of translating out-of-vocabulary (OOV) NEs in spoken utterances, we show that our approach is capable of translating OOV names in text input. To demonstrate efficacy of our approach, we present results on internal test set as well as the 2008 June DARPA TRANSTAC name evaluation set.

TI An indirect method of industrial robot programming for machining tasks
   based on STEP-NC
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING
AB STEP-NC is the next generation of data models between CAD/CAM and CNC systems and it aims at providing a digital thread for CNC manufacturing. After more than a decade of investigation, the STEP-NC technology is still underdeveloped. As the industrial robots are getting more and more capable of taking on machining operations, it is necessary to couple the robot for machining towards new STEP-NC standards. The paper presents an indirect method of industrial robot programming for machining tasks by applying standard ISO 10303-238. A methodology has been established to enable programming and simulation of industrial robots for machining, where information on the machining project is saved at a high information level in the STEP-NC format, which can be readily exchanged between different users for machining, either on machine tools or robots for machining. The methodology also includes the developed robot language converter for STEP-NC programme translation to robot programming language for machining tasks. Developed programming method verification has been performed by simulation in STEP-NC Machine environment using configured virtual robot and after that through several real experiments of drawing the toolpath in 3-axis machining tasks on available vertical articulated robot.

AB The requirements of next-generation of networks have imposed a multi-dimensional/ directional complexity over network management. As a result, the only way forward is through the automation of administrative and management procedures of networks. However, the best solution for having an automation system is through Machine Learning. The next-generation network services have complex requirements that can be determined using service graphs. However, autonomous translation of high-level user requirements to a service graph is itself a complex problem and requires an intelligent solution. Hence in this manuscript, a GAN (generative adversarial network) based fake service graph generation and DRL (Deep reinforcement learning) based optimized graph selection mechanism is considered for automatic intent translation.

AB Standard methods in deep learning for natural language processing fail to capture the compositional structure of human language that allows for systematic generalization outside of the training distribution. However, human learners readily generalize in this way, e.g. by applying known grammatical rules to novel words. Inspired by work in cognitive science suggesting a functional distinction between systems for syntactic and semantic processing, we implement a modification to an existing approach in neural machine translation, imposing an analogous separation between alignment and translation. The resulting architecture substantially outperforms standard recurrent networks on the SCAN dataset, a compositional generalization task, without any additional supervision. Our work suggests that learning to align and to translate in separate modules may be a useful heuristic for capturing compositional structure.

TI Towards the identification of imaging biomarkers in schizophrenia, using
   multivariate pattern classification at a single-subject level
SO NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL
AB Standard univariate analyses of brain imaging data have revealed a host of structural and functional brain alterations in schizophrenia. However, these analyses typically involve examining each voxel separately and making inferences at group-level, thus limiting clinical translation of their findings. Taking into account the fact that brain alterations in schizophrenia expand over a widely distributed network of brain regions, univariate analysis methods may not be the most suited choice for imaging data analysis. To address these limitations, the neuroimaging community has turned to machine learning methods both because of their ability to examine voxels jointly and their potential for making inferences at a single-subject level. This article provides a critical overview of the current and foreseeable applications of machine learning, in identifying imaging-based biomarkers that could be used for the diagnosis, early detection and treatment response of schizophrenia, and could, thus, be of high clinical relevance. We discuss promising future research directions and the main difficulties facing machine learning researchers as far as their potential translation into clinical practice is concerned.

AB A currently popular research area in end-to end speech translation is the use of knowledge distillation from a machine translation (MT) task to improve the speech translation (ST) task. However, such scenario obviously allows only a one way transfer, limiting the overall effectiveness of the approach by the performance of the pre-trained teacher model. Therefore, we pose that in this respect knowledge distillation based approaches are sub-optimal. We propose an alternative a trainable mutual-learning scenario, where the MT and ST models are collaboratively trained and are considered as peers, rather than teacher/student. This allows us to improve the performance of end-to-end ST more effectively than with a teacher-student paradigm. As a side benefit, performance of the MT model also improves. Experimental results show that in our mutual-learning scenario, models can effectively utilise the auxiliary information from peer models and achieve compelling results on MuST-C datasets.

TI TransARM: An Efficient Instruction Set Architecture Emulator
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS
AB Instruction set architecture (ISA) emulation is the key to implement a virtual machine across different ISAs. This paper presents the design and implementation of TransARM, an efficient ISA emulator supporting IA-32 applications on ARM-based systems. TransARM adopts interpretation and binary translation as its basis. Interpretation is performed at the initial stage of emulation. Translation is performed only on the hot spots. Lazy flag updating and Pcache-based hybrid threaded interpretation is used to improve the interpretation performance while superblock chaining is used to accelerate binary translation. Several implementation issues which are crucial in the design of an ISA emulator are discussed, such as the executable and linking format resolution, architecture mapping and system call emulation. Benchmarks selected from MiBench are emulated by TransARM on two real ARM-based systems. Experimental results demonstrate the correctness of TransARM in terms of ISA emulation and indicate that TransARM is competitive to other ISA emulators.

TI Application of Computational Stylistics and Text Mining Techniques to
   Identify and Compare Salient Features of Different English Translations
   of the Holy Quran
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND NETWORK SECURITY
AB The presence and role of religion in human life and history is an undisputable phenomenon. The religious text provides foundation for understanding the meaning of life and offers answers of fundamental questions related to human life. Religious text is claimed to be revealed in a particular language on some holy person and later, it was translated and interpreted in multiple languages. Since the text can have multiple meanings, the translation and interpretation depend on the background, style and understandings of the person who is translating and interpreting the text. Quran, the Holy book of the Muslims is a unique literary masterpiece in terms of its linguistics and style. More than forty English translations of the original Arabic text appeared over the past two centuries. These translations of the Holy Quran vary widely in terms of linguistics and style. Various translators adopted different strategies in translating the Quranic Arabic to English language. Comparative studies by linguistic researchers identified differences among these translated works in terms of translating Arabic figures of speech, homonyms, metaphors, polysemous words, and overall loyalty and preciseness to the Arabic text. The syntactic and semantic features of each translation also varies greatly. Existing comparative studies are mostly limited in nature with regard to the number of translation aspects com-pared and the size of corpus used for the study. These limitations are primarily due to the linguistic complexity and the sheer large volume of translated works of the Quranic text. The rise of computing power as well as artificial intelligence and machine learning advancements have resulted in crossing many limits. Text mining with its set of linguistic, statistical and machine learning techniques can help overcome the limitations faced by the traditional linguistic researchers. In this paper, computational stylistics and text mining techniques were utilized to perform a detailed comparative study on a large number of available translations of the Holy Quran. The quantification of literary works to measure style and compare translations was performed using internationally recognized metrics. Cosine similarity was used to discover textual level of similarity.

The language addresses a number of topics such as: partitioning of the system, concurrency, interrupts, synchronization mechanisms, time, data transformations, hardware interactions. Model checking of the EMLAN specification is based on translations into DT-CSM (Discrete Time Concurrent State Machines), generation of a reachability graph (represented in BDD) and checking temporal formulas (CTL) representing requirements. The paper presents the EMLAN language, methods of translation into DT-CSM and an example of specification and verification of the traffic light controller.

The construction-based replication process is achieved by translation and transcription of the configuration information of the loop in the processing unit of a data and signals cellular automaton (DSCA). The inspection-based replication process is realized by duplication and translation of the same configuration information in the processing unit of the DSCA.

CL Houston, TX
AB Power Architecture (R) processors are popular and widespread on embedded systems, and such platforms are increasingly being used to run virtual machines [11, 22]. While the Power Architecture meets the Popek-and-Goldberg virtualization requirements for traditional trap-and-emulate style virtualization, the performance overhead of virtualization remains high. For example, workloads exhibiting a large amount of kernel activity typically show 3-5x slowdowns over bare-metal.
   Recent additions to the Linux kernel contain guest and host side paravirtual extensions for Power Architecture platforms. While these extensions improve performance significantly, they are guest-specific, guest-intrusive, and cover only a subset of all possible virtualization optimizations.
   We present a set of host-side optimizations that achieve comparable performance to the aforementioned paravirtual extensions, on an unmodified guest. Our optimizations are based on adaptive in-place binary translation. Unlike the paravirtual approach, our solution is guest neutral. We implement our ideas in a prototype based on Qemu/KVM. After our modifications, KVM can boot an unmodified Linux guest around 2.5x faster. We contrast our optimization approach with previous similar binary translation based approaches for the x86 architecture [4]; in our experience, each architecture presents a unique set of challenges and optimization opportunities.

TI Design of English Translation Model of Intelligent Recognition Based on
   Deep Learning
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB In the context of globalization, the international common language is English and it is more and more widely used. However, there is a shortage of talents with high English proficiency in all industries. According to the demand of the Chinese market, we should pay attention to students' English language ability. Deep learning is a machine learning method based on feature learning and feature hierarchical structure, which simulates the analysis and learning of the human brain, carries out feature transformation layer by layer, trains a single-layer network each time, and transforms the features of samples in the original space to a new feature space, thus making classification or prediction easier. There are still some defects in the current machine translation (MT) results of online MT, especially the disadvantages of low efficiency and low accuracy of MT when the full-text range uses the server to compare the data of different languages to obtain the grammar and text-related rules among different languages. Therefore, other modern intelligent recognition technologies should be adopted to achieve accurate English MT. Generally speaking, the closer the training data is to the domain of the target text, the higher the quality of sentence alignment and the more sentence pairs, the more helpful it is to learn more accurate translation rules, so as to obtain a more robust translation.

AB End-to-end models for speech translation (ST) more tightly couple speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) than a traditional cascade of separate ASR and MT models, with simpler model architectures and the potential for reduced error propagation. Their performance is often assumed to be superior, though in many conditions this is not yet the case. We compare cascaded and end-to-end models across high, medium, and low-resource conditions, and show that cascades remain stronger baselines. Further, we introduce two methods to incorporate phone features into ST models. We show that these features improve both architectures, closing the gap between end-to-end models and cascades, and outperforming previous academic work - by up to 9 BLEU on our low-resource setting.

TI Dual contextual module for neural machine translation
SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB Self-attention-based encoder-decoder frameworks have drawn increasing attention in recent years. The self-attention mechanism generates contextual representations by attending to all tokens in the sentence. Despite improvements in performance, recent research argues that the self-attention mechanism tends to concentrate more on the global context with less emphasis on the contextual information available within the local neighbourhood of tokens. This work presents the Dual Contextual (DC) module, an extension of the conventional self-attention unit, to effectively leverage both the local and global contextual information. The goal is to further improve the sentence representation ability of the encoder and decoder subnetworks, thus enhancing the overall performance of the translation model. Experimental results on WMT'14 English-German (En -> De) and eight IWSLT translation tasks show that the DC module can further improve the translation performance of the Transformer model.

AB The way information spreads through society has changed significantly over the past decade with the advent of online social networking. Twitter, one of the most widely used social networking websites, is known as the real-time, public microblogging network where news breaks first. Most users love it for its iconic 140-character limitation and unfiltered feed that show them news and opinions in the form of tweets. Tweets are usually multilingual in nature and of varying quality. However, machine translation (MT) of twitter data is a challenging task especially due to the following two reasons: (i) tweets are informal in nature (i.e., violates linguistic norms), and (ii) parallel resource for twitter data is scarcely available on the Internet. In this paper, we develop FooTweets, a first parallel corpus of tweets for English-German language pair. We extract 4; 000 English tweets from the FIFA 2014 world cup and manually translate them into German with a special focus on the informal nature of the tweets. In addition to this, we also annotate sentiment scores between 0 and 1 to all the tweets depending upon the degree of sentiment associated with them. This data has recently been used to build sentiment translation engines and an extensive evaluation revealed that such a resource is very useful in machine translation of user generated content.

AB Translation of biological knowledge from animal models to humans is an important step in the development of therapeutics, but there remain limitations for effective translation. Systems biology offers approaches to understand the limitations for translation between species through data-driven models, such as methods that rely on learning patterns from data, and mechanism-driven models of biological processes, such as pharmacokinetic models. Here, we describe recent advances in both data-driven and mechanism-driven systems biology approaches to better understand limitations to translation from animal models to humans. Both approaches to modeling have their strengths and weaknesses but still provide key biological insight for translating between model systems and humans (Fig. 1). The presented methods not only identify differences between different model organisms but also provide opportunities to identify shared biomarkers and unique biological insight.

AB Text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) is the final stage in the speech-to-speech (S2S) translation pipeline, producing an audible rendition of translated text in the target language. TTS systems typically rely on a lexicon to look up pronunciations for each word in the input text. This is problematic when the target language is dialectal Arabic, because the statistical machine translation (SMT) system usually produces undiacritized text output. Many words in the latter possess multiple pronunciations; the correct choice must be inferred from context. In this paper, we present a weakly supervised pronunciation prediction approach for undiacritized dialectal Arabic in S2S systems that leverages automatic speech recognition (ASR) to obtain parallel training data for pronunciation prediction. Additionally, we show that incorporating source language features derived from SMT-generated automatic word alignment further improves automatic pronunciation prediction accuracy.

AB This work aims to produce translations that convey source language content at a formality level that is appropriate for a particular audience. Framing this problem as a neural sequence-to-sequence task ideally requires training triplets consisting of a bilingual sentence pair labeled with target language formality. However, in practice, available training examples are limited to English sentence pairs of different styles, and bilingual parallel sentences of unknown formality. We introduce a novel training scheme for multi-task models that automatically generates synthetic training triplets by inferring the missing element on the fly, thus enabling end-to-end training. Comprehensive automatic and human assessments show that our best model outperforms existing models by producing translations that better match desired formality levels while preserving the source meaning.(1)

AB The UNED phrase-based cross-language summaries were first introduced at iCLEF 2001 as a translation strategy which permitted faster document selection with roughly the same accuracy than full Machine Translation. For our iCLEF 2003 participation, we tested the validity of our summaries as cross-language indexes for the retrieval stage of the interactive search process. We compared a reference system that performs query translation (and then retrieves target-language documents) with a system that directly retrieves cross-language summaries with the source-language query. The performance of both systems is very similar, confirming that UNED summaries are viable for cross-language indexing. This approach is trivially scalable to more than one target language, opening an interesting path for truly multilingual search assistance.

The analysis of the interference fringes during loading provides the geometry of the gratings and so leads to the strain determination. The proposed method is insensitive to the specimen translations and presents a measurement range from 5 x 10(-5), with the use of a quasi-heterodyne technique, to a few 10(-2).

AB The role and importance of methods for lexical knowledge elicitation in the area of multilingual information processing, including machine translation, computer-aided translation and cross-lingual information retrieval is undisputable. The usefulness of such methods becomes even more apparent in cases of language pairs where no appropriate digital language resources exist. This paper presents encouraging experimental results in automatically eliciting bilingual lexica out of Greek-Turkish parallel corpora, consisting of international organizations' documents available in English, Greek and Turkish, in an attempt to aid multilingual document processing involving these languages.

AB We describe a sentence-level domain adaptation translation system, which trained with the sentence-weight model. Our system can take advantage of the domain information in each sentence rather than in the corpus. It is a fine-grained method for domain adaptation. By adding weights which reflect the preference of target domain to the sentences in the training set, we can improve the domain adaptation ability of a translation system. We set up the sentence-weight model depending on the similarity between sentences in the training set and the target domain text. In our method, the similarity is measured by the word frequency distribution. Our experiments on a large-scale Chinese-to-English translation task in news domain validate the effectiveness of our sentence-weight-based adaptation approach, with gains of up to 0.75 BLEU over a non-adapted baseline system.

AB This paper demonstrates that multilingual pre-training and multilingual fine-tuning are both critical for facilitating cross-lingual transfer in zero-shot translation, where the neural machine translation (NMT) model is tested on source languages unseen during supervised training. Following this idea, we present SixT+, a strong many-to-English NMT model that supports 100 source languages but is trained with a parallel dataset in only six source languages. SixT+ initializes the decoder embedding and the full encoder with XLM-R large and then trains the encoder and decoder layers with a simple two-stage training strategy. SixT+ achieves impressive performance on many-to-English translation. It significantly outperforms CRISS and m2m-100, two strong multilingual NMT systems, with an average gain of 7.2 and 5.0 BLEU respectively. Additionally, SixT+ offers a set of model parameters that can be further fine-tuned to other unsupervised tasks. We demonstrate that adding SixT+ initialization outperforms state-of-the-art explicitly designed unsupervised NMT models on Si <-> En and Ne <-> En by over 1.2 average BLEU. When applied to zero-shot cross-lingual abstractive summarization, it produces an average performance gain of 12.3 ROUGE-L over mBART-ft. We conduct detailed analyses to understand the key ingredients of SixT+, including multilinguality of the auxiliary parallel data, positional disentangled encoder, and the cross-lingual transferability of its encoder.

AB The competitive performance of neural machine translation (NMT) critically relies on large amounts of training data. However, acquiring high-quality translation pairs requires expert knowledge and is costly. Therefore, how to best utilize a given dataset of samples with diverse quality and characteristics becomes an important yet understudied question in NMT. Curriculum learning methods have been introduced to NMT to optimize a model's performance by prescribing the data input order, based on heuristics such as the assessment of noise and difficulty levels. However, existing methods require training from scratch, while in practice most NMT models are pre-trained on big data already. Moreover, as heuristics, they do not generalize well. In this paper, we aim to learn a curriculum for improving a pre-trained NMT model by re-selecting influential data samples from the original training set and formulate this task as a reinforcement learning problem. Specifically, we propose a data selection framework based on Deterministic Actor-Critic, in which a critic network predicts the expected change of model performance due to a certain sample, while an actor network learns to select the best sample out of a random batch of samples presented to it. Experiments on several translation datasets show that our method can further improve the performance of NMT when original batch training reaches its ceiling, without using additional new training data, and significantly outperforms several strong baseline methods.

AB As a typical Indo-European language, inflection and derivation have been the main ways of new word building for English and many new words in scientific literature have been created. Influenced by English, multiple affixes is also becoming a major part of creating new words in Chinese scientific literature. For the similarity to its original source, Chinese words of multiple affixes can be automatically translated with rule-based. methods. This paper employs a head transduction model and attempts to solve the problem of the Chinese words of multiple affixes usually as unknown words in a machine translation system by building a bilingual lexicon with a richer content.

AB This paper describes the development of an open-source tool named Trdlo. Trdlo was developed as part of our effort to build a machine translation system between very close languages. These languages usually do not have available pre-processed linguistic resources or dictionaries suitable for computer processing. Bilingual dictionaries have a big impact on quality of translation. Proposed methods described in this paper attempt to extend existing dictionaries with inferable translation pairs. Our approach requires only 'cheap' resources: a list of lemmata for each language and rules for inferring words from one language to another. It is also possible to use other resources like annotated corpora or Wikipedia. Results show that this approach greatly improves effectivity of building Czech-Slovak dictionary.

AB The orthogonality relations are derived for the rotation coefficients of two-center overlap integrals over arbitrary atomic orbitals (AAOs) and expansion coefficients for translation of Slater-type orbitals (STOs). Using these formulas, a very interesting theorem regarding the angular dependence is established. If we add the products of all the overlap integrals or all the translation coefficients with the same n and l values, but different m values, the result is independent of orientation. The final results are of a simple structure and are, therefore, especially useful for machine computations of multielectron multicenter molecular integrals by expanding one- and two-center electron charge density over STOs in terms of STOs about a new center.

Taking the second view is the new research area called Cross Language Information Retrieval. This paper will discuss the problems and current research techniques being explored in this area for finding documents in languages other than the original query. We will talk about language identification methods (n-grams and short word techniques), techniques for automatically generating queries in other languages (stemming and morphological analysis; dictionary-based translation, corpus-based translation, machine-translation based; query conflation), and retrieving and merging query results (weighting schemes).

AB Transcribing struck-through, handwritten words, for example for the purpose of genetic criticism, can pose a challenge to both humans and machines, due to the obstructive properties of the superimposed strokes. This paper investigates the use of paired image to image translation approaches to remove strikethrough strokes from handwritten words. Four different neural network architectures are examined, ranging from a few simple convolutional layers to deeper ones, employing Dense blocks. Experimental results, obtained from one synthetic and one genuine paired strikethrough dataset, confirm that the proposed paired models outperform the CycleGAN-based state of the art, while using less than a sixth of the trainable parameters.

TI Preface
SO NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING
AB After several decades of work on rule-based machine translation (MT) where linguists try to manually encode their knowledge about language, the time around 1990 brought a paradigm change towards automatic systems which try to learn how to translate by looking at large collections of high-quality sample translations as produced by professional translators. The first such attempts were called example- or analogy-based translation, and somewhat later the so-called statistical approach to MT was introduced. Both can be subsumed under the label data-driven approaches to MT. It took about 10 years until these self-learning systems became serious competitors of the traditional rule-based systems, and by now some of the most successful MT systems, such as Google Translate and Moses, are based on the statistical approach.

TI Ribosome signatures aid bacterial translation initiation site
   identification
SO BMC BIOLOGY
AB Background: While methods for annotation of genes are increasingly reliable, the exact identification of translation initiation sites remains a challenging problem. Since the N-termini of proteins often contain regulatory and targeting information, developing a robust method for start site identification is crucial. Ribosome profiling reads show distinct patterns of read length distributions around translation initiation sites. These patterns are typically lost in standard ribosome profiling analysis pipelines, when reads from footprints are adjusted to determine the specific codon being translated.
   Results: Utilising these signatures in combination with nucleotide sequence information, we build a model capable of predicting translation initiation sites and demonstrate its high accuracy using N-terminal proteomics. Applying this to prokaryotic translatomes, we re-annotate translation initiation sites and provide evidence of N-terminal truncations and extensions of previously annotated coding sequences. These re-annotations are supported by the presence of structural and sequence-based features next to N-terminal peptide evidence. Finally, our model identifies 61 novel genes previously undiscovered in the Salmonella enterica genome.
   Conclusions: Signatures within ribosome profiling read length distributions can be used in combination with nucleotide sequence information to provide accurate genome-wide identification of translation initiation sites.

Here we present one example of using the implicit intelligence of language use to solve an important problem for machine translation programs and cross-lingual applications. This problem involves the translation of words written in katakana characters in Japanese. In this paper, we describe techniques of discovering katakana transliteration of English names and of finding English translations of multiword katakana sequences using implicit language models of English and Japanese found on the Web. These techniques were evaluated against human-constructed English-katakana glosses.

TI Chemical modifications to mRNA nucleobases impact translation elongation
   and termination
SO BIOPHYSICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) serve as blueprints for protein synthesis by the molecular machine the ribosome. The ribosome relies on hydrogen bonding interactions between adaptor aminoacyl-transfer RNA molecules and mRNAs to ensure the rapid and faithful translation of the genetic code into protein. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that chemical modifications to mRNA nucleosides impact the speed and accuracy of protein synthesis by the ribosome. Modulations in translation rates have downstream effects beyond protein production, influencing protein folding and mRNA stability. Given the prevalence of such modifications in mRNA coding regions, it is imperative to understand the consequences of individual modifications on translation. In this review we present the current state of our knowledge regarding how individual mRNA modifications influence ribosome function. Our comprehensive comparison of the impacts of 16 different mRNA modifications on translation reveals that most modifications can alter the elongation step in the protein synthesis pathway. Additionally, we discuss the context dependence of these effects, highlighting the necessity of further study to uncover the rules that govern how any given chemical modification in an mRNA codon is read by the ribosome.

AB Virtual machining is an important part in the research field of virtual manufacturing. This paper describes the architecture and key techniques for constructing a virtual machining system, which should be open, extendable and reconfigurable.
   Based on the features, functionality and application of virtual machining system, an open, modularized architecture is proposed. Then a hierarchical model of virtual machining environment is put forward, which is composed of component layer, equipment layer and environment layer. Moreover, a general NC code parser based on dynamic linked library (DLL) is reported. Users can download the DLL program for a specific NC system to extend the system's function. The flow chart of the translation algorithm is also given out. Further, the implementation of 3-Axis milling simulation is presented. The simulation method, based on triangular faceted model, has the advantages of real time rendering, changeable view points and so on. The modeling method of work-piece and the optimized machining algorithm are put forward in detail.
   Finally, on the basis of the techniques mentioned above, a prototype virtual machining system VRMS is developed. A Micron UCP 710 milling centre has been set up in the system. Users can verify and optimize NC code by simulating the machining process on the virtual machine tool.

AB As a principled approach to capturing semantic relations of words in information retrieval, statistical translation models have been shown to outperform simple document language models which rely on exact matching of words in the query and documents. A main challenge in applying translation models to ad hoc information retrieval is to estimate a translation model without training data. Existing work has relied on training on synthetic queries generated based on a document collection. However, this method is computationally expensive and does not have a good coverage of query words. In this paper, we propose an alternative way to estimate a translation model based on normalized mutual information between words, which is less computationally expensive and has better coverage of query words than the synthetic query method of estimation. We also propose to regularize estimated translation probabilities to ensure sufficient probability mass for self-translation. Experiment results show that the proposed mutual information-based estimation method is not only more efficient, but also more effective than the synthetic query-based method, and it can be combined with pseudo-relevance feedback to further improve retrieval accuracy. The results also show that the proposed regularization strategy is effective and can improve retrieval accuracy for both synthetic query-based estimation and mutual information-based estimation.

AB Word embedding is central to neural machine translation (NMT), which has attracted intensive research interest in recent years. In NMT, the source embedding plays the role of the entrance while the target embedding acts as the terminal. These layers occupy most of the model parameters for representation learning. Furthermore, they indirectly interface via a soft-attention mechanism, which makes them comparatively isolated. In this paper, we propose shared-private bilingual word embeddings, which give a closer relationship between the source and target embeddings, and which also reduce the number of model parameters. For similar source and target words, their embeddings tend to share a part of the features and they cooperatively learn these common representation units. Experiments on 5 language pairs belonging to 6 different language families and written in 5 different alphabets demonstrate that the proposed model provides a significant performance boost over the strong baselines with dramatically fewer model parameters.

TI Filtering Reordering Table Using a Novel Recursive Autoencoder Model for
   Statistical Machine Translation
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB In phrase-based machine translation (PBMT) systems, the reordering table and phrase table are very large and redundant. Unlike most previous works which aim to filter phrase table, this paper proposes a novel deep neural network model to prune reordering table. We cast the task as a deep learning problem where we jointly train two models: a generative model to implement rule embedding and a discriminative model to classify rules. The main contribution of this paper is that we optimize the reordering model in PBMT by filtering reordering table using a recursive autoencoder model. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we performed it on public corpus tomeasure its reordering ability. The experimental results show that our approach obtains high improvement in BLEU score with less scale of reordering table on two language pairs: English-Chinese (+0.28) and Uyghur-Chinese (+ 0.33) MT.

AB In this paper, we present a corpus for use in automatic readability assessment and automatic text simplification for German. The corpus is compiled from web sources and consists of parallel as well as monolingual-only (simplified German) data amounting to approximately 6,200 documents (nearly 211,000 sentences). As a unique feature, the corpus contains information on text structure (e.g., paragraphs, lines), typography (e.g., font type, font style), and images (content, position, and dimensions). While the importance of considering such information in machine learning tasks involving simplified language, such as readability assessment, has repeatedly been stressed in the literature, we provide empirical evidence for its benefit. We also demonstrate the added value of leveraging monolingual-only data for automatic text simplification via machine translation through applying back-translation, a data augmentation technique.

AB Traditional Neural machine translation (NMT) involves a fixed training procedure where each sentence is sampled once during each epoch. In reality, some sentences are well-learned during the initial few epochs; however, using this approach, the well-learned sentences would continue to be trained along with those sentences that were not well learned for 10-30 epochs, which results in a wastage of time. Here, we propose an efficient method to dynamically sample the sentences in order to accelerate the NMT training. In this approach, a weight is assigned to each sentence based on the measured difference between the training costs of two iterations. Further, in each epoch, a certain percentage of sentences are dynamically sampled according to their weights. Empirical results based on the NIST Chinese-to-English and the WMT English-to-German tasks show that the proposed method can significantly accelerate the NMT training and improve the NMT performance.

AB In order to obtain all the geometric errors of five-axis CNC machine tool, a measuring strategy with cross grid encoder and double ball-bar (DBB) is proposed. According to the theory of multi-body systems, by using the homogeneous coordinate transformation method the model of geometric errors is established. The cross grid encoder is used to detect the translation geometric errors and the DBB is used to measure the rotation ones. Based on the kinematic chain and the properties of geometric errors, the translation geometric errors are measured before the rotation ones. For each axis, both PIGEs (position-independent errors) and PDGEs (position-dependent errors) are under consideration. Then a complete compensated model can be established.

AB One of the problems of the connectionist translator RECONTRA is the representation of the vocabularies of the languages implied in the task to be translated. In previous work, a simple connectionist model was used to provide automatic codifications for RECONTRA, but sometimes these codifications have shown not to be adequate for the translation task. In this paper we aim to extend the RECONTRA topology in order to integrate the creation of the codifications (for the languages to be translated) and the translation task in an unique connectionist architecture. To do that, a new hidden layer is added to the network, as it's known how a neural network develops its own internal representation of its input.

AB Development of neural prostheses over the past few decades has produced a number of clinically relevant brain machine interfaces (BMIs), such as the cochlear prostheses and deep brain stimulators. Current research pursues the restoration of communication or motor function to individuals with neurological disorders. Efforts in the field, such as the BrainGate trials, have already demonstrated that such interfaces can enable humans to effectively control external devices with neural signals. However, a number of significant issues regarding BMI performance, device capabilities, and surgery must be resolved before clinical use of BMI technology can become widespread. This chapter reviews challenges to clinical translation and discusses potential solutions that have been reported in recent literature, with focuses on hardware reliability, state-of-the-art decoding algorithms, and surgical considerations during implantation.

AB Argumentation mining refers to automatic extraction of arguments and their relations from texts. This field has been evolving rapidly in recent years, but there is almost no research for the Russian language. The present study is an attempt to overcome this gap. Firstly, we create the first argument-annotated corpus of Russian based on Argumentative Microtext Corpus and make it publicly available. Secondly, we study the importance of various feature types. Contextual and lexical features turn out to be the most significant. Thirdly, we evaluate the performance of various classifiers for argumentation mining. Bagging and XGBoost classifiers give the best results. Fourthly, we assess the possibility of using several machine translation systems (Google Translate, Yandex.Translate and Promt) for automatic creating of argument-annotated corpora. Google Translate appears to be the best system to reach this goal.

AB The parallel sentences are known as very important resources for training cross-lingual natural language process applications, such as machine translation (MT) systems. However, these resources are not available for many low-resource language pairs. Existing methods mined parallel sentences using transfer learning. Although several attempts can get a good performance, they are not able to explain why transfer learning can help mining parallel sentences for low-resource language pairs. In this paper, we propose an explainable evaluation to quantity why transfer learning is useful for parallel sentence mining. Besides, we propose a novel unsupervised transfer learning that can maintain the robustness of transfer learning. Experiments show that our proposed method improves the performance of mined parallel sentences compared with previous methods in a standard evaluation set. In particular, we achieve good results at two real-world low-resource language pairs.

AB Language models (LMs) are essential components of many applications such as speech recognition or machine translation. LMs factorize the probability of a string of words into a product of P(w(i)vertical bar h(i)), where hi is the context (history) of word w(i). Most LMs use previous words as the context. The paper presents two alternative approaches: post-n gram LMs (which use following words as context) and dependency LMs (which exploit dependency structure of a sentence and can use e.g. the governing word as context). Dependency LMs could be useful whenever a topology of a dependency tree is available, but its lexical labels are unknown, e.g. in tree-to-tree machine translation. In comparison with baseline interpolated trigram LM both of the approaches achieve significantly lower perplexity for all seven tested languages (Arabic, Catalan, Czech, English, Hungarian, Italian, Turkish).

AB There has been much work done in the area of automated program repair, specifically through using machine learning methods to correct buggy code. Whereas some degree of success has been attained by those efforts, there is still considerable room for growth with regard to the accuracy of results produced by such tools. In that vein, we implement Hephaestus, a novel method to improve the accuracy of automated bug repair through learning to apply edit operations. Hephaestus leverages neural machine translation and attempts to produce the edit operations needed to correct a given buggy code segment to a fixed version. We examine the effects of using various forms of edit operations in the completion of this task. Our study found that all models which learned from edit operations were not as effective at repairing bugs as models which learned from fixed code segments directly. This evidences that learning edit operations does not offer an advantage over the standard approach of translating directly from buggy code to fixed code. We conduct an analysis of this lowered efficiency and explore why the complexity of the edit operations-based models may be suboptimal. Interestingly, even though our Hephaestus model exhibited lower translation accuracy than the baseline, Hephaestus was able to perform successful bug repair. This success, albeit small, leaves the door open for other researchers to innovate unique solutions in the realm of automatic bug repair.

AB Although the problem of full machine translation (MT) is unsolved yet, the computer aided translation (CAT) makes progress. In this field we created a work environment for monolingual translator(1). This package of tools generally enables a user who masters a source language to translate texts to a target language which the user does not master. The application is for Hebrew-to-Russian case, emphasizing specific problems of these languages, but it can be adapted for other pairs of languages also. After Source Text Preparation, Morphological Analysis provides all the meanings for every word. The ambiguity problem is very serious in languages with incomplete writing, like Hebrew. But the main problem is the translation itself. Words' meanings mapping between languages is M:M, i.e., almost every source word has a number of possible translations, and almost every target word can be a translation of several words. Many methods for resolving of these ambiguities propose using large data bases, like dictionaries with semantic fields based on theta-theory. The amount of information needed to deal with general texts is prohibitively large. We propose here to solve ambiguities by a new method: Accumulation with Inversion and then Weighted Selection, plus Learning, using only two regular dictionaries: from source to target and from target to source languages. The method is built from a number of phases: (1) during Accumulation with inversion, all the possible translations to the target language of every word are brought, and every one of them is translated back to the source language; (2) Selection of suitable suggestions is being made by user in source language, this is the only manual phase; (3) Weighting of the selection's results is being made by software and determines the most suitable translation to the target language; (4) Learning of word's context will provide preferable translation in the future. Target Text Gene,Prion is based on morphological records in target language, that are produced by the disambiguation phase. To complete the missing features for word's building, we propose here a method of Features Expansion. This method is based on assumptions about feature flow through the sentence, and on dependence of grammatical phenomena in the two languages. Software of the workstation combines four tools: Source Text Preparation, Morphological Analysis, Disambiguation and Target Text Generation. The application includes an elaborated windows interface, on which the user's work is based.

TI Active Mechanical Threading by a Molecular Motor
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Molecular motors transform external energy input into directional motions and offer exquisite precision for nano-scale manipulations. To make full use of molecular motor capacities, their directional motions need to be transmitted and used for powering downstream molecular events. Here we present a macrocyclic molecular motor structure able to perform repetitive molecular threading of a flexible tetraethylene glycol chain through the macrocycle. This mechanical threading event is actively powered by the motor and leads to a direct translation of the unidirectional motor rotation into unidirectional translation motion (chain versus ring). The mechanism of the active mechanical threading is elucidated and the actual threading step is identified as a combined helix inversion and threading event. The established molecular machine function resembles the crucial step of macroscopic weaving or sewing processes and therefore offers a first entry point to a "molecular knitting" counterpart.

TI Valid, Plausible, and Diverse Retrosynthesis Using Tied Two-Way
   Transformers with Latent Variables
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING
AB Retrosynthesis is an essential task in organic chemistry for identifying the synthesis pathways of newly discovered materials, and with the recent advances in deep learning, there have been growing attempts to solve the retrosynthesis problem through transformer models, which are the state-of-the-art in neural machine translation, by converting the problem into a machine translation problem. However, the pure transformer provides unsatisfactory results that lack grammatical validity, chemical plausibility, and diversity in reactant candidates. In this study, we develop tied two-way transformers with latent modeling to solve those problems using cycle consistency checks, parameter sharing, and multinomial latent variables. Experimental results obtained using public and in-house datasets demonstrate that the proposed model improves the retrosynthesis accuracy, grammatical error, and diversity, and qualitative evaluation results verify its ability to suggest valid and plausible results.

TI NADAQ: Natural Language Database Querying Based on Deep Learning
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The high complexity behind SQL language and database schemas has made database querying a challenging task to human programmers. In this paper, we present our new natural language database querying (NADAQ) system as an alternative solution, by designing new translation models smoothly fusing deep learning and traditional database parsing techniques. On top of the popular encoder-decoder model for machine translation, NADAQ injects new dimensions of schema-aware bits associated with the input words into encoder phase and adds new hidden memory neurons controlled by the finite state machine for grammatical state tracking into the decoder phase. We further develop new techniques to enable the augmented neural network to reject queries irrelevant to the contents of the target database and recommend candidate queries reversely transformed into natural language. NADAQ performs well on real-world database systems over human labeled workload, returning query results at 90% accuracy.

TI Surface design of roller gear cam mechanisms with a turret in both
   translation and rotation
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF
   MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
AB Roller gear cam mechanisms (RGCMs) are used extensively as automatic tool changers of machining centres or as indexing mechanisms in various machinery. However, almost all the existing RGCMs have a turret in a rotational motion only. Thus for example, when they are used as a part of automatic tool changers, the translational motions of the tools have to be given by other mechanisms. An RGCM with a turret which can move with both translation and rotation simultaneously is proposed; such an RGCM may simplify the structure of some machines.
   By using D-H homogeneous coordinate transformation matrices, and applying the theory of conjugate surfaces, the model for the surface design of the RGCM is developed. Two examples are included to demonstrate the usages of the model and to verify its correctness.

AB Graphic symbols can be used as an alternative way of communication. Translating from a message composed of symbols to a fluent sentence will enable symbol users to be understood by those who may not be familiar with the use of symbols. Symbol messages may not match the target language in terms of order and syntax. This paper describes an attempt to reorder symbols, based on their labels, to match the target language namely Modern Standard Arabic. An initial experiment has been conducted using a SMT decoder with two n-gram models to reorder words in general then discuss its application to symbols. The output was evaluated using BLEU: an automatic evaluation metric used in machine translation. The average score of the output has improved over the input. Further improvements are suggested and will be carried out in future experiments.

AB This paper presents a rule based model for solving ambiguities of the Uyghur future tense. Uyghur is an agglutinative language and a root word can be followed by numerous suffixes simultaneously. Because of this reason, a character of a word may be changed with respect to the type of suffixes that it is has been affixed. In some cases, the analysis of suffixes is not sufficient to categorize the property of a word. This is especially the case with verbs and it is a critical problem in machine translation. Therefore, it is important to consider some other words in a sentence at the same time. In order to categorize verbs which appear in future tenses, some rules have been defined related to some specific words in the sentence and the performance of the model has been evaluated with some sentences.

AB The paper focuses on the problems of research and integral modeling of semantic representations of language structures for the implementation of knowledge extraction from texts and machine translation. The method of presenting language structures and resolving their ambiguity is based on logical linguistic rules and vector spaces. An effective method of displaying the vector of natural language structures in an expanded space of features for the classification of new language objects and structures has been developed. A focal sample of parallel texts of business and scientific documents in Russian, English and French has been formed for various fields of science and technology; an expanded system of new categories has been developed to enhance the expressive power of the original version of the unification grammar. The multilingual parsing procedures have been developed, which take into account the translational transformations.

AB Sign language is a common non-verbal communication method for people with impaired hearing. Despite the existence of sign language, there are communications boundaries. With the implementation of Myo armbands in predicting the gestures, this gap could be reduced. Myo armbands can collect three-axis accelerometer, three-axis gyroscope, and three-axis magnetometer signals. These collected data are used in constructing the prediction model. Translation is possible with the use of machine learning algorithms implemented in the prediction model. The algorithms used for testing the best accuracy rate from the prediction model are Decision Tree, Sequential Minimal Optimization, and Multilayer Perceptron. In addition, Mean and Standard Deviation (SD) are used to test for optimal feature selection. After testing, the prediction model that gave the best result were with MLP and SMO algorithms having Mean and SD as the optimal features. Thus, either of them could be implemented.

AB The knowledge behind the gigantic pool of data remains largely unextracted. Techniques such as ontology design, RDF representations, hpernym extraction, etc. have been used to represent the knowledge. However, the area of logic (FOPL) and linguistics (Semantics) has not been explored in depth for this purpose. Search engines suffer in extraction of specific answers to queries because of the absence of structured domain knowledge. The current paper deals with the design of formalism to extract and represent knowledge from the data in a consistent format. The application of logic and linguistics combined greatly eases and increases the precision of knowledge translation from natural language. The results clearly indicate the effectiveness of the knowledge extraction and representation methodology developed providing intelligence to machines for efficient analysis of data. The methodology helps machines to retrieve precise results in an efficient manner.

TI Multi-scale Gaussian processes: a novel model for chaotic time series
   prediction
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Based on the classical Gaussian process (GP) model, we propose a multi-scale Gaussian process (MGP) model to predict the existence of chaotic time series. The MGP employs a covariance function that is constructed by a scaling function with its different dilations and translations, ensuring that the optimal hyperparameter is easy to determine. Moreover, the scaling function with its difrerent dilations and translations can form a set of complete bases, resulting in the fact that the MGP can acquire better prediction performance than the GP. The experiments can lead to the following conclusions: (1) The MGP gives a relatively better prediction performance in comparison with the classical GP model. (ii) The prediction performance of the MGP is competitive with support vector machine (SVM). They give better performance as compared to the radial basis function networks.

AB Multi-modal neural machine translation (NMT) aims to translate source sentences into a target language paired with images However, dominant multi-modal NMT models do not fully exploit fine-grained semantic correspondences between semantic units of different modalities, which have potential to refine multi-modal representation learning. To deal with this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel graph-based multi-modal fusion encoder for NMT. Specifically, we first represent the input sentence and image using a unified multi-modal graph, which captures various semantic relationships between multi-modal semantic units (words and visual objects). We then stack multiple graph-based multi-modal fusion layers that iteratively perform semantic interactions to learn node representations. Finally, these representations provide an attention-based context vector for the decoder. We evaluate our proposed encoder on the Multi30K datasets. Experimental results and in-depth analysis show the superiority of our multi-modal NMT model.

AB Sentence correction has been an important and emerging issue in computer-assisted language learning. However, existing techniques based on grammar rules or statistical machine translation are still not robust enough to tackle the common incorrect word order errors in sentences produced by second language learners of Chinese. In this paper, a novel relative position. language model is proposed to address this problem, for which a corpus of erroneous English-Chinese language transfer sentences along with their corrected counterparts is created and manually judged by human annotators. Experimental results show that compared to a scoring approach based on an n-gram language model and a phrase-based machine translation system, the performance in terms of BLEU scores of the proposed approach achieved improvements of 20.3% and 26.5% for the correction of word order errors resulting from language transfer, respectively.

AB While strings and syntax trees are used by the Natural Language Processing community to represent the structure of spoken languages, these encodings are difficult to adapt to a signed language like American Sign Language (ASL). In particular, the multichannel nature of an ASL performance makes it difficult to encode in a linear single-channel string. This paper will introduce the Partition/Constitute (P/C) formalism, a new method of computationally representing a linguistic signal containing multiple channels. The formalism allows coordination and non-coordination relationships to be encoded between different portions of a signal. The P/C formalism will be compared to representations used in related research in gesture animation. The way in which P/C is used by this project to build an English-to-ASL machine translation system will also be discussed.

TI Still taboo? Using machine translation for low-level EFL writers
SO ELT JOURNAL
AB This study investigates the application of machine translation (MT) in an EFL writing class and its impact on lower proficiency level writers. Theoretically grounded in the social nature of learning, the MT-based writing class is applied to students in four steps: planning, drafting with MT, revising MT output, and individual writing with MT. The peer-editing process and the teacher's guidance have been found to be critical factors in terms of enhancing students' metalinguistic awareness at both the micro-level and macro-level revisions of MT output. Additionally, by gaining confidence and motivation, the students become more autonomous and self-directed. The results of this study provide insights into how an MT-based EFL writing class can be conducted successfully by including peer and teacher feedback and thus result in MT being viewed as an effective tool, rather than being considered taboo for helping lower level EFL learners in writing.

AB Large annotated datasets in NLP are overwhelmingly in English. This is an obstacle to progress in other languages. Unfortunately, obtaining new annotated resources for each task in each language would be prohibitively expensive. At the same time, commercial machine translation systems are now robust. Can we leverage these systems to translate English-language datasets automatically? In this paper, we offer a positive response for natural language inference (NLI) in Turkish. We translated two large English NLI datasets into Turkish and had a team of experts validate their translation quality and fidelity to the original labels. Using these datasets, we address core issues of representation for Turkish NLI. We find that in-language embeddings are essential and that morphological parsing can be avoided where the training set is large. Finally, we show that models trained on our machine-translated datasets are successful on human-translated evaluation sets. We share all code, models, and data publicly.

AB Discriminative language modeling (DLM) is used as a post processing step to correct automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors. Traditional DLM training requires a large number of ASR N-best lists together with their reference transcriptions. It is possible to incorporate additional text data into training via artificial hypothesis generation through confusion modeling. A weighted finite-state transducer (WFST) or a machine translation (MT) system can be used to generate the artificial hypotheses. When the reference transcriptions are not available, training can be done in an unsupervised way via a target output selection scheme. In this paper we adapt the MT-based artificial hypothesis generation approach to unsupervised discriminative language modeling, and compare it with the WEST-based setting. We achieve improvements in word error rate of up to 0.7% over the generative baseline, which is significant at p < 0.001.

AB In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), herbal prescriptions are accumulated from doctors' clinical experience and play an essential role in treatment process for more than thousands of years. Mining their containing many-to-many relationship between symptoms and herbs are important for both clinical practice and novel prescriptions development. Previously, the research attention in this field is attracted by topic models and multi-label classification approaches, but they don't fully capture the correlations of labels and achieve very promising performance. Alternatively, we problematic it as a machine translation problem, that the source sentence is formed by symptoms and the target sentence consists of herbs. Two sentences are both in weakly order. In terms of this assumption, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) architecture, namely TCM translator, to translate symptoms to herbs. Seq2seq, consisting of an encoder and a decoder, is a well known framework for resolving the machine translation problem in natural language processing (NLP) community. It maps a bag of symptoms to the latent space, which is decoded to the target sentence, i.e., herbs. In this paper, transformer is used as our encoder to explore the latent correlations of symptoms and LSTM is implemented as the decoder to generate the herbs sequentially. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective and outperforms other baseline models by a substantial margin.

TI Efficient Estimation of Word Representations using Constrained
   Positional Weighting
SO JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB In 2018, Mikolov et al. [Mik+18] introduced the positional language model, which has characteristics of attention-based neural machine translation models and which achieved state-of-the-art performance on the intrinsic word analogy task. However, the positional model is not practically fast and it has never been evaluated on qualitative criteria or extrinsic tasks. We propose a constrained positional model, which adapts the sparse attention mechanism from neural machine translation to improve the speed of the positional model. We evaluate the positional and constrained positional models on three novel qualitative criteria and on language modeling. We show that the positional and constrained positional models contain interpretable information about the grammatical properties of words and outperform other shallow models on language modeling. We also show that our constrained model outperforms the positional model on language modeling and trains twice as fast.

AB Beam search is the go-to method for decoding auto-regressive machine translation models. While it yields consistent improvements in terms of BLEU, it is only concerned with finding outputs with high model likelihood, and is thus agnostic to whatever end metric or score practitioners care about. Our aim is to establish whether beam search can be replaced by a more powerful metric-driven search technique. To this end, we explore numerous decoding algorithms, including some which rely on a value function parameterised by a neural network, and report results on a variety of metrics. Notably, we introduce a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based method and showcase its competitiveness. We provide a blueprint for how to use MCTS fruitfully in language applications, which opens promising future directions. We find that which algorithm is best heavily depends on the characteristics of the goal metric; we believe that our extensive experiments and analysis will inform further research in this area.

SO NATURE NEUROSCIENCE
AB A decade after speech was first decoded from human brain signals, accuracy and speed remain far below that of natural speech. Here we show how to decode the electrocorticogram with high accuracy and at natural-speech rates. Taking a cue from recent advances in machine translation, we train a recurrent neural network to encode each sentence-length sequence of neural activity into an abstract representation, and then to decode this representation, word by word, into an English sentence. For each participant, data consist of several spoken repeats of a set of 30-50 sentences, along with the contemporaneous signals from similar to 250 electrodes distributed over peri-Sylvian cortices. Average word error rates across a held-out repeat set are as low as 3%. Finally, we show how decoding with limited data can be improved with transfer learning, by training certain layers of the network under multiple participants' data.

AB Data selection is a significant technique to enhance the data-driven models especially for large-scale natural language processing (NLP). Recent research on statistical machine translation (SMT) domain adaptation focuses on the usage of various individual data selection models. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid data selection model named iCPE, which combines three state-of-the-art similarity metrics: Cosine tf-idf, Perplexity and Edit distance at both corpus level and model level. We conduct the experiments on Hong Kong Law Chinese-English corpus and the results show that this simple and effective hybrid model performs better over the baseline system trained on entire data as well as the best rival method. This consistently boosting performance of the proposed approach has a profound implication for mining very large corpora in a computationally-limited environment.

TI Cascade or Direct Speech Translation? A Case Study
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Speech translation has been traditionally tackled under a cascade approach, chaining speech recognition and machine translation components to translate from an audio source in a given language into text or speech in a target language. Leveraging on deep learning approaches to natural language processing, recent studies have explored the potential of direct end-to-end neural modelling to perform the speech translation task. Though several benefits may come from end-to-end modelling, such as a reduction in latency and error propagation, the comparative merits of each approach still deserve detailed evaluations and analyses. In this work, we compared state-of-the-art cascade and direct approaches on the under-resourced Basque-Spanish language pair, which features challenging phenomena such as marked differences in morphology and word order. This case study thus complements other studies in the field, which mostly revolve around the English language. We describe and analysed in detail the mintzai-ST corpus, prepared from the sessions of the Basque Parliament, and evaluated the strengths and limitations of cascade and direct speech translation models trained on this corpus, with variants exploiting additional data as well. Our results indicated that, despite significant progress with end-to-end models, which may outperform alternatives in some cases in terms of automated metrics, a cascade approach proved optimal overall in our experiments and manual evaluations.

TI Translating Ideology: An Intergroup Mediation Perspective
SO VESTNIK ROSSIISKOGO UNIVERSITETA DRUZHBY NARODOV-SERIYA
   LINGVISTIKA-RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS
AB Ideology is an important component of text production and reception, and therefore of translation. In the paper, we address the translation of ideology through the prism of the intergroup threat theory. The resulting intergroup mediation perspective is a practical framework aimed at helping translators to evaluate whether an ideological recontextualisation may be desirable when dealing with divergence in ideological contexts between the author, the source text readership and the target text audience. The framework includes ideology shifts analysis in terms of the roles ideology can play in a text: it can constitute a part of the message (foreground) or belong to the background. Although applicable rather generally, the framework is derived from an example-based study of news translation. The study focuses on translation between French, English and German using examples form online versions of major European news media, such as the French Le Monde and Le Figaro, the German Zeit Online and Die Welt, and the British The Independent, The Telegraph and Guardian. The paper allows for a better understanding of ideology-related problems in translation, helps identify essential factors influencing translator's choices and could be used as a guidance in translation practice. Also, considering the formal character of the framework, it could eventually serve as a basis for handling ideology-related issues in machine translation in the news industry.

AB Classical Chinese poetry, as the cultural heritage of human beings, is very popular in Chinese community all over the world. Nearly every person in these regions can recite several poems to artistically express his or her emotion. However, due to the huge difference between the archaic and modern Chinese language, now, it is hard for people to understand these poems. Considering the Neural machine translation (NMT) has made great progress since the self-attention technology called Transformer was adopted, we followed the paradigm of NMT to translate the classical Chinese poems into modern Chinese texts in this study. First, we collect many ancient poems and their explanations as a parallel corpus. Then, a NMT system is trained with this corpus. Finally, we compared this system with Generative Pre-Training (GPT) and analysis their results in detail.

Data resource for this language pair is few and rare so the parallel text should be extracted at multi levels, sentence level and fragment level, to get as much data as possible. Moreover, the proposed method considers word order independently so it can be applied to different language families. The result applied on Japanese-Vietnamese Wikipedia resource shows that the proposed method increases significantly the number of extracted parallel data. The extracted multi-level parallel text contributes to the quality of machine translation as well. More than 144,000 pairs of parallel sentences and 148,000 pairs of parallel fragments had been mined and opened to the research community.

AB The model of interactive Turing machines (ITMs) has been proposed to characterise which stream translations are interactively computable; the model of reactive Turing machines (RTMs) has been proposed to characterise which behaviours are reactively executable. In this article we provide a comparison of the two models. We show, on the one hand, that the behaviour exhibited by ITMs is reactively executable, and, on the other hand, that the stream translations naturally associated with RTMs are interactively computable. We conclude from these results that the theory of reactive executability subsumes the theory of interactive computability. Inspired by the existing model of ITMs with advice, which provides a model of evolving computation, we also consider RTMs with advice and we establish that a facility of advice considerably upgrades the behavioural expressiveness of RTMs: every countable transition system can be simulated by some RTM with advice up to a fine notion of behavioural equivalence.

AB This paper addresses the issues in designing the so-called 'Controlled Korean' for a Korean-English MT system. Controlled Language is a sublanguage of a natural language which is supposed to improve the readability and the translatability of a text. Much effort has been made to design a controlled language for major international languages such as English, German, Spanish and etc. However, little effort has been made yet to design a Controlled Korean in the context of machine translation. In this paper we introduce the concept of the Controlled Korean we have developed for a Korean-English MT system and compare the Controlled Korean with the Controlled English and Controlled German from the perspective of the translatability. The result of our experiments shows that in designing a Controlled Language, not only the linguistic characteristics of the language but also the characteristics of an MT-System must be taken into account.

SO TRANSLATION & INTERPRETING-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSLATION AND

AB Digital technologies in the translation profession have given rise to the use of automated Computer Assisted Translation (CAT) tools and Machine Translation (MT), and Translation Service Providers are embracing these innovations as part of their workflows. Higher Education Institutions are also transforming their curricula In adapt to the changes brought about by technology (Austermiihl, 2006, 2013; Doherty, Kenny, & Way 2012; Doherty & Moorkens, 2013; Gaspari, Almaghout, & Doherty, 2015; Mellinger, 2017; Moorkens, 2017; 01 lagan, 2013; Rothwell & Svoboda, 2017). This research takes a phenomenological and ethnographical approach using action research as the methodology to see how the new digital skillsets are taught and used in the translation industry. As a trainer -researcher, I stay at translation companies to immerse myself in the training given to new employees. The results of this qualitative-type research derive from observations typically involving the trainer spending a full working week at the employers' premises. The data set is hence collected based on workplace observations within the companies and on semistructured interviews with translation company managers. This approach permits a very full understanding of the skills needed in the translation profession. What has been learned in the workplace can be applied at university in the training of future translators. Preliminary work suggests that MT and Artificial Intelligence (AI), while transforming the profession in many ways, are not yet overriding the need of sophisticated linguistic skills from trainee translators.

AB Multiword expressions (MWEs) are known to be widespread in most languages, but how can we actually identify them in texts? How can we account for the diverse nature of these multiword expressions with a consistent typology? This paper aims to address this topic by carrying out two tasks: (1) conducting a small survey with expert linguists on several types of MWEs; (2) building an annotated corpus which includes several genres incorporating a large panel of multiword expressions. The results show that experts can reach a consensus and that the annotation task can be performed satisfactorily, as long as the typology is not overly complex and clear guidelines are provided. Finally, a useful application of the annotated corpus for statistical machine translation is presented, showing significant differences among multiword expressions considered in the study.

AB Writing software exploits is an important practice for offensive security analysts to investigate and prevent attacks. In particular, shellcodes are especially time-consuming and a technical challenge, as they are written in assembly language. In this work, we address the task of automatically generating shellcodes, starting purely from descriptions in natural language, by proposing an approach based on Neural Machine Translation (NMT). We then present an empirical study using a novel dataset (Shellcode_IA32), which consists of 3200 assembly code snippets of real Linux/x86 shellcodes from public databases, annotated using natural language. Moreover, we propose novel metrics to evaluate the accuracy of NMT at generating shellcodes. The empirical analysis shows that NMT can generate assembly code snippets from the natural language with high accuracy and that in many cases can generate entire shellcodes with no errors.

TI Applying Machine Translation and Language Modelling Strategies for the
   Recommendation Task of Micro Learning Service
SO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY
AB A newly emerged micro learning service offers a flexible formal, informal, or non-formal online learning opportunity to worldwide users with different backgrounds in real-time. With the assist of big data technology and cloud computing service, online learners can access tremendous fine-grained learning resources through micro learning service. However, big data also causes serious information overload during online learning activities. Hence, an intelligent recommender system is required to filter out not-suitable learning resources and pick the one that matches the learner's learning requirement and academic background. From the perspective of natural language processing (NLP), this study proposed a novel recommender system that utilises machine translation and language modelling. The proposed model aims to overcome the defects of conventional recommender systems and further enhance distinguish ability of the recommender system for different learning resources.

AB The Google Patents is one of the main important sources of patents information. A striking characteristic is that many of its abstracts are presented in more than one language, thus making it a potential source of parallel corpora. This article presents the development of a parallel corpus from the open access Google Patents dataset in 74 language pairs, comprising more than 68 million sentences and 800 million tokens. Sentences were automatically aligned using the Hunalign algorithm for the largest 22 language pairs, while the others were abstract (i.e. paragraph) aligned. We demonstrate the capabilities of our corpus by training Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models for the main 9 language pairs, with a total of 18 models. Our parallel corpus is freely available in TSV format and with a SQLite database, with complementary information regarding patent metadata.

TI Recognition of English Vocabulary and Speech Corpus Based on Computer

SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
AB In order to solve the problem that the function and performance of traditional systems in English machine translation cannot meet the needs of intelligence, the author proposes an English vocabulary and speech corpus recognition system based on computer image processing. On the basis of designing the overall structure of the system, the hardware structure is designed by designing the server and translator. In the software design, the semantic features of the input English sentences in human-computer interaction are analyzed by using the enhanced algorithm, the decoding algorithm is designed according to the analysis results, and the English machine translation model is constructed. Experimental results show that when the number of sentences translated by this system is from 100 to 1000, the BLEU indicator keeps rising from 7 to 10. The English vocabulary and speech corpus recognition system based on computer image processing is more efficient.

AB This paper proposes a new abstractive summarization model for documents, hierarchical BART (Hie-BART), which captures the hierarchical structures of documents (i.e., their sentence-word structures) in the BART model. Although the existing BART model has achieved state-of-the-art performance on document summarization tasks, it does not account for interactions between sentence-level and word-level information. In machine translation tasks, the performance of neural machine translation models can be improved with the incorporation of multi-granularity self-attention (MG-SA), which captures relationships between words and phrases. Inspired by previous work, the proposed Hie-BART model incorporates MG-SA into the encoder of the BART model for capturing sentence-word structures. Evaluations performed on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset show that the proposed Hie-BART model outperforms strong baselines and improves the performance of a non-hierarchical BART model (+0.23 ROUGE-L).

AB This paper examines the problem of adapting neural machine translation systems to new, low-resourced languages (LRLs) as effectively and rapidly as possible. We propose methods based on starting with massively multilingual "seed models", which can be trained ahead-of-time, and then continuing training on data related to the LRL. We contrast a number of strategies, leading to a novel, simple, yet effective method of "similar-language regularization", where we jointly train on both a LRL of interest and a similar high-resourced language to prevent over-fitting to small LRL data. Experiments demonstrate that massively multilingual models, even without any explicit adaptation, are surprisingly effective, achieving BLEU scores of up to 15.5 with no data from the LRL, and that the proposed similarlanguage regularization method improves over other adaptation methods by 1.7 BLEU points average over 4 LRL settings.

TI Trace2trace-A Feasibility Study on Neural Machine Translation Applied to
   Human Motion Trajectories
SO SENSORS
AB Neural machine translation is a prominent field in the computational linguistics domain. By leveraging the recent developments of deep learning, it gave birth to powerful algorithms for translating text from one language to another. This study aims to assess the feasibility of transferring the neural machine translation approach into a completely different context, namely human mobility and trajectory analysis. Building a conceptual parallelism between sentences (sequences of words) and motion traces (sequences of locations), we aspire to translate individual trajectories generated by a certain category of users into the corresponding mobility traces potentially generated by a different category of users. The experiment is inserted in the background of tourist mobility analysis, with the goal of translating the motion behavior of tourists belonging to a specific nationality into the motion behavior of tourists belonging to a different nationality. The model adopted is based on the seq2seq approach and consists of an encoder-decoder architecture based on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks and neural embeddings. The encoder turns an input location sequence into a corresponding hidden vector; the decoder reverses the process, turning the vector into an output location sequence. The proposed framework, tested on a real-world large-scale dataset, explores an effective attempt of motion transformation between different entities, arising as a potentially powerful source of mobility information disclosure, especially in the context of crowd management and smart city services.

TI Optimizing Attention for Sequence Modeling via Reinforcement Learning
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
AB Attention has been shown highly effective for modeling sequences, capturing the more informative parts in learning a deep representation. However, recent studies show that the attention values do not always coincide with intuition in tasks, such as machine translation and sentiment classification. In this study, we consider using deep reinforcement learning to automatically optimize attention distribution during the minimization of end task training losses. With more sufficient environment states, iterative actions are taken to adjust attention weights so that more informative words receive more attention automatically. Results on different tasks and different attention networks demonstrate that our model is of great effectiveness in improving the end task performances, yielding more reasonable attention distribution. The more in-depth analysis further reveals that our retrofitting method can help to bring explainability for baseline attention.

CL ELECTR NETWORK
AB Cross-lingual text summarization aims at generating a document summary in one language given input in another language. It is a practically important but under-explored task, primarily due to the dearth of available data. Existing methods resort to machine translation to synthesize training data, but such pipeline approaches suffer from error propagation. In this work, we propose an end-to-end cross-lingual text summarization model. The model uses reinforcement learning to directly optimize a bilingual semantic similarity metric between the summaries generated in a target language and gold summaries in a source language. We also introduce techniques to pre-train the model leveraging monolingual summarization and machine translation objectives. Experimental results in both English-Chinese and English-German cross-lingual summarization settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. In addition, we find that reinforcement learning models with bilingual semantic similarity as rewards generate more fluent sentences than strong baselines.(1)

In this work, we demonstrate a model inspired by statistical machine translation and hidden Markov model/deep neural network (HMM-DNN) hybrid systems. Our learning algorithm is capable of discovering the visual and acoustic correlates of K distinct words in an unknown language by simultaneously learning the mapping from image regions to concepts (the first DNN), the mapping from acoustic feature vectors to phones (the second DNN), and the optimum alignment between the two (the HMM). In the simulated low-resource setting using MSCOCO and Speech-COCO datasets, our model achieves 62.4 % alignment accuracy and outperforms the audio-only segmental embedded GMM approach on standard word discovery evaluation metrics.

TI Expressive ontology learning as neural machine translation
SO JOURNAL OF WEB SEMANTICS
AB Automated ontology learning from unstructured textual sources has been proposed in literature as a way to support the difficult and time-consuming task of knowledge modeling for semantic applications. In this paper we propose a system, based on a neural network in the encoder-decoder configuration, to translate natural language definitions into Description Logics formulae through syntactic transformation. The model has been evaluated to assess its capacity to generalize over different syntactic structures, tolerate unknown words, and improve its performance by enriching the training set with new annotated examples. The results obtained in our evaluation show how approaching the ontology learning problem as a neural machine translation task can be a valid way to tackle long term expressive ontology learning challenges such as language variability, domain independence, and high engineering costs.

The particular problems were chosen to allow a natural progression from simple prediction to structured prediction. We aim for a sufficiently formal presentation suitable for readers with a background in automata theory that allows to appreciate the contribution of finite-state approaches, but we will not discuss practical issues outside the core ideas.

TI PE2LGP: translating European Portuguese into Portuguese Sign Language
   glosses
SO LINGUAMATICA
AB As the Portuguese language, the Portuguese sign language evolved naturally, acquiring grammatical characteristics different from Portuguese. Therefore, the development of a translator between the two languages consists in more than a mapping of words into signs (signed Portuguese), as it should ensure that the resulting signs satisfy the grammar of the Portuguese sign language and that the translations are semantically correct. Previous works use exclusively manual translation rules and are very limited in the amount of grammatical phenomena covered, producing merely signed Portuguese.
   This paper presents the first translator from Portuguese to the Portuguese sign language, based on manual rules, but also in translation rules automatically built from a reference corpus. Given a sentence in Portuguese, the system returns a sequence of glosses with markers that identify facial expressions, spelled words, among others. The paper reports both a manual and automatic evaluation. Results show improvements in the translation quality of simple and short sentences compared to the baseline system ("signed Portuguese").
   Moreover, this is the first study that deals with grammatical facial expressions, which mark interrogative and negative sentences.

AB A desideratum of high-quality translation systems is that they preserve meaning, in the sense that two sentences with different meanings should not translate to one and the same sentence in another language. However, state-of-the-art systems often fail in this regard, particularly in cases where the source and target languages partition the "meaning space" in different ways. For instance, "I cut my finger." and "I cut my finger off." describe different states of the world but are translated to French (by both Fairseq and Google Translate) as "Je me suis coupe le doigt.", which is ambiguous as to whether the finger is detached. More generally, translation systems are typically many-to-one (non-injective) functions from source to target language, which in many cases results in important distinctions in meaning being lost in translation. Building on Bayesian models of informative utterance production, we present a method to define a less ambiguous translation system in terms of an underlying pre-trained neural sequence-to-sequence model. This method increases injectivity, resulting in greater preservation of meaning as measured by improvement in cycle-consistency, without impeding translation quality (measured by BLEU score).

AB Automatic headline generation is related to automatic text summarization and it is useful to solve information flood problems. This paper aims at generating a headline using a recurrent neural network which is based on a machine translation approach. Our headline generator consists of an encoder and a decoder and they are constructed with Long Short Term Memory, which is one of recurrent neural networks. The encoder constructs distributed representation from the first sentence in an article and the decoder generated headlines from the distributed representation. In our experiments, we confirmed that our proposed method could generate appropriate headlines but in some articles this method generates meaningless headlines. The results show that our proposed method is superior to another approach, statistical machine translation from the viewpoint of ROUGE, which is an evaluation score of automatic text summarization. Furthermore, we could find that using an input sentence in reverse order improves the quality of headline generation.

Parallel documents are more suitable resources but due to their shortage, comparable and nonparallel documents are also used. In this paper, we address both document alignment and sentence alignment in comparable documents as an assignment problem of bipartite graph matching and intend to find the sub graphs having the maximum weight. One of the best methods to solve this problem is Hungarian algorithm which is a combinatorial optimization problem with known mathematical solutions. The advantages of proposed method are language independency and time complexity of O(n(3)) for Hungarian algorithm. We have applied this method to bilingual Farsi-English corpus, and obtained high precision and recall for this method.

AB One of the major issues in the process of machine translation is word sense disambiguation (WSD), which is defined as choosing the correct meaning of a multi-meaning word. Supervised learning methods are usually used to solve this problem. The disambiguation task is carried out using the statistics of the translated documents (as training data) or dual corpora of source and target languages. In this paper we present a supervised learning method for WSD, which is based on Cosine Similarity. As the first step, we extract two sets of features; the set of words that have occurred frequently in the text and the set of words surrounding the ambiguous word. We will present the results of evaluating the proposed schemes and illustrate the effect of weighting strategies proposed. The results are promising compared to the methods existing in the literature.

TI Is the concordance feature the new black? A workplace study of
   translators' interaction with translation resources while post-editing
   TM and MT matches
SO JOURNAL OF SPECIALISED TRANSLATION
AB This paper reports on a workplace study of industrial practices at a large Danish Language Service Provider and is concerned with how seven translators interact with a translation tool when post-editing translation proposals in an environment that combines translation memory (TM) and machine translation (MT). Recently conducted studies indicate that translation resources play a more important role in the translation process than has previously been acknowledged in process research, and those translators who apply computer-aided translation (CAT) tools find the concordance feature particularly useful. This paper investigates which types of translation resources the translators use when translating a technical and a marketing text from English into Danish at their usual workplace, and whether the concordance feature is the translators' first choice of resource. Moreover, the paper analyses how the translators explain their interaction with the concordance feature retrospectively. Based on the results, the paper discusses whether the translators experience this type of interaction as an instance of cognitive friction. The study adopts an embedded mixed method design that combines an experimental and an ethnographically inspired approach. The results show that the concordance search is the translators' preferred resource. Furthermore, the study indicates that, in some cases, concordance searches are instances of cognitive friction in the sense that they disrupt translators' technology-aided cognitive processes. At the same time, the study shows that it is difficult to determine when they are disrupted.

AB Named Entity Recognition (NER) is considered as a very influential undertaking in natural language processing appropriate to Question Answering system, Machine Translation (MT), Information extraction (IE), Information Retrieval (IR) etc. Basically NER is to identify and classify different types of proper nouns present inside given filelike location name, person name, number, organization name, time etc. Multilingual NER is a task where NE can be recognized for variety of Languages by implementing one or more methods. In this paper, we have implemented Conditional Random Field (CRF) as a base and firefly Algorithm (FA) to effectively combine different feature representation. For better performance of this system, we have combined both the methods. We have taken three Indian languages Hindi, Bengali, and Odiya for the purpose of evaluation. A promising result is observed for all three languages while implementing FA with CRF.

TI A learning to rank approach for cross-language information retrieval
   exploiting multiple translation resources
SO NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING
AB Cross-language information retrieval (CLIR), finding information in one language in response to queries expressed in another language, has attracted much attention due to the explosive growth of multilingual information in the World Wide Web. One important issue in CLIR is how to apply monolingual information retrieval (IR) methods in cross-lingual environments. Recently, learning to rank (LTR) approach has been successfully employed in different IR tasks. In this paper, we use LTR for CLIR. In order to adapt monolingual LTR techniques in CLIR and pass the barrier of language difference, we map monolingual IR features to CLIR ones using translation information extracted from different translation resources. The performance of CLIR is highly dependent on the size and quality of available bilingual resources. Effective use of available resources is especially important in low-resource language pairs. In this paper, we further propose an LTR-based method for combining translation resources in CLIR. We have studied the effectiveness of the proposed approach using different translation resources. Our results also show that LTR can be used to successfully combine different translation resources to improve the CLIR performance. In the best scenario, the LTR-based combination method improves the performance of single-resource-based CLIR method by 6% in terms of Mean Average Precision.

TI Multi-modal neural machine translation with deep semantic interactions
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Based on the conventional attentional encoder-decoder framework, multi-modal neural machine translation (NMT) further incorporates spatial visual features through a separate visual attention mechanism. In this aspect, most current multi-modal NMT models first separately learn the semantic representations of text and image and then independently produce two modalities of context vectors for word predictions, neglecting their semantic interactions. In this paper, we argue that learning text-image semantic interactions is more reasonable in the sense of jointly modeling two modalities for multi-modal NMT and propose a novel multi-modal NMT model with deep semantic interactions. Specifically, our model extends the conventional multi-modal NMT by introducing the following two attention neural networks: (1) a bi-directional attention network for modeling text and image representations, where the semantic representations of text are learned by referring to the image representations, and vice versa; (2) a co-attention network for refining text and image context vectors, which first summarizes the text into a context vector, then attends it to the image for obtaining the text-aware visual context vector. The final context vector is calculated by re-attending the visual context vector to the text. Results on the Multi30k dataset for different language pairs show that our model significantly improves on the state-of-the-art baselines.

TI Automatic Text Simplification for German
SO FRONTIERS IN COMMUNICATION
AB The article at hand aggregates the work of our group in automatic processing of simplified German. We present four parallel (standard/simplified German) corpora compiled and curated by our group. We report on the creation of a gold standard of sentence alignments from the four sources for evaluating automatic alignment methods on this gold standard. We show that one of the alignment methods performs best on the majority of the data sources. We used two of our corpora as a basis for the first sentence-based neural machine translation (NMT) approach toward automatic simplification of German. In follow-up work, we extended our model to render it capable of explicitly operating on multiple levels of simplified German. We show that using source-side language level labels improves performance with regard to two evaluation metrics commonly applied to measuring the quality of automatic text simplification.

AB When building a language model (LM) for spontaneous speech, the ideal situation is to have a large amount of spoken, in-domain training data. Having such abundant data, however, is not realistic. We address this problem by generating texts in spoken language from those in written language by using a neural machine translation (NMT) model. We collected faithful transcripts of fully spontaneous speech and corresponding written versions and used them as a parallel corpus to train the NMT model. We used top-k random sampling, which generates a large variety of texts of higher quality as compared to other generation methods for NMT. We indicate that the NMT model is capable of converting written texts in a certain domain to spoken texts, and that the converted texts are effective for training LMs. Our experimental results show significant improvement of speech recognition accuracy with the LMs.

AB Modern neural sequence generation models are built to either generate tokens step-by-step from scratch or (iteratively) modify a sequence of tokens bounded by a fixed length. In this work, we develop Levenshtein Transformer, a new partially autoregressive model devised for more flexible and amenable sequence generation. Unlike previous approaches, the basic operations of our model are insertion and deletion. The combination of them facilitates not only generation but also sequence refinement allowing dynamic length changes. We also propose a set of new training techniques dedicated at them, effectively exploiting one as the other's learning signal thanks to their complementary nature. Experiments applying the proposed model achieve comparable or even better performance with much-improved efficiency on both generation (e.g. machine translation, text summarization) and refinement tasks (e.g. automatic post-editing). We further confirm the flexibility of our model by showing a Levenshtein Transformer trained by machine translation can straightforwardly be used for automatic post-editing.

Different features were extracted from both the source and target parts of the TPR dataset, separately and different models were developed separately by employing such features using a machine learning framework. These models were trained using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the best accuracy of 49.01% and 59.78% were obtained with respect to cross validation for source and target gaze fixation durations, respectively. The experiments were also carried out on the post edited data set using same experimental set up and the highest accuracy of 71.70% was obtained. Finally, Information Gain based pruning has been performed in order to select the best features that are useful for classifying the gaze durations.

AB As we strive for sophisticated machine translation and reliable information extraction, we have launched a subproject pertaining to the revelation of reference and information structure in (Hungarian) declarative sentences. The crucial part of information extraction is a procedure whose input is a sentence, and whose output is an information structure, which is practically a set of possible operator scope orders (acceptance). A similar procedure forms the first half of machine translation, too: we need the information structure of the source-language sentence. Then an opposite procedure should come (generation), whose input is an information structure, and whose output is an intoned word sequence, that is, a sentence in the target language. We can base the procedure of acceptance (in the above sense) upon that of generation, due to the reversibility of Prolog mechanisms. And as our approach to grammar is "totally lexicalist", the lexical description of verbs is responsible for the order and intonation of words in the generated sentence.

TI Improving data augmentation for low resource speech-to-text translation
   with diverse paraphrasing
SO NEURAL NETWORKS
AB High quality end-to-end speech translation model relies on a large scale of speech-to-text training data, which is usually scarce or even unavailable for some low-resource language pairs. To overcome this, we propose a target-side data augmentation method for low-resource language speech translation. In particular, we first generate large-scale target-side paraphrases based on a paraphrase generation model which incorporates several statistical machine translation (SMT) features and the commonly used recurrent neural network (RNN) feature. Then, a filtering model which consists of semantic similarity and speech-word pair co-occurrence was proposed to select the highest scoring source speech-target paraphrase pairs from candidates. Experimental results on English, Arabic, German, Latvian, Estonian, Slovenian and Swedish paraphrase generation show that the proposed method achieves significant and consistent improvements over several strong baseline models on PPDB datasets (http://paraphrase. org/). To introduce the results of paraphrase generation into the low-resource speech translation, we propose two strategies: audio-text pairs recombination and multiple references training. Experimental results show that the speech translation models trained on new audio-text datasets which combines the paraphrase generation results lead to substantial improvements over baselines, especially on low-resource languages.

TI Efficient and retargetable SIMD translation in a dynamic binary
   translator
SO SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB The single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) computing capability of modern processors is continually improved to deliver ever better performance and power efficiency. For example, Intel has increased SIMD register lengths from 128 bits in streaming SIMD extension to 512 bits in AVX-512. The ARM scalable vector extension supports SIMD register length up to 2048 bits and includes predicated instructions. However, SIMD instruction translation in dynamic binary translation has not received similar attention. For example, the widely used QEMU emulates guest SIMD instructions with a sequence of scalar instructions, even when the host machines have relevant SIMD instructions. This leaves significant potential for performance enhancement. We propose a newly designed SIMD translation framework for dynamic binary translation, which takes advantage of the host's SIMD capabilities. The proposed framework has been built in HQEMU, an enhanced QEMU with a separate thread for applying LLVM optimizations. The current prototype supports ARMv7, ARMv8, and IA32 guests on the X86-64 AVX-2 host. Compared with the scalar-translation version HQEMU, our framework runs up to 1.84 times faster on Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation 2006 CFP benchmarks and up to 6.81 times faster on selected real applications.

   international higher education
SO JOURNAL OF ENGLISH FOR ACADEMIC PURPOSES
AB This study aims to investigate the way in which Machine Translation is used in practice by stu-dents at a transnational joint venture in China. This is a mixed-methods study, involving a questionnaire and focus groups with Chinese students who are studying on an English as a Me-dium of Instruction (EMI) programme in China. The findings suggest that the students are using the technology in strategic and nuanced ways in order to support their academic studies and enhance their abilities in the English language. The students do not cede complete control of their writing to the automated system, but take a critical and thoughtful approach towards how a combination of their own knowledge and technological assistance can support them in their academic endeavours. They translate shorter pieces of language to produce more accurate output and critically evaluate this output, especially when culturally related. When faced with time constraints, they translate paragraphs or whole texts, but then refine the grammar and logical transition within the output. Therefore, students appear to regard MT as an additional strategy with which to achieve communicative success as opposed to a substitute for their own writing skills. The authors discuss these findings and draw parallels between this and the idea of trans-languaging, suggesting that students are incorporating the digital resources into the repertoire of linguistic resources available to them.

AB Machine Translation has been defined as the process that utilizes computer software to translate text from one natural language to another[2].This definition involves accounting for the grammatical structure of, each language and using rules and grammars to transfer the grammatical structure of the source language (SL) into the target language (TL). Agreement and Word-ordering play an important role with this structure, as MT should handle agreement between the subject and verb where the number gender, person and features of'the subject are important factors in the derivation of the verb as well as the features oJ' the verb itself Other agreements are required between the adjective and the noun where Arabic adjectives depend on the number, gender and person as well as the definiteness and indefiniteness of the noun. Some other agreements also exist between the numbers and the countable nouns. This paper examines the agreement and word-order rule's in tackling Arabic MT systems. Special attention is given to Tarjim by Sakhr Software Company which pioneered a new generation of Arabic Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies. The approach adopted is flexible and scalable, and the main advantages are: first, it is a rule-based approach, and second, it can be applied on other languages with minor modifications. A major design goal of this system is that, it can be used as a stand-alone tool and can be very well integrated with a general machine translation system for English sentence.

AB Hardware resource sharing has proven to be an efficient way to increase resource utilization, save energy, and decrease operational cost. Modern-day servers accommodate hundreds of Virtual Machines (VMs) running concurrently, and lightweight software abstractions like containers enable the consolidation of an even larger number of independent tenants per server. The increasing number of hardware accelerators along with growing interconnection bandwidth creates a new class of devices available for sharing. To fully utilize the potential of these devices, I/O architecture needs to be carefully designed for both processors and devices.
   This paper presents the design and analysis of scalable Hypertenant TRanslation of I/O addresses (HyperTRIO) for shared devices. HyperTRIO provides isolation and performance guarantees at low hardware cost by supporting multiple in-flight address translations, partitioning translation caches, and utilizing both inter- and intra-tenant access patterns for translation prefetching. This work also constructs a Hyper-tenant Simulator of I/O address accesses (HyperSIO) for 1000-tenant systems which we open-sourced. This work characterizes tenant access patterns and uses these insights to address identified challenges. Overall, the HyperTRIO design enables the system to utilize full available I/O bandwidth in a hyper-tenant environment.

A very important aspect is the precision of not only manual gestures but also facial expressions, which are extremely important in the overall context of a sentence. In this article, we present the problem of including facial expressions in the automation of Polish-to-Polish Sign Language (PJM) translation-this is part of an ongoing project related to a comprehensive solution allowing for the animation of manual gestures, body movements and facial expressions. Our approach explores the possibility of using action unit (AU) recognition in the automatic annotation of recordings, which in the subsequent steps will be used to train machine learning models. This paper aims to evaluate entropy in real-life translation recordings and analyze the data associated with the detected action units. Our approach has been subjected to evaluation by experts related to Polish Sign Language, and the results obtained allow for the development of further work related to automatic translation into Polish Sign Language.

SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Solving Mathematics Word Problem (MWP) is a basic ability of humanity, which can be mastered by most students at a young age. The existing artificial intelligence system is not good enough in numerical questions, like MWPs. The hard part of this problem is translating natural language sentences in MWP into mathematical expressions or equations. In recent researches, the Transformer network, which proved a great success in machine translation, is applied to automatic mathematic word problem-solving. While previous works have only shown the ability of Transformer model in MWP, how multiple factors such as encoding, decoding, and pre-training affect the performance of Transformer model has not received enough attention. The study is the first to examine the role of these factors experimentally. This paper proposes several methods to improve Transformer network performance in MWPs under the basis of previous studies, achieves higher accuracy compared to the previous state of the art. Pre-training on target tasks dataset improves the translation quality of the Transformer model greatly. Different token encoding and search algorithms also benefit prediction accuracy at the expense of more training and testing time.

AB Multilingual neural machine translation models are trained to maximize the likelihood of a mix of examples drawn from multiple language pairs. The dominant inductive bias applied to these models is a shared vocabulary and a shared set of parameters across languages; the inputs and labels corresponding to examples drawn from different language pairs might still reside in distinct subspaces. In this paper, we introduce multilingual crossover encoder-decoder (mXEncDec) to fuse language pairs at an instance level. Our approach interpolates instances from different language pairs into joint 'crossover examples' in order to encourage sharing input and output spaces across languages. To ensure better fusion of examples in multilingual settings, we propose several techniques to improve example interpolation across dissimilar languages under heavy data imbalance. Experiments on a large-scale WMT multilingual dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly improves quality on English-to-Many, Many-to-English and zero-shot translation tasks (from +0.5 BLEU up to +5.5 BLEU points). Results on code-switching sets demonstrate the capability of our approach to improve model generalization to out-of-distribution multilingual examples. We also conduct qualitative and quantitative representation comparisons to analyze the advantages of our approach at the representation level.

AB Verbs form the pivots of sentences. However, they have not received as much attention as nouns did in the ontology and lexical semantics research. The classification of verbs and placing them in a structure according to their selectional preference and other semantic properties seem essential in most text information processing tasks like machine translation, information extraction etc. The present paper describes the construction of a verb hierarchy using Beth Levin's verb classes for English, the hypernymy hierarchy of the WordNet and the constructs and the knowledge base of the Universal Networking Language (UNL) which is a recently proposed interlingua. These ideas have been translated into the building of a verb hierarchy for Hindi. The application of this hierarchy to the construction of the Hindi WordNet is discussed. The overall motivation for this work is the task of machine translation between English and Hindi.

AB Lexically constrained neural machine translation (NMT), which controls the generation of NMT models with pre-specified constraints, is important in many practical scenarios. Due to the representation gap between discrete constraints and continuous vectors in NMT models, most existing works choose to construct synthetic data or modify the decoding algorithm to impose lexical constraints, treating the NMT model as a black box. In this work, we propose to open this black box by directly integrating the constraints into NMT models. Specifically, we vectorize source and target constraints into continuous keys and values, which can be utilized by the attention modules of NMT models. The proposed integration method is based on the assumption that the correspondence between keys and values in attention modules is naturally suitable for modeling constraint pairs. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms several representative baselines on four language pairs, demonstrating the superiority of integrating vectorized lexical constraints.

AB Record linkage, or entity resolution, is an important area of data mining. Name matching is a key component of systems for record linkage. Alternative spellings of the same name are a common occurrence in many applications. We use the largest collection of genealogy person records in the world together with user search query logs to build name-matching models. The procedure for building a crowd-sourced training set is outlined together with the presentation of our method. We cast the problem of learning alternative spellings as a machine translation problem at the character level. We use information retrieval evaluation methodology to show that this method substantially outperforms on our data a number of standard well known phonetic and string similarity methods in terms of precision and recall. Our result can lead to a significant practical impact in entity resolution applications.

AB We propose a new automatic evaluation metric for machine translation. Our proposed metric is obtained by adjusting the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to the evaluation task. The EMD measure is used to obtain the distance between two probability distributions consisting of some signatures having a feature and a weight. We use word embeddings, sentence-level tf . idf, and cosine similarity between two word embeddings, respectively, as the features, weight, and the distance between two features. Results show that our proposed metric can evaluate machine translation based on word meaning. Moreover, for distance, cosine similarity and word position information are used to address wordorder differences. We designate this metric as Word Embedding-based automatic MT evaluation using Word Position Information (WE_WPI). A meta-evaluation using WMT16 metrics shared task set indicates that our WE WPI achieves the highest correlation with human judgment among several representative metrics.

AB A lot of unnatural sentences exist in the Japanese sentences which the computer generates in the machine translation, the dialogue processing and so on. The user has dissatisfaction for it. From the point of view of this situation, we previously proposed the method which paraphrases an unnatural Japanese sentence generated by a computer to its natural Japanese sentence with inductive learning. In order to confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method, we constructed the experimental system and carried out the evaluation experiment. The rate of the number of natural sentences in the number of all input sentences improved from 32.4% to 55.3%. From the result of this evaluation experiment, we have confirmed the effectiveness of our method. In this paper, first of all, we explain the outline of our proposal method, and consider the effectiveness of our method through the experimental results.

AB Visually-grounded natural language processing has become an important research direction in the past few years. However, majorities of the available cross-modal resources (e.g., image-caption datasets) are built in English and cannot be directly utilized in multilingual or non-English scenarios. In this study, we present a novel multilingual multimodal corpus by extending the Flickr30k Entities image-caption dataset with Japanese translations, which we name Flickr30k Entities JP (F30kEnt-JP). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multilingual image-caption dataset where the captions in the two languages are parallel and have the shared annotations of many-to-many phrase-to-region linking. We believe that phrase-to-region as well as phrase-to-phrase supervision can play a vital role in fine-grained grounding of language and vision, and will promote many tasks such as multilingual image captioning and multimodal machine translation. To verify our dataset, we performed phrase localization experiments in both languages and investigated the effectiveness of our Japanese annotations as well as multilingual learning realized by our dataset.

AB Nearly all previous work on neural machine translation (NMT) has used quite restricted vocabularies, perhaps with a subsequent method to patch in unknown words. This paper presents a novel word-character solution to achieving open vocabulary NMT. We build hybrid systems that translate mostly at the word level and consult the character components for rare words. Our character-level recurrent neural networks compute source word representations and recover unknown target words when needed. The twofold advantage of such a hybrid approach is that it is much faster and easier to train than character-based ones; at the same time, it never produces unknown words as in the case of word-based models. On the WMT'15 English to Czech translation task, this hybrid approach offers an addition boost of +2.1-11.4 BLEU points over models that already handle unknown words. Our best system achieves a new state-of-the-art result with 20.7 BLEU score. We demonstrate that our character models can successfully learn to not only generate well-formed words for Czech, a highly-inflected language with a very complex vocabulary, but also build correct representations for English source words.

In the context of multisensor data fusion, how to effectively carry out English translation activity course in colleges and universities has become an important topic. The educational value and intellectual property of advanced Intelligent English translation activity course are analyzed. From multisensor data fusion and the improvement of translation, translators psychological changes of the boot and prominent features, English translation activity and translation, the generality of the multisensor data fusion of multisensor data fusion personalization features this four aspects, which is under the background of the sensor data fusion of the practice for college English translation activity. Firstly, the theory of data fusion estimation is elaborated, and various data fusion structures in multisensor systems are summarized. Then, the data fusion estimation model based on Kalman filter is established, and the Kalman filtering algorithms of centralized, sequential, parallel, and joint structures are given, respectively. Simulation experiments are carried out on the algorithms. Experimental results show that the estimation accuracy of the system can be improved by multisensor data fusion. Then a rule-based lexical analyzer is designed. Combined with the system model, a rule-based lexical analyzer and a comprehensive dictionary, the linguistic knowledge source throughout the whole machine translation process, are researched and designed. A hashing algorithm for lexical retrieval is designed, and various rules and data structures related to the lexical analyzer are described in formal language. The analysis algorithms of morphological preprocessing, morphological analysis, unincluded word processing, phrase analysis, and part of speech tagging are introduced.

TI A Compression-Based Multiple Subword Segmentation for Neural Machine
   Translation
SO ELECTRONICS
AB In this study, we propose a simple and effective preprocessing method for subword segmentation based on a data compression algorithm. Compression-based subword segmentation has recently attracted significant attention as a preprocessing method for training data in neural machine translation. Among them, BPE/BPE-dropout is one of the fastest and most effective methods compared to conventional approaches; however, compression-based approaches have a drawback in that generating multiple segmentations is difficult due to the determinism. To overcome this difficulty, we focus on a stochastic string algorithm, called locally consistent parsing (LCP), that has been applied to achieve optimum compression. Employing the stochastic parsing mechanism of LCP, we propose LCP-dropout for multiple subword segmentation that improves BPE/BPE-dropout, and we show that it outperforms various baselines in learning from especially small training data.

AB The attention mechanism is the crucial component of the transformer architecture. Recent research shows that most attention heads are not confident in their decisions and can be pruned after training. However, removing them before training a model results in lower quality. In this paper, we apply the lottery ticket hypothesis to prune heads in the early stages of training, instead of doing so on a fully converged model. Our experiments on machine translation show that it is possible to remove up to three-quarters of all attention heads from a transformer-big model with an average -0.1 change in BLEU for Turkish -> English. The pruned model is 1.5 times as fast at inference, albeit at the cost of longer training. The method is complementary to other approaches, such as teacher-student, with our English!German student losing 0.2 BLEU at 75% encoder attention sparsity.

AB This paper highlights the impressive utility of multi-parallel corpora for transfer learning in a one-to-many low-resource neural machine translation (NMT) setting. We report on a systematic comparison of multistage fine-tuning configurations, consisting of (1) pretraining on an external large (209k-440k) parallel corpus for English and a helping target language, (2) mixed pre-training or fine-tuning on a mixture of the external and low-resource (18k) target parallel corpora, and (3) pure finetuning on the target parallel corpora. Our experiments confirm that multi-parallel corpora are extremely useful despite their scarcity and content-wise redundancy thus exhibiting the true power of multilingualism. Even when the helping target language is not one of the target languages of our concern, our multistage finetuning can give 3-9 BLEU score gains over a simple one-to-one model.

AB Supervised domain adaptation-where a large generic corpus and a smaller in-domain corpus are both available for training-is a challenge for neural machine translation (NMT). Standard practice is to train a generic model and use it to initialize a second model, then continue training the second model on in-domain data to produce an in-domain model. We add an auxiliary term to the training objective during continued training that minimizes the cross entropy between the in-domain model's output word distribution and that of the out-of-domain model to prevent the model's output from differing too much from the original out-of-domain model. We perform experiments on EMEA (descriptions of medicines) and TED (rehearsed presentations), initialized from a general domain (WMT) model. Our method shows improvements over standard continued training by up to 1.5 BLEU.

AB Language modeling is a very important step in several NLP applications. Most of the current language models are based on probabilistic methods. In this paper, we propose a new language modeling approach based on the possibility theory. Our goal is to suggest a method for estimating the possibility of a word-sequence and to test this new approach in a machine translation system. We propose a word-sequence possibilistic measure, which can be estimated from a corpus. We proceeded in two ways: first, we checked the behavior of the new approach compared with the existing work. Second, we compared the new language model with the probabilistic one used in statistical MT systems. The results, in terms of the METEOR metric, show that the possibilistic-language model is better than the probabilistic one. However, in terms of BLEU and TER scores, the probabilistic model remains better.

AB The theory of bit-vectors in SMT solvers is very important for many applications due to its ability to faithfully model the behavior of machine instructions. A crucial step in solving bit-vector formulas is the translation from high-level bit-vector terms down to low-level boolean formulas that can be efficiently mapped to CNF clauses and fed into a SAT solver. In this paper, we demonstrate how a combination of program synthesis and machine learning technology can be used to automatically generate code to perform this translation in a way that is tailored to particular problem domains. Using this technique, the paper shows that we can improve upon the basic encoding strategy used by CVC4 (a state of the art SMT solver) and automatically generate variants of the solver tailored to different domains of problems represented in the bit-vector benchmark suite from SMT-COMP 2015.

TI A Method for Incorporating Language Models Based on Linkage Grammar into
   Phrase-Based SMT Models
SO INFORMATION-AN INTERNATIONAL INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL
AB Language model is an important component of statistical machine translation (SMT) systems. Syntax-based language models have been proposed and successfully used in many natural language processing applications. Moreover studies on applying syntax-based language models in syntax-based SMT models were carried out. However no studies, to our best knowledge, have been conducted to incorporate syntax-based into phrase-based SMT models, which are still dominating models in the SMT area. In this paper, we proposed a novel method to incorporate syntax-based language models into phrase-based SMT systems. The syntax-based language model used in this paper is based on link grammar, which is a high lexical formalism. In order to apply language models based on link grammar in phrase-based models, we brought out the concept of linked phrases, which is an extension of the concept of traditional phrases in phrase-based models. Experiments were conducted and the results showed that the use of syntax-based language models could improve the performance of the phrase-based models greatly.

AB The main objective of our experiments in the domain-specific track at CLEF 2008 is utilizing semantic knowledge from collaborative knowledge bases such as Wikipedia and Wiktionary to improve the effectiveness of information retrieval. While Wikipedia has already been used in IR, the application of Wiktionary in this task is new. We evaluate two retrieval models, i.e. SR-Text and SR-Word, based on semantic relatedness by comparing their performance to a statistical model as implemented by Lucene. We refer to Wikipedia article titles and Wiktionary word entries as concepts and map query and document terms to concept vectors which are then used to compute the document relevance. lit the bilingual task, we translate the English topics into the document language, i.e. German, by rising machine translation. For SR-Text, we alternatively perform the translation process by using cross-language links in Wikipedia, whereby the terms are directly mapped to concept vectors in the target language. The evaluation shows that the latter approach especially improves the retrieval performance in cases where the machine translation system incorrectly translates query terms.

TI The development of brain-machine interface neuroprosthetic devices
SO NEUROTHERAPEUTICS
AB The development of brain-machine interface technology is a logical next step in the overall direction of neuro-prosthetics. Many of the required technological advances that will be required for clinical translation of brain-machine interfaces are already under development, including a new generation of recording electrodes, the decoding and interpretation of signals underlying intention and planning, actuators for implementation of mental plans in virtual or real contexts, direct somatosensory feedback to the nervous system to refine actions, and training to encourage plasticity in neural circuits. Although pre-clinical studies in nonhuman primates demonstrate high efficacy in a realistic motor task with motor cortical recordings, there are many challenges in the clinical translation of even simple tasks and devices. Foremost among these challenges is the development of biocompatible electrodes capable of long-term, stable recording of brain activity and implantable amplifiers and signal processors that are sufficiently resistant to noise and artifact to faithfully transmit recorded signals to the external environment. Whether there is a suitable market for such new technology depends on its efficacy in restoring and enhancing neural function, its risks of implantation, and its long-term efficacy and usefulness. Now is a critical time in brain-machine interface development because most ongoing studies are science-based and noncommercial, allowing new approaches to be included in commercial schemes under development.

AB The standard training algorithm in neural machine translation (NMT) suffers from exposure bias, and alternative algorithms have been proposed to mitigate this. However, the practical impact of exposure bias is under debate. In this paper, we link exposure bias to another well-known problem in NMT, namely the tendency to generate hallucinations under domain shift. In experiments on three datasets with multiple test domains, we show that exposure bias is partially to blame for hallucinations, and that training with Minimum Risk Training, which avoids exposure bias, can mitigate this. Our analysis explains why exposure bias is more problematic under domain shift, and also links exposure bias to the beam search problem, i.e. performance deterioration with increasing beam size. Our results provide a new justification for methods that reduce exposure bias: even if they do not increase performance on in-domain test sets, they can increase model robustness to domain shift.

AB Zero-shot translations is a fascinating feature of Multilingual Neural Machine Translation (MNMT) systems. These MNMT models are usually trained on English-centric data, i.e. English either as the source or target language, and with a language label prepended to the input indicating the target language. However, recent work has highlighted several flaws of these models in zero-shot scenarios where language labels are ignored and the wrong language is generated or different runs show highly unstable results. In this paper, we investigate the benefits of an explicit alignment to language labels in Transformer-based MNMT models in the zero-shot context, by jointly training one cross attention head with word alignment supervision to stress the focus on the target language label. We compare and evaluate several MNMT systems on three multilingual MT benchmarks of different sizes, showing that simply supervising one cross attention head to focus both on word alignments and language labels reduces the bias towards translating into the wrong language, improving the zero-shot performance overall. Moreover, as an additional advantage, we find that our alignment supervision leads to more stable results across different training runs.

AB Assessment and reporting of skills is a central feature of many digital learning platforms. With students often using multiple platforms, cross-platform assessment has emerged as a new challenge. While technologies such as Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) have enabled communication between platforms, reconciling the different skill taxonomies they employ has not been solved at scale. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a methodology for finding and linking equivalent skills between platforms by utilizing problem content as well as the platform's clickstream data. We propose six models to represent skills as continuous real-valued vectors, and leverage machine translation to map between skill spaces. The methods are tested on three digital learning platforms: ASSISTments, Khan Academy, and Cognitive Tutor. Our results demonstrate reasonable accuracy in skill equivalency prediction from a fine-grained taxonomy to a coarse-grained one, achieving an average recall@5 of 0.8 between the three platforms. Our skill translation approach has implications for aiding in the tedious, manual process of taxonomy to taxonomy mapping work, also called cross-walks, within the tutoring as well as standardized testing worlds.

AB Twitter, is considered as one of the famous social networking platform. It has become a very valuable information source for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. Some strategies and linguistic pipelines were developed for analyzing English tweets but Arabic social media analysis is still an active research area. In this research paper, we focus on the task of preprocessing Arabic tweets, which can be regarded as a first step for any NLP application. We follow up with a statistical machine translation for Arabic tweets into English, where we explain the normalization process for both Arabic and English tweets. Moreover, to overcome the obstacle of unavailability of Arabic-English parallel corpora in the social media context, we used the UN corpus, a more general corpus in (Modern Standard Arabic and English). Then, we applied adapting strategies for the tweet's contents like using an out-of-domain and/or in-domain language model. Our conducted experiments showed that applying a good lexical normalization on both languages and combining in-domain and out-of-domain data for the language model improves the Bleu score with 4pt., over the baseline.

TI Bridging the cross-modal gap using adversarial training for
   speech-to-text translation
SO DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB The end-to-end speech translation (ST) model usually adopts the encoder-decoder structure, which takes the speech of the source language as input and directly outputs its translation result in the target language. Since the model performs cross-modal translation, it needs to extract semantically rich representations from speech. Compared with text, speech is fine-grained and contains more noise, which puts a great burden on the encoder of the ST model. The modal gap between speech and text usually causes the ST model to perform inferior to the corresponding machine translation (MT) model. To bridge the cross-modal gap, this paper proposes to use adversarial training to relieve the burden on the ST encoder by providing internal supervision signals. In this approach, the encoder in the ST model can extract representations that contain rich semantics, which greatly improves performance. Experiments on the datasets of Augmented Librispeech English-French and MuST-C English-German show the effectiveness of our method. Further analysis indicates that our proposed method can perform well in low-resource conditions compared to strong baselines.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful framework to address the discrepancy between loss functions used during training and the final evaluation metrics to be used at test time. When applied to neural Machine Translation (MT), it minimises the mismatch between the cross-entropy loss and non-differentiable evaluation metrics like BLEU. However, the suitability of these metrics as reward function at training time is questionable: they tend to be sparse and biased towards the specific words used in the reference texts. We propose to address this problem by making models less reliant on such metrics in two ways: (a) with an entropy-regularised RL method that does not only maximise a reward function but also explore the action space to avoid peaky distributions; (b) with a novel RL method that explores a dynamic unsupervised reward function to balance between exploration and exploitation. We base our proposals on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) framework, adapting the off-policy maximum entropy model for language generation applications such as MT. We demonstrate that SAC with BLEU reward tends to overfit less to the training data and performs better on out-of-domain data. We also show that our dynamic unsupervised reward can lead to better translation of ambiguous words.

TI Translation initiation modeling and mutational analysis based on the 3
   '-end of the Escherichia coli 16S rRNA sequence
SO BIOSYSTEMS
AB A model for the process of translation in gene expression is proposed. The model is based on the assumption that the ribosome decodes the mRNA sequences using consecutive subsequences of the 3'-end of its 16S rRNA subunit. The biological consistency of the model is validated by successful detection of the Shine-Dalgarno signal and the start codon. Furthermore, implications on the role of the 3'-end in the complete process of prokaryotic translation are presented and discussed. Interestingly, the results obtained support the possibility of an involvement of this part of the ribosome in the process of translation termination. Subsequently, results obtained via the proposed model are compared with published experimental results for different mutations of the last 13 bases of the 16S rRNA molecule. Agreement between predictions and experimental results validate the biological relevance of the proposed model. By means of simulated nucleotide mutations, a global analysis of this part of the ribosome in the process of translation is conducted. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dynamics of a type of miniature reconfigurable parallel machines is dealt with, and the trail tracking control method is studied at the same time. First, aimed at the outer translation pair driving fashion, the inverse solution model of position, velocity and acceleration of parallel machine including parallelogram strut structure is deduced. Based on this, its rigid dynamic model is set up by using the virtual work principle. Taking the gravity and error of model into consideration, a robust trail tracking controller is designed to ensure the tracking precision, which guarantees the uniform and ultimate bound of the tracking error. At last, simulation on the circular trail in the whole workspace proves that the stability and validity of this control method is excellent.

AB Neural machine translation (NMT) models are data-driven and require large-scale training corpus. In practical applications, NMT models are usually trained on a general domain corpus and then fine-tuned by continuing training on the in-domain corpus. However, this bears the risk of catastrophic forgetting that the performance on the general domain is decreased drastically. In this work, we propose a new continual learning framework for NMT models. We consider a scenario where the training is comprised of multiple stages and propose a dynamic knowledge distillation technique to alleviate the problem of catastrophic forgetting systematically. We also find that the bias exists in the output linear projection when fine-tuning on the in-domain corpus, and propose a bias-correction module to eliminate the bias. We conduct experiments on three representative settings of NMT application. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to baseline models in all settings.(1)

AB This paper introduces Dynamic Programming Encoding (DPE), a new segmentation algorithm for tokenizing sentences into subword units. We view the subword segmentation of output sentences as a latent variable that should be marginalized out for learning and inference. A mixed character-subword transformer is proposed, which enables exact log marginal likelihood estimation and exact MAP inference to find target segmentations with maximum posterior probability. DPE uses a lightweight mixed character-subword transformer as a means of pre-processing parallel data to segment output sentences using dynamic programming. Empirical results on machine translation suggest that DPE is effective for segmenting output sentences and can be combined with BPE dropout for stochastic segmentation of source sentences. DPE achieves an average improvement of 0.9 BLEU over BPE (Sennrich et al., 2016) and an average improvement of 0.55 BLEU over BPE dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) on several WMT datasets including English <-> (German, Romanian, Estonian, Finnish, Hungarian).

AB Different order between Mongolian and Chinese and the scarcity of parallel corpus are the main problems in Mongolian-Chinese statistical machine translation (SMT). We propose a method that adopts morphological information as the features of the maximum entropy based phrase reordering model for Mongolian-Chinese SMT. By taking advantage of the Mongolian morphological information, we add Mongolian stem and affix as phrase boundary information and use a maximum entropy model to predict reordering of neighbor blocks. To some extent, our method can alleviate the influence of reordering caused by the data sparseness. In addition, we further add part-of-speech (POS) as the features in the reordering model. Experiments show that the approach outperforms the maximum entropy model using only boundary words information and provides a maximum improvement of 0.8 BLEU score increment over baseline.

AB We report insights from translating Spanish conversational telephone speech into English text by cascading an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system with a statistical machine translation (SMT) system. The key new insight is that the informal register of conversational speech is a greater challenge for ASR than for SMT: the BLEU score for translating the reference transcript is 64%, but drops to 32% for translating automatic transcripts, whose word error rate (WER) is 40%. Several strategies are examined to mitigate the impact of ASR errors on the SMT output: (i) providing the ASR lattice, instead of the 1-best output, as input to the SMT system, (ii) training the SMT system on Spanish ASR output paired with English text, instead of Spanish reference transcripts, and (iii) improving the core ASR system. Each leads to consistent and complementary improvements in the SMT output. Compared to translating the 1-best output of an ASR system with 40% WER using an SMT system trained on Spanish reference transcripts, translating the output lattice of a better ASR system with 35% WER using an SMT system trained on ASR output improves BLEU from 32% to 38%.

AB Neural machine translation has achieved great success in bilingual settings, as well as in multilingual settings. With the increase of the number of languages, multilingual systems tend to underperform their bilingual counterparts. Model capacity has been found crucial for massively multilingual NMT to support language pairs with varying typological characteristics. Previous work increases the modeling capacity by deepening or widening the Transformer. However, modeling cardinality based on aggregating a set of transformations with the same topology has been proven more effective than going deeper or wider when increasing capacity. In this paper, we propose to efficiently increase the capacity for multilingual NMT by increasing the cardinality. Unlike previous work which feeds the same input to several transformations and merges their outputs into one, we present a Multi-InputMulti-Output (MIMO) architecture that allows each transformation of the block to have its own input. We also present a task-aware attention mechanism to learn to selectively utilize individual transformations from a set of transformations for different translation directions. Our model surpasses previous work and establishes a new state-of-the-art on the large scale OPUS-100 corpus while being 1:31 times as fast.

TI Language and domain aware lightweight ontology matching
SO JOURNAL OF WEB SEMANTICS
AB Concepts and relations in ontologies and in other knowledge organisation systems are usually annotated with natural language labels. Most ontology matchers rely on such labels in element-level matching techniques. State-of-the-art approaches, however, tend to make implicit assumptions about the language used in labels (usually English) and are either domain-agnostic or are built for a specific domain. When faced with labels in different languages, most approaches resort to general-purpose machine translation services to reduce the problem to monolingual English-only matching. We investigate a thoroughly different and highly extensible solution based on semantic matching where labels are parsed by multilingual natural language processing and then matched using language-independent and domain aware background knowledge acting as an interlingua. The method is implemented in NuSM, the language and domain aware evolution of the SMATCH semantic matcher, and is evaluated against a translation-based approach. We also design and evaluate a fusion matcher that combines the outputs of the two techniques in order to boost precision or recall beyond the results produced by either technique alone.

AB Objectives: Local Health Departments (LHDs) are a key source of health promotion information. For ethnically and culturally diverse communities, it becomes important to provide minorities with language appropriate health information. This project sought to assess the availability of multilingual health promotion materials on LHD websites in Washington State (WA), USA. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of all 34 LHD websites in WA. We collected and classified health promotion documents available to the public, specifically, whether translated versions were available. We also assessed the extent of document sharing between LHDs. Results: We identified 1,624 documents across 34 LHDs. Topics most frequently covered were communicable diseases and emergency preparedness. Fewer than 10% of documents were available in non-English languages. We found little evidence of document sharing between LHDs; only 5% of all documents were shared between LHDs. Conclusions: WA LHDs provide a variety of health promotion materials for the public, but few multilingual materials are available online. New technologies for facilitating document sharing and machine translation may improve the present landscape.

TI LEARNING AND EXTRACTING INITIAL MEALY AUTOMATA WITH A MODULAR
   NEURAL-NETWORK MODEL
SO NEURAL COMPUTATION
AB A hybrid recurrent neural network is shown to learn small initial mealy machines (that can be thought of as translation machines translating input strings to corresponding output strings, as opposed to recognition automata that classify strings as either grammatical or nongrammatical) from positive training samples. A well-trained neural net(1) is then presented once again with the training set and a Kohonen self-organizing map with the ''star'' topology of neurons is used to quantize recurrent network state space into distinct regions representing corresponding states of a mealy machine being learned. This enables us to extract the learned mealy machine from the trained recurrent network. One neural network (Kohonen self-organizing map) is used to extract meaningful information from another network (recurrent neural network).

TI Navigating learner data in translator and interpreter training Insights

   (CETILC)
SO BABEL-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE LA TRADUCTION-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF
   TRANSLATION
AB The development of technology, in particular, innovations in natural language processing and means to explore big data, has influenced different aspects in the training of translators and interpreters. This paper investigates how learner corpora and their research contribute to the teaching and learning of translation and interpreting. It starts with a review of the evolvement of learner corpora in translator and interpreter training. Drawing on data from the Chinese/English Translation and Interpreting Learner Corpus (CETILC), a learner corpus developed for the study of lexical cohesion, the paper introduces three case studies to illustrate the possibilities of exploring learner data through human annotation, machine-facilitated human annotation, and finally human-supervised/edited machine annotation. The findings of the case studies suggest the complexity of learner language and its intricate relationships with various factors concerning the learner, text, and task. The paper ends with a discussion of the great potentials of purposely made learner corpora such as the CETILC in translator and interpreter training, as well as the application of learner corpora in (semi-) automatic processing of learner texts.

TI Manipuri-English comparable corpus for cross-lingual studies
SO LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
AB This paper presents Mni-EnCC, a temporal alligned Manipuri-English comparable corpus, to facilitate cross-lingual studies between Manipuri and English. Mni-EnCC has been created by collating text from two publicly published news sources in internet namely Sangai Express and Poknapham in Manipur. Though, both the publishers publish news in Manipuri and English editions, they are not the translation of each other. Almost all of the Manipuri editions are created using proprietary tools which generate texts in customized non-standard and non-unicode encodings. We develop tools to transform the non-unicode text into unicode text to generate the Manipuri corpus. We then verify and time aligned all the articles using a semi-automated process. Furthermore, the quality of the Mni-EnCC is evaluated using two premier cross-lingual studies: bilingual dictionary induction and machine translation. Experimental observations provide encouraging results making it as a suitable dataset for future cross-lingual studies on between Manipuri and English language pair. With an objective to promote cross-lingual studies in Manipuri-English, we also plan to release the corpus and supporting Unicode conversion tool.

AB We present a new large-scale multilingual video description dataset, VATEX1, which contains over 41; 250 videos and 825; 000 captions in both English and Chinese. Among the captions, there are over 206; 000 English-Chinese parallel translation pairs. Compared to the widely-used MSRVTT dataset [64], VATEX is multilingual, larger, linguistically complex, and more diverse in terms of both video and natural language descriptions. We also introduce two tasks for video-and-language research based on VATEX: (1) Multilingual Video Captioning, aimed at describing a video in various languages with a compact unified captioning model, and (2) Video-guided Machine Translation, to translate a source language description into the target language using the video information as additional spatiotemporal context. Extensive experiments on the VATEX dataset show that, first, the unified multilingual model can not only produce both English and Chinese descriptions for a video more efficiently, but also offer improved performance over the monolingual models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the spatiotemporal video context can be effectively utilized to align source and target languages and thus assist machine translation. In the end, we discuss the potentials of using VATEX for other video-and-language research.

First, the machine is designed to illustrate the translation from C/C++ to assembly language and from thence to machine language. Instead of the more common memory dump labeled by address, the tracer displays a graphic representation of the cell labeled by its symbol. Second, the simulator displays in real time the growth of the run-time stack on function activation, detects and displays the boundaries of the activation record, and displays all the cells on the run-time stack labeled by symbol. The paper includes download information for the open-source application.

AB Support vector machines (SVM) have been introduced for pattern recognition and regression. But it was limited by the time consuming and the choice of kernel function in practical application. Motivated by the theory of multi-scale representations of signals and wavelet transforms, this paper presents a way for building a wavelet-based reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) which is a multiresolution scale subspace and its associate scaling kernel for least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM). The scaling kernel is constructed by using a scaling function with its different dilations and translations. Results on several approximation problems illustrate that the LS-SVM with scaling kernel can approximate arbitrary signal with multi-scale and owns better approximation performance.

AB Cross-lingual embedding has shown an effective way to learn cross-lingual representation in a joint embedding space. Recent work showed that cross-lingual phrase embedding is important to induce phrase table for unsupervised phrase-based machine translation. However, most of the cross-lingual representation from the literature are either limited to word level embedding or uses bilingual supervision for shared phrase embedding space. Therefore, in this paper, we explore the ways to map phrase embeddings of two languages into a common embedding space without supervision. Our model uses a three-step process: first we identify phrase in a sentence by using their mutual information, and combine component words of the phrase in the preprocessing stage; then we independently learn phrase embedding for each language based on their distributional properties, finally a fully unsupervised linear transformation method based on self-learning is used to map the phrase embeddings into a shared space. We extracted bilingual phrase translation as a gold standard to evaluate the result of the system. Besides its simplicity, the proposed method has shown a promising result for phrase embedding mapping.

AB Medical image translation has the potential to reduce the imaging workload, by removing the need to capture some sequences, and to reduce the annotation burden for developing machine learning methods. GANs have been used successfully to translate images from one domain to another, such as MR to CT. At present, paired data (registered MR and CT images) or extra supervision (e.g. segmentation masks) is needed to learn good translation models. Registering multiple modalities or annotating structures within each of them is a tedious and laborious task. Thus, there is a need to develop improved translation methods for unpaired data. Here, we introduce modified pix2pix models for tasks CT -> MR and MR -> CT, trained with unpaired CT and MR data, and MRCAT pairs generated from the MR scans. The proposed modifications utilize the paired MR and MRCAT images to ensure good alignment between input and translated images, and unpaired CT images ensure the MR -> CT model produces realistic-looking CT and CT -> MR model works well with real CT as input. The proposed pix2pix variants outperform baseline pix2pix, pix2pixHD and Cyc1eGAN in terms of FID and KID, and generate more realistic looking CT and MR translations.

SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Accurate simulations of atomistic systems from first principles are limited by computational cost. In high-throughput settings, machine learning can reduce these costs significantly by accurately interpolating between reference calculations. For this, kernel learning approaches crucially require a representation that accommodates arbitrary atomistic systems. We introduce a many-body tensor representation that is invariant to translations, rotations, and nuclear permutations of same elements, unique, differentiable, can represent molecules and crystals, and is fast to compute. Empirical evidence for competitive energy and force prediction errors is presented for changes in molecular structure, crystal chemistry, and molecular dynamics using kernel regression and symmetric gradient-domain machine learning as models. Applicability is demonstrated for phase diagrams of Pt-group/transition-metal binary systems.

AB Named entity recognition (NER) is low-level semantics technology. Since it is simple and efficient, it has been widely applied in many systems such as machine translation, information retrieval, information extraction, question answering and summarization. The goal of named entity recognition is to classify names into some particular categories from text, such as the names of people, places, and organizations. Previous studies focus on combining abundant rules or trigger words to enhance the system performance. These methods require domain experts to build up the rules and word set. In this paper, we present a robust named entity recognition system based on support vector machines (SVM). In the experiment, we perform the One-against-One SVM algorithm and a feature extraction method to achieve high accuracy.

AB While pre-training techniques are working very well in natural language processing, how to pre-train a decoder and effectively leverage it for neural machine translation (NMT) still remains a tricky issue. The main reason is that the cross-attention module between the encoder and decoder cannot be pre-trained, and the combined encoder-decoder model cannot work well in the fine-tuning stage because the inputs of the decoder cross-attention come from unknown encoder outputs. In this paper, we propose a better pre-training method for NMT by defining a semantic interface (SemFace) between the pre-trained encoder and the pre-trained decoder. Specifically, we propose two types of semantic interfaces, including CL-SemFace which regards cross-lingual embeddings as an interface, and VQ-SemFace which employs vector quantized embeddings to constrain the encoder outputs and decoder inputs in the same language-independent space. We conduct massive experiments on six supervised translation pairs and three unsupervised pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SemFace can effectively connect the pre-trained encoder and decoder, and achieves significant improvement by 3.7 and 1.5 BLEU points on the two tasks respectively compared with previous pre-training-based NMT models.

TI Efficient Java exception handling in just-in-time compilation
SO SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
CT ACM 2000 Java Grande Conference
CY JUN, 2000
CL San Francisco, CA
AB Java uses exceptions to provide elegant error handling capabilities during program execution. However, the presence of exception handlers complicates the job of the just-in-time (JIT) compiler, while exceptions are rarely used in most programs. This paper describes two techniques for reducing such complications. First, we delay the translation of an exception handier until the exception really occurs. This on-demand translation of exception handlers allows more optimizations when translating the main flow, without being hindered by constraints caused by the exception flows. Secondly, for those exceptions that are actually thrown during program execution we insert exception-type check code and a direct branch to the translated exception handlers. This exception handler prediction is motivated by an observation that frequently thrown exceptions are likely to be handled by the same exception handlers, so this will eliminate the exception processing overhead of the Java virtual machine. Our experiments indicate that the code quality of the main flow is no longer affected by the presence of exception handlers. Also, frequently thrown exceptions can be efficiently handled by the exception handier prediction. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB The encoder-decoder framework has achieved promising progress for many sequence generation tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, dialog system, image captioning, etc. Such a framework adopts an one-pass forward process while decoding and generating a sequence, but lacks the deliberation process: A generated sequence is directly used as final output without further polishing. However, deliberation is a common behavior in human's daily life like reading news and writing papers/articles/books. In this work, we introduce the deliberation process into the encoder-decoder framework and propose deliberation networks for sequence generation. A deliberation network has two levels of decoders, where the first-pass decoder generates a raw sequence and the second-pass decoder polishes and refines the raw sentence with deliberation. Since the second-pass deliberation decoder has global information about what the sequence to be generated might be, it has the potential to generate a better sequence by looking into future words in the raw sentence. Experiments on neural machine translation and text summarization demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed deliberation networks. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.5.

AB Logs of user queries from a search engine (such as Bing or Google) together with the links clicked provide valuable implicit feedback to improve statistical spoken language understanding (SLU) models. However, the form of natural language utterances occurring in spoken interactions with a computer differs stylistically from that of keyword search queries. In this paper, we propose a machine translation approach to learn a mapping from natural language utterances to search queries. We train statistical translation models, using task and domain independent semantically equivalent natural language and keyword search query pairs mined from the search query click logs. We then extend our previous work on enriching the existing classification feature sets for input utterance domain detection with features computed using the click distribution over a set of clicked URLs from search engine query click logs of user utterances with automatically translated queries. This approach results in significant improvements for domain detection, especially when detecting the domains of user utterances that are formulated as natural language queries and effectively complements to the earlier work using syntactic transformations.

AB Graph-based semantic parsing aims to represent textual meaning through directed graphs. As one of the most promising general-purpose meaning representations, these structures and their parsing have gained a significant interest momentum during recent years, with several diverse formalisms being proposed. Yet, owing to this very heterogeneity, most of the research effort has focused mainly on solutions specific to a given formalism. In this work, instead, we reframe semantic parsing towards multiple formalisms as Multilingual Neural Machine Translation (MNMT), and propose SGL, a many-to-many seq2 seq architecture trained with an MNMT objective. Backed by several experiments, we show that this framework is indeed effective once the learning procedure is enhanced with large parallel corpora coming from Machine Translation: we report competitive performances on AMR and UCCA parsing, especially once paired with pre-trained architectures. Furthermore, we find that models trained under this configuration scale remarkably well to tasks such as cross-lingual AMR parsing: SGL outperforms all its competitors by a large margin without even explicitly seeing non-English to AMR examples at training time and, once these examples are included as well, sets an unprecedented state of the art in this task.

AB Speed, portability and correctness have traditionally been the main requirements for dynamic binary translation (DBT) systems. Given the increasing availability of multi-core machines as both emulation guests and hosts, scalability has emerged as an additional design objective. It has however been an elusive goal for two reasons: contention on common data structures such as the translation cache is difficult to avoid without hurting performance, and instruction set architecture (ISA) disparities between guest and host (such as mismatches in the memory consistency model and the semantics of atomic operations) can compromise correctness.
   In this paper we address these challenges in a simple and memory-efficient way, demonstrating a multi-threaded DBT-based emulator that scales in an architecture-independent manner. Furthermore, we explore the trade-offs that exist when emulating atomic operations across ISAs, and present a novel approach for correct and scalable emulation of load-locked/store-conditional instructions based on hardware transactional memory (HTM). By adding around 1000 lines of code to QEMU, we demonstrate the scalability of both user-mode and full-system emulation on a 64-core x86 64 host running x86 64 guest code, and a 12-core, 96-thread POWER8 host running x86 64 and Aarch64 guest code.

TI Extracting parallel phrases from comparable data for machine translation
SO NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING
AB Mining parallel data from comparable corpora is a promising approach for overcoming the data sparseness in statistical machine translation and other natural language processing applications. In this paper, we address the task of detecting parallel phrase pairs embedded in comparable sentence pairs. We present a novel phrase alignment approach that is designed to only align parallel sections bypassing non-parallel sections of the sentence. We compare the proposed approach with two other alignment methods: (1) the standard phrase extraction algorithm, which relies on the Viterbi path of the word alignment, (2) a binary classifier to detect parallel phrase pairs when presented with a large collection of phrase pair candidates. We evaluate the accuracy of these approaches using a manually aligned data set, and show that the proposed approach outperforms the other two approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the extracted phrase pairs by using them in Arabic-English and Urdu-English translation systems, which resulted in improvements upto 1.2 Bleu over the baseline. The main contributions of this paper are two-fold: (1) novel phrase alignment algorithms to extract parallel phrase pairs from comparable sentences, (2) evaluating the utility of the extracted phrases by using them directly in the MT decoder.

TI Sentiment analysis in cross-linguistic context: How can machine
   translation influence sentiment classification?
SO DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP IN THE HUMANITIES
AB In recent years, there has been a lot of interest in cross-language sentiment classification, as the research in sentiment analysis has shifted focus from English to less resourceful languages. Cross-language sentiment classification attempts to leverage the automated machine translation (MT) capability utilizing the infrastructure of languages rich in linguistic resources, mainly English, to help build sentiment analysis systems for low-resource languages. In this study, we explore how MT influences cross-language sentiment classification. To this end, we perform three different experiments, obtaining promising results. In the first experiment, we automatically translate 4,000 positive and negative reviews from English into Greek and Italian, thus obtaining labeled sentiment datasets in these languages. Then, we train a Naive Bayes classifier and compare the performance with the source dataset. In the second experiment, the translated reviews are automatically translated back into the source language (English), aiming to compare the classification accuracy with the one obtained in the original dataset. In the final approach, the reviews are translated from the source (English) into Italian through an intermediate translation in Greek to examine whether the performance was further diminished compared with the approach of the first experiment.

AB Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence architectures, while achieving state-of-the-art results on a large number of NLP tasks, can still suffer from overfitting during training. In practice, this is usually countered either by applying regularization methods (e.g. dropout, L2-regularization) or by providing huge amounts of training data. Additionally, Transformer and other architectures are known to struggle when generating very long sequences. For example, in machine translation, the neural-based systems perform worse on very long sequences when compared to the preceding phrase-based translation approaches (Koehn and Knowles, 2017).
   We present results which suggest that the issue might also be in the mismatch between the length distributions of the training and validation data combined with the aforementioned tendency of the neural networks to overfit to the training data. We demonstrate on a simple string editing task and a machine translation task that the Transformer model performance drops significantly when facing sequences of length diverging from the length distribution in the training data. Additionally, we show that the observed drop in performance is due to the hypothesis length corresponding to the lengths seen by the model during training rather than the length of the input sequence.

AB The use of virtual machine technology has become a popular approach for defending software applications from attacks by adversaries that wish to compromise the integrity and confidentiality of an application. In addition to providing some inherent obfuscation of the execution of the software application, the use of virtual machine technology can make both static and dynamic analysis more difficult for the adversary. However, a major point of concern is the protection of the virtual machine itself. The major weakness is that the virtual machine presents a inviting target for the adversary. If an adversary can render the virtual machine ineffective, they can focus their energy and attention on the software application. One possible approach is to protect the virtual machine by composing or nesting virtualization layers to impart virtual machine protection techniques to the inner virtual machines "closest" to the software application. This paper explores the concept and feasibility of nested virtualization for software protection using a high-performance software dynamic translation system. Using two metrics for measuring the strength of protection, the preliminary results show that nesting virtual machines can strengthen protection of the software application. While the nesting of virtual machines does increase run-time overhead, initial results indicate that with careful application of the technique, run-time overhead could be reduced to reasonable levels.

AB The use of multilingualism among the new generation is widespread in the form of code-mixed data on social media, and therefore a robust translation system is required for catering to the novice and monolingual users. In this work, we present a translation framework that uses a translation-transliteration strategy for translating code-mixed data into their equivalent monolingual instances. One of the goals of this work is to translate a code-mixed source (written in Roman script) to a Bengali target (written in Devanagari script), where the source may contain English, along with transliterated Bengali. Finally, to convert the output to a more readable form, it is reordered using a target language model. The decisive advantage of the proposed framework is that it does not require a code-mixed to monolingual parallel corpus for training and decoding. On testing the framework, it achieved BLEU and TER scores of 16.47 and 55.45, respectively. Since the proposed framework deals with various sub-modules, we dive deeper into the importance of each of them, analyze the errors and finally, discuss some improvement strategies.

AB Unknown words whose translation is not listed in general dictionaries, have been a problem in cross-language information retrieval and machine translation. Since the new terms are created one after the other, it is difficult to cover all such terms using general bilingual dictionaries. Therefore, researches on automatic extraction of translations for unknown words have been performed for the purpose of building a bilingual dictionary at low cost using Web corpora. In this paper, we focus on anime titles; they are commercially important, and propose a method to extract Japanese candidate translations corresponding to the English anime titles using Conditional Random Fields (CRF). We used transliteration features as well as features of bag of words, part of speech, and so on because we focused on the fact that when the Japanese anime titles were translated into English, they were transliterated in many cases. The experiments were performed using one hundred Web pages at most collected from the search engine, whose queries were Japanese-English anime title pairs extracted from Wikipedia. The results showed that the number of acquired titles significantly increased when the transliteration features were used.

TI Fluctuations in protein synthesis from a single RNA template: Stochastic
   kinetics of ribosomes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Proteins are polymerized by cyclic machines called ribosomes, which use their messenger RNA (mRNA) track also as the corresponding template, and the process is called translation. We explore, in depth and detail, the stochastic nature of the translation. We compute various distributions associated with the translation process; one of them-namely, the dwell time distribution-has been measured in recent single-ribosome experiments. The form of the distribution, which fits best with our simulation data, is consistent with that extracted from the experimental data. For our computations, we use a model that captures both the mechanochemistry of each individual ribosome and their steric interactions. We also demonstrate the effects of the sequence inhomogeneities of real genes on the fluctuations and noise in translation. Finally, inspired by recent advances in the experimental techniques of manipulating single ribosomes, we make theoretical predictions on the force-velocity relation for individual ribosomes. In principle, all our predictions can be tested by carrying out in vitro experiments.

AB In this paper we describe our work in constructing a language identification system for use in our simultaneous lecture translation system. We first built PPR and PPRLM baseline systems that produce score-fusing language cue feature vectors for language discrimination and utilize an SVM back-end classifier for the actual language identification. On our bi-lingual lecture tasks the PPRLM system clearly outperforms the PPR system in various segment length conditions, however at the cost of slower run-time. By using lexical information in the form of keyword spotting, and additional language models we show ways to improve the performance of both baseline systems. In order to combine the faster run-time of the PPR system with the better performance of the PPRLM system we finally built a hybrid of both approaches that clearly outperforms the PPR system while not adding any additional computing time. This hybrid system is therefore our choice for the use in the lecture translation system due to its faster run-time and good performance.

AB End-to-end speech translation models have become a new trend in research due to their potential of reducing error propagation. However, these models still suffer from the challenge of data scarcity. How to effectively use unlabeled or other parallel corpora from machine translation is promising but still an open problem. In this paper, we propose Cross Speech-Text Network (XSTNet), an end-to-end model for speech-to-text translation. XSTNet takes both speech and text as input and outputs both transcription and translation text. The model benefits from its three key design aspects: a self-supervised pre-trained sub-network as the audio encoder, a multi-task training objective to exploit additional parallel bilingual text, and a progressive training procedure. We evaluate the performance of XSTNet and baselines on the MuST-C En-X and Libri-Speech En-Fr datasets. In particular, XSTNet achieves state-of-the-art results on all language directions with an average BLEU of 28.8, outperforming the previous best method by 3.2 BLEU. Code, models, cases, and more detailed analysis are available at https://github.com/ReneeYe/XSTNet.

AB Back-translation has proven to be an effective method to utilize monolingual data in neural machine translation (NMT), and iteratively conducting back-translation can further improve the model performance. Selecting which monolingual data to back-translate is crucial, as we require that the resulting synthetic data are of high quality and reflect the target domain. To achieve these two goals, data selection and weighting strategies have been proposed, with a common practice being to select samples close to the target domain but also dissimilar to the average general-domain text. In this paper, we provide insights into this commonly used approach and generalize it to a dynamic curriculum learning strategy, which is applied to iterative back-translation models. In addition, we propose weighting strategies based on both the current quality of the sentence and its improvement over the previous iteration. We evaluate our models on domain adaptation, low-resource, and high-resource MT settings and on two language pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods achieve improvements of up to 1.8 BLEU points over competitive baselines.(1)

AB Advances in machine and language translation immerge new fields and research opportunities for researchers, whereas Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics deal with communication between natural languages and their interaction. The objective of this research is to develop and test a novel tactic to solve the issue of translation from Roman Urdu to the English language. The approach used to construct this practical model is divided into three stages; each stage works out to achieve its desired task. Self-maintained corpus alongwith its corresponding tag-set is used for tokenization. The syntactical structure is covered by writing Urdu POS tagger based on grammatical rules. We prepared the grammatical structures of different sentences for Roman Urdu to English translation. Since Roman script can be expressed in numerous ways, our grammatical structures fulfill the maximum possible needs of writing and produce the best possible English translation. We entered a sentence in Roman Urdu which gave the best possible translation in the English language. In comparison with Google Translator, Transtech worked better and gives more accurate results.

AB Industrial robot has an increasingly wide application in automatic manufacturing of aerospace parts. However, the robot still faces challenges due to the hard processing material and high demand of machining quality. In this paper, a robot posture optimization method is proposed to improve the machining accuracy in aerospace skin milling. The basic idea is that the objective function is defined as absolute average machining accuracy to be minimized. Both joint parameter error and stiffness, the major two factors causing machining error, are considered in the objective function. The function relationship between machining error and joint parameter error is established using robot kinematic. Based on robot dynamics and force adjoint transformation, the machining error with respect to joint stiffness, milling force and robot posture is theoretically analyzed. For n cutting location points, the optimization problem is formulated as (n + 1) variables including rotation and translation redundant freedoms to be determined by genetic algorithm. Finally, the experiment of aerospace skin milling using ABB 6660 robot is provided.

TI Translating the invisible: Governing underground utilities in the
   Amsterdam airport Schiphol terminal project
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT
AB Governing material conditions -including physical, material subjects such as machines, build constructions, construction materials, and subsoils -is a crucial challenge within projects and is underrepresented in project governance theory. To clarify the relationship between project governance and materiality, we draw on translation theory, which is essentially about the reinterpretation, appropriation, and representation of interests related to materials. This paper studies the challenges of governing the underground during the construction of the new terminal at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. The findings show that, during the project life cycle, the translation of the underground by project actors hampered the necessary relocation of utilities in this project. This eventually resulted in delays and unforeseen costs. This translation is explained by a combination of the governance of the project, strategic interactions of project actors, and the characteristics and context of the material conditions. We contribute to project governance studies by demonstrating the usefulness of translation theory to better understand the mechanisms at play in governing underrepresented material conditions in infrastructure projects.

AB With advances in hardware-assisted full virtualization technologies, system virtualization based on the virtual machine monitor (VMM) has received much recent attention. Using the Xen/IA64 hardware virtual machine implemented on Intel (R) Virtualization Technology for Itaniums (R)(VT-i), we investigate the design of a virtual software hash translation lookaside buffer (TLB) based on the virtual hash page table (VHPT). Experimental results show that the proposed design can significantly improve the performance of the hardware virtual machine of Xen/IA64. Our contributions are the following. First, we design and implement in the VMM a virtual hash TLB algorithm to optimize the system performance of VT-i guest virtual machines. Second, we quantify experimentally the performance benefits of the hash TLB for VT-i guest virtual machines and analyze the performance impact of the software VHPT walker with the hash TLB algorithm. Lastly, we present experiments to verify, in an SMP virtual machine system environment, the superior scalability of the hash TLB approach.

The SLSE, by creating a new pipeline of SLSE through the establishment of the network described above, the first bilingual dictionary of the model of training data, including the Deep Neural Network (DNN) that has been proposed, because it is often in such, it is building because it plays a very important role in the model, SLSE is evaluated by people to ensure the richness of the content that has been used as training data. If the English applicable, not built from 60 gigabytes of text. Since the processing time for it when not highly structured data mining is large, it is troublesome to collect data on this scale. To shorten the processing time, data mining is implemented as a whole.

TI A BEHAVIOR-PRESERVING TRANSLATION FROM FBD DESIGN TO C IMPLEMENTATION
   FOR REACTOR PROTECTION SYSTEM SOFTWARE
SO NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Software safety for nuclear reactor protection systems (RPSs) is the most important requirement for the obtainment of permission for operation and export from government authorities, which is why it should be managed with well-experienced software development processes. The RPS software is typically modeled with function block diagrams (FBDs) in the design phase, and then mechanically translated into C programs in the implementation phase, which is finally compiled into executable machine codes and loaded on RPS hardware - PLC (Programmable Logic Controller). Whereas C Compilers are fully-verified COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) software, translators from FBDs to C programs are provided by PLC vendors. Long-term experience, experiments and simulations have validated their correctness and function safety. This paper proposes a behavior-preserving translation from FBD design to C implementation for RPS software. It includes two sets of translation algorithms and rules as well as a prototype translator. We used an example of RPS software in a Korean nuclear power plant to demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed translation.

TI Design and verification of an ultra-precision 3D-coordinate measuring
   machine with parallel drives
SO MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB An ultra-precision 3D coordinate measuring machine (CMM), the TriNano N100, has been developed. In our design, the workpiece is mounted on a 3D stage, which is driven by three parallel drives that are mutually orthogonal. The linear drives support the 3D stage using vacuum preloaded (VPL) air bearings, whereby each drive determines the position of the 3D stage along one translation direction only. An exactly constrained design results in highly repeatable machine behavior. Furthermore, the machine complies with the Abbe principle over its full measurement range and the application of parallel drives allows for excellent dynamic behavior. The design allows a 3D measurement uncertainty of 100 nanometers in a measurement range of 200 cubic centimeters. Verification measurements using a Gannen XP 3D tactile probing system on a spherical artifact show a standard deviation in single point repeatability of around 2 nm in each direction.

AB We formulate the challenging problem to establish information interoperability within a system of systems (SoS) as a machine-learning task, where autoencoder embeddings are aligned using message data and metadata to automate message translation. An SoS requires communication and collaboration between otherwise independently operating systems, which are subject to different standards, changing conditions, and hidden assumptions. Thus, interoperability approaches that are based on standardization and symbolic inference will have limited generalization and scalability in the SoS engineering domain. We present simulation experiments performed with message data generated using heating and ventilation system simulations. While the unsupervised learning approach proposed here remains unsolved in general, we obtained up to 75% translation accuracy with autoencoders aligned by back-translation after investigating seven different models with different training protocols and hyperparameters. For comparison, we obtain 100% translation accuracy on the same task with supervised learning, but the need for a labeled dataset makes that approach less interesting. We discuss possibilities to extend the proposed unsupervised learning approach to reach higher translation accuracy.

TI Specialized ribosomes and the control of translation
SO BIOCHEMICAL SOCIETY TRANSACTIONS
AB The control of translation is increasingly recognized as a major factor in determining protein levels in the cell. The ribosome - the cellular machine that mediates protein synthesis - is typically seen as a key, but invariant, player in this process. This is because translational control is thought to be mediated by other auxiliary factors while ribosome recruitment is seen as the end-point of regulation. However, recent developments have made it clear that heterogeneous ribosome types can exist in different tissues, and more importantly, that these ribosomes can preferentially translate different subsets of mRNAs. In so doing, heterogeneous ribosomes could be key regulatory players in differentiation and development. Here, we examine current evidence for the existence of different ribosome types and how they might arise. In particular, we will take a close look at the mechanisms through which these ribosomes might mediate selective mRNA translation. We also summarize recently developed techniques/approaches that will aid in our understanding of the functions of such specialized ribosomes.

AB Conversion of Chinese Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) plays an important role in Mandarin Chinese Text-To-Speech (TTS) systems, where one of the biggest challenges is the task of polyphone disambiguation. Most of the previous polyphone disambiguation models are trained on manually annotated datasets, and publicly available datasets for polyphone disambiguation are scarce. In this paper we propose a simple back-translation-style data augmentation method for mandarin Chinese polyphone disambiguation, utilizing a large amount of unlabeled text data. Inspired by the back-translation technique proposed in the field of machine translation, we build a Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) model to predict the pronunciation of polyphonic character, and a Phoneme-to-Grapheme (P2G) model to predict pronunciation into text. Meanwhile, a window-based matching strategy and a multi-model scoring strategy are proposed to judge the correctness of the pseudo-label. We design a data balance strategy to improve the accuracy of some typical polyphonic characters in the training set with imbalanced distribution or data scarcity. The experimental result shows the effectiveness of the proposed back-translation-style data augmentation method.

AB Training data is an essential ingredient within supervised learning, but time consuming, expensive and for some applications impossible to acquire. A possible solution is to use synthetic training data. However, the domain shift of synthetic data makes it challenging to obtain good results when used as training data for deep learning models. It is therefore of interest to refine synthetic data, e.g. using image-to-image translation, to improve results. The aim of this work is to compare different methods to do image-to-image translation of synthetic training data of thermal IR-images using generative adversarial networks (GANs). Translation is done both using synthetic thermal IR-images alone, as well as including pixelwise depth and/or semantic information. To evaluate, we propose a new measure based on the Frechet Inception Distance, adapted to work for thermal IR-images. We show that by adapting a GAN model to also include corresponding pixelwise depth data to each synthetic IR-image, the performance is improved compared to using only IR-images.

AB In this paper, we described the process of building a large-scale speech-to-text pipeline. Two target domains, daily conversations and travel-related conversations between two agents, for the English-German language pair (both directions) are examined. The SMT component is built from out-of-domain but freely-available bilingual and monolingual data. We make use of most of the known available resources to examine the effects of unrestricted data and large scale models. A naive baseline delivers solid results in terms of MT-quality. Extending the baseline with context-based translation model features like operations sequence models, higher-order class-based language models, and additional web-scale word-based language models leads to a system that significantly outperforms the baseline. Domain adaption is performed by separately weighting the influence of the out-of-domain subcorpora. This is explored for translation models and language models yielding significant improvements in both cases. Automatic and manual evaluation results are provided for raw MT-quality and ASR+MT-quality.

TI Functionally diverse dendritic mRNAs rapidly associate with ribosomes
   following a novel experience
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The subcellular localization and translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) supports functional differentiation between cellular compartments. In neuronal dendrites, local translation of mRNA provides a rapid and specific mechanism for synaptic plasticity and memory formation, and might be involved in the pathophysiology of certain brain disorders. Despite the importance of dendritic mRNA translation, little is known about which mRNAs can be translated in dendrites in vivo and when their translation occurs. Here we collect ribosome-bound mRNA from the dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons in the adult mouse hippocampus. We find that dendritic mRNA rapidly associates with ribosomes following a novel experience consisting of a contextual fear conditioning trial. High throughput RNA sequencing followed by machine learning classification reveals an unexpected breadth of ribosome-bound dendritic mRNAs, including mRNAs expected to be entirely somatic. Our findings are in agreement with a mechanism of synaptic plasticity that engages the acute local translation of functionally diverse dendritic mRNAs.

AB Different electromyography (EMG) machines store their data in different formats that vary from manufacturer to manufacturer and even between different EMG machines from the same manufacturer. As advanced as these machines are today, it is necessary in most cases to use faxes, scanners, or a common interface such as Adobe's file format to exchange data between them. A possible solution to this problem is to translate the EMG machine's data output into a common format that can be read (and displayed) by commonly available programs or, even better, by a Web browser. We describe an EMG-extensible markup language (XML) translation program that takes proprietary data from an EMG machine and translates the data into XML, a common language format. Predefined extensible stylesheet language (XSL) style sheets allow the display of the data in user-defined formats for EMG machines, personal digital assistants such as Palm Pilots, and even cellular phones.

AB In global e-commerce, semantic document exchange ensures unambiguity and shares same meaning for documents sender and receiver cross different natural languages (e.g., English to Chinese), as the difference makes the translation between cross-language documents complex and inaccurate. This paper proposed a novel collaborative framework of semantic document exchange through a mediation approach which provides a sentence-based machine natural language (MNL). Here, the NINE constructs a grammatical case structure to compatible with all languages. Thus, the mediation framework enables the sentence computer-readable and understandable without ambiguity, simultaneously the MNL can improve accuracy and reduce the complexity of mapping in semantic document exchange.

AB In the process of learning English, the status of spoken language is particularly important, and it is also the most concerned aspect of most English learners. However, the current situation is that due to the limited resources of traditional teachers and the lack of oral practice environment, it is difficult for many learners to effectively improve their English level. Based on this, this study builds a smart English recognition system based on support vector machine. Moreover, this paper introduces a support vector machine to characterize speech signals. In addition, this paper uses feature fusion to map complex nonlinear relationships between features based on support vector machines and establishes a smart English recognition system based on support vector machine. The model can accurately identify the syllables and pronunciations in the words. Moreover, the use of a large-scale corpus based on non-specific people in this article can represent the generality of spoken learner.

The scale and importance of these models require that they be efficient, expressive, and portable across an array of heterogeneous hardware devices. These constraints are often at odds; in order to better accommodate them we propose a new high-level intermediate representation (IR) called Relay. Relay is being designed as a purely-functional, statically-typed language with the goal of balancing efficient compilation, expressiveness, and portability. We discuss the goals of Relay and highlight its important design constraints. Our prototype is part of the open source NNVM compiler framework, which powers Amazon's deep learning framework MxNet.

The tools and methods are evaluated with the TREC CLIR task document collection using Dutch queries on the English document base. The main issue addressed here is an evaluation of two approaches to disambiguation. The underlying question is whether a lot of effort should be: put in finding the correct translation for each query term before searching, or whether searching with more than one possible translation leads to better results? The experimental study suggests that the quality of search methods is more important than the quality of disambiguation methods. Good retrieval methods are able to disambiguate translated queries implicitly during searching.

For example, in imaging science, GANs are effectively utilized in generating image datasets, photographs of human faces, image and video captioning, image-to-image translation, text-to-image translation, video prediction, and 3D object generation to name a few. In this paper, we discuss how GANs can be used to create an artificial world. More specifically, we discuss how GANs help to describe an image utilizing image/video captioning methods and how to translate the image to a new image using image-to-image translation frameworks in a theme we desire. We articulate how GANs impact creating a customized world.

TI Functional specialization of ribosomes?
SO TRENDS IN BIOCHEMICAL SCIENCES
AB Ribosomes are highly conserved macromolecular machines that are responsible for protein synthesis in all living organisms. Work published in the past year has shown that changes to the ribosome core can affect the mechanism of translation initiation that is favored in the cell, which potentially leads to specific changes in the relative efficiencies with which different proteins are made. Here, I examine recent data from expression and proteomic studies that suggest that cells make slightly different ribosomes under different growth conditions, and discuss genetic evidence that such differences are functional. In particular, I argue that eukaryotic cells probably produce ribosomes that lack one or more core ribosomal proteins (RPs) under some conditions, and that core RPs contribute differentially to translation of distinct subpopulations of mRNAs.

AB We propose a method that bilingually segments sentences in languages with no clear delimiter for word boundaries. In our model, we first convert the search for the segmentation into a sequential tagging problem, allowing for a polynomial-time dynamic-programming solution, and incorporate a control to balance monolingual and bilingual information at hand. Our bilingual segmentation algorithm, the integration of a monolingual language model and a statistical translation model, is devised to tokenize sentences more suitably for bilingual applications such as word alignment and machine translation. Empirical results show that bilingually-motivated segmenters outperform pure monolingual one in both the word-aligning (12% reduction in error rate) and the translating (5% improvement in BLEU) tasks, suggesting monolingual segmentation is useful in some aspects but, in a sense, not built for bilingual researches.

TI Analysing user's queries for cross-language image retrieval from digital
   library collections
SO ELECTRONIC LIBRARY
AB Purpose - This paper aims to describe a study of the queries generated from a user experiment for cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) from a historic image archive.
   Design/methodology/approach - A controlled lab-based user study was carried out using a prototype Italian-English image retrieval system. Participants were asked to carry out searches for 16 images provided to them, a known-item search task. Italian speaking users generated 618 queries for a set of known-item search tasks. User's interactions with the system were recorded and queries were analysed manually quantitatively and qualitatively. The queries generated by user's interaction with the system were analysed and the results used to suggest recommendations for the future development of cross-language retrieval systems for digital image libraries.
   Findings Results highlight the diversity in requests for similar visual content and the weaknesses of machine translation for query translation. Through the manual translation of queries the authors show the benefits of using high-quality translation resources. The results show the individual characteristics of users while performing known-item searches and the overlap obtained between query terms and structured image captions, highlighting the use of user's search terms for objects within the foreground of an image.
   Research limitations/implications - This research looks in depth into one case of interaction and one image repository. Despite this limitation, the discussed results are likely to be valid across other languages and image repositories.
   Practical implications - To develop effective systems requires studying user's search behaviours, particularly in digital image libraries.
   Originality/value - The growing quantity of digital visual material in digital libraries offers the potential to apply techniques from CLIR to provide cross-language information access services. The value of this paper is in the provision of empirical evidence to support recommendations for effective cross-language image retrieval system design.

AB Cloud computing changes the conventional way of virtualization resource allocation, and gives users high flexibility and convenience. However, when the cloud service providers offer Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), there are many practical problems to be resolved. We propose a cloud system's prototype, through a composition of cloud services to automate workflow and exchange data between services based on Message-Oriented Middleware, and then achieve the goal of virtualization platform integration. We develop efficient schemes for users to use functions, which include a single web portal, virtual machine templates and message translation, to quickly deploy virtual machines in a large-scale.

AB This article presents an implemented prototype of a French-to-English translation system which goal is to ensure a syntactic quality of translation. The method employed relies on a French parser, named SYGFRAN, which in turn is based on an engine that uses Markov's algorithms applied to tree transducers. SYGFRAN produces a syntactic tree structure as output, with non terminal nodes tagged with part-of-speech constituents and dependencies. In this presentation, we show that divergence is the basis upon which we try to model the transformation path between an analyzed French sentence and its corresponding generated English sentence. We present a set of examples of divergence rules with different scopes, and a first evaluation of the prototype on two corpora: A random corpus, and a chosen corpus of,syntactically difficult' French sentences.

AB This paper presents the workspace analysis of a 6 DOF Parallel Kinematic Machine (PKM) designed for machining. The analysis is based on kineto-statics indexes able to highlight different aspects of the manipulator performances. Beside the classical jacobian based indexes (kinematic manipulability, isotropy, stiffness) the analysis has been also performed using new indexes recently defined in order to remove dependencies on the adopted units used to measure length, angles, force and torques. Moreover the new indexes decouple the effects of rotations and translations. These indexes are used to optimise the geometrical design of the PKM.

AB Previous work on multimodal machine translation has shown that visual information is only needed in very specific cases, for example in the presence of ambiguous words where the textual context is not sufficient. As a consequence, models tend to learn to ignore this information. We propose a translate-and-refine approach to this problem where images are only used by a second stage decoder. This approach is trained jointly to generate a good first draft translation and to improve over this draft by (i) making better use of the target language textual context (both left and right-side contexts) and (ii) making use of visual context. This approach leads to the state of the art results. Additionally, we show that it has the ability to recover from erroneous or missing words in the source language.

AB The state-of-the-art adaptive policies for simultaneous neural machine translation (SNMT) use monotonic attention to perform read/write decisions based on the partial source and target sequences. The lack of sufficient information might cause the monotonic attention to take poor read/write decisions, which in turn negatively affects the performance of the SNMT model. On the other hand, human translators make better read/write decisions since they can anticipate the immediate future words using linguistic information and domain knowledge. In this work, we propose a framework to aid monotonic attention with an external language model to improve its decisions. Experiments on MuST-C English-German and English-French speech-to-text translation tasks show the future information from language model improves the state-of-the-art monotonic multi-head attention model further.

TI Extraction of multi-word expressions from small parallel corpora
SO NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING
AB We present a general, novel methodology for extracting multi-word expressions (MWEs) of various types, along with their translations, from small, word-aligned parallel corpora. Unlike existing approaches, we focus on misalignments; these typically indicate expressions in the source language that are translated to the target in a non-compositional way. We introduce a simple algorithm that proposes MWE candidates based on such misalignments, relying on 1:1 alignments as anchors that delimit the search space. We use a large monolingual corpus to rank and filter these candidates. Evaluation of the quality of the extraction algorithm reveals significant improvements over naive alignment-based methods. The extracted MWEs, with their translations, are used in the training of a statistical machine translation system, showing a small but significant improvement in its performance.

AB This study investigates the impact of zero pronominal anaphora for Romanian on a learning model able to distinguish between translated and non-translated texts. Even though the correct understanding of ellipsis from the source language and its mapping into the target language is essential in the translation process, zero pronominal anaphora has been scarcely investigated in the context of translation studies domain. This paper reports the results of a supervised learning system which exploits the anaphoric zero pronoun feature and its informativeness in the learning process. Moreover, ellipsis is one of the attributes proposed for the investigation of explicitation universal, and hence this study also brings an argument towards the existence of this hypothesis.

TI Groupwise Retargeted Least-Squares Regression
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
AB In this brief, we propose a new groupwise retargeted least squares regression (GReLSR) model for multicategory classification. The main motivation behind GReLSR is to utilize an additional regularization to restrict the translation values of ReLSR, so that they should be similar within same class. By analyzing the regression targets of ReLSR, we propose a new formulation of ReLSR, where the translation values are expressed explicitly. On the basis of the new formulation, discriminative least-squares regression can be regarded as a special case of ReLSR with zero translation values. Moreover, a groupwise constraint is added to ReLSR to form the new GReLSR model. Extensive experiments on various machine leaning data sets illustrate that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Many supervised learning tasks are emerged in dual forms, e.g., English-to-French translation vs. French-to-English translation, speech recognition vs. text to speech, and image classification vs. image generation. Two dual tasks have intrinsic connections with each other due to the probabilistic correlation between their models. This connection is, however, not effectively utilized today, since people usually train the models of two dual tasks separately and independently. In this work, we propose training the models of two dual tasks simultaneously, and explicitly exploiting the probabilistic correlation between them to regularize the training process. For ease of reference, we call the proposed approach dual supervised learning. We demonstrate that dual supervised learning can improve the practical performances of both tasks, for various applications including machine translation, image processing, and sentiment analysis.

We first build a phrase-level alignment of these multiple streams, using phrase tables to link the phrase pairs together. The information so collected is then used to make it more likely that sentence units are equivalent across streams. We applied this technique to a number of simultaneously interpreted speeches of the European Parliament Committees, for the recovery of the full stop, in four different languages (English, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish). We observed an average improvement in SER of 37% when compared to an existing baseline, in Portuguese and English.

AB The semantics of modelling languages are not always specified in a precise and formal way, and their rather complex underlying models make it a non-trivial exercise to reuse them in newly developed tools. We report on experiments with a virtual machine-based approach for state space generation. The virtual machine's (VM) byte-code language is straightforwardly implementable, facilitates reuse and makes it an adequate target for translation of higher-level languages like the SPIN model checker's PROMELA, or even C. As added value, it provides efficiently executable operational semantics for modelling languages. Several tools have been built on top of the VM implementation we developed, to evaluate the benefits of the proposed approach.

TI Sign Language Gloss Translation using Deep Learning Models
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB Converting sign language to a form of natural language is one of the recent areas of the machine learning domain. Many research efforts have focused on categorizing sign language into gesture or facial recognition. However, these efforts ignore the linguistic structure and the context of natural sentences. Traditional translation methods have low translation quality, poor scalability of their underlying models, and are time-consuming. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it proposes a deep learning approach for bidirectional translation using GRU and LSTM. In each of the proposed models, Bahdanau and Luong's attention mechanisms are used. Second, the paper experiments proposed models on two sign languages corpora: namely, ASLG-PC12 and Phoenix-2014T. The experiment conducted on 16 models reveals that the proposed model outperforms the other previous work on the same corpus. The results on the ASLG-12 corpus, when translating from text to gloss, reveal that the GRU model with Bahdanau attention gives the best result with ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) score 94.37% and BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)-4 score 83.98%. When translating from gloss to text, the results also show that the GRU model with Bahdanau attention achieves the best result with ROUGE score 87.31% and BLEU-4 66.59%. On Phoenix-2014T corpus, the results of text to gloss translation show that the GRU model with Bahdanau attention gives the best result in ROUGE with a score of 42.96%, while the GRU model with Luong attention gives the best result in BLEU-4 with 10.53%. When translating from gloss to text, the results report that the GRU model with Luong attention achieves the best result in ROUGE with a score of 45.69% and BLEU-4 with a score of 19.56%.

AB We suggest a new technique for deriving paraphrases from a monolingual corpus, supported by a relatively small set of comparable documents. Two somewhat similar phrases that each occur in one of a pair of documents dealing with the same incident are taken as potential paraphrases, which are evaluated based on the contexts in which they appear in the larger monolingual corpus. We apply this technique to Arabic, a highly inflected language, for improving an Arabic-to-English statistical translation system. The paraphrases are provided to the translation system formatted as a word lattice, each assigned with a score reflecting its equivalence level. We experiment with the system on different configurations, resulting in encouraging results: our best system shows an increase of 1.73 (5.49%) in BLEU.

TI Constraint logic programming with a relational machine
SO FORMAL ASPECTS OF COMPUTING
AB We present a declarative framework for the compilation of constraint logic programs into variable-free relational theories which are then executed by rewriting. This translation provides an algebraic formulation of the abstract syntax of logic programs. Logic variables, unification, and renaming apart are completely elided in favor of manipulation of variable-free relation expressions. In this setting, term rewriting not only provides an operational semantics for logic programs, but also a simple framework for reasoning about program execution. We prove the translation sound, and the rewriting system complete with respect to traditional SLD semantics.

AB Word sense disambiguation is a well-known source of translation errors in NMT. We posit that some of the incorrect disambiguation choices are due to models' over-reliance on dataset artifacts found in training data, specifically superficial word co-occurrences, rather than a deeper understanding of the source text. We introduce a method for the prediction of disambiguation errors based on statistical data properties, demonstrating its effectiveness across several domains and model types. Moreover, we develop a simple adversarial attack strategy that minimally perturbs sentences in order to elicit disambiguation errors to further probe the robustness of translation models. Our findings indicate that disambiguation robustness varies substantially between domains and that different models trained on the same data are vulnerable to different attacks.(1)

AB Recent studies argue that knowledge distillation is promising for speech translation (ST) using end-to-end models. In this work, we investigate the effect of knowledge distillation with a cascade ST using automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) models. We distill knowledge from a teacher model based on human transcripts to a student model based on erroneous transcriptions. Our experimental results demonstrated that knowledge distillation is beneficial for a cascade ST. Further investigation that combined knowledge distillation and fine-tuning revealed that the combination consistently improved two language pairs: English-Italian and Spanish-English.

AB The past decade has witnessed exciting work in the field of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). However, accurate evaluation of its potential in real-life contexts is still a questionable issue.
   In this study, we investigate the behavior of a SMT engine faced with a corpus far different from the one it has been trained on. We show that terminological databases are obvious resources that should be used to boost the performance of a statistical engine. We propose and evaluate a way of integrating terminology into a SMT engine which yields a significant reduction in word error rate.

AB In the Transformer network architecture, positional embeddings are used to encode order dependencies into the input representation. However, this input representation only involves static order dependencies based on discrete numerical information, that is, are independent of word content. To address this issue, this work proposes a recurrent positional embedding approach based on word vector. In this approach, these recurrent positional embeddings are learned by a recurrent neural network, encoding word content-based order dependencies into the input representation. They are then integrated into the existing multi-head selfattention model as independent heads or part of each head. The experimental results revealed that the proposed approach improved translation performance over that of the state-of-the-art Transformer baseline in WMT'14 English-to-German and NIST Chinese-to-English translation tasks.

AB The state of the art of handling rich morphology in neural machine translation (NMT) is to break word forms into subword units, so that the overall vocabulary size of these units fits the practical limits given by the NMT model and GPU memory capacity. In this paper, we compare two common but linguistically uninformed methods of subword construction (BPE and STE, the method implemented in Tensor2Tensor toolkit) and two linguistically-motivated methods: Morfessor and one novel method, based on a derivational dictionary. Our experiments with German-to-Czech translation, both morphologically rich, document that so far, the non-motivated methods perform better. Furthermore, we identify a critical difference between BPE and STE and show a simple preprocessing step for BPE that considerably increases translation quality as evaluated by automatic measures.

AB This paper presents the algorithms to interactively optimize the tool path of the five-axis milling machine. The algorithms employ the inverse kinematics to derive the corresponding trajectories (rotation and translation movement) of the five-axis machine. The trajectory of the tool path is not unique and depends on the initial set up of the workpiece as well as the combined rotations of the machine rotary axes. The proposed methods interactively select the appropriate workpiece orientation with the combination of rotations. The resulting optimized tool path can be used to simulate the milling process, verify the final cut and estimate the errors of the actual tool path before the real machining. It has been shown that the interactive approach provides an efficient way to the modification of a tool path based on an appropriate set of rotations and the initial workpiece orientation. Tool path optimization is verified by computer simulation software developed by the author as well as by real cutting on MAHO600E five-axis machine.

AB Many artificial intelligence tasks appear in dual forms like English <-> French translation and speech <-> text transformation. Existing dual learning schemes, which are proposed to solve a pair of such dual tasks, explore how to leverage such dualities from data level. In this work, we propose a new learning framework, model-level dual learning, which takes duality of tasks into consideration while designing the architectures for the primal/dual models, and ties the model parameters that playing similar roles in the two tasks. We study both symmetric and asymmetric model-level dual learning. Our algorithms achieve significant improvements on neural machine translation and sentiment analysis.

AB The classical concepts of partial and total correctness identify all types of runtime errors and divergence. We argue that the associated notions of translation correctness cannot cope adequately with practical questions like optimizations and finiteness of machines. As a step towards a solution we propose more fine-grained correctness notions, which are parameterized in sets of acceptable failure outcomes, and study a corresponding family of predicate transformers that generalize the well-known wp and wlp transformers. We also discuss the utility of the resulting setup for answering compiler correctness questions.

AB There is no doubt that in the last couple of years corpus-based machine translation (CBMT) approaches have been in focus. Each of the CBMT approaches (statistical MT and example-based MT) has its advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, hybrid approaches have been developed. This paper presents a comparative study of CBMT approaches, using three types of systems: a statistical MT (SMT) system, an example-based MT (EBMT) system and a hybrid (EBMT-SMT) system. For our experiments we considered German-Romanian as languagepair, in this direction of translation, and a domain-restricted corpus, manually created and aligned (RoGER). The translation results have been both automatically and manually evaluated. For both evaluation types, the SMT system is ranked best in our experiments.

AB The non-local feature always plays an important role in improving performance of SMT. Nonlinear neural network model can take better advantage of non-local features to improve the performance of translation through the introduction of the hidden layer. So this paper will build reranking models based on neural network to make use of non-local features to improve the translation performance. In this paper, we will introduce two models: Reranker-WC and Reranker-D. Compared with performance of the baseline system, the performance of Reranker-WC can be promoted to about 1.4 BLEU score. Moreover, we find that different hyper-parameter lambda will also affect the quality of SMT output at the same time. We achieve the best performance while lambda is 40.

Then case frames are used to constraint rule extraction and decoding in chunk-based dependency-to-string model. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs well on long structural reordering and lexical translation, and achieves better performance than hierarchical phrase-based model and word-based dependency-to-string model on Japanese to Chinese test sets.

We also analyze some parameters of dynamic quality that influence their technical characteristics as a mechatronic product making them compatible with the requirements of such intelligent machines. The paper presents an analysis of roto-translation systems, that can be programmed, and the project of an equipment of translation helped by a system which changes the rotation movement into a translation movement, using a screw with balls. The main constructive variants, the model of kinematics, dynamics and the calculus with the working conditions are also presented. The result of the research can be valued immediately in any system of linear movement because it is based on the newest techniques in the field of modeling. Their objective is the developing of a new system of electro-mechanic linear actuator type, as well as perfecting the existing ones in a very short time and in highly energy-efficient and economic conditions. In the future these researches can continue to develop new applications on other types of mechanical transmissions using this method and different other modular controls. Finally, additional researches on defining the correct set of requirements and specifications for new electro-mechanic actuator systems could significantly improve their development.

We utilize the Candide facial grid and apply Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to find the two eigenvectors of the model vertices. These eigenvectors along with the barycenter of the vertices are used to define a new coordinate system where vertices are mapped. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are then used for the facial expression classification task. The method is invariant to in-plane translation and rotation as well as scaling of the face and achieves very satisfactory results.

AB The accurate translation of collocations, or multi-word units, is essential for high quality machine translation. However, many collocations do not translate compositionally, thus requiring individual entries in the bilingual lexicon. We present a technique for collocation extraction from large corpora that takes into account the dispersion of the collocations throughout the corpus. Collocations are ranked to more accurately reflect how likely they are to occur in a wide variety of texts; collocations which are specific to a particular text are less useful for lexicon development. Once the collocations are extracted, appropriate bilingual lexical entries can be developed by lexicographers.

AB Hardware generation from high-level languages like C/C++ has been one of the dreams of software and hardware engineers for decades. Several high-level synthesis (HLS) or domain-specific languages (DSLs) have been developed to reduce the gap between high-level languages and hardware descriptive languages. However, each language tends to target some specific applications or there is a big learning curve in learning DSLs, which ends up having many program languages and tool chains.
   To address these challenges, we propose the use of a source-to-source translation to pick and choose which framework to use so that the hardware designer chooses the best target HLS/DSL that can be synthesized to the best performing hardware. In this work, we present source-to-source translation between CUDA to OpenCL using NMT, which we call PLNMT. The contribution of our work is that it develops techniques to generate training inputs. To generate a training dataset, we extract CUDA API usages from CUDA examples and write corresponding OpenCL API usages. With a pair of API usages acquired, we construct API usage trees that helps users find unseen usages from new samples and easily add them to a training input. Our initial results show that we can translate many applications from benchmarks such as CUDA SDK, polybench-gpu, and Rodinia. Furthermore, we show that translated kernel code from CUDA applications can be run in the OpenCL FPGA framework, which implies a new direction of HLS.

The code generation process follows the model-driven engineering approach, where the code is obtained from a formal abstract model by applying certain transformation rules. The translation process is highly configurable in order to correctly integrate the underlying hardware. The advantage of the Asm2C++ tool is that it is part of the Asmeta framework that allows to analyze, verify, and validate the correctness of a formal model.

Each computational step in one model is simulated in a constant number of computational steps in the other one while a translation via Turing machines squares the time complexity.

AB Natural Language Processing plays a vital role in our day-to-day life. Deep learning models for NLP help make human life easier as computers can think, talk, and interact like humans. Applications of the NLP models can be seen in many domains, especially in machine translation and psychology. This paper briefly reviews the different transformer models and the advantages of using an Encoder-Decoder language translator model. The article focuses on the need for sequence-to-sequence language-translation models like BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet, along with their components.

AB P>Cells invest a significant amount of their energy synthesizing proteins, and a large portion of the energy expenditure goes into making ribosomes, the RNA-protein machines at the centre of translation. When ribosomes are damaged in a cell, i.e. during stressful conditions, cells must first recognize the damage and then mount a response. Remme et al. show that instead of having to rebuild ribosomes from scratch, bacteria can repair ribosomes by replacing damaged proteins in situ, thereby saving significant time and energy. Given the central role of translation, such repair mechanisms might be widespread in nature.

AB A two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a reflection dynamics on a field-reversed configuration (FRC) plasma is carried out by numerically modeling the confinement region of the FRC Injection Experiment (FIX) machine. It is shown from the simulation results that the FRC plasma is reflected by the downstream magnetic mirror field without severe destruction of the closed magnetic flux surfaces even when injected with supersonic velocity into the magnetic mirror region, showing the robustness of the FRC against external perturbations. The effects of the magnetic minor field and the translation velocity on the FRC plasma are discussed.

AB Translated texts have been used for malicious purposes, i.e., plagiarism or fake reviews. Existing detectors have been built around a specific translator (e.g., Google) but fail to detect a translated text from a strange translator. If we use the same translator, the translated text is similar to its round-trip translation, which is when text is translated into another language and translated back into the original language. However, a round-trip translated text is significantly different from the original text or a translated text using a strange translator. Hence, we propose a detector using text similarity with round-trip translation (TSRT). TSRT achieves 86.9% accuracy in detecting a translated text from a strange translator. It outperforms existing detectors (77.9%) and human recognition (53.3%).

AB The Multi-word Expressions (MWE) treatment is a very difficult problem for the Natural Language Processing in general and for Machine Translation in particular. This is true because each word of a MWE can have a specific meaning but the expression can have a totally different meaning both in source and in target language of a translation. The things are complicated also by the fact that the source expression can appear in the source text under a very different form from its form in a bilingual MWE dictionary (it can have some inflections) and, most of all, it can have some extensions (some MWE words can have associated new words that do not belong to the MWE). The paper show how this kind of problems can be treated and solved using Generative Dependency Grammar with Features.

AB The language used in electronic communications such as e-mails, chats and SMS texts presents special phenomena and important deviations from natural language. Typical machine translation approaches are difficult to adapt to SMS language due to the many irregularities this kind of language shows. This paper presents a new approach for SMS normalization that combines lexical and phonological translation techniques with disambiguation algorithms at two different levels: lexical and semantic. The results obtained by the system outperform some of the existing methods of SMS normalization despite the fact that the corpus created has some features that complicates the normalization task.

We release a dataset of augmented annotations to the Proceedings of the European Parliament that cover dialectal speaker information, and we analyze different classes of written English covering native varieties from the British Isles. Our analyses aim to discuss the discriminatory features between the different classes and to reveal words whose usage differs between varieties of the same language. We perform classification experiments and show that automatically distinguishing between the dialectal varieties is possible with high accuracy, even after translation, and propose a new explainability method based on embedding alignments in order to reveal specific differences between dialects at the level of the vocabulary.

AB The porting or translation of software applications from one programming language to another is a common requirement of organisations that utilise software, and the increasing number and diversity of programming languages makes this capability as relevant today as in previous decades.
   Several approaches have been used to address this challenge, including machine learning and the manual definition of explicit translation rules. We define a novel approach using model-driven engineering (MDE) techniques: reverse-engineering source programs into specifications in the UML and OCL formalisms, and then forward-engineering the specifications to the required target language. This approach has the additional advantage of extracting specifications of software from code. We provide an evaluation based on a comprehensive dataset of examples, including industrial cases, and compare our results to those of other approaches and tools.

AB Several approaches have recently been proposed for learning decentralized deep multiagent policies that coordinate via a differentiable communication channel. While these policies are effective for many tasks, interpretation of their induced communication strategies has remained a challenge. Here we propose to interpret agents' messages by translating them. Unlike in typical machine translation problems, we have no parallel data to learn from. Instead we develop a translation model based on the insight that agent messages and natural language strings mean the same thing if they induce the same belief about the world in a listener. We present theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence that our approach preserves both the semantics and pragmatics of messages by ensuring that players communicating through a translation layer do not suffer a substantial loss in reward relative to players with a common language.(1)

AB The initial behavioural specification of an embedded system goes through significant optimizing transformations, automated and also human guided, before being mapped to an architecture. Establishing the validity of these transformations is crucial to ensure that the intended behaviour of a system has not been faultily altered during synthesis. Finite state machines with datapath (FSMDs) have traditionally been used to model the specification and the implementation. Path based equivalence checkers over this model have been proposed to validate the translation process. Since specification for digital systems implementing algorithmic computations over integers involves the whole of integer arithmetic which is undecidable, majority of these equivalence checkers employ a normalization technique that tries to reduce two computationally equivalent expressions e(1) and e(2) to a syntactically identical form. This normalization technique, however, is not applicable to reason over finite precision datatypes. In this work, we propose to augment the normalization module, wherever necessary, with an SMT solver to determine the validity of e(1) = e(2). The scope of translation validation can be extended to handle bit-vectors, user-defined datatypes and more sophisticated transformations by leveraging the capability of SMT solvers while keeping the basic equivalence checking framework intact. We have explored three state-of-the-art SMT solvers namely, Yices2, CVC4 and Z3. The experiments demonstrate improvement in terms of its scope of application over the existing methodology.

Early computational approaches to language research focused on automating the analysis of the linguistic structure of language and developing basic technologies such as machine translation, speech recognition, and speech synthesis. Today's researchers refine and make use of such tools in real-world applications, creating spoken dialogue systems and speech-to-speech translation engines, mining social media for information about health or finance, and identifying sentiment and emotion toward products and services. We describe successes and challenges in this rapidly advancing area.

AB Computing in virtualized environments has become a common practice for many businesses. Typically, hosting companies aim for lower operational costs by targeting high utilization of host machines maintaining just enough machines to meet the demand. In this scenario, frequent virtual machine context switches are common, resulting in increased TLB miss rates (often, by over 5X when contexts are doubled) and subsequent expensive page walks. Since each TLB miss in a virtual environment initiates a 2D page walk, the data caches get filled with a large fraction of page table entries (often, in excess of 50%) thereby evicting potentially more useful data contents.
   In this work, we propose CSALT - a Context-Switch Aware Large TLB, to address the problem of increased TLB miss rates and their adverse impact on data caches. First, we demonstrate that the CSALT architecture can effectively cope with the demands of increased context switches by its capacity to store a very large number of TLB entries. Next, we show that CSALT mitigates data cache contention caused by conflicts between data and translation entries by employing a novel TLB-Aware Cache Partitioning scheme. On 8-core systems that switch between two virtual machine contexts executing multi-threaded workloads, CSALT achieves an average performance improvement of 85% over a baseline with conventional L1-L2 TLBs and 25% over a baseline which has a large L3 TLB.

The most tedious part is to manually write a target machine code translator to emulator's internal representation. In this paper we describe an automated approach to this problem. In this approach a programmer writes a description of target instruction set encoding and instructions semantics. Our tools then generate a completely functional translator from these descriptions. The proposed tools were tested on Moxie architecture and have shown to be correct.

This paper describes the design of finite state machine in development of a Malayalam spellchecker. Conventional spell checkers has the disadvantage of large dictionary size which can be reduced using finite state models. Morphological factors like word categories and their inflections evolve automatically during training of these models if we train the model with an appropriate training set.

Such requirements engineering also results in direct and automatic translation to implementation, minimising software faults. We present our method and illustrated with a classical example. We also compare our approach with other state diagram methods, as well as Petri nets and Behavior Trees.

TI Identification of Grammatical Errors of English Language Based on
   Intelligent Translational Model
SO MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB To address the problem of low kappa, precision and recall values, and high misjudgment rate in traditional methods, this study proposes an English grammatical error identification method based on a machine translation model. For this purpose, a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) model is established to diagnose English grammatical errors. A machine learning (ML) model, i.e., Naive Bayes is used for the result classification of the English grammatical error diagnosis, and the N-gram model is utilized to effectively point out the location of the error. According to the preprocessing results, a grammatical error generation model is designed, a parallel corpus is built from which a training dataset for the model training is generated, and different types of grammatical errors are also checked. The overall architecture of the machine translation model is given, and the model parameters are trained on a large-scale modification of the wrong learner corpus, which greatly improves the accuracy of grammatical error identification. The experimental outcomes reveal that the model used in this study significantly improves the kappa value, the precision and recall values, and the misjudgment rate remains below 1.0, which clearly demonstrates that the detection effect is superior.

TI Do multilingual androids dream of a better life in Australia?
   Effectiveness of information technology for government translation to
   support refugees and migrants in Australia
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION
AB Without high-quality translation of online information about government support and services, refugees and migrants from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds in Australia experience a major barrier to improved health, employment, education and social outcomes. Recent advances in the ability of Google Translate, Skype Translator and other forms of machine translation that use artificial intelligence can help translate government information to better support refugees and migrants but they bring the risk of ineffective communication, and exclusion from services that could positively impact on settlement experiences and daily life. Evidence suggests that government agencies are likely to be using human translators for most translation work, but the degree to which any form of information technology is used, how it may be best applied and the associated effects are not known. This study systematically reviewed the peer-reviewed and grey literature to determine effective ways of using information technology for translating government information to refugees and migrants from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds in Australia. Included studies were analysed to identify techniques and other characteristics of translation, information technology and language support more broadly, and outcomes on education, health, social and other refugee and migrant experiences relating to translated information. Our review found a small evidence base featuring studies with strong evaluation demonstrating effective forms of 'language support' for refugees and migrants from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds in Australia in a broad sense. However, there is a major gap in knowledge that is contributing to barriers in the use of online government information in Australia. In particular, there is an absence of evidence demonstrating what is effective in the use of machine translation with artificial intelligence, websites and other kinds of information technology for translating government information with refugees and migrants from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. The oversight risks further excluding already marginalised groups from services and support. This paper makes a number of suggestions practitioners can take to address the issue and guidelines for future research.

AB Cloud Computing is a recent trend technology that moves the World forward. It helps the mobile users to run computationally-intensive and memory-demanding applications on a remote cloud and access the results on their mobile devices. The usual processing of the cloud based applications is realized via a WAN connection. However, this approach is inefficient for real-time applications due to the relatively huge WAN latency. Cloudlet is a small cloud located near the mobile user, which can perform the same processing tasks as a remote cloud by using Virtual Machines (VMs), but its position close to the mobile phones enables them faster response, avoiding huge WAN latencies. In this paper we present details on development of a multilingual dictionary application running on a mobile device. The application will use VMs installed on the cloud/cloudlet for execution of the tasks and presenting the results on the mobile device. The user can insert a word for translation and find the corresponding meaning in a selected language. The mobile device will be used for data input, by inserting the word and for data output, presenting the result. The process execution (translation) will be realized on the cloud/cloudlet. Although the initial version supports translation between two languages, it can be easily expanded to support multilingual translation. We present several design details and provide a proof of a concept by developing a prototype and implementing the solution in a cloud environment.

TI Neural machine translating from natural language to SPARQL
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB SPARQL is a highly powerful query language for an ever-growing number of resources and knowledge graphs represented in the Resource Description Framework (RDF) data format. Using it requires a certain familiarity with the entities in the domain to be queried as well as expertise in the language's syntax and semantics, none of which average human web users can be assumed to possess. To overcome this limitation, automatically translating natural language questions to SPARQL queries has been a vibrant field of research. However, to this date, the vast success of deep learning methods has not yet been fully propagated to this research problem. This paper contributes to filling this gap by evaluating the utilization of eight different Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models for the task of translating from natural language to the structured query language SPARQL. While highlighting the importance of high-quantity and high-quality datasets, the results show a dominance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based architecture with a Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score of up to 98 and accuracy of up to 94%.

AB Named Entities (NE) is widely used in various research areas such as machine translation, cross-language information retrieval, bilingual question answering, bilingual lexicon construction and so on. Although in recent years scientists have done great efforts to identify and translate NE, aligning named entities in bilingual documents is still a complex problem. In this paper, we propose a method to align bilingual named entities in parallel corpora. The results show that the proposed methodology has got good performance, and it can be applicable to a wide range of natural language processing.

TI Anterior tibial translation during different isokinetic quadriceps
   torque in anterior cruciate ligament deficient and nonimpaired
   individuals
SO JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC & SPORTS PHYSICAL THERAPY
AB Study Design: Factorial quasi-experimental design.
   Objectives: To quantify the effect of different levels of isokinetic concentric and eccentric knee extensor torques on the anterior tibial translation in subjects with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficiency Electromyogram (EMC) activity of 4 leg muscles was recorded in order to detect any co-activation of extensors and flexors.
   Background: The rehabilitation after an ACL injury is of importance for the functional outcome of the patient. In order to construct a rehabilitation program after that injury, it is important to understand the in vivo relationships between muscle force and tibial translation.
   Methods and Measures: Twelve patients with unilateral ACL injury and 11 uninjured volunteers performed 36 repetitions of a quadriceps contraction at different isokinetic concentric and eccentric torque levels, on a KinCom machine (60 degrees .s(-1)), with simultaneous recordings of tibial translation (CA-4000) and EMG activity from quadriceps and hamstrings muscles. Tibial translations and EMC levels were normalized to the maximum of each subject.
   Results: The individual anterior tibial translation increased with increased quadriceps torque in a similar manner in both quadriceps contraction modes in all legs tested. During concentric mode, translation was similar in all groups, but during eccentric mode, the mean translation was 38% larger in the ACL injured knees. No quadriceps-hamstrings co-activation occurred in any test or group.
   Conclusions: An ACL deficient knee can limit the translation within a normal space during concentric muscle activity but not during eccentric activity. That limitation depends on other mechanisms than hamstrings co-activation.

The front left translation pair, front right translation pair and rear translation pair are controlled by the electro-hydraulic system. In this way, the vehicle-mounted drill is operated around and before and after translation, and the azimuth alignment and position adjustment of the vehicle-mounted drill are carried out. The feedback signals of the left and right ranging sensors, signal generators, signal receivers and the translation distance form a closed-loop control to ensure the position accuracy of the drilling rig. The card position plate increases the reliability of the translation system by mechanical positioning.

AB Images of historical Vietnamese steles allow historians to discover invaluable information regarding the past of the country, especially about the life of people in rural villages. Due to the sheer amount of available stone engravings and their diverseness, manual examination is difficult and time-consuming. Therefore, automatic document analysis methods based on machine learning could immensely facilitate this laborious work. However, creating ground truth for machine learning is also complex and time-consuming for human experts, which is why synthetic training samples greatly support learning while reducing human effort. In particular, they can be used to train deep neural networks for character detection and recognition. In this paper, we present a method for creating synthetic engravings and use it to create a new database composed of 26,901 synthetic Chu Nom characters in 21 different styles. Using a machine learning model for unpaired image-to-image translation, our approach is annotation-free, i.e. there is no need for human experts to label character images. A user study demonstrates that the synthetic engravings look realistic to the human eye.

AB Text prediction is a form of interactive machine translation that is well suited to skilled translators. In recent work it has been shown that simple statistical translation models can be applied within a user-modeling framework to improve translator productivity by over 10% in simulated results. For the sake of efficiency in making real-time predictions, these models ignore the alignment relation between source and target texts. In this paper we introduce a new model that captures fuzzy alignments in a very simple way, and show that it gives modest improvements in predictive performance without significantly increasing the time required to generate predictions.

DBPal leverages recent advances in deep models to make query understanding more robust in the following ways: First, DBPal uses novel machine translation models to translate natural language statements to SQL, making the translation process more robust to paraphrasing and linguistic variations. Second, to support the users in phrasing questions without knowing the database schema and the query features, DBPal provides a learned auto-completion model that suggests to users partial query extensions during query formulation and thus helps to write complex queries.

AB We present a simple yet powerful hierarchical search algorithm for automatic word alignment. Our algorithm induces a forest of alignments from which we can efficiently extract a ranked kappa-best list. We score a given alignment within the forest with a flexible, linear discriminative model incorporating hundreds of features, and trained on a relatively small amount of annotated data. We report results on Arabic-English word alignment and translation tasks. Our model outperforms a GIZA++ Model-4 baseline by 6.3 points in F-measure, yielding a 1.1 BLEU score increase over a state-of-the-art syntax-based machine translation system.

TI AN INVARIANT PATTERN-RECOGNITION MACHINE USING A MODIFIED ART
   ARCHITECTURE
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS
AB A novel invariant pattern recognition machine is proposed based on a modified ART architecture. Invariance is achieved by adding a new layer called F23, beyond the F2 layer in the ART architecture. The design of the weight connections between the nodes of the F2 layer and the cells of the F3 layer are similar to the invariance net. Computer simulations show that the model is not only invariant to translations and rotations of 2-D binary images but also noise-tolerant to these transformed images.

AB This work uses the formal method B for the implementation of hierarchical control structures for a class of discrete-event systems modelled by Finite State Machines. Given the architecture, their constitutive controllers and communication channels together with their functional specifications, a formal translation is established from the automata-based controllers into abstract machines and relates them with the structuring features of B. Therefore, the implementation can be proved to be correct with respect to the functional specification. The work is illustrated with an example.

AB It has been hypothesized that the ribosome gains additional fidelity during protein translation by probing structural differences in tRNA species. We measure the translocation kinetics of different tRNA species through similar to 3 nm diameter synthetic nanopores. Each tRNA species varies in the time scale with which it is deformed from equilibrium, as in the translocation step of protein translation. Using machine-learning algorithms, we can differentiate among five tRNA species, analyze the ratios of tRNA binary mixtures, and distinguish tRNA isoacceptors.

AB High speed and precision machining technology [1,2,3] have been rapidly adopted in five-axis CNC system for their high productivity. The design of trajectory generation and control algorithms plays a crucial role in realizing the accuracy requirement for high speed feed motion. Most interpolation algorithms for five-axis CNC machining are focused on studying techniques to design position, orientation, and feedrate curves in such a way using iso-parametric correspondence as to avoid excessive angular velocities. However, it is difficult to guarantee such correspondence. To help alleviate such difficulties, this paper presents a new interpolation algorithm to five-axis CNC tool path generation for sculptured surface machining. Interpolation algorithm using dual quaternion has several advantages over the algorithm of interpolating translation and rotation independently and then combining the results. The effectiveness of the proposed interpolation algorithm is verified in Matlab. The results show the velocity, acceleration and jerk of five-axis machining can smooth without losing machining accuracy and surface quality.

AB Virtual machine introspection (VMI) is a technique for the external monitoring of virtual machines. Through previous work, it became apparent that VMI can contribute to the security of distributed systems and cloud architectures by facilitating stealthy intrusion detection, malware analysis, and digital forensics. The main shortcomings of active VMI-based approaches such as program tracing or process injection in production environments result from the side effects of writing to virtual address spaces and the parallel execution of shared main memory on multiple processor cores.
   In this paper, we present RapidVMI, a framework for active virtual machine introspection that enables fine-grained, multi-core aware VMI-based memory access on virtual address spaces. It was built to overcome the outlined shortcomings of existing VMI solutions and facilitate the development of introspection applications as if they run in the monitored virtual machine itself. Furthermore, we demonstrate that hypervisor support for this concept improves introspection performance in prevalent virtual machine tracing applications considerably up to 98 times.

AB Style translation is the process of transforming an input motion into a new style while preserving its original content. This problem is motivated by the needs of interactive applications, which require rapid processing of captured performances. Our solution learns to translate by analyzing differences between performances of the same content in input and output styles. It relies on a novel correspondence algorithm to align motions, and a linear time-invariant model to represent stylistic differences. Once the model is estimated with system identification, our system is capable of translating streaming input with simple linear operations at each frame.

TI From AADL to Timed Abstract State Machines: A verified model
   transformation
SO JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
AB Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) is an architecture description language standard for embedded real-time systems widely used in the avionics and aerospace industry to model safety-critical applications. To verify and analyze the AADL models, model transformation technologies are often used to automatically extract a formal specification suitable for analysis and verification. In this process, it remains a challenge to prove that the model transformation preserves the semantics of the initial AADL model or, at least, some of the specific properties or requirements it needs to satisfy. This paper presents a machine checked semantics-preserving transformation of a subset of AADL (including periodic threads, data port communications, mode changes, and the AADL behavior annex) into Timed Abstract State Machines (TASM). The AADL standard itself lacks at present a formal semantics to make this translation validation possible. Our contribution is to bridge this gap by providing two formal semantics for the subset of AADL. The execution semantics provided by the AADL standard is formalized as Timed Transition Systems (ITS). This formalization gives a reference expression of AADL semantics which can be compared with the TASM-based translation (for verification purpose). Finally, the verified transformation is mechanized in the theorem prover Coq. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Joining linguistic and statistical methods for Spanish-to-Basque speech
   translation
SO SPEECH COMMUNICATION
AB The goal of this work is to develop a text and speech translation system from Spanish to Basque. This pair of languages shows quite odd characteristics as they differ extraordinarily in both morphology and syntax, thus, attractive challenges in machine translation are involved. Nevertheless, since both languages share official status in the Basque Country, the underlying motivation is not only academic but also practical.
   Finite-state transducers were adopted as basic translation models. The main contribution of this work involves the Study of several techniques to improve probabilistic finite-state transducers by means of additional linguistic knowledge. Two methods to cope with both linguistics and statistics were proposed. The first one performed a morphological analysis in all attempt to benefit from atomic meaningful units when it comes to rendering the meaning from One language to the other. The second approach aimed at clustering words according to their syntactic role and used such phrases its translation unit. From the latter approach phrase-based finite-state transducers arose as a natural extension of classical ones.
   The models were assessed under a restricted domain task, very repetitive and with a small vocabulary. Experimental results shown that both morphological and syntactical approaches outperformed the baseline under different test sets and architectures for speech translation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Existing Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems are generally trained on a large amount of sentence-level parallel data, and during prediction sentences are independently translated, ignoring cross-sentence contextual information. This leads to inconsistency between translated sentences. In order to address this issue, context-aware models have been proposed. However, document-level parallel data constitutes only a small part of the parallel data available, and many approaches build context-aware models based on a pre-trained frozen sentence-level translation model in a two-step training manner. The computational cost of these approaches is usually high. In this paper, we propose to make the most of layers pre-trained on sentence-level data in contextual representation learning, reusing representations from the sentence-level Transformer and significantly reducing the cost of incorporating contexts in translation. We find that representations from shallow layers of a pre-trained sentence-level encoder play a vital role in source context encoding, and propose to perform source context encoding upon weighted combinations of pre-trained encoder layers' outputs. Instead of separately performing source context and input encoding, we propose to iteratively and jointly encode the source input and its contexts and to generate input-aware context representations with a cross-attention layer and a gating mechanism, which resets irrelevant information in context encoding. Our context-aware Transformer model outperforms the recent CADec [Voita et al., 2019c] on the English-Russian subtitle data and is about twice as fast in training and decoding.

   PROCESSING
AB Manually constructing an annotated Named Entity (NE) in a bilingual corpus is a time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive process, but this is necessary for natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as cross-lingual information retrieval, cross-lingual information extraction, machine translation, etc. In this article, we present an automatic approach to construct an annotated NE in English-Vietnamese bilingual corpus from a bilingual parallel corpus by proposing an aligned NE method. Basing this corpus on a bilingual corpus in which the initial NEs are extracted from its own language separately, the approach tries to correct unrecognized NEs or incorrectly recognized NEs before aligning the NEs by using a variety of bilingual constraints. The generated corpus not only improves the NE recognition results but also creates alignments between English NEs and Vietnamese NEs, which are necessary for training NE translation models. The experimental results show that the approach outperforms the baseline methods effectively. In the English-Vietnamese NE alignment task, the F-measure increases from 68.58% to 79.77%. Thanks to the improvement of the NE recognition quality, the proposed method also increases significantly: the F-measure goes from 84.85% to 88.66% for the English side and from 75.71% to 85.55% for the Vietnamese side. By providing the additional semantic information for the machine translation systems, the BLEU score increases from 33.04% to 45.11%.

TI A review of optical chemical structure recognition tools
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS
AB Structural information about chemical compounds is typically conveyed as 2D images of molecular structures in scientific documents. Unfortunately, these depictions are not a machine-readable representation of the molecules. With a backlog of decades of chemical literature in printed form not properly represented in open-access databases, there is a high demand for the translation of graphical molecular depictions into machine-readable formats. This translation process is known as Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR). Today, we are looking back on nearly three decades of development in this demanding research field. Most OCSR methods follow a rule-based approach where the key step of vectorization of the depiction is followed by the interpretation of vectors and nodes as bonds and atoms. Opposed to that, some of the latest approaches are based on deep neural networks (DNN). This review provides an overview of all methods and tools that have been published in the field of OCSR. Additionally, a small benchmark study was performed with the available open-source OCSR tools in order to examine their performance.

TI A Comparison of Human and Machine Translation of Health Promotion
   Materials for Public Health Practice: Time, Costs, and Quality
SO JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE
AB Context: Most local public health departments serve limited English proficiency groups but lack sufficient resources to translate the health promotion materials that they produce into different languages. Machine translation (MT) with human postediting could fill this gap and work toward decreasing health disparities among non-English speakers. Objectives: (1) To identify the time and costs associated with human translation (HT) of public health documents, (2) determine the time necessary for human postediting of MT, and (3) compare the quality of postedited MT and HT. Design: A quality comparison of 25 MT and HT documents was performed with public health translators. The public health professionals involved were queried about the workflow, costs, and time for HT of 11 English public health documents over a 20-month period. Three recently translated documents of similar size and topic were then machine translated, the time for human postediting was recorded, and a blind quality analysis was performed. Setting: Seattle/King County, Washington. Participants: Public health professionals. Main Outcome Measures: (1) Estimated times for various HT tasks; (2) observed postediting times for MT documents; (3) actual costs for HT; and (4) comparison of quality ratings for HT and MT. Results: Human translation via local health department methods took 17 hours to 6 days. While HT postediting words per minute ranged from 1.58 to 5.88, MT plus human postediting words per minute ranged from 10 to 30. The cost of HT ranged from $130 to $1220; MT required no additional costs. A quality comparison by bilingual public health professionals showed that MT and HT were equivalently preferred. Conclusions: MT with human postediting can reduce the time and costs of translating public health materials while maintaining quality similar to HT. In conjunction with postediting, MT could greatly improve the availability of multilingual public health materials.

TI Quality-aware skill translation models for expert finding on
   StackOverflow
SO INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB StackOverflow has become an emerging resource for talent recognition in recent years. While users exploit technical language on StackOverflow, recruiters try to find the relevant candidates for jobs using their own terminology. This procedure implies a gap which exists between recruiters and candidates terms. Due to this gap, the state-of-the-art expert finding models cannot effectively address the expert finding problem on StackOverflow. We propose two translation models to bridge this gap. The first approach is a statistical method and the second is based on word embedding approach. Utilizing several translations for a given query during the scoring step, the result of each intermediate query is blended together to obtain the final ranking. Here, we propose a new approach which takes the quality of documents into account in scoring step. We have made several observations to visualize the effectiveness of the translation approaches and also the quality-aware scoring approach. Our experiments indicate the following: First, while statistical and word embedding translation approaches provide different translations for each query, both can considerably improve the recall. Besides, the quality-aware scoring approach can improve the precision remarkably. Finally, our best proposed method can improve the MAP measure up to 46% on average, in comparison with the state-of-the-art expert finding approach. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Chatbots are software used in entertainment industry, businesses and user support. Chatbots are modeled on various techniques such as knowledge base, machine learning based. Machine learning based chatbots yields more practical results. Chatbot which gives responses based on the context of conversation tends to be more user friendly. The chatbot we are proposing demonstrates a method of developing chatbot which can follow the context of the conversation. This method uses TensorFlow for developing the neural network model of the chatbot and uses the nlp techniques to maintain the context of the conversation. This chatbots can be used in small industries or business for automating customer care as user queries will be handled by chatbots thus reducing need of human labour and expenditure.

TI Fault diagnosis based on Walsh transform and support vector machine
SO MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB Recognition of shaft orbit plays an important role in the fault diagnosis. In this paper, a novel recognition method for the shaft orbit based on Walsh transform and support vector machine is proposed. In the method, distance vector between the point on the shaft orbit and its center is first calculated. Then, the distance vector is transformed by Walsh matrix, and the Walsh spectrum obtained has property of invariance to rotation, scaling and translation. In the end, the Walsh spectrum, viewed as the feature of shaft orbit, is trained and tested by means of support vector machine. In addition, a comparison with the previous methods is performed, and experimental results are encouraging, which fully demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.

TI Set of Active Suffix Chains and its Role in Development of the MT System

AB Definition process of the active suffix chains of Azerbaijani (The Azerbaijani language) has been explained in this paper. Morphologically Azerbaijani word-forms consist of the stem and simple or compound suffixes (suffix chains). Because Azerbaijani is an agglutinative language the simple suffixes in this language can form the great number of suffix chains and consequently, it is possible to generate practically "endless" number of word-forms from the same stem. While developing machine translation system from Azerbaijani into non-Turkic languages for the translation of any word-form it is necessary to translate its suffix chain in whole. It is not possible to get the correct translation of a word-form by translating each simple suffix of its suffix chain separately and then by putting these translations together. For these reasons, it is necessary to define the subset of suffix chains frequently used in the texts instead of the set of every possible suffix chains.

AB Computer Numerical Controlled (CNC) machines are more and more used for a variety of tasks such as milling, drilling, lathing, etc. As many CNCs are programmed using G-Code, it is of great interest for this code to be close to the optimum, taking into consideration different metrics such as the total path length covered by the CNC head during the machining process or the total machining time. We propose an algorithm to optimize a large class of G-Codes, by reducing the total path length. As most of the machining operations require translations, our algorithm is applicable for many processes. In this paper we describe the algorithm and demonstrate its performance in the specific case of Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) drilling.

TI An experiment in abstract machine design
SO SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB In this article we present Typed Feature Structures as an extension of Prolog, and show how to come up with a compilation scheme and an abstract machine using a design methodology based on partial evaluation. First we define the transformations used by our partial evaluator. Then we present the design methodology which we will use later. Next, we clarify the notion of Typed Feature Structures that underlies our work, and formally define the unification of such structures. Based on this definition, we develop a unification procedure with explicit heap representation. By partially evaluating this procedure with respect to some example programs, we show how to come up with the machine instructions and translation schemes. Finally, we briefly address coreferences, cyclic structures and the unification of types.

TI An efficient error prediction and compensation method for coordinated
   five-axis machine tools under variable temperature
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB I n a dual-machine system, the positioning accuracy of coordinated machine tools is one of the most important performances. Considering the quasi-static errors of the developed system, the paper presents an effective error prediction and compensation method for coordinated five-axis machine tools under variable temperature. Firstly, for error prediction at a constant temperature, the workspace of coordinated machines is divided into the subspaces of translation and rotation axes, and an error prediction algorithm is presented with the known errors at sampled points. When the temperature changes, the thermal errors of the coordinated machines are analyzed by the simulation and error measurement, and an interpolation method is proposed to quickly determine the sampled data at any temperature. For error compensation, a recursive algorithm is proposed to compensate the absolute and relative pose error of dual machines. Validation experiments have been conducted to verify the proposed method on the developed system. The results have shown that, compared with previous method, the method presented in this paper is more accurate and time-efficient for error prediction and compensation under variable temperature conditions.

AB Machine Translation (MT) evaluation is very important for a MT system. In this paper, we investigate an improved Cilin-based smoothed BLEU (BLEUS-syn). As the possible cases that the short translation or English abbreviations in candidate may cause unigram have no matches, this evaluation metric smoothed the traditional BLEUS n-gram. It applied synonym substitution in unigram matching, and calculated the other 2-4-gram. It performed experiments in Russian and Chinese bilingual sentence data set and evaluated the output translations of online translation systems such as Google, Baidu, Bing and Youdao. The experimental results show that the effectiveness of our BLEUS-syn and traditional BLEUS are consistent. The performance of Baidu is the best, that of Youdao is the second, and that of Bing is the worst. Using BLEUS-syn can greatly enhance the performance of traditional BLEUS evaluation. It makes the Baidu BLEUS value improve 6.81%, Youdao improve 6.98%, Google 7.82%, and Bing 7.55%.

AB In this paper, we present an empirical study that utilizes morph-syntactical information to improve translation quality. With three kinds of language pairs matched according to morph-syntactical similarity or difference, we investigate the effects of various morpho-syntactical information, such as base form, part-of-speech, and the relative positional information of a word in a statistical machine translation framework. We learn not only translation models but also word-based/class-based language models by manipulating morphological and relative positional information. And we integrate the models into a log-linear model. Experiments on multilingual translations showed that such morphological information as part-of-speech and base form are effective for improving performance in morphologically rich language pairs and that the relative positional features in a word group are useful for reordering the local word orders. Moreover, the use of a class-based n-gram language model improves performance by alleviating the data sparseness problem in a word-based language model.

AB Cross-Language Spoken Document Retrieval (CLSDR) combines the need for language translation and the retrieval of spoken documents. CLSDR baseline retrieval performance is established for the TREC-8 SDR task using two machine translation tools (Systran and Power Translator Pro) combined with the Okapi probabilistic retrieval system. Our CLSDR results show that pseudo relevance feedback and combination with contemporaneous text collections both lead to improved absolute retrieval performance, but that there is little improvement in cross-language retrieval losses relative to monolingual text retrieval. Further experiments show that significant loss in retrieval performance arises separately due to both cross-language topic translation weaknesses and errors in automatic transcription of the spoken documents, and that these losses are almost exactly additive for our current CLSDR system. The use of data fusion to combine the output from retrieval runs carried out using separate topic translations from the two NIT systems gives a large increase in the number of relevant documents retrieved, but has mixed results for retrieval precision.

AB Current methodologies for automatic translation cannot be expected to produce high quality translations. However, some techniques based on these methodologies can increase the productivity of human translators. The basis of one of these methodologies are finite-state transducers, which are adequate models for computer assisted translation. These models have proved its efficiency in many pattern recognition and artificial intelligence tasks such as speech recognition, handwriting recognition and machine translation for specific domains.
   These finite-state models present some advantages. On the one hand, finite-state models can be learnt from bilingual corpus to infer transducers. On the other hand, there are well-known and efficient algorithms to perform the parse of the best translation according to these models (e.g. Viterbi search). In this paper, the concept of interactive search will be introduced along with some efficient techniques that solve the problem of producing a translation given a sentence in the source language and a prefix (from the output sentence) typed by the user. Needless to say that this system must run under real-time constraints to be useful for human translators.
   This approach has been tested on a corpus of printer manuals and the first results reflect that human translators would only need to type the 25% of the characters of the whole translated text, increasing in this way their throughput and reducing their effort.

AB This study applies multimodal conversation analysis to examine how pupils of L2 English in Sweden make use of online translation tools (OTTs), i.e. bilingual dictionaries and Google Translate, in a range of digital collaborative writing tasks. The collection of sequences where pupils use OTTs comes from 31 hours of video-recorded data from four Swedish upper-secondary schools. In contrast to previous research on OTTs, this multimodal micro-analytic study examines the process of using OTTs and links it to the written product, by analysing actions on the screen accompanied by embodied pupil interaction. Thus the analyses track: (1) how and when pupils deploy OTTs, (2) whether the tools help them to resolve lexical gaps and other lexical issues and (3) what problems arise in the process. The study also discusses what help can be offered to overcome the encountered difficulties of using OTTs.

AB The number of natural language queries submitted to search engines is increasing as search environments get diversified. However, legacy search engines are still optimized for short keyword queries. Thus, the use of natural language queries at legacy search engines degrades the retrieval performance of the engines. This paper proposes a novel method to translate a natural language query into a keyword query relevant to the natural language query for retrieving better search results without change of the engines. The proposed method formulates the translation as a generation task. That is, the method generates a keyword query from a natural language query by preserving the semantics of the natural language query. A recurrent neural network encoder-decoder architecture is adopted as a generator of keyword queries from natural language queries. In addition, an attention mechanism is also used to cope with long natural language queries.

AB Machine Comprehension (MC) is one of the core problems in natural language processing, requiring both understanding of the natural language and knowledge about the world. Rapid progress has been made since the release of several benchmark datasets, and recently the state-of-the-art models even surpass human performance on the well-known SQuAD evaluation. In this paper, we transfer knowledge learned from machine comprehension to the sequence-to-sequence tasks to deepen the understanding of the text. We propose MacNet: a novel encoder-decoder supplementary architecture to the widely used attention-based sequence-to-sequence models. Experiments on neural machine translation (NMT) and abstractive text summarization show that our proposed framework can significantly improve the performance of the baseline models, and our method for the abstractive text summarization achieves the state-of-the-art results on the Gigaword dataset.

AB The Push Method for Bottom-Up Evaluation in deductive databases was previously defined as a translation from Datalog to C++. Performance tests on some benchmarks from the OpenRuleBench collection gave very encouraging results. However, most of the systems used for comparison compile the query into code of an abstract machine and then use an emulator for this code. Therefore, runtimes cannot be directly compared. In this paper, we propose an abstract machine for bottom-up evaluation of Datalog based on the Push Method. This also helps to clarify some optimizations we previously expected from the C++ compiler. First tests have shown that the code running in the emulator of the abstract machine is only 1.5 times slower than the native code generated by the C++ compiler. This is better compared to the case for Prolog.

TI Fidelity of translation initiation is required for coordinated
   respiratory complex assembly
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes are unique molecular machines that translate 11 leaderless mRNAs; however, it is not clear how mitoribosomes initiate translation, since mitochondrial mRNAs lack untranslated regions. Mitochondrial translation initiation shares similarities with prokaryotes, such as the formation of a ternary complex of fMet-tRNA(Met), mRNA and the 28S subunit, but differs in the requirements for initiation factors. Mitochondria have two initiation factors: MTIF2, which closes the decoding center and stabilizes the binding of the fMet-tRNA(Met) to the leaderless mRNAs, and MTIF3, whose role is not clear. We show that MTIF3 is essential for survival and that heart- and skeletal muscle-specific loss of MTIF3 causes cardiomyopathy. We identify increased but uncoordinated mitochondrial protein synthesis in mice lacking MTIF3, resulting in loss of specific respiratory complexes. Ribosome profiling shows that MTIF3 is required for recognition and regulation of translation initiation of mitochondrial mRNAs and for coordinated assembly of OXPHOS complexes in vivo.

AB A typical knowledge-based question answering (KB-QA) system faces two challenges: one is to transform natural language questions into their meaning representations (MRs); the other is to retrieve answers from knowledge bases (KBs) using generated MRs. Unlike previous methods which treat them in a cascaded manner, we present a translation-based approach to solve these two tasks in one unified framework. We translate questions to answers based on CYK parsing. Answers as translations of the span covered by each CYK cell are obtained by a question translation method, which first generates formal triple queries as MRs for the span based on question patterns and relation expressions, and then retrieves answers from a given KB based on triple queries generated. A linear model is defined over derivations, and minimum error rate training is used to tune feature weights based on a set of question-answer pairs. Compared to a KB-QA system using a state-of-the-art semantic parser, our method achieves better results.

TI Validation of a machine learning technique for segmentation and pose
   estimation in single plane fluoroscopy
SO JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH
AB Kinematics of total knee replacements (TKR) play an important role in assessing the success of a procedure and would be a valuable addition to clinical practice; however, measuring TKR kinematics is time consuming and labour intensive. Recently, an automatic single-plane fluoroscopic method utilizing machine learning has been developed to facilitate a quick and simple process for measuring TKR kinematics. This study aimed to validate the new automatic single-plane technique using biplanar radiostereometric analysis (RSA) as the gold standard. Twenty-four knees were imaged at various angles of flexion in a dedicated RSA lab and 113 image pairs were obtained. Only the lateral RSA images were used for the automatic single-plane technique to simulate single-plane fluoroscopy. Two networks helped automate the kinematics measurement process, one segmented implant components and the other generated an initial pose estimate for the optimization algorithm. Kinematics obtained via the automatic single plane and manual biplane techniques were compared using root-mean-square error and Bland-Altman plots. Two observers measured the kinematics using the automated technique and results were compared with assess reproducibility. Root-mean-square errors were 0.8 mm for anterior-posterior translation, 0.5 mm for superior-inferior translation, 2.6 mm for medial-lateral translation, 1.0 degrees for flexion-extension, 1.2 degrees for abduction-adduction, and 1.7 degrees for internal-external rotation. Reproducibility, reported as root-mean-square errors between operator measurements, was submillimeter for in-plane translations and below 2 degrees for all rotations. Clinical Significance: The advantages of the automated single plane technique should aid in the kinematic measurement process and help researchers and clinicians perform TKR kinematic analyses.

AB As information sharing becomes more and more convenient, a lot of phenomena of plagiarism shows up. The study of cross-language plagiarism is an important problem that the whole academic circle tries to solve it collectively. In this paper, a multiple-features based cross-language plagiarism detection model is proposed, which includes cross-language plagiarism candidate retrieval based on multiple features and cross-language plagiarism detection based on dynamic text alignment. For cross-language plagiarism candidate retrieval, it is mainly based on the translation features. What's more, for cross-language plagiarism detection, a text-alignment based similarity analysis was used to filter the final results between the identified paragraphs. In this step, our approach doesn't use a machine translation system to convert longer text, but uses a dictionary to obtain the translation of a single word. Moreover, experimental results show that our method outperforms the previous methods and achieved the best results in four datasets.

AB Segmentation of bilingual text corpora is a very important issue to deal with in machine translation. In this paper we present a new method to perform bilingual segmentation of a parallel corpus, SPBalign, which is based on phrase-based statistical translation models. The new technique proposed here is compared with other two existing techniques, which are also based on statistical translation methods: the RECalign technique, which is based on the concept of recursive alignment, and the GIATIalign technique, which is based on simple word alignments. Experimental results are obtained for the EuTRANS-I English-Spanish task, in order to create new, shorter bilingual segments to be included in a translation memory database. The evaluation of these three methods has been performed comparing the bilingual segmentations obtained by these techniques with respect to a manually segmented bilingual test corpus. These results show us that the new method proposed here outperforms in all cases the two already proposed bilingual segmentation techniques.

AB In last decade lot of efforts had been made by research community to create sign language recognition system which provide a medium of communication for differently-abled people and their machine translations help others having trouble in understanding such sign languages. Computer vision and machine learning can be collectively applied to create such systems. In this paper, we present a sign language recognition system which makes use of depth images that were captured using a Microsoft Kinect (R) camera. Using computer vision algorithms, we develop a characteristic depth and motion profile for each sign language gesture. The feature matrix thus generated was trained using a multi-class SVM classifier and the final results were compared with existing techniques. The dataset used is of sign language gestures for the digits 0-9.

TI PECULIARITIES OF TRANSLATION SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES' ANNOTATIONS WITH THE
   HELP OF FREELY REDISTRIBUTABLE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS
SO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND LEARNING TOOLS
AB The article analyzes the peculiarities of translation scientific articles' annotations with the help of freely redistributable software products, in particular Google Translate and Pereklad.online.ua which are the most popular in Ukraine. Universal characteristics for this type of texts, compositional structure and methods of their lexical and grammatical design, as well as the possibility of translating into English, both with the help of free software products and professional translators have been determined. It is established that the annotation accelerates the work with the text, as it includes the brief content of the text itself and helps to determine the further work with it. Thanks to the annotation, the reader will be familiar with the subject matter of the text, its relevance and the main idea. It has been found out that by creating the text of the annotation, the author of the scientific publication himself, in his own discretion, determines its relevance, novelty, and also the volume of cognitive information necessary in his opinion sufficient for the future reader of this scientific product. The scientific and technical vocabulary of the annotation serves for the most accurate description and explanation of certain facts, therefore nouns, adjectives and impersonal forms of the verb predominate in it, and the personal forms of the verb are more often used in the passive state. The annotation should be translated in English with the preservation of the relative equality of the content, semantic, stylistic and functional-communicative information contained in the original and the translation, at the same time a certain evidence, reasoning is required. Translation of annotations is a quite difficult long-term process, in the case of misunderstanding the content of the annotationor ignorance of scientific and technical terminology it may occur distortion of the content of the article. Scientific and technical translation does not tolerate the duality of the content and distortion of the terms used. The scientific style of the annotation has its own characteristics and the translation from Ukrainian into English requires the translator to correlate grammatical constructions and lexical material of one language to another, taking into account the features of the scientific style as a whole. It should be noted that for now the machine translation system is playing only a supporting role and allows to translate satisfactorily only simple syntactic and lexical constructions.

AB Monolingual data, being readily available in large quantities, has been used to upscale the scarcely available parallel data in order to train better models for automatic translation. Self-learning, where a model is made to learn from its output, is one approach of exploiting such data. However, it has been shown that too much of this data can be detrimental to the performance of the model if the available parallel data is comparatively extremely low. In this study, we investigate whether the monolingual data can also be too little and if this reduction, based on quality, have a any affect on the performance of the translation model. Experiments have shown that on English-German low resource NMT, it is often better to select only the most useful additional data-based on quality or closeness to the domain of the test data-than utilizing all of the available data.

TI Ribosome heterogeneity in Drosophila melanogaster gonads through
   paralog-switching
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Ribosomes have long been thought of as homogeneous macromolecular machines, but recent evidence suggests they are heterogeneous and could be specialised to regulate translation. Here, we have characterised ribosomal protein heterogeneity across 4 tissues of Drosophila melanogaster. We find that testes and ovaries contain the most heterogeneous ribosome populations, which occurs through a combination of paralog-enrichment and paralog-switching. We have solved structures of ribosomes purified from in vivo tissues by cryo-EM, revealing differences in precise ribosomal arrangement for testis and ovary 80S ribosomes. Differences in the amino acid composition of paralog pairs and their localisation on the ribosome exterior indicate paralog-switching could alter the ribosome surface, enabling different proteins to regulate translation. One testis-specific paralog-switching pair is also found in humans, suggesting this is a conserved site of ribosome heterogeneity. Overall, this work allows us to propose that mRNA translation might be regulated in the gonads through ribosome heterogeneity, providing a potential means of ribosome specialisation.

AB The paper reviews a set of research projects intended to plan for the future. It uses an actor-network construct from Latour's work on science practice, translation. The paper contrasts normal science practice with science in a corporate context. Both situations occur in actor networks, require translation and contain arbitrary decisions. The corporate context can be more problematic because of the greater diversity of actors and agendas. The longer the work goes on, the more actors there are. Research per se is a sustained effort toward emergent goals; in the context of fluid corporate networks, these goals can become lost in mis-translation from one phase to the next. Results that would otherwise build up science findings miss their mark, are delayed, or are overtaken by other developments. The findings exist, but the outcomes for which they were intended may not materialize.

TI Syntax- and semantic-based reordering in hierarchical phrase-based
   statistical machine translation
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB We present a syntax-based reordering model (RM) for hierarchical phrase-based statistical machine translation (HPB-SMT) enriched with semantic features. Our model brings a number of novel contributions: (i) while the previous dependency-based RM is limited to the reordering of head and dependant constituent pairs, we also model the reordering of pairs of dependants; (ii) Our model is enriched with semantic features (Wordnet synsets) in order to allow the reordering model to generalize to pairs not seen in training but with equivalent meaning. (iii) We evaluate our model on two language directions: English-to-Farsi and English-to-Turkish. These language pairs are particularly challenging due to the free word order, rich morphology and lack of resources of the target languages.
   We evaluate our RM both intrinsically (accuracy of the RM classifier) and extrinsically (MT). Our best configuration outperforms the baseline classifier by 5-29% on pairs of dependants and by 12-30% on head and dependant pairs while the improvement on MT ranges between 1.6% and 5.5% relative in terms of BLEU depending on language pair and domain. We also analyze the value of the feature weights to obtain further insights on the impact of the reordering-related features in the HPB-SMT model. We observe that the features of our RM are assigned significant weights and that our features are complementary to the reordering feature included by default in the HPB-SMT model.

In this Perspective, we discuss the possibility of embedding artificial molecular machines into heterogeneous robust frameworks with the goal of creating cooperatively working molecular factories. We describe the current progress in the design, synthesis and functioning of artificial molecular machines and outline current efforts organizing them in ordered assemblies and frameworks. On the basis of this discussion, design principles are given towards collectively working systems in which both the machine and the framework are active components. We further explore potential functionalities and applications of these systems, and discuss challenges and prospects for the future.

AB System-level Dynamic Binary Translation (DBT) provides the capability to boot an Operating System (OS) and execute programs compiled for an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) different from that of the host machine. Due to their performance-critical nature, system-level DBT frameworks are typically hand-coded and heavily optimized, both for their guest and host architectures. While this results in good performance of the DBT system, engineering costs for supporting a new architecture or extending an existing architecture are high. In this article, we develop a novel, retargetable DBT hypervisor, which includes guest-specific modules generated from high-level guest machine specifications. Our system simplifies retargeting of the DBT, but it also delivers performance levels in excess of existing manually created DBT solutions. We achieve this by combining offline and online optimizations and exploiting the freedom of a Just-in-time (JIT) compiler operating in a bare-metal environment provided by a Virtual Machine (VM) hypervisor. We evaluate our DBT using both targeted micro-benchmarks as well as standard application benchmarks, and we demonstrate its ability to outperform the de facto standard QEMU DBT system. Our system delivers an average speedup of 2.21x over QEMU across SPEC CPU2006 integer benchmarks running in a full-system Linux OS environment, compiled for the 64-bit ARMv8-A ISA and hosted on an x86-64 platform. For floating-point applications the speedup is even higher, reaching 6.49x on average. We demonstrate that our system-level DBT system significantly reduces the effort required to support a new ISA while delivering outstanding performance.

AB Recent years have seen the rise of Deep Learning (DL) techniques applied to source code. Researchers have exploited DL to automate several development and maintenance tasks, such as writing commit messages, generating comments and detecting vulnerabilities among others. One of the long lasting dreams of applying DL to source code is the possibility to automate non-trivial coding activities. While some steps in this direction have been taken (e.g., learning how to fix bugs), there is still a glaring lack of empirical evidence on the types of code changes that can be learned and automatically applied by DL. Our goal is to make this first important step by quantitatively and qualitatively investigating the ability of a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to learn how to automatically apply code changes implemented by developers during pull requests. We train and experiment with the NMT model on a set of 236k pairs of code components before and after the implementation of the changes provided in the pull requests. We show that, when applied in a narrow enough context (i.e., small/medium-sized pairs of methods before/after the pull request changes), NMT can automatically replicate the changes implemented by developers during pull requests in up to 36% of the cases. Moreover, our qualitative analysis shows that the model is capable of learning and replicating a wide variety of meaningful code changes, especially refactorings and bug-fixing activities. Our results pave the way for novel research in the area of DL on code, such as the automatic learning and applications of refactoring.

TI Context-aware Retrieval-based Deep Commit Message Generation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY
AB Commit messages recorded in version control systems contain valuable information for software development, maintenance, and comprehension. Unfortunately, developers often commit code with empty or poor quality commit messages. To address this issue, several studies have proposed approaches to generate commit messages from commit diffs. Recent studies make use of neural machine translation algorithms to try and translate git diffs into commit messages and have achieved some promising results. However, these learningbasedmethods tend to generate high-frequency words but ignore low-frequency ones. In addition, they suffer from exposure bias issues, which leads to a gap between training phase and testing phase.
   In this article, we propose COREC to address the above two limitations. Specifically, we first train a contextaware encoder-decoder model that randomly selects the previous output of the decoder or the embedding vector of a ground truth word as context to make the model gradually aware of previous alignment choices. Given a diff for testing, the trained model is reused to retrieve the most similar diff from the training set. Finally, we use the retrieval diff to guide the probability distribution for the final generated vocabulary. Our method combines the advantages of both information retrieval and neural machine translation. We evaluate CoRec on a dataset from Liu et al. and a large-scale dataset crawled from 10K popular Java repositories in Github. Our experimental results show that COREC significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method NNGen by 19% on average in terms of BLEU.

AB This paper is about the static error measuring strategy of five-axis CNC machine tool basing on the touch-trigger probe, which is the mainly measuring tool to detect the static error of the five-axis machine tool of RTTTR and RRTTT topological structure. According to kinematic chain of the five-axis NC machine, the relationship between NC machine coordinate system and workpiece coordinate system is established and the relationship between NC machine coordinate system and tool coordinate system. Now the measurement and identification of three axis NC machine tool has been studied a lot, which means that the error of straight line can be measure and compensate very well. So in this paper we assume that the error of the translation axis has been compensated and the motion error of the rotation axis is small enough relative to the static error. Then based on the relationship between static error and the actual coordinate values in the model established before, the static error of each rotation axis can be solved.

AB Many studies that have investigated the educational value of online machine translation (MT) in second language (L2) writing generally report significant improvements after MT use, but no study as of yet has comprehensively analyzed the effectiveness of MT use in terms of various measures in syntactic complexity, accuracy, lexical complexity, and fluency (CALF). The present study examined how learners' use of MT affects CALF measures in L2 writing using evaluations by automated computational tools as well as human raters. In addition, the study investigated whether proficiency level and text genre affect the learners' use of MT. A total of 91 Korean learners of English participated in the main task of the study in which they wrote on an assigned topic in English first without the help of any resource, and then on a different topic using only Google Translate a week later. Text analysis of students' writing revealed major improvements in accuracy but unclear benefits in syntactic and lexical complexity. It was also found that MT use provided different advantages and disadvantages depending on the proficiency level (high vs. low) and text genre (narrative vs. argumentative). Survey responses strongly indicated that students are highly satisfied with MT and plan to use it again in the future despite being aware of its limitations. Overall, this study found that MT can be useful for improving accuracy but must be used with much discretion for it to benefit other aspects of L2 writing.

AB Cloud computing has begun a transformation from using virtual machines to containers. Containers are attractive because multiple of them can share a single kernel, and add minimal performance overhead. Cloud providers leverage the lean nature of containers to run hundreds of them on a few cores. Furthermore, containers enable the serverless paradigm, which leads to the creation of short-lived processes.
   In this work, we identify that containerized environments create page translations that are extensively replicated across containers in the TLB and in page tables. The result is high TLB pressure and redundant kernel work during page table management. To remedy this situation, this paper proposes BabelFish, a novel architecture to share page translations across containers in the TLB and in page tables. We evaluate BabelFish with simulations of an 8-core processor running a set of Docker containers in an environment with conservative container colocation. On average, under BabelFish, 53% of the translations in containerized workloads and 93% of the translations in serverless workloads are shared. As a result, BabelFish reduces the mean and tail latency of containerized data-serving workloads by 11% and 18%, respectively. It also lowers the execution time of containerized compute workloads by 11%. Finally, it reduces serverless function bring-up time by 8% and execution time by 10%-55%.

AB Automatic evaluation of Machine Translation (MT) quality has been investigated over several decades. Spoken Language Translation (SLT), especially when simultaneous, needs to consider additional criteria and does not have a standard evaluation procedure and a widely used toolkit. To fill the gap, we introduce SLTEV, an open-source tool for assessing SLT in a comprehensive way. SLTEV reports the quality, latency, and stability of an SLT candidate output based on the time-stamped transcript and reference translation into a target language. For quality, we rely on sacreBLEU which provides MT evaluation measures such as chrF or BLEU. For latency, we propose two new scoring techniques. For stability, we extend the previously defined measures with a normalized Flicker in our work. We also propose a new averaging of older measures.
   A preliminary version of SLTEV was used in the IWSLT 2020 SHARED TASK. Moreover, a growing collection of test datasets directly accessible by SLTEV are provided for system evaluation comparable across papers.

AB n-gram language modeling is a popular technique used to improve performance of various NLP applications. However, it still faces the "curse of dimensionality" issue wherein word sequences on which the model will be tested are likely to be different from those seen during training (Bengio et al., 2003). An approach that incorporates WordNet to a trigram language modeler has been developed to address this issue. WordNet was used to generate proxy trigrams that may be used to reinforce the fluency of the given trigrams. Evaluation results reported a significant decrease in model perplexity showing that the new method, evaluated using the English language in the business news domain, is capable of addressing the issue. The modeler was also used as a too] to rank parallel translations produced by multiple Machine Translation systems. Results showed a 6-7% improvement over the base approach (Callison-Burch and Flournoy, 2001) in correctly ranking parallel translations.

AB PVS is one of the most powerful proof assistant systems and its libraries of formalized mathematics are among the most comprehensive albeit under-appreciated ones. A characteristic feature of PVS is the use of a very rich mathematical and logical foundation, including e.g., record types, undecidable subtyping, and a deep integration of decision procedures. That makes it particularly difficult to develop integrations of PVS with other systems such as other reasoning tools or library management periphery.
   This paper presents a translation of PVS and its libraries to the OMDoc/MMT framework that preserves the logical semantics and notations but makes further processing easy for third-party tools. OMDoc/MMT is a framework for formal knowledge that abstracts from logical foundations and concrete syntax to provide a universal representation format for formal libraries and interface layer for machine support. Our translation allows instantiating generic OMDoc/MMT-level tool support for the PVS library and enables future translations to libraries of other systems.

TI Multi-Information Spatial-Temporal LSTM Fusion Continuous Sign Language
   Neural Machine Translation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB There are two basic problems in sign language recognition (SLR): (a) isolated word SLR and (b) continuous SLR. Most of the existing continuous SLR methods are extensions of the isolated word SLR methods. These methods use the isolated word SLR results as the basic module and obtain the sentence recognition results through sentence segmentation and word alignment. However, sentence segmentation and word alignment are often not accurate, resulting in a low sentence recognition accuracy. At the same time, continuous SLR usually requires strict sample labels, leading to the difficult task of manual labeling and limited training data availability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a bidirectional spatial-temporal LSTM fusion attention network (Bi-ST-LSTM-A) for continuous SLR. This approach avoids problems such as sentence segmentation, word alignment, and tedious manual labeling. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) we proposed a sign language video feature representation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and spatial-temporal LSTM (ST-LSTM) information fusion technology; and (2) we constructed a uniform neural machine translation framework that can be used for complex continuous SLR and gesture recognition of nonspecific people in nonspecific environments. Experiments were carried out on some large continuous sign language datasets. The sign language recognition accuracy reached 81.22% on the 500 CSL dataset, 76.12% on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather dataset and 75.32% on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T dataset, thereby illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

AB Conventional code compliance checking of building envelope energy efficiency is a complex process with tremendous manual calculation work. Automating the checking process can avoid potential calculation mistakes and allow designers to optimize building envelope design more efficiently. To this end, machine-readable code translation with high level of accuracy and correctness is a strong need. This paper thus presents a visual programming language (VPL)-based code translation approach for automated compliance checking of building envelope energy efficiency. Analysis of energy code for building envelope design in Hong Kong is first conducted to identify data sources and key intermediate checking requirements. Based on the identification, atomic methods are selected, and nested program are created, which gives designers and architects the flexibility to reuse these nodes to build or update relevant checking rules. Finally, an architecture of VPL-based energy code translation for overall thermal transfer value (OTTV) checking is presented for future verification of the performance of our approach.

TI Factor-based evaluation for English to Hindi MT outputs
SO LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
AB Design and implementation of automatic evaluation methods is an integral part of any scientific research in accelerating the development cycle of the output. This is no less true for automatic machine translation (MT) systems. However, no such global and systematic scheme exists for evaluation of performance of an MT system. The existing evaluation metrics, such as BLEU, METEOR, TER, although used extensively in literature have faced a lot of criticism from users. Moreover, performance of these metrics often varies with the pair of languages under consideration. The above observation is no less pertinent with respect to translations involving languages of the Indian subcontinent. This study aims at developing an evaluation metric for English to Hindi MT outputs. As a part of this process, a set of probable errors have been identified manually as well as automatically. Linear regression has been used for computing weight/penalty for each error, while taking human evaluations into consideration. A sentence score is computed as the weighted sum of the errors. A set of 126 models has been built using different single classifiers and ensemble of classifiers in order to find the most suitable model for allocating appropriate weight/penalty for each error. The outputs of the models have been compared with the state-of-the-art evaluation metrics. The models developed for manually identified errors correlate well with manual evaluation scores, whereas the models for the automatically identified errors have low correlation with the manual scores. This indicates the need for further improvement and development of sophisticated linguistic tools for automatic identification and extraction of errors. Although many automatic machine translation tools are being developed for many different language pairs, there is no such generalized scheme that would lead to designing meaningful metrics for their evaluation. The proposed scheme should help in developing such metrics for different language pairs in the coming days.

AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models have been observed to produce poor translations when there are few/no parallel sentences to train the models. In the absence of parallel data, several approaches have turned to the use of images to learn translations. Since images of words, e.g., horse may be unchanged across languages, translations can be identified via images associated with words in different languages that have a high degree of visual similarity. However, translating via images has been shown to improve upon text-only models only marginally. To better understand when images are useful for translation, we study image translatability of words, which we define as the translatability of words via images, by measuring intra- and inter-cluster similarities of image representations of words that are translations of each other. We find that images of words are not always invariant across languages, and that language pairs with shared culture, meaning having either a common language family, ethnicity or religion, have improved image translatability (i.e., have more similar images for similar words) compared to its converse, regardless of their geographic proximity. In addition, in line with previous works that show images help more in translating concrete words, we found that concrete words have improved image translatability compared to abstract ones.

TI AUTOMATIC PARALLEL CODE GENERATION FOR NUFFT DATA TRANSLATION ON
   MULTICORES
SO JOURNAL OF CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND COMPUTERS
AB The nonuniform FFT (NuFFT) is widely used in many applications. Focusing on the most time-consuming part of the NuFFT computation, the data translation step, in this paper, we develop an automatic parallel code generation tool for data translation targeting emerging multicores. The key components of this tool are two scalable parallelization strategies, namely, the source-driven parallelization and the target-driven parallelization. Both these strategies employ equally sized geometric tiling and binning to improve data locality while trying to balance workloads across the cores through dynamic task allocation. They differ in the partitioning and scheduling schemes used to guarantee mutual exclusion in data updates. This tool also consists of a code generator and a code optimizer for the data translation. We evaluated our tool on a commercial multicore machine for both 2D and 3D inputs under different sample distributions with large data set sizes. The results indicate that both parallelization strategies have good scalability as the number of cores and the number of dimensions of data space increase. In particular, the target-driven parallelization outperforms the other when samples are nonuniformly distributed. The experiments also show that our code optimizations can bring about 32%-43% performance improvement to the data translation step of NuFFT.

TI Task-Oriented Multi-User Semantic Communications
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS
AB While semantic communications have shown the potential in the case of single-modal single-users, its applications to the multi-user scenario remain limited. In this paper, we investigate deep learning (DL) based multi-user semantic communication systems for transmitting single-modal data and multimodal data, respectively. We adopt three intelligent tasks, including, image retrieval, machine translation, and visual question answering (VQA) as the transmission goal of semantic communication systems. We propose a Transformer based framework to unify the structure of transmitters for different tasks. For the single-modal multi-user system, we propose two Transformer based models, named, DeepSC-IR and DeepSC-MT, to perform image retrieval and machine translation, respectively. In this case, DeepSC-IR is trained to optimize the distance in embedding space between images and DeepSC-MT is trained to minimize the semantic errors by recovering the semantic meaning of sentences. For the multimodal multi-user system, we develop a Transformer enabled model, named, DeepSC-VQA, for the VQA task by extracting text-image information at the transmitters and fusing it at the receiver. In particular, a novel layer-wise Transformer is designed to help fuse multimodal data by adding connection between each of the encoder and decoder layers. Numerical results show that the proposed models are superior to traditional communications in terms of the robustness to channels, computational complexity, transmission delay, and the task-execution performance at various task-specific metrics.

TI Addressing domain shift in neural machine translation via reinforcement
   learning
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB Domain Adaptation (DA) has been a well-known transfer learning algorithm used in Neural Machine Transla-tion (NMT) task. Adding domain-related corpora in training data to train the model boosts the performance of NMT. Many low resource language pairs such as Hindi-Nepali and Spanish-Portuguese, for which sufficient parallel data are not available to train the model, face in-domain data scarcity issue. Non-availability of in-domain training data leads to the use of unrelated corpus in training the model, which degrades the NMT performance. This domain mismatch between training and test data results in a domain shift problem. To tackle the challenge of the domain shift problem in NMT, we propose REINFORCE-based Sentence Selection and Weighting (RSSW) method, which selects pseudo in-domain sentences from out-of-domain data and learns their weights based on Reinforcement Learning. The proposed method leverages the similarity between language pairs by encoding the source and target languages into a common encoding script for language model training. RSSW uses minimum risk training and maximum likelihood estimation as an objective function to train NMT on selected pseudo in-domain sentences. Furthermore, we employ multi-domain and fine -tuning approaches to compare proposed method on Hindi <-> Nepali and Hindi <-> Marathi language pairs through extensive experimental analysis. From the experimental results, we find that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art and baseline approaches by & SIM;2 BLEU points in all translation directions of language pairs.

TI Optimizing Deep Learning Inference on Embedded Systems Through Adaptive
   Model Selection
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS
AB Deep neural networks (DNNs) are becoming a key enabling technique for many application domains. However, on-device inference on battery-powered, resource-constrained embedding systems is often infeasible due to prohibitively long inferencing time and resource requirements of many DNNs. Offloading computation into the cloud is often unacceptable due to privacy concerns, high latency, or the lack of connectivity. Although compression algorithms often succeed in reducing inferencing times, they come at the cost of reduced accuracy.
   This article presents a new, alternative approach to enable efficient execution of DNNs on embedded devices. Our approach dynamically determines which DNN to use for a given input by considering the desired accuracy and inference time. It employs machine learning to develop a low-cost predictive model to quickly select a pre-trained DNN to use for a given input and the optimization constraint. We achieve this first by offline training a predictive model and then using the learned model to select a DNN model to use for new, unseen inputs. We apply our approach to two representative DNN domains: image classification and machine translation. We evaluate our approach on a Jetson TX2 embedded deep learning platform and consider a range of influential DNN models including convolutional and recurrent neural networks. For image classification, we achieve a 1.8x reduction in inference time with a 7.52% improvement in accuracy over the most capable single DNN model. For machine translation, we achieve a 1.34x reduction in inference time over the most capable single model with little impact on the quality of translation.

AB Network-based mobile services, such as speech-to-speech translation and voice search, enable the construction of large-scale log database including speech. We have developed a smartphone application called VoiceTra for speech-to-speech translation and have collected 10,000,000 utterances so far. This huge corpus is unique in size and spatio-temporal information; it contains information on anonymized user locations. This spatio-temporal corpus can be used for improving the accuracy of its speech recognition and machine translation, and it will open the door for the study of the location dependency of vocabulary and new applications for location-based services. This paper first analyzes the corpus and then presents a novel method for classifying utterances using linguistic and non-linguistic information. L2-regularized Logistic Regression is used for utterance classification. Our experiments performed on the VoiceTra log corpus revealed that our proposed method outperformed baseline methods in terms of F measure.

AB This paper reports on recent experiments for speech to text (STT) translation of European Parliamentary speeches. A Spanish speech to English text translation system has been built using data from the TC-STAR European project. The speech recognizer is a state-of-the-art multipass system trained for the Spanish EPPS task and the statistical translation system relies on the IBM-4 model. First, MT results are compared using manual transcriptions and 1-best ASR hypotheses with different word error rates. Then, an n-best interface between the ASR and MT components is investigated to improve the STT process. Derivation of the fundamental equation for machine translation suggests that the source language model is not necessary for STT This was investigated by using weak source language models and by n-best rescoring adding the acoustic model score only. A significant loss in the BLEU score was observed suggesting that the source language model is needed given the insufficiencies of the translation model. Adding the source language model score in the n-best rescoring process recovers the loss and slightly improves the BLEU score over the I-best ASR hypothesis. The system achieves a BLEU score of 37.3 with an ASR word error rate of 10% and a BLEU score of 40.5 using the manual transcripts.

TI Fast Two-Level Address Translation for Virtualized Systems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS
AB Recently, there have been several improvements in architectural supports for two-level address translation for virtualized systems. However, those improvements including HW-based two-dimensional (2D) page walkers have extended the traditional multi-level page tables, without considering the memory management characteristics of virtual machines. This paper exploits the unique behaviors of the hypervisor, and proposes three new nested address translation schemes for virtualized systems. The first scheme called nested segmentation is designed for static memory allocation, and uses HW segmentation to map the VM memory directly to large contiguous memory regions. The second scheme proposes to use a flat nested page table for each VM, reducing memory accesses by the current 2D page walkers. The third scheme uses speculative inverted shadow paging, backed by non-speculative flat nested page tables. The speculative mechanism provides direct translation with a single memory reference for common cases without page table synchronization overheads. We evaluate the proposed schemes with the Xen hypervisor running on a full system simulator. Nested segmentation can reduce the overheads of two-level translation significantly for a certain cloud computing model. The nested segmentation, flat page tables, and speculative shadowing improve a state-of-the-art 2D page walker by 10, 7, and 14 percent respectively.

AB Detection of automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors is crucial to preventing their further propagation through statistical machine translation (SMT) in conversational spoken language translation (CSLT) systems. In this paper, we venture beyond traditional features obtained from the ASR decoder and hypothesized word sequence, and explore additional information streams provided by an error-robust CSLT system, including SMT confidence estimates and posteriors from named entity detection (NED). Another significant novelty of this work is the use of an automated word boundary detector based on acoustic-prosodic features to verify the existence of ASR-hypothesized word boundaries, which further improves ASR error detection. Offline evaluation on a test set designed to invoke ASR errors showed that at 10% false alarm rate, the proposed features provide 2.8% absolute (4.2% relative) improvement in detection rate over a state-of-the-art baseline error detector that uses a rich set of features traditionally employed in the existing literature.

   simultaneous interpreting
SO TARGET-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB Since the early 1990s, with the advance of computerized corpora, translation scholars have been using corpus-based methodologies to look into the possible existence of overriding patterns (tentatively described as universals or as laws) in translated texts. The application of such methodologies to interpreted texts has been much slower in developing than in the case of translated ones, but significant progress has been made in recent years. After presenting the fundamental methodological hurdles - and advantages - of working on machine-readable (transcribed) oral corpora, we present and discuss several recent studies using cross-modal comparisons, and examine the viability of using interpreted outputs to explore the features that set simultaneous interpreting apart from other forms of translation. We then set out to test the hypothesis that modality may exert a stronger effect than ontology - i.e. that being oral (vs. written) is a more powerful influence than being translated (vs. original).

AB We introduce our TMU Japanese-to-English system, which employs a semi-autoregressive model, to tackle the WAT 2021 (Nakazawa et al., 2021) restricted translation task. In this task, we translate an input sentence with the constraint that some words, called restricted target vocabularies (RTVs), must be contained in the output sentence. To satisfy this constraint, we use a semi-autoregressive model, namely, RecoverSAT (Ran et al., 2020), due to its ability (known as "forced translation") to insert specified words into the output sentence. When using "forced translation," the order of inserting RTVs is a critical problem. In our system, we obtain word alignment between a source sentence and the corresponding RTVs and then sort the RTVs in the order of their corresponding words or phrases in the source sentence. Using the model with sorted order RTVs, we succeeded in inserting all the RTVs into output sentences in more than 96% of the test sentences. Moreover, we confirmed that sorting RTVs improved the BLEU score compared with random order RTVs.

AB Although the problem of similar language translation has been an area of research interest for many years, yet it is still far from being solved. In this paper, we study the performance of two popular approaches: statistical and neural. We conclude that both methods yield similar results; however, the performance varies depending on the language pair. While the statistical approach outperforms the neural one by a difference of 6 BLEU points for the Spanish-Portuguese language pair, the proposed neural model surpasses the statistical one by a difference of 2 BLEU points for Czech-Polish. In the former case, the language similarity (based on perplexity) is much higher than in the latter case. Additionally, we report negative results for the system combination with back-translation.
   Our TALP-UPC system submission won 1st place for Czech -> Polish and 2nd place for Spanish -> Portuguese in the official evaluation of the 1st WMT Similar Language Translation task.

We train T2API to statistically learn the alignments between English and APIs and determine the relevant API elements. The training is done on StackOverflow, which is a bilingual corpus on which developers discuss programming problems in two types of language: English and programming language. T2API considers both the context of the words in the input query and the context of API elements that often go together in the corpus. The derived API elements with their relevance scores are assembled into an API usage by GRASYN, our novel graph-based API synthesis algorithm that generates a graph representing an API usage from a large code corpus. Importantly, it is capable of generating new API usages from previously seen sub-usages.

We constrain our experiments such that the methods developed can be extended to low-resource languages. We derive different phonetic representations of the source texts in order to model the kinds of transcriptions that can be learned from low-resource-language speech data. We experiment with different methods of clustering the elements of the phonetic representations together into word-like units. We train MT models on the resulting texts, and report BLEU scores for the different representations and clustering methods in order to compare their effectiveness. Finally, we discuss our findings and suggest avenues for future research.

TI Efficient Methods for Mapping Neural Machine Translator on FPGAs
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
AB Neural machine translation (NMT) is one of the most critical applications in natural language processing (NLP) with the main idea of converting text in one language to another using deep neural networks. In recent year, we have seen continuous development of NMT by integrating more emerging technologies, such as bidirectional gated recurrent units (GRU), attention mechanisms, and beam-search algorithms, for improved translation quality. However, with the increasing problem size, the real-life NMT models have become much more complicated and difficult to implement on hardware for acceleration opportunities. In this article, we aim to exploit the capability of FPGAs to deliver highly efficient implementations for real-life NMT applications. We map the inference of a large-scale NMT model with total computation of 172 GFLOP to a highly optimized high-level synthesis (HLS) IP and integrate the IP into Xilinx VCU118 FPGA platform. The model has widely used key features for NMTs, including the bidirectional GRU layer, attention mechanism, and beam search. We quantize the model to mixed-precision representation in which parameters and portions of calculations are in 16-bit half precision, and others remain as 32-bit floating-point. Compared to the float NMT implementation on FPGA, we achieve 13.1x speedup with an end-to-end performance of 22.0 GFLOPS without any accuracy degradation. Based on our knowledge, this is the first work that successfully implements a real-life end-to-end NMT model to an FPGA on board.

TI PhraseTransformer: an incorporation of local context information into
   sequence-to-sequence semantic parsing
SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE
AB Semantic parsing is a challenging task mapping a natural language utterance to machine-understandable information representation. Recently, approaches using neural machine translation (NMT) have achieved many promising results, especially the Transformer. However, the typical drawback of adapting the vanilla Transformer to semantic parsing is that it does not consider the phrase in expressing the information of sentences while phrases play an important role in constructing the sentence meaning. Therefore, we propose an architecture, PhraseTransformer, that is capable of a more detailed meaning representation by learning the phrase dependencies in the sentence. The main idea is to incorporate Long Short-Term Memory into the Self-Attention mechanism of the original Transformer to capture the local context of a word. Experimental results show that our proposed model performs better than the original Transformer in terms of understanding sentences structure as well as logical representation and raises the model local context-awareness without any support from external tree information. Besides, although the recurrent architecture is integrated, the number of sequential operations of the PhraseTransformer is still O(1) similar to the original Transformer. Our proposed model achieves strong competitive performance on Geo and MSParS datasets, and leads to SOTA performance on the Atis dataset for methods using neural networks. In addition, to prove the generalization of our proposed model, we also conduct extensive experiments on three translation datasets IWLST14 German-English, IWSLT15 Vietnamese-English, WMT14 English-German, and show significant improvement. Our code is available at https://github.com/phuongnm94/PhraseTransformer.git.

AB Speech-to-speech translation is a challenging task mixing two of the most ambitious Natural Language Processing challenges: Machine Translation (MT) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Recent advances in both fields have led to operational systems achieving good performance when used in matching conditions with those of ASR and MT models training. Regardless of the quality of these models, errors are inevitable due to some technical limitations of the systems (e.g. closed vocabulary) and intrinsic ambiguities of spoken languages. However all ASR and MT errors don't have the same impact on the usability of a given speech-to-speech dialog system: some can be very benign, unconsciously corrected by users, some can damage the understanding between users and eventually lead the dialog to a failure. We present in this paper a strategy focusing on ASR error segments that have a high negative impact on MT performance. We propose a method that consists firstly in automatically detecting these erroneous segments then secondly estimating their impact on MT. We show that removing such segments prior to translation can lead to a significant decrease in translation error rate, even without any correction strategy.

AB Rapid progress in Machine Learning (ML) has seen a swift translation to real world commercial deployment. While research and development of ML applications have progressed at an exponential pace, the required software engineering process for ML applications and the corresponding eco-system of testing and quality assurance tools which enable software reliable, trustworthy and safe and easy to deploy, have sadly lagged behind. Specifically, the challenges and gaps in quality assurance (QA) and testing of AI applications have largely remained unaddressed contributing to a poor translation rate of ML applications from research to real world. Unlike traditional software, which has a well-defined software testing methodology, ML applications have largely taken an ad-hoc approach to testing. ML researchers and practitioners either fall back to traditional software testing approaches, which are inadequate for this domain, due to its inherent probabilistic and data dependent nature, or rely largely on non-rigorous self-defined QA methodologies. These issues have driven the ML and Software Engineering research communities to develop of newer tools and techniques designed specifically for ML. These research advances need to be publicized and practiced in real world in ML development and deployment for enabling successful translation of ML from research prototypes to real world. This tutorial intends to address this need.
   This tutorial aims to:
   [1] Provide a comprehensive overview of testing of ML applications
   [2] Provide practical insights and share community best practices for testing ML software

Online banking, web TV, internet shopping, e-government and social networking are all different kinds of human interaction that have recently leveraged the capabilities of the Web architecture. Activities that have human and computer components are referred to as social machines. This paper introduces HTP, a sociotechnical model to understand, describe and analyze the formation and development of social machines and other web activities. HTP comprises three components: heterogeneous networks of actors involved in a social machine; the iterative process of translation of the actors' activities into a temporarily stable and sustainable social machine; and the different phases of this machine's adaptation from one stable state to another as the surrounding networks restructure and global agendas ebb and flow. The HTP components are drawn from an interdisciplinary range of theoretical positions and concepts. HTP provides an analytical framework to explain why different Web activities remain stable and functional, whilst others fail. We illustrate the use of HTP by examining the formation of a classic social machine (Wikipedia), and the stabilization points corresponding to its different phases of development.

AB Direct integration of translation model (TM) probabilities into a language model (LM) with the purpose of improving automatic speech recognition (ASR) of spoken translations typically requires a number of complex operations for each sentence. Many if not all of the LM probabilities need to be updated, the model needs to be renormalized and the ASR system needs to load a new, updated LM for each sentence. In computer-aided translation environments the time loss induced by these complex operations seriously reduces the potential of ASR as an efficient input method.
   In this paper we present a novel LM adaptation technique that drastically reduces the complexity of each of these operations. The technique consists of LM probability updates using exponential weights based on TM probabilities for each sentence and does not enforce probability renormalization. Instead of storing each resulting language model in its entirety, we only store the update weights which also reduces disk storage and loading time during ASR. Experiments on Dutch read speech translated from English show that both disk storage and recognition time drop dramatically compared to a baseline system that employs a more conventional way of updating the LM.

AB Virtualization provides value for many workloads, but its cost rises for workloads with poor memory access locality. This overhead comes from translation lookaside buffer (TLB) misses where the hardware performs a 2D page walk (up to 24 memory references on x86-64) rather than a native TLB miss (up to only 4 memory references).
   The first dimension translates guest virtual addresses to guest physical addresses, while the second translates guest physical addresses to host physical addresses. This paper proposes new hardware using direct segments with three new virtualized modes of operation that significantly speed-up virtualized address translation. Further, this paper proposes two novel techniques to address important limitations of original direct segments. First, self-ballooning reduces fragmentation in physical memory, and addresses the architectural input/output (I/O) gap in x86-64. Second, an escape filter provides alternate translations for exceptional pages within a direct segment (e.g., physical pages with permanent hard faults).
   We emulate the proposed hardware and prototype the software in Linux with KVM on x86-64. One mode-VMM Direct reduces address translation overhead to near-native without guest application or OS changes (2% slower than native on average), while a more aggressive mode Dual Direct on big-memory workloads performs better-than-native with near-zero translation overhead.

Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the quality of the translation of the translation system. Only when it reaches a certain level can it meet the application standard. The automatic evaluation system is a specific application of intelligent information processing technology. The system can automatically complete the compilation and feed back the system space-time resource information consumed by the user to the user in time, so that the user can check the pros and cons of the algorithm. The purpose of this article is to study the design and research of the English translation automatic evaluation system based on the artificial intelligence fusion control algorithm, and it was expected to combine the artificial intelligence fusion algorithm with the automatic evaluation of the English translation system. In this way, the traditional evaluation efficiency of translation could be further improved and the consumption of human resources can be reduced. Data fusion refers to an information processing technology that uses a computer to automatically analyze and synthesize several observational information obtained in time series under certain criteria to complete the required decision-making and evaluation tasks. This article proposed an automatic terminology translation method based on central word constraints aimed at the different linguistic characteristics of English and Chinese terms; the materials were sequenced before translation. The macroevaluation index was also introduced into the machine translation fusion method to achieve a balance between the robustness and effectiveness of the translation fusion technology. The experimental results of this article showed that under the traditional evaluation system, the response time of the system was 5.5 s and 6.3 s when the number of translations to be judged was 9 sentences and 11 sentences, respectively, whereas under the fusion control method, it was 4.1 s and 4.6 s, respectively. Therefore, the system evaluation efficiency under the fusion control algorithm was higher.

TI English Translation of Chinese Topic Sentences with Gap Subject Based on
   Internet Environment
SO MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Machine translation is showing an increasingly broad application prospect as the Internet becomes more widely used. The method based on the principle of maximum entropy is primarily used in this paper to determine the subject clause for translation. Its feature set does not necessitate extensive linguistic knowledge, and it is less reliant on it than other methods. It can also add arbitrary features and flexibly combine a large amount of scattered and fragmented knowledge. As a result, the maximum entropy model is used as the classifier in this paper, and lexical and sentence features are used to effectively combine the rules and statistical knowledge. The subsentence recognition process is broken down into three stages, with different features extracted at different stages and the maximum entropy model applied multiple times. At each stage, the classifiers are trained. The translation accuracy and recall rate of Chinese gapped subject topic sentences are improved by more than 5% in a maximum entropy model, according to the results. This method of feature description is particularly useful for identifying sentence endings in Chinese subject topic sentences with gaps. Its translation is closer to the correct translation, indicating that the proposed method's basic concept-the rationality of segmentation-is correct. The algorithm based on the maximum entropy model performs better in practice.

AB This paper describes the ON-TRAC Consortium translation systems developed for two challenge tracks featured in the Evaluation Campaign of IWSLT 2022: low-resource and dialect speech translation. For the Tunisian Arabic-English dataset (low-resource and dialect tracks), we build an end-to-end model as our joint primary submission, and compare it against cascaded models that leverage a large fine-tuned wav2vec 2.0 model for ASR. Our results show that in our settings pipeline approaches are still very competitive, and that with the use of transfer learning, they can outperform end-to-end models for speech translation (ST). For the TamasheqFrench dataset (low-resource track) our primary submission leverages intermediate representations from a wav2vec 2.0 model trained on 234 hours of Tamasheq audio, while our contrastive model uses a French phonetic transcription of the Tamasheq audio as input in a Conformer speech translation architecture jointly trained on automatic speech recognition, ST and machine translation losses. Our results highlight that self-supervised models trained on smaller sets of target data are more effective to low-resource end-to-end ST fine-tuning, compared to large off-the-shelf models. Results also illustrate that even approximate phonetic transcriptions can improve ST scores.

TI TransCirc: an interactive database for translatable circular RNAs based
   on multi-omics evidence
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB TransCirc (https://www.biosino.org/transcirc/) is a specialized database that provide comprehensive evidences supporting the translation potential of circular RNAs (circRNAs). This database was generated by integrating various direct and indirect evidences to predict coding potential of each human circRNA and the putative translation products. Seven types of evidences for circRNA translation were included: (i) ribosome/polysome binding evidences supporting the occupancy of ribosomes onto circRNAs; (ii) experimentally mapped translation initiation sites on circRNAs; (iii) internal ribosome entry site on circRNAs; (iv) published N-6-methyladenosine modification data in circRNA that promote translation initiation; (v) lengths of the circRNA specific open reading frames; (vi) sequence composition scores froma machine learning prediction of all potential open reading frames; (vii) mass spectrometry data that directly support the circRNA encoded peptides across back-splice junctions. TransCirc provides a user-friendly searching/browsing interface and independent lines of evidences to predicte how likely a circRNA can be translated. In addition, several flexible tools have been developed to aid retrieval and analysis of the data. TransCirc can serve as an important resource for investigating the translation capacity of circRNAs and the potential circRNA-encoded peptides, and can be expanded to include new evidences or additional species in the future.

TI Duplicated ribosomal protein paralogs promote alternative translation
   and drug resistance
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Ribosomes are often seen as monolithic machines produced from uniformly regulated genes. However, in yeast most ribosomal proteins come from duplicated genes. Here, we demonstrate that gene duplication may serve as a stress-adaptation mechanism modulating the global proteome through the differential expression of ribosomal protein paralogs. Our data indicate that the yeast paralog pair of the ribosomal protein L7/uL30 produces two differentially acetylated proteins. Under normal conditions most ribosomes incorporate the hypo-acetylated major form favoring the translation of genes with short open reading frames. Exposure to drugs, on the other hand, increases the production of ribosomes carrying the hyper-acetylated minor paralog that increases translation of long open reading frames. Many of these paralog-dependent genes encode cell wall proteins that could promote tolerance to drugs as their translation increases after exposure to drugs. Together our data suggest a mechanism of translation control that functions through a differential use of near-identical ribosomal protein isoforms.
   Most yeast ribosomal protein genes are duplicated but the functional significance of this duplication remains unclear. This study identifies a natural program where changing the ratio of proteins produced from duplicated genes modifies translation in response to drugs regardless of ribosome number.

AB At every level of education, from early years to postgraduate, students can arrive in the UK (or US) classroom with little or no English language ability. It is impossible for teachers to have knowledge of every first language that students bring into the classroom and thus they may rely on a computer-aided translation tool so that their students can have access to the English needed in all subjects across the curriculum. At the same time students need to move from basic English skills in listening, speaking, reading and writing towards the subtleties of academic English which they must achieve in order to reach the UK government's required standards in English at every level of assessment. Using her extensive knowledge of the challenges that students learning English as an Additional Language (EAL) and their teachers face in the classroom situation and the English needed in assessments, the author will examine possible benefits of computer-aided translation tools such as Google Translate and Talking Pen and outline some of the problems and drawbacks with such tools that create barriers to acquiring full academic fluency and thus pose challenges to future translation tool developers.

TI Image Classification in Arabic: Exploring Direct English to Arabic
   Translations
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Image classification is an ongoing research challenge. Most of the current research focuses on image classification in English with very little research in Arabic. Expanding image classification to Arabic has several applications and benefits. This paper investigates the accuracy of direct translations of English labels that are available in ImageNet, a database of images labeled in English that is commonly used in computer vision research, to Arabic. A dataset comprised of 2,887 labeled images was constructed by randomly selecting images from ImageNet. All of the labels were translated to Arabic using an online translation service. The accuracy of each translation was evaluated by a human judge. Results indicated that 65.6% of the generated Arabic labels were accurate with the highest results achieved when the labels consisted of only one word. This study makes three important contributions to the image classification literature: (1) it determines a baseline level of accuracy for image classification in Arabic algorithms; (2) it provides 1,910,935 images classified with accurate Arabic labels (based on accurately labeling 1,895 images that consist of 1,643 unique synsets); and (3) it measures the accuracy of translations of image labels in ImageNet to Arabic.

TI The cross-lingual lexical substitution task
SO LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
AB In this paper we provide an account of the cross-lingual lexical substitution task run as part of SemEval-2010. In this task both annotators (native Spanish speakers, proficient in English) and participating systems had to find Spanish translations for target words in the context of an English sentence. Because only translations of a single lexical unit were required, this task does not necessitate a full blown translation system. This we hope encouraged those working specifically on lexical semantics to participate without a requirement for them to use machine translation software, though they were free to use whatever resources they chose. In this paper we pay particular attention to the resources used by the various participating systems and present analyses to demonstrate the relative strengths of the systems as well as the requirements they have in terms of resources. In addition to the analyses of individual systems we also present the results of a combined system based on voting from the individual systems. We demonstrate that the system produces better results at finding the most frequent translation from the annotators compared to the highest ranked translation provided by individual systems. This supports our other analyses that the systems are heterogeneous, with different strengths and weaknesses.

TI Post-Editing as the Means to Activate Students' Thinking and Analytical
   Process: Psycholinguistic Aspects
SO PSYCHOLINGUISTICS
AB The aim of the research is looking for the ways to intensify the future translators' analytical and thinking activity during their independent work in online teaching. The author strives to achieve it through the combination of post-editing machine-translated texts and the Think-aloud protocol procedure. It is also assumed that this combination reduces the students' dependence on the MT target text structure, as well as improves their competence in translating specialized texts.
   The methodology of research involved experimental post-editing-based online teaching (28 contact hours and 92 hours of independent work) of an elective university course 'Specifics of translating English-language discourse in the domain of Psychology' to the first-year MA students (majoring in English and Translation) whose command of English ranged from C1 to C2 levels in the CEFR classification. The parameters of analysis included the percentage of the students' uploaded home tasks, the degree of the subjects' post-editing intensity in their weekly homework, the students' independence in the interim and final tests, as well as the marks in the Final test.
   The results of the analysis demonstrated a substantial difference between various groups of the subjects by all indicators. The amount of home tasks uploaded by the subjects in groups A and B (with more intensive analytical and thinking activity) exceeds the similar parameter in groups C and D (with less intensive activity) more than twofold. There is a considerable advantage of the groups A and B (and even C) subjects' post-editing intensity in their weekly homework as compared to group D. The intensity of the students' analytical and thinking activity decreased from the highest (group A) to moderately high (group B) to average (group C) and to low (group D). The degree of the students' independence in the interim and final tests decreased from 85.0% (group A) to 35.0% in group D, with the remaining groups' indicators in between - 59.0% (group B) and 46.0% (group C). These indicators clearly correlate with the average marks in the final test, which amounted to 93.80, 63 and 53 points (out of 100) in groups A, B, C and D respectively.
   Conclusions. Post-editing, in combination with the modified TAP procedure, contributes to the efficient development of the specialized texts translation competence due to the intensification of the students' analytical and thinking activity, reduces their dependence on the MT target text structure and correlates with the improvement of the overall quality of their translation.

TI Communication-aware thread mapping using the translation lookaside
   buffer
SO CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB Threads of parallel applications need to communicate in order to fulfill their tasks. The communication performance between the cores in modern multi-core architectures differs because of the memory and interconnection hierarchies. In these architectures, it is important to map the threads of parallel applications by taking into account the communication between them, to improve their performance and energy consumption. In parallel applications based on shared memory, communication is implicit, which makes it difficult to detect the communication pattern between the threads. In this paper, we introduce a new lightweight mechanism to detect the communication pattern between threads of shared memory applications using the translation lookaside buffer. Our mechanism relies on hardware features, which make it transparent to the programmer and allow the detection to be performed by the operating system during the execution of the application. We also developed a heuristic mapping algorithm that uses the detected pattern to dynamically map the threads to cores. Experiments were performed with applications from the NAS-OMP and PARSEC parallel benchmark suites in a simulated machine as well as a real machine. Results show that our mechanism can substantially improve parallel application performance, as well as processor and DRAM energy consumption. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Imposing Constraints from the Source Tree on ITG Constraints for SMT
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB In the current statistical machine translation (SMT), erroneous word reordering is one of the most serious problems. To resolve this problem, many word-reordering constraint techniques have been proposed. Inversion transduction grammar (ITG) is one of these constraints. In ITG constraints, target-side word order is obtained by rotating nodes of the source-side binary tree. In these node rotations, the source binary tree instance is not considered. Therefore, stronger constraints for word reordering can be obtained by imposing further constraints derived from the source tree on the ITG constraints. For example, for the source word sequence {a b c d}, ITG constraints allow a total of twenty-two target word orderings. However, when the source binary tree instance ((a b) (c d)) is given, our proposed "imposing source tree on ITG" (IST-ITG) constraints allow only eight word orderings. The reduction in the number of word-order permutations by our proposed stronger constraints efficiently suppresses erroneous word orderings. In our experiments with IST-ITG using the NIST MT08 English-to-Chinese translation track's data, the proposed method resulted in a 1.8-points improvement in character BLEU-4 (35.2 to 37.0) and a 6.2% lower CER (74.1 to 67.9%) compared with our baseline condition.

TI Machine Translation Systems for Indian Languages: Review of Modelling

SO ARCHIVES OF COMPUTATIONAL METHODS IN ENGINEERING
AB With the advancement in computer language technology in a multilingual country like India, numerous linguistics require technology for translation. It aids in research for ancient languages like Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam to be available for society. Devising these languages require natural language processing, and machine translation is one of its essential areas. It plays a significant role in breaking the language barrier and facilitating inter-lingual communication by translating one language to another. As, with the advent of information technology, many documents and web pages are available in local languages. There is a tremendous need to establish proper communication amongst the people belonging to discrete backgrounds and cultures. This paper contributes in two ways: firstly, the review of different modelling techniques is performed. It serves the developers with resources required for modelling different techniques such as corpus, domains, toolkits, techniques, models, features and their evaluation measures. Secondly, a comparison of research work on different Indic language pairs based on their modelling techniques have been performed. It influences the work on Sanskrit language to be minimal despite holding an ancient scientific and comprehensive literature of India. It also contributes to linguistic and technical challenges for processing Sanskrit language, open issues, and future research directions in this field.

AB Multi-word expressions (MWEs) are a hot topic in research in natural language processing (NLP), including topics such as MWE detection, MWE decomposition, and research investigating the exploitation of MWEs in other NLP fields such as Machine Translation. However, the availability of bilingual or multi-lingual MWE corpora is very limited. The only bilingual MWE corpora that we are aware of is from the PARSEME (PARSing and Multi-word Expressions) EU Project. This is a small collection of only 871 pairs of English-German MWEs. In this paper, we present multi-lingual and bilingual MWE corpora that we have extracted from root parallel corpora. Our collections are 3,159,226 and 143,042 bilingual MWE pairs for German-English and Chinese-English respectively after filtering. We examine the quality of these extracted bilingual MWEs in MT experiments. Our initial experiments applying MWEs in MT show improved translation performances on MWE terms in qualitative analysis and better general evaluation scores in quantitative analysis, on both German-English and Chinese-English language pairs. We follow a standard experimental pipeline to create our MultiMWE corpora which are available online. Researchers can use this free corpus for their own models or use them in a knowledge base as model features.

The alignment is not only on the synset level, but also on word level, by matching words with their closest translations in each language. We argue that the tighter alignment is essential in machine translation and natural language generation. About one-fifth of the lexical entries are also linked to the corresponding Wikipedia articles. In addition to the traditional semantic relations in WordNet, we also integrate morphological and morpho-syntactic information. The resource comes with a corpus where examples from Princeton WordNet are translated to Swedish and Bulgarian. The examples are aligned on word and phrase level. The new resource is open-source and in its development we used only existing open-source resources.

AB Automatic post-editing (APE), which aims to correct errors in the output of machine translation systems in a post-processing step, is an important task in natural language processing. While recent work has achieved considerable performance gains by using neural networks, how to model the copying mechanism for APE remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a new method for modeling copying for APE. To better identify translation errors, our method learns the representations of source sentences and system outputs in an interactive way. These representations are used to explicitly indicate which words in the system outputs should be copied, which is useful to help CopyNet (Gu et al., 2016) better generate post-edited translations. Experiments on the datasets of the WMT 2016-2017 APE shared tasks show that our approach outperforms all best published results. (1)

With the NMT model being widely used in empirical productions, its long-standing weakness in handling the rare and out of vocabulary words has been amplified a lot. In order to release the model from the stress of "understanding" the rare words, copy mechanism has been proposed to deal with the rare and unseen words for the neural network models using attention. However the negative side of the copy mechanism is that the model is only able to decide whether to copy or not. It is unable to detect which class should the rare word be copied to, such as person, location, and organization. This paper deeply investigates this limitation of the NMT model. As a result, we propose a new NMT model by novelly incorporating a class-specific copy network. With the network, the proposed NMT model is able to decide which class the words in the target belong to and which class in the source should be copied to. Experimental results on Chinese-English translation tasks show that the proposed model outperforms the traditional NMT model with a large margin especially for sentences containing the rare words.

AB Gujarati language is spoken by nearly 60 million people worldwide, making it the 26th most-spoken native language in the world. It is part of Indo-Aryan family which is a branch of Indo-European languages. Based on our literature review, we have found that there are 3 Gujarati translators available but none of them provides the accurate translation of Gujarati idioms. This is so because they follow a token-based dictionary-based approach. We have created a corpus of nearly 3000 n-gram idioms of Gujarati language and done an intensive analysis of the same. From this corpus, nearly 1800 bigram idioms have been targeted for Machine Translation using a phrase-based dictionary-based approach. Idiom is a sequence of tokens whose meaning is different from the combination of the literal meaning of the individual tokens forming the idiom. Unlike many natural language tokens, the meaning of idiom does not change with time and space. The proposed Gujarati to English Idioms Translator works well for the bigrams and being based on idioms is free from the effect of getting obsolete with time as well as free from giving unexpected output at a geographically different location throughout the world.

AB Recently, the Transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) that is based solely on attention mechanisms, has advanced the state-of-the-art on various machine translation tasks. However, recent studies reveal that the lack of recurrence hinders its further improvement of translation capacity (Chen et al., 2018; Dehghani et al., 2019). In response to this problem, we propose to directly model recurrence for Transformer with an additional recurrence encoder. In addition to the standard recurrent neural network, we introduce a novel attentive recurrent network to leverage the strengths of both attention and recurrent networks. Experimental results on the widely-used WMT14 English)German and WMT17 Chinese)English translation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our studies also reveal that the proposed model benefits from a short-cut that bridges the source and target sequences with a single recurrent layer, which outperforms its deep counterpart.

TI Deployment strategies for crowdsourcing text creation
SO INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Automatically generating text of high quality in tasks such as translation, summarization, and narrative writing is difficult as these tasks require creativity, which only humans currently exhibit. However, crowd sourcing such tasks is still a challenge as they are tedious for humans and can require expert knowledge. We thus explore deployment strategies for crowdsourcing text creation tasks to improve the effectiveness of the crowdsourcing process. We consider effectiveness through the quality of the output text, the cost of deploying the task, and the latency in obtaining the output. We formalize a deployment strategy in crowdsourcing along three dimensions: work structure, workforce organization, and work style. Work structure can either be simultaneous or sequential, workforce organization independent or collaborative, and work style either by humans only or by using a combination of machine and human intelligence. We implement these strategies for translation, summarization, and narrative writing tasks by designing a semi-automatic tool that uses the Amazon Mechanical Turk API and experiment with them in different input settings such as text length, number of sources, and topic popularity. We report our findings regarding the effectiveness of each strategy and provide recommendations to guide requesters in selecting the best strategy when deploying text creation tasks.

AB The prediction of translation initiation sites (TISs) in eukaryotic mRNAs has been a challenging problem in computational molecular biology. In this paper, we present a new algorithm to recognize TISs with a very high accuracy. Our algorithm includes two novel ideas. First, we introduce a class of new sequence-similarity kernels based on string editing, called edit kernels, for use with support vector machines (SVMs) in a discriminative approach to predict TISs. The edit kernels are simple and have significant biological and probabilistic interpretations. Although the edit kernels are not positive definite, it is easy to make the kernel matrix positive definite by adjusting the parameters. Second, we convert the region of an input mRNA sequence downstream to a putative TIS into an amino acid sequence before applying SVMs to avoid the high redundancy in the genetic code. The algorithm has been implemented and tested on previously published data. Our experimental results on real mRNA data show that both ideas improve the prediction accuracy greatly and that our method performs significantly better than those based on neural networks and SVMs with polynomial kernels or Salzberg kernels.

AB In the context of neural machine translation, data augmentation (DA) techniques may be used for generating additional training samples when the available parallel data are scarce. Many DA approaches aim at expanding the support of the empirical data distribution by generating new sentence pairs that contain infrequent words, thus making it closer to the true data distribution of parallel sentences. In this paper, we propose to follow a completely different approach and present a multi-task DA approach in which we generate new sentence pairs with transformations, such as reversing the order of the target sentence, which produce unfluent target sentences. During training, these augmented sentences are used as auxiliary tasks in a multi-task framework with the aim of providing new contexts where the target prefix is not informative enough to predict the next word. This strengthens the encoder and forces the decoder to pay more attention to the source representations of the encoder. Experiments carried out on six low-resource translation tasks show consistent improvements over the baseline and over DA methods aiming at extending the support of the empirical data distribution. The systems trained with our approach rely more on the source tokens, are more robust against domain shift and suffer less hallucinations.

AB Humans constantly deal with multimodal information, that is, data from different modalities, such as texts and images. In order for machines to process information similarly to humans, they must be able to process multimodal data and understand the joint relationship between these modalities. This paper describes the work performed on the VTLM (Visual Translation Language Modelling) framework from (Caglayan et al., 2021) to test its generalization ability for other language pairs and corpora. We use the multimodal and multilingual corpus How2 (Sanabria et al., 2018) in three parallel streams with aligned English-Portuguese-Visual information to investigate the effectiveness of the model for this new language pair and in more complex scenarios, where the sentence associated with each image is not a simple description of it. Our experiments on the Portuguese-English multimodal translation task using the How2 dataset demonstrate the efficacy of cross-lingual visual pretraining. We achieved a BLEU score of 51.8 and a METEOR score of 78.0 on the test set, outperforming the MMT baseline by about 14 BLEU and 14 METEOR. The good BLEU and METEOR values obtained for this new language pair, regarding the original English-German VTLM, establish the suitability of the model to other languages.

AB Text-based analysis methods enable an adversary to reveal privacy relevant author attributes such as gender, age and can identify the text's author. Such methods can compromise the privacy of an anonymous author even when the author tries to remove privacy sensitive content. In this paper, we propose an automatic method, called the Adversarial Author Attribute Anonymity Neural Translation (A(4)NT), to combat such text-based adversaries. Unlike prior works on obfuscation, we propose a system that is fully automatic and learns to perform obfuscation entirely from the data. This allows us to easily apply the A(4)NT system to obfuscate different author attributes. We propose a sequence-to-sequence language model, inspired by machine translation, and an adversarial training framework to design a system which learns to transform the input text to obfuscate the author attributes without paired data. We also propose and evaluate techniques to impose constraints on our A(4)NT model to preserve the semantics of the input text. A(4)NT learns to make minimal changes to the input to successfully fool author attribute classifiers, while preserving the meaning of the input text. Our experiments on two datasets and three settings show that the proposed method is effective in fooling the attribute classifiers and thus improves the anonymity of authors.

AB Document-level MT models are still far from satisfactory. Existing work extend translation unit from single sentence to multiple sentences. However, study shows that when we further enlarge the translation unit to a whole document, supervised training of Transformer can fail. In this paper, we find such failure is not caused by overfitting, but by sticking around local minima during training. Our analysis shows that the increased complexity of target-to-source attention is a reason for the failure. As a solution, we propose G-Transformer, introducing locality assumption as an inductive bias into Transformer, reducing the hypothesis space of the attention from target to source. Experiments show that G-Transformer converges faster and more stably than Transformer, achieving new state-of-the-art BLEU scores for both nonpretraining and pre-training settings on three benchmark datasets.

The Panlingua-KMI team conducted a series of experiments to explore both the phrase-based statistical (PBSMT) and neural methods (NMT). Among the 11 MT systems prepared under this task, 6 PBSMT systems were prepared for Nepali-Hindi, 1 PBSMT for Hindi-Nepali and 2 NMT systems were developed for Nepalis <-> Hindi. The results show that PBSMT could be an effective method for developing MT systems for closely-related languages. Our Hindi-Nepali PBSMT system was ranked 2nd among the 13 systems submitted for the pair and our Nepali-Hindi PBSMT system was ranked 4th among the 12 systems submitted for the task.

AB Translation is the process by which the genetic information contained in mRNA is used to link amino acids in a predetermined sequential order into a polypeptide chain, which then folds into a protein. Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are the adapter molecules designed to provide the "lookup" from codons to amino acids. Cryo-EM has provided evidence that the ribosome, as a molecular machine, undergoes many structural changes during translation. Recent findings show that the tRNA structure itself undergoes large conformational changes as well, and that the decoding process must be seen as a complex dynamic interplay between tRNA and the ribosome.

In the first one, we propose to use both two external resources Arabic WordNet (AWN) and WN based on term to term Machine Translation System (MTS). The second contribution consists of choosing the nearest concept for the ambiguous terms, based on more relationships with different concepts in the same local context. To evaluate the accuracy of our proposed method, several experiments have been conducted using Feature Selection methods; Chi-Square and CHIR, two machine learning techniques; the Naive Bayesian (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The obtained results illustrate that using the proposed method increases greatly the performance of our Arabic Text Categorization System.

AB In recent years, support vector machines (SVMs) have demonstrated excellent performance in a variety of pattern recognition problems. In this paper, we apply SVMs for texture classification, using translation-invariant features generated from the discrete wavelet frame transform. To alleviate the problem of selecting the right kernel parameter in the SVM, we use a fusion scheme based on multiple SVMs, each with a different setting of the kernel parameter. Compared to the traditional Bayes classifier and the learning vector quantization algorithm, SVMs, and, in particular, the fused output from multiple SVMs, produce more accurate classification results on the Brodatz texture album.

AB Classical Chinese poetry is a jewel in the treasure house of Chinese culture. Previous poem generation models only allow users to employ keywords to interfere the meaning of generated poems, leaving the dominion of generation to the model. In this paper, we propose a novel task of generating classical Chinese poems from vernacular, which allows users to have more control over the semantic of generated poems. We adapt the approach of unsupervised machine translation (UMT) to our task. We use segmentation-based padding and reinforcement learning to address under-translation and over-translation respectively. According to experiments, our approach significantly improve the perplexity and BLEU compared with typical UMT models. Furthermore, we explored guidelines on how to write the input vernacular to generate better poems. Human evaluation showed our approach can generate high-quality poems which are comparable to amateur poems.

AB Finite mixture modelling is a standard pattern recognition technique. However, in statistical machine translation (SMT), the use of mixture modelling is currently being explored. Two main advantages of the mixture approach are first, its flexibility to find an appropriate tradeoff between model complexity and the amount of training data available and second, its capability to learn specific probability distributions that better fit subsets of the training dataset. This latter advantage is even more important in SMT, since it is widely accepted that most state-of-the-art translation models proposed have limited application to restricted semantic domains. In this work, we revisit the mixture extension of the well-known M2(1) translation model. The M2 mixture model is evaluated on a word alignment large-scale task obtaining encouraging results that prove the applicability of finite mixture modelling in SMT.

We manually extracted the transliteration word/phrase pairs from the ALT corpus and applying XML markup feature of Moses decoder (i.e. -xml-input exclusive, -xml-input inclusive). We demonstrate that hybrid translation technique can significantly improve (around 6 BLEU scores) the baseline of three well-known "Phrase-based SMT", "Operation Sequence Model" and "Hierarchical Phrase-based SMT". Moreover, this simple hybrid method achieved the second highest results among the submitted MT systems for English-to-Myanmar WAT2021 translation share task according to BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and AMFM scores (Banchs et al., 2015).

AB Ancient poetry is an important part of Chinese culture. There have been projects like Jiuge to combine ancient poetry with deep learning. The language of ancient poetry is often refined, and it needs rich imagination to understand its meaning. As a result, it is difficult to automatically implement the translation. This paper makes a preliminary attempt in this aspect, based on the data set collected by ourselves, adopts deep encoder-decoder model, such as GRU, LSTM and Transformer models, to train our model. We compare the results of the three models, which have their own advantages and disadvantages. However, due to the size of the data set and the model itself, the effect is not very ideal, and still needs to be unproved.

AB The finite state machine with datapath (FSMD) models provide a formalism to represent any sequential behavior. Literature has many examples where this model has been successfully applied for behavioral verification of programs. All these methods, however, cannot handle an important class of programs, namely those involving arrays. This limitation is now overcome with finite state machine with datapath having arrays (FSMDA) models which are an extension of FSMD models; the corresponding equivalence checking algorithm has also been enhanced so that code motions of array-intensive behaviors can be validated. The new mechanism has been successfully tested with several examples.

AB This paper outlines an implemented process for fusing soft textual information with hard signal information called the Mixed Initiative Soft Fusion Implementation Testbed (MISFIT). While translation of the content of hard information sources to a machine processable semantic representation is usually feasible, the content of most unconstrained natural language textual sources can only be partially translated to a machine processable semantic representation. In response the Intelligence Processing and Analysis Branch has differentiated four alternative strategies. This paper describes the mixed initiative strategy in which "humans in the loop" address components of the process that are difficult to automate. This strategy increases potential for complex semantics to be expressed, structured and exploited with machine reasoning.

AB Confidence estimation aims to quantify the confidence of the model prediction, providing an expectation of success. A well-calibrated confidence estimate enables accurate failure prediction and proper risk measurement when given noisy samples and out-of-distribution data in real-world settings. However, this task remains a severe challenge for neural machine translation (NMT), where probabilities from softmax distribution fail to describe when the model is probably mistaken. To address this problem, we propose an unsupervised confidence estimate learning jointly with the training of the NMT model. We explain confidence as how many hints the NMT model needs to make a correct prediction, and more hints indicate low confidence. Specifically, the NMT model is given the option to ask for hints to improve translation accuracy at the cost of some slight penalty. Then, we approximate their level of confidence by counting the number of hints the model uses. We demonstrate that our learned confidence estimate achieves high accuracy on extensive sentence/word-level quality estimation tasks. Analytical results verify that our confidence estimate can correctly assess underlying risk in two real-world scenarios: (1) discovering noisy samples and (2) detecting out-of-domain data. We further propose a novel confidence-based instance-specific label smoothing approach based on our learned confidence estimate, which outperforms standard label smoothing1.

AB Clinical documents are vital resources for radiologists when they have to consult or refer while studying similar cases. In large healthcare facilities where millions of reports are generated, searching for relevant documents is quite challenging. With abundant interchangeable words in clinical domain, understanding the semantics of the words in the clinical documents is vital to improve the search results. This paper details an end to end semantic search application to address the large scale information retrieval problem of clinical reports. The paper specifically focuses on the challenge of identifying semantics in the clinical reports to facilitate search at semantic level. The semantic search works by mapping the documents into the concept space and the search is performed in the concept space. A unique approach of framing the concept mapping problem as a language translation problem is proposed in this paper. The concept mapper is modelled using the Neural machine translation model (NMT) based on encoder-decoder with attention architecture. The regular expression based concept mapper takes approximately 3 seconds to extract UMLS concepts from a single document, where as the trained NMT does the same in approximately 30 milliseconds. NMT based model further enables incorporation of negation detection to identify whether a concept is negated or not, facilitating search for negated queries.

This type of resource is valuable and essential for language processing and more particularly for machine translation systems builders. To do this, we firstly collected data from different sources such as social networks (Facebook(1) and Youtube(2)), blogs, forums and other dialectal content sources available on the web. Secondly, we performed a grammatical categorization to the extracted words from this data. Thirdly, we organized them according to an ISO international standard i.e. Lexical Markup Framework (LMF) for Natural Language Processing (NLP) lexicons. Finally, we verified their translation with multiple Arabic dictionaries. Our proposed TD to MSA lexicon provides almost 14K of clean and manually approved words.

AB The purpose of this study is to realise numerical control (NC) gear cutting on the split wheel blank of equal-base bevel gears, based on the instantaneous cutter position information in tooth surface forming and NC machining theory, the coordinate system of split equal-base bevel gears is established. According to the movement of tool centre coordinate and its transformation, the linear motion of machine tool is solved. By the rotation and translation of the tool axis vector, the solution of the rotary motion of the machine tool is obtained. According to the different rotation direction and concave-convex property of tooth surface, the calculating model of the starting point of processing of each tooth surface is deduced. The complete machining trajectory is formed by analysis and extension of the tool starting point and terminal point of machining, and the automatic generation of the NC machining program is realised. Finally, the simulation of gear cutting on the split wheel blank is carried out using VERICUT software. The experimental and tooth surface measurement results show that the mathematical model of motion trajectory is correct and the machining method is feasible.

This suggested interpretation system gives the interpreted result back to the user, speaking at an emphasized speech based on the user's age. The personalized automatic speech interpretation system performs gender recognition, age recognition, speaker distance detection, speech recognition, language identification, Google machine translation, and TTS web services. We showed the comparison of normal speech and emphasized speech by realizing a user-oriented translation system in a mobile device. A Mean Opinion Score was used for the experiment.

AB Large-scale training datasets lie at the core of the recent success of neural machine translation (NMT) models. However, the complex patterns and potential noises in the large-scale data make training NMT models difficult. In this work, we explore to identify the inactive training examples which contribute less to the model performance, and show that the existence of inactive examples depends on the data distribution. We further introduce data rejuvenation to improve the training of NMT models on large-scale datasets by exploiting inactive examples. The proposed framework consists of three phases. First, we train an identification model on the original training data, and use it to distinguish inactive examples and active examples by their sentence-level output probabilities. Then, we train a rejuvenation model on the active examples, which is used to re-label the inactive examples with forward-translation. Finally, the rejuvenated examples and the active examples are combined to train the final NMT model. Experimental results on WMT14 English-German and English-French datasets show that the proposed data rejuvenation consistently and significantly improves performance for several strong NMT models. Extensive analyses reveal that our approach stabilizes and accelerates the training process of NMT models, resulting in final models with better generalization capability. (1)

AB What can pre-trained multilingual sequence-to-sequence models like mBART contribute to translating low-resource languages? We conduct a thorough empirical experiment in 10 languages to ascertain this, considering five factors: (1) the amount of fine-tuning data, (2) the noise in the fine-tuning data, (3) the amount of pre-training data in the model, (4) the impact of domain mismatch, and (5) language typology. In addition to yielding several heuristics, the experiments form a framework for evaluating the data sensitivities of machine translation systems. While mBART is robust to domain differences, its translations for unseen and typologically distant languages remain below 3.0 BLEU. In answer to our title's question, mBART is not a low-resource panacea; we therefore encourage shifting the emphasis from new models to new data(1).

TI An expectation-maximization algorithm for query translation based on
   pseudo-relevant documents
SO INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT
AB Query translation in cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) can be done by employing dictionaries, aligned corpora, or machine translators. Scarcity of aligned corpora for various domains in many language pairs intensifies the importance of dictionary-based CLIR which motivates us to use only a bilingual dictionary and two independent collections in source and target languages for query translation. We exploit pseudo-relevant documents for a given query in the source language and pseudo-relevant documents for a translation of the query in the target language with a proposed expectation-maximization algorithm for improving query translation. The proposed method (called EM4QT) assumes that each target term either is translated from the source pseudo-relevant documents or has come from a noisy collection. Since EM4QT does not directly consider term coherency, which is defined as fluency of the target translation, we investigate a crucial question: can EM4QT be improved using either coherency-based methods or token-to-token translation ones? To address this question, we combine different translation models via simple linear interpolation and a proposed divergence minimization method. Evaluations over four CLEF collections in Persian, French, Spanish, and German indicate that EM4QT significantly outperforms competitive baselines in all the collections. Our experiments also reveal that since EM4QT indirectly considers term coherency, combining the method with coherency-based models cannot significantly improve the retrieval performance. On the other hand, investigating the query-by-query results supports the view that EM4QT usually gives a relatively high weight to one translation and its combination with the proposed token-to-token translation model, which is obtained by running EM4QT for each query term separately, soothes the effect and reaches better results for many queries. Comparing the method with a competitive word-embedding baseline reveals the superiority of the proposed model. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The inverse position model of the 4-UPS-UPU PCMM is established. The Jacobian matrix, and the expressions of velocity and acceleration are deduced. Furthermore, a numerical analysis of the inverse solutions of the position, velocity and acceleration are carried out. The results are confirmed by a virtual simulation of the 4-UPS-UPU PCMM prototype. This research has laid a solid foundation for the motion control and movement performance analysis of the 4-UPS-UPU PCMM.

TI The compilation of SL, a set-based logic language for generic parallel
   architectures
SO JOURNAL OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
AB Set-based languages have emerged as a powerful means for expressing not only programs but also requirements, test cases and so on. However, a uniform compilation schema for sets has not yet been completely developed. The present paper tries to overcome this lack using a set-based logic language, SL( set language), as target.
   The approach is based on an imperative abstract machine, the SAM( set abstract machine). The translation from SL to SAL (SAM assembly language) is described and all the possible optimizations, both at source code level and at assembly code level, are detailed. The potentials for identifying parallel flows of computations are analysed. Several examples of compilations are presented and discussed.

SO TRADUMATICA-TRADUCCIO I TECNOLOGIES DE LA INFORMACIO I LA COMUNICACIO
AB The global digital revolution, along with the demands of the current multilingual society, sketch out a scenario full of challenges for the sake of training competent citizens. From different disciplines' perspectives, such as Translation Studies, it has been researched into multilingualism, second language acquisition and digital skills throughout decades, though there are significant literature and evidence on the translation competence, which incorporates not only the capacity of communicating in several languages, but also instrumental (technological) subcompetences. This study aims at describing the needs, tools and resources used by the students of Translation and Interpreting included in the sample. In order to attain our goal, a survey has been carried out involving 110 students (local and incoming students from the Universidad Pablo de Olavide mainly, and students from the Bristol and Ulster universities as well), and its results have been compared with those of a similar survey made by Alonso among 412 professional translators in 2015. In both surveys, it could be observed the importance of lexicographic, terminological and documentary needs experienced by the subjects. Unlike professional translators, translation students found the use of mobile devices very compelling. Exhibiting a sort of a constructivist dynamics in their learning process, students usually turned to their classmates as well as to their lecturers for support and guidance. This is a worth researching tendency which can be studied more thoroughly in future projects. Automatic translation is seldom used among students and professionals. Results suggest that individuals seem to cover up their multilingual competence gaps with (technological or human) external resources.

AB This paper addresses the issue of acquiring translation rules for machine translation (MT) systems that adopt a transfer approach. These rules are semantic pattern pairs (SPPs) of source and target languages. Practical MT systems must additionally contain a huge number of SPPs corresponding to rarely-used predicates and predicate usages. Such SPPs are difficult to automatically acquire with corpus-based methods [1, 2, 10, 11]. To solve this difficulty, this paper proposes a method to acquire SPPs by using queries based on a semantic hierarchy. The proposed method asks the lexicographer for the necessary information in order to generalize the conditions of SPPs and then gradually generalizes these conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed method allows the acquisition of more plausible conditions within almost the same rime spent for manual generalization.

AB Word alignment is to estimate a lexical translation probability p(elf), or to estimate the correspondence g(e, f) where a function g outputs either 0 or 1, between a source word f and a target word e for given bilingual sentences. In practice, this formulation does not consider the existence of 'noise' (or outlier) which may cause problems depending on the corpus. N-to-m mapping objects, such as paraphrases, non-literal translations, and multi word expressions, may appear as both noise and also as valid training data. From this perspective, this paper tries to answer the following two questions: 1) how to detect stable patterns where noise seems legitimate, and 2) how to reduce such noise, where applicable, by supplying extra information as prior knowledge to a word aligner.

TI English Long Sentence Segmentation and Translation Optimization of
   Professional Literature Based on Hierarchical Network of Concepts
SO MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB The structure of English long sentences is generally complicated, with complicated logical levels, many parallel elements, many modifiers and conjunctions, and long post attributives. Moreover, pronouns in English long sentences often need to be judged according to the context. Complex English long sentences are very common in English and even run through the whole English article. The analysis results of these complex long sentences will seriously affect the quality and readability of machine translation. In this paper, HNC (hierarchical network of concepts) method is improved to realize the segmentation of long sentences, so as to simplify sentence patterns. According to the characteristics of professional literature, this paper puts forward a translation optimization method of professional literature combining HNC with statistics, which greatly improves the recognition efficiency of unknown words by extracting professional terms. The results show that the word segmentation method based on HNC and statistics proposed in this paper has achieved a good word segmentation effect in the open test environment, with an accuracy rate of 93.38% and a recall rate of 94.51%. The conclusion shows that our method can make full use of the knowledge of the source tree database, thereby improving the accuracy of the syntactic model on the target tree database.

TI Abstractive Cross-Language Summarization via Translation Model Enhanced
   Predicate Argument Structure Fusing
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Cross-language multidocument summarization is the task to generate a summary in a target language (e.g., Chinese) from a collection of documents in a different source language (e.g., English). Previous methods such as the extractive and compressive algorithms focus only on single sentence selection and compression, which cannot make full use of the similar sentences containing complementary information. Furthermore, the translation model knowledge is not fully explored in previous approaches. To address these two problems, we propose in this paper an abstractive cross-language summarization framework. First, the source language documents are translated into target language with a machine translation system. Then, the method constructs a pool of bilingual concepts and facts represented by the bilingual elements of the source-side predicate-argument structures (PAS) and their target-side counterparts. Finally, new summary sentences are produced by fusing bilingual PAS elements with the integer linear programming algorithm to maximize both of the salience and translation quality of the PAS elements. The experimental results on English-to-Chinese cross-language summarization demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art extractive systems in both automatic and manual evaluations.

AB Part of the success of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) as a specification language is due to its diagrammatic nature, Its meaning is expressed by its meta model, a combination of class diagrams and constraints written in the Object Constraint Language (OCL), a textual language of expressions. Recent efforts have tried to give a formal semantics to OCL in a classical way. In this paper, we propose a graph-based semantics for OCL and a systematic translation of OCL constraints into expressions over graph rules. Besides providing a semantical formalization of OCL, this translation can be employed to check the consistency of UML model instances wrt. the constraints, using a general purpose graph transformation machine like AGG or PROGRES. The translation of OCL constraints into graph rules suggests a way to express the constraints in a more intuitive visual form.

AB Dubbing is the art of finding a translation from a source into a target language that can be lip-synchronously revoiced, i. e., that makes the target language speech appear as if it was spoken by the very actors all along. Lip synchrony is essential for the full-fledged reception of foreign audiovisual media, such as movies and series, as violated constraints of synchrony between video (lips) and audio (speech) lead to cognitive dissonance and reduce the perceptual quality. Of course, synchrony constraints only apply to the translation when the speaker's lips are visible on screen. Therefore, deciding whether to apply synchrony constraints requires an automatic method for detecting whether an actor's lips are visible on screen for a given stretch of speech or not. In this paper, we attempt, for the first time, to classify on- from off-screen speech based on a corpus of real-world television material that has been annotated word-by-word for the visibility of talking lips on screen. We present classification experiments in which we classify individual words as on- or off-screen. We find that this task is far from trivial and that combined audio and visual features work best.

TI A Comprehensive Analysis of Bilingual Lexicon Induction
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Bilingual lexicon induction is the task of inducing word translations from monolingual corpora in two languages. In this article we present the most comprehensive analysis of bilingual lexicon induction to date. We present experiments on a wide range of languages and data sizes. We examine translation into English from 25 foreign languages: Albanian, Azeri, Bengali, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Cebuano, Gujarati, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Latvian, Nepali, Romanian, Serbian, Slovak, Somali, Spanish, Swedish, Tamil, Telugu, Turkish, Ukrainian, Uzbek, Vietnamese, and Welsh. We analyze the behavior of bilingual lexicon induction on low-frequency words, rather than testing solely on high-frequency words, as previous research has done. Low-frequency words are more relevant to statistical machine translation, where systems typically lack translations of rare words that fall outside of their training data. We systematically explore a wide range of features and phenomena that affect the quality of the translations discovered by bilingual lexicon induction. We provide illustrative examples of the highest ranking translations for orthogonal signals of translation equivalence like contextual similarity and temporal similarity. We analyze the effects of frequency and burstiness, and the sizes of the seed bilingual dictionaries and the monolingual training corpora. Additionally, we introduce a novel discriminative approach to bilingual lexicon induction. Our discriminative model is capable of combining a wide variety of features that individually provide only weak indications of translation equivalence. When feature weights are discriminatively set, these signals produce dramatically higher translation quality than previous approaches that combined signals in an unsupervised fashion (e.g., using minimum reciprocal rank). We also directly compare our model's performance against a sophisticated generative approach, the matching canonical correlation analysis (MCCA) algorithm used by Haghighi et al. (2008). Our algorithm achieves an accuracy of 42% versus MCCA's 15%.

AB During the years 1988-1991, IBM Norway developed a broad-coverage grammar for Norwegian Bokmal as part of an international corporate effort to create writing tools for all platforms and for all major language communities where IBM had business at that time. The grammar was based on IBM's own lexicon and morphology modules and a key factor of the technology was the programming language PLNLP. The main project halted in 1990 because of the world's economic crisis. However, local development continued with a view to a different application: Machine translation between Norwegian Bokmal and Nynorsk. Unfortunately, even this project did not reach a natural conclusion for economic reasons. In addition to producing linguistic results, the project showed how difficult it is to rely on one unique source of corporate funding for a comprehensive long-term project. It also showed how a national subsidiary of an international corporation could not count on local public support.

We evaluate the performance of a naive configuration of our hypervisor on a real embedded hardware platform and propose techniques to reduce DBT-based overhead. We analyse the impact of our optimisations using both micro-benchmarks and real applications. While the naive version of our hypervisor can get several times slower than native, our optimisations bring down the run-time overhead of real applications to at most 16%. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB HQEMU is a multi-threaded and retargetable dynamic binary translator built on top of QEMU and LLVM. It combines the fast and reliable code translation in the TCG (Tiny Code Generator) of QEMU and the rich optimizations in LLVM to achieve high performance for both short running and long running applications. One weakness of HQEMU lies in the lack of efficient SIMD instruction translation. This work investigates on how to remedy that. Two approaches have been designed and tested. One simple approach is to modify the help function to emit LLVM vector IR, and a more complete approach is to add a newly introduced vector IR in the TCG phase. Although both approaches can exploit the SIMD instructions of the host machine, the second and more complete approach has superior runtime as well as compile time advantages.

AB Resolving cases of multiple parsing is one of the biggest problems in Machine Aided Translation (MA T) systems. Producing an unambiguous parse is a major challenge for the parsers developed for Indian Languages. The paper discusses a Data Mining based approach for development of Vector Charts that could be used for resolving multiple Parses and noun-verb attachment problems for correct translation of Indian Languages. In this approach using the text corpus, a vibhakti-chart (or subcategorization frames) is obtained This vibhakti-chart plays a pivotal role in defining Association Rules that could be used more effectively for multiple parse disambiguation. The vibhakti-chart can be used further for finding agreement rules for verb and noun-groups with proper vibhaktis, for finding how many noun-groups have ambiguous grouping with or without vibhakti-charts, and also to know whether verbs obtained be grouped into classes. An Indian language text corpus has been used for the work. It is a collection of more than 250 stories, and the total size is about 100000 words. Anusaaraka (A language follower) has been used to perform morphological analysis of given corpus, and to obtain vibhaktis of noun. In the process, several filters had been developedfor necessary data cleaning.

AB Document-level machine translation manages to outperform sentence level models by a small margin, but have failed to be widely adopted. We argue that previous research did not make a clear use of the global context, and propose a new document-level NMT framework that deliberately models the local context of each sentence with the awareness of the global context of the document in both source and target languages. We specifically design the model to be able to deal with documents containing any number of sentences, including single sentences. This unified approach allows our model to be trained elegantly on standard datasets without needing to train on sentence and document level data separately. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms Transformer baselines and previous document-level NMT models with substantial margins of up to 2.1 BLEU on state-of-the-art baselines. We also provide analyses which show the benefit of context far beyond the neighboring two or three sentences, which previous studies have typically incorporated.

   PROCESSING
AB Grapheme-to-phoneme models are key components in automatic speech recognition and text-to-speech systems. With low-resource language pairs that do not have available and well-developed pronunciation lexicons, grapheme-to-phoneme models are particularly useful. These models are based on initial alignments between grapheme source and phoneme target sequences. Inspired by sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural network-based translation methods, the current research presents an approach that applies an alignment representation for input sequences and pretrained source and target embeddings to overcome the transliteration problem for a low-resource languages pair. Evaluation and experiments involving French and Vietnamese showed that with only a small bilingual pronunciation dictionary available for training the transliteration models, promising results were obtained with a large increase in BLEU scores and a reduction in Translation Error Rate (TER) and Phoneme Error Rate (PER). Moreover, we compared our proposed neural network-based transliteration approach with a statistical one.

Unlike existing systems which only change color or texture pattern of a particular type of food in an inflexible manner, our system changes the appearance of food into multiple types of food in real-time flexibly, dynamically and interactively in accordance with the deformation of the food that the user is actually eating by using GAN-based image-to image translation. The experimental results reveal that our system successfully manipulates gustatory sensations to some extent and that the effectiveness depends on the original and target types of food as well as each user's food experience.

AB The past year has witnessed rapid advances in sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) modeling for Machine Translation (MT). The classic RNN-based approaches to MT were first out-performed by the convolutional seq2seq model, which was then outperformed by the more recent Transformer model. Each of these new approaches consists of a fundamental architecture accompanied by a set of modeling and training techniques that are in principle applicable to other seq2seq architectures. In this paper, we tease apart the new architectures and their accompanying techniques in two ways. First, we identify several key modeling and training techniques, and apply them to the RNN architecture, yielding a new RNMT+ model that outperforms all of the three fundamental architectures on the benchmark WMT'14 English -> French and English -> German tasks. Second, we analyze the properties of each fundamental seq2seq architecture and devise new hybrid architectures intended to combine their strengths. Our hybrid models obtain further improvements, outperforming the RNMT+ model on both benchmark datasets.

AB In this paper we tackle a unique and important problem of extracting a structured order from the conversation a customer has with an order taker at a restaurant. This is motivated by an actual system under development to assist in the order taking process. We develop a sequence-to-sequence model that is able to map from unstructured conversational input to the structured form that is conveyed to the kitchen and appears on the customer receipt. This problem is critically different from other tasks like machine translation where sequence-to-sequence models have been used: the input includes two sides of a conversation; the output is highly structured; and logical manipulations must be performed, for example when the customer changes his mind while ordering. We present a novel sequence-to-sequence model that incorporates a special attention-memory gating mechanism and conversational role markers. The proposed model improves performance over both a phrase-based machine translation approach and a standard sequence-to-sequence model.

AB In a machine translation system from one language to Chinese, it is difficult to decide whether there is a structural particle "DE" between the "DingYu" and the "ZhongXinCi". The DingYu is a term in Chinese grammar which resembles the modifier and the attributive words or phrases in English or Japanese, but not the same. The ZhongXinCi is refered to the word modified by DingYu. Nowadays a practical Japanese-Chinese machine translation system based on translation rules has been implemented. However, the current system lacks the ability for resolving the problem mentioned above. To resolve this problem, this paper presents an algorithm for determining DingYu structural particle using the grammar knowledge and statidtical information. We first collect a large number of grammar items from Chinese grammar books, and obtain some elementary judgment rules by classifying and inducing the collected grammar items. Then we put these judgment rules into use in actual Chinese language, and modify the rules by checking their results instantly. Lastly we check and modify the rules by using the statistical information from a actual corpus. An experiment system based on the proposed algorithm has been constructed and an experiment is carried out. The result shows the effectiveness of the presented method.

TI Deep learning and its applications to machine health monitoring
SO MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB Since 2006, deep learning (DL) has become a rapidly growing research direction, redefining state-of-the-art performances in a wide range of areas such as object recognition, image segmentation, speech recognition and machine translation. In modern manufacturing systems, data-driven machine health monitoring is gaining in popularity due to the widespread deployment of low-cost sensors and their connection to the Internet. Meanwhile, deep learning provides useful tools for processing and analyzing these big machinery data. The main purpose of this paper is to review and summarize the emerging research work of deep learning on machine health monitoring. After the brief introduction of deep learning techniques, the applications of deep learning in machine health monitoring systems are reviewed mainly from the following aspects: Auto-encoder (AE) and its variants, Restricted Boltzmann Machines and its variants including Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). In addition, an experimental study on the performances of these approaches has been conducted, in which the data and code have been online. Finally, some new trends of DL-based machine health monitoring methods are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We describe a scheme to translate spoken English lectures into Japanese consisting of a deep neural network based English automatic speech recognition system (ASR) and an English to Japanese phrase-based statistical machine translation system (SMT). The bad influence of speech misrecognition for the translation model is focused. For coping with bad influence caused by speech misrecognition, we utilized the actual misrecognition results as a parallel corpus. We prepared four ASR systems. Pairs of the results including speech misrecognition and the correct translation into target language are added to an original parallel corpus. When the sentences including misrecognition were added to an original corpus, the baseline model was improved. Next, we prepared speech misrecognition results by using a simulated ASR system. This method also improved the baseline system by about 2.0 BLEU as well as actual ASR systems.
   Finally, we investigated the effectiveness of optimal selection from multiple candidates / outputs by rescoring based on language models. We found that the performance was improved further by 2.0 similar to 3.0 BLEU, if we can select the optimal candidate.

TI Attention-based encoder-decoder model for answer selection in question
   answering
SO FRONTIERS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING
AB One of the key challenges for question answering is to bridge the lexical gap between questions and answers because there may not be any matching word between them. Machine translation models have been shown to boost the performance of solving the lexical gap problem between question-answer pairs. In this paper, we introduce an attention-based deep learning model to address the answer selection task for question answering. The proposed model employs a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) encoder-decoder, which has been demonstrated to be effective on machine translation tasks to bridge the lexical gap between questions and answers. Our model also uses a step attention mechanism which allows the question to focus on a certain part of the candidate answer. Finally, we evaluate our model using a benchmark dataset and the results show that our approach outperforms the existing approaches. Integrating our model significantly improves the performance of our question answering system in the TREC 2015 LiveQA task.

AB Lambda mu-calculus was introduced as a Bohm-complete extension of Parigot's lambda mu-calculus. Lambda mu-calculus, contrarily to Parigot's calculus, is a calculus of CBN delimited control as evidenced by Herbelin and Chilezan. In their seminal paper on (CBV) delimited control, Danvy and Filinski introduced the CPS Hierarchy of control operators (shift(i)/reset(i))(i is an element of omega) In a similar way, we introduce in the present paper the Stream Hierarchy, a hierarchy of calculi extending and generalizing Lambda mu-calculus. The (Lambda(n))(n is an element of E)-calculi have Church-Rosser and Bohm theorems. We then present sound and complete CPS translations for the hierarchy. Next, we investigate the operational content of the hierarchy through its abstract machines, the (Lambda(n))(n is an element of omega)-KAM. Finally, we establish that the Stream hierarchy is indeed a CM analogue to the CPS hierarchy.

Learning to extract these types of data is called Named Entity Recognition (NER) task. Proper named entity recognition and extraction is important to solve most problems in hot research area such as Question Answering and Summarization Systems, Information Retrieval and Information Extraction, Machine Translation, Video Annotation, Semantic Web Search and Bioinformatics. In this paper we have improved the precision in NER from text using the new proposed method that calls FSVM. In our method we have employed Support Vector Machine as one of the best machine learning algorithm for classification and contribute a new fuzzy membership function thus removing the Support Vector Machine's weakness points in NER precision and multi classification. The design of our method is a kind of One-Against-All multi classification technique to solve the traditional binary classifier in SVM.

TI Comparative study on corpora for speech translation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB This paper investigates issues in preparing corpora for developing speech-to-speech translation (S2ST). It is impractical to create a broad-coverage parallel corpus only from dialog speech. An alternative approach is to have bilingual experts write conversational-style texts in the target domain, with translations. There is, however, a risk of losing fidelity to the actual utterances. This paper focuses on balancing a tradeoff between these two kinds of corpora through the analysis of two newly developed corpora in the travel domain: a bilingual parallel corpus with 420 K utterances and a collection of in-domain dialogs using actual S2ST systems. We found that the first corpus is effective for covering utterances in the second corpus if complimented with a small number of utterances taken from monolingual dialogs. We also found that characteristics of in-domain utterances become closer to those of the first corpus when more restrictive conditions and instructions to speakers are given. These results suggest the possibility of a bootstrap-style of development of corpora and S2ST systems, where an initial S2ST system is developed with parallel texts, and is then gradually improved with in-domain utterances collected by the system as restrictions are relaxed.

AB Non-autoregressive translation (NAT) has become a hot direction for its acceleration on decoding. Conditional masked language model (CMLM) performs excellently in NAT models. We review and extend the CMLM in some strategy: (1) N-gram mask strategy, which can help model to learn coarse sematic information of target language; (2) top-k decoding strategy, our model generates the top-k probability words in each step so that it can generate the final sentence in constant number steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is progressive compared with CMLM and some other NAT models. Specially, on the dataset WMT 14 EN-DE, our approach can achieve 27.24 BLEU score with only 0.1 BLEU sacrifice compared with the autoregressive counterpart base Transformer while speeding up 3 times on decoding.

AB Most machine translation systems generate text autoregressively from left to right. We, instead, use a masked language modeling objective to train a model to predict any subset of the target words, conditioned on both the input text and a partially masked target translation. This approach allows for efficient iterative decoding, where we first predict all of the target words non-autoregressively, and then repeatedly mask out and regenerate the subset of words that the model is least confident about. By applying this strategy for a constant number of iterations, our model improves state-of-the-art performance levels for non-autoregressive and parallel decoding translation models by over 4 BLEU on average. It is also able to reach within about 1 BLEU point of a typical left-to-right transformer model, while decoding significantly faster.(1)

TI Which Apple Keeps Which Doctor Away? Colorful Word Representations With

SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Recent pre-trained language models (PrLMs) offer a new performant method of contextualized word representations by leveraging the sequence-level context for modeling. Although the PrLMs generally provide more effective contextualized word representations than non-contextualized models, they are still subject to a sequence of text contexts without diverse hints from multimodality. This paper thus proposes a visual representation method to explicitly enhance conventional word embedding with multiple-aspect senses from visual guidance. In detail, we build a small-scale word-image dictionary from a multimodal seed dataset where each word corresponds to diverse related images. Experiments on 12 natural language understanding and machine translation tasks further verify the effectiveness and the generalization capability of the proposed approach. Analysis shows that our method with visual guidance pays more attention to content words, improves the representation diversity, and is potentially beneficial for enhancing the accuracy of disambiguation.

AB Sarcasm is a form of speech in which speakers say the opposite of what they truly mean in order to convey a strong sentiment. In other words, "Sarcasm is the giant chasm between what I say, and the person who doesn't get it.". In this paper we present the novel task of sarcasm interpretation, defined as the generation of a non-sarcastic utterance conveying the same message as the original sarcastic one. We introduce a novel dataset of 3000 sarcastic tweets, each interpreted by five human judges. Addressing the task as monolingual machine translation (MT), we experiment with MT algorithms and evaluation measures. We then present SIGN: an MT based sarcasm interpretation algorithm that targets sentiment words, a defining element of textual sarcasm. We show that while the scores of n-gram based automatic measures are similar for all interpretation models, SIGN's interpretations are scored higher by humans for adequacy and sentiment polarity. We conclude with a discussion on future research directions for our new task.(1)

AB The paper discusses a prototype module for:on-line checking of term consistency in a workbench for knowledge-based Machine Aided Human Translation (MAHT). We present the linguistic resources and the knowledge base (KB) of the system as well as their place in the processes.,To discover missing or misleading translations, the checker relies on the lexicon information and the hierarchy in the KB. To detect comprehension difficulties, the module checks ambiguities in the target text by resolving anaphora. The module design is based on the assumption that in aligned parallel texts some types of difficulties to resolve anaphora could be used to find wrong, missing and/or cognitively difficult translations.,The paper explains the algorithms for checking term consistency. an evaluation of the approach and prospects for further work conclude the paper.

AB Natural language is a promising alternative interface to DBMSs because it enables non-technical users to formulate complex questions in a more concise manner than SQL. Recently, deep learning has gained traction for translating natural language to SQL, since similar ideas have been successful in the related domain of machine translation. However, the core problem with existing deep learning approaches is that they require an enormous amount of training data in order to provide accurate translations. This training data is extremely expensive to curate, since it generally requires humans to manually annotate natural language examples with the corresponding SQL queries (or vice versa).
   Based on these observations, we propose DBPal, a new approach that augments existing deep learning techniques in order to improve the performance of models for natural language to SQL translation. More specifically, we present a novel training pipeline that automatically generates synthetic training data in order to (1) improve overall translation accuracy, (2) increase robustness to linguistic variation, and (3) specialize the model for the target database. As we show, our DBPal training pipeline is able to improve both the accuracy and linguistic robustness of state-of-the-art natural language to SQL translation models.

AB Speech-to-text translation (ST) refers to transforming the audio in source language to the text in target language. Mainstream solutions for such tasks are to cascade automatic speech recognition with machine translation, for which the transcriptions of the source language are needed in training. End-to-end approaches for ST tasks have been investigated because of not only technical interests such as to achieve globally optimized solution, but the need for ST tasks for the many source languages worldwide which do not have written form. In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end ST framework with two decoders to handle the relatively deeper relationships between the source language audio and target language text. The first-pass decoder generates some useful latent representations, and the second-pass decoder then integrates the output of both the encoder and the first-pass decoder to generate the text translation in target language. Only paired source language audio and target language text are used in training. Preliminary experiments on several language pairs showed improved performance, and offered some initial analysis.

TI Mitoribosomal regulation of OXPHOS biogenesis in plants
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB The ribosome filter hypothesis posits that ribosomes are not simple non-selective translation machines but may also function as regulatory elements in protein synthesis. Recent data supporting ribosomal filtering come from plant mitochondria where it has been shown that translation of mitochondrial transcripts encoding components of oxidative phosphorylation complexes (OXPHOS) and of mitoribosomes can be differentially affected by alterations in mitoribosomes. The biogenesis of mitoribosome was perturbed by silencing of a gene encoding a small-subunit protein of the mitoribosome in Arabidopsis thaliana. As a consequence, the mitochondrial OXPHOS and ribosomal transcripts were both upregulated, but only the ribosomal proteins were oversynthesized, while the OXPHOS subunits were actually depleted. This finding implies that the heterogeneity of plant mitoribosomes found in vivo could contribute to the functional selectivity of translation under distinct conditions. Furthermore, global analysis indicates that biogenesis of OXPHOS complexes in plants can be regulated at different levels of mitochondrial and nuclear gene expression, however, the ultimate coordination of genome expression occurs at the complex assembly level.

TI Recommendations for machine learning benchmarks in neuroimaging
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB The field of neuroimaging has embraced methods from machine learning in a variety of ways. Although an increasing number of initiatives have published open-access neuroimaging datasets, specifically designed benchmarks are rare in the field. In this article, we first describe how benchmarks in computer science and biomedical imaging have fostered methodological progress in machine learning. Second, we identify the special characteristics of neuroimaging data and outline what researchers have to ensure when establishing a neuroimaging benchmark, how datasets should be composed and how adequate evaluation criteria can be chosen. Based on lessons learned from machine learning benchmarks, we argue for an extended evaluation procedure that, next to applying suitable performance metrics, focuses on scientifically relevant aspects such as explainability, robustness, uncertainty, computational efficiency and code quality. Lastly, we envision a collaborative neuroimaging benchmarking platform that combines the discussed aspects in a collaborative and agile framework, allowing researchers across disciplines to work together on the key predictive problems of the field of neuroimaging and psychiatry.

AB Transformer, based on the encoder-decoder framework, has achieved state-of-the-art performance on several natural language generation tasks. The encoder maps the words in the input sentence into a sequence of hidden states, which are then fed into the decoder to generate the output sentence. These hidden states usually correspond to the input words and focus on capturing local information. However, the global (sentence level) information is seldom explored, leaving room for the improvement of generation quality. In this paper, we propose a novel global representation enhanced Transformer (GRET) to explicitly model global representation in the Transformer network. Specifically, in the proposed model, an external state is generated for the global representation from the encoder. The global representation is then fused into the decoder during the decoding process to improve generation quality. We conduct experiments in two text generation tasks: machine translation and text summarization. Experimental results on four WMT machine translation tasks and LCSTS text summarization task demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on natural language generation(1).

TI Towards the use of entropy as a measure for the reliability of automatic
   MT evaluation metrics
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
AB The study describes an experiment with different estimations of reliability. Reliability reflects the technical quality of the measurement procedure such as an automatic evaluation of Machine Translation (MT). Reliability is an indicator of accuracy, the reliability of measuring, in our case, measuring the accuracy and error rate of MT output based on automatic metrics (precision, recall, f-measure, Bleu-n, WER, PER, and CDER). The experiment showed metrics (Bleu-4 and WER) that reduce the overall reliability of the automatic evaluation of accuracy and error rate using entropy. Based on the results we can say, that the use of entropy for the estimation of reliability brings more accurate results than conventional estimations of reliability (Cronbach's alpha and correlation). MT evaluation, based on n-grams or edit distance, using entropy could offer a new view on lexicon-based metrics in comparison to commonly used ones.

AB Accurate prediction of translation initiation sites (TISs) is important for the annotation of genomes. Although many methods have been proposed to solve this problem, the prediction accuracy is still limited. In this paper, the features that have been widely used for predicting TISs are further analyzed, and it is found that some features of TISs and non-TISs are heavily dependent on the C+G content of sequences around AUG codons, and some features are quite different for non-TISs located in untranslated regions and coding regions considering different reading frames. Further, the strategy of using multiple support vector machines to fully make use of the information is proposed, and a new program TISKey for the prediction of TISs is developed Testing results on widely used dataset demonstrate that TISKey could get better prediction accuracy. TISKey can be accessed at http://infosci.hust.edu.cn.

AB Domain Adaptation (DA) of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model often relies on a pretrained general NMT model which is adapted to the new domain on a sample of in-domain parallel data. Without parallel data, there is no way to estimate the potential benefit of DA, nor the amount of parallel samples it would require. It is however a desirable functionality that could help MT practitioners to make an informed decision before investing resources in dataset creation. We propose a Domain adaptation Learning Curve prediction (DaLC) model that predicts prospective DA performance based on in-domain monolingual samples in the source language. Our model relies on the NMT encoder representations combined with various instance and corpus-level features. We demonstrate that instance-level is better able to distinguish between different domains compared to corpus-level frameworks proposed in previous studies (Xia et al., 2020; Kolachina et al., 2012). Finally, we perform indepth analyses of the results highlighting the limitations of our approach, and provide directions for future research.

TI Gesture Recognition of Sign Language Alphabet Using a Magnetic
   Positioning System
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Hand gesture recognition is a crucial task for the automated translation of sign language, which enables communication for the deaf. This work proposes the usage of a magnetic positioning system for recognizing the static gestures associated with the sign language alphabet. In particular, a magnetic positioning system, which is comprised of several wearable transmitting nodes, measures the 3D position and orientation of the fingers within an operating volume of about 30 x 30 x 30 cm, where receiving nodes are placed at known positions. Measured position data are then processed by a machine learning classification algorithm. The proposed system and classification method are validated by experimental tests. Results show that the proposed approach has good generalization properties and provides a classification accuracy of approximately 97% on 24 alphabet letters. Thus, the feasibility of the proposed gesture recognition system for the task of automated translation of the sign language alphabet for fingerspelling is proven.

AB In this paper, we investigate paraphrase generation in the colloquial domain. We use state-of-the-art neural machine translation models trained on the Opusparcus corpus to generate paraphrases in six languages: German, English, Finnish, French, Russian, and Swedish. We perform experiments to understand how data selection and filtering for diverse paraphrase pairs affects the generated paraphrases. We compare two different model architectures, an RNN and a Transformer model, and find that the Transformer does not generally outperform the RNN. We also conduct human evaluation on five of the six languages and compare the results to the automatic evaluation metrics BLEU and the recently proposed BERTScore. The results advance our understanding of the trade-offs between the quality and novelty of generated paraphrases, affected by the data selection method. In addition, our comparison of the evaluation methods shows that while BLEU correlates well with human judgments at the corpus level, BERTScore outperforms BLEU in both corpus and sentence-level evaluation.

CL ROME, ITALY
AB We are interested in defining and querying views in a huge and highly heterogeneous XML repository (Web scale). In this context, view definitions are very large, involving lots of sources, and there is no apparent limitation to their size. This raises interesting problems that we address in the paper: (i) how to distribute views over several machines without having a negative impact on the query translation process; (ii) how to quickly select the relevant part of a view given a query; (iii) how to minimize the cost of communicating potentially large queries to the machines where they will be evaluated. The solution that we propose is based on a simple view definition language that allows for automatic generation of views. The language maps paths in the view abstract DTD to paths in the concrete source DTDs. It enables a distributed implementation of the view system that is scalable both in terms of data and load. In particular, the query translation algorithm is shown to have a good (linear) complexity.

AB Diachronic lexical information was mostly used in its natural field, historical linguistics, until recently, when promising but not yet conclusive applications to low resource languages machine translation started extending its usage to NLP. There is therefore a new need for fine-grained, large-coverage and accurate etymological lexical resources. In this paper, we propose a set of guidelines to generate such resources, for each step of the life-cycle of an etymological lexicon: creation, update, evaluation, dissemination, and exploitation. To illustrate the guidelines, we introduce EtymDB 2.0, an etymological database automatically generated from the Wiktionary, which contains 1.8 million lexemes, linked by more than 700,000 fine-grained etymological relations, across 2,536 living and dead languages. We also introduce use cases for which EtymDB 2.0 could represent a key resource, such as phylogenetic tree generation, low resource machine translation and medieval languages study.

AB With building information modeling becoming mature, this technology provides several new possibilities for improving the checking processes of the design planning regarding the applicable codes in the construction industry. Code compliance checks are essential since they standardize the functions a building must fulfill finally. Currently, these controls are cumbersome and error-prone and performed to a large extent manual by the planning consultants as well as authority officers. To enable an automation, the contents of the applicable guidelines have to be translated into a digital format, which can be read, interpreted and applied by machines. Various approaches focused on a textual or hard-coded translation of the guidelines. To increase the involvement of non-programming users, we introduced the visual code checking language, which uses a visual notation to represent the content of directives machine-as well as human-readable. In the presented paper, the authors present a refinement of the VCCL to increase the coverage rate of the translation capabilities.

AB One of the major challenges in the process of machine translation is word sense disambiguation (WSD), which is defined as choosing the correct meaning of a multi meaning word. Supervised learning methods are usually used to solve this problem. The disambiguation task is carried out using the statistics of the translated documents (as training data) or dual corpora of source and target languages. In this paper we present a supervised learning method for WSD, which is based on K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. As the first step, we extract two sets of features; the set of words that have occurred frequently in the text and the set of words surrounding the ambiguous word. In order to improve the classification accuracy, we propose a feature weighting strategy. We will present the results of evaluating the proposed schemes and illustrate the effect of weighting strategies proposed. The results are encouraging comparing to state of the art.

AB In this article, we are studying the differences between the European languages using statistical and unsupervised methods. The analysis is conducted in different levels of language, lexical, morphological and syntactic. Our premise is that the difficulty of the translation could be perceived as differences or similarities in different levels of language. The results are compared to linguistic groupings. The analyses of this paper are based on the concept of Kolmogorov complexity, which is used to compare the language structure in syntactic and morphological levels. The way the languages convey information in these levels is taken as a measure of similarity or dissimilarity between languages and the results are compared to classical linguistic classification. The results will serve as a tool in developing machine translation system(s), e.g., in the following way: if source language conveys more information in the morphological level and the target language more in the syntactic level, it is clear that the (machine) translator must be able to transfer the information from one level to another.

TI Empirical studies on the impact of lexical resources on CLIR performance
SO INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT
AB In this paper, we compile and review several experiments measuring cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) performance as a function of the following resources: bilingual term lists, parallel corpora, machine translation (MT), and stemmers. Our CUR system uses a simple probabilistic language model; the studies used TREC test corpora over Chinese. Spanish and Arabic. Our findings include:
   One can achieve an acceptable CLIR performance using only a bilingual term list (70-80% on Chinese and Arabic corpora).
   However, if a bilingual term list and parallel corpora are available, CLIR performance can rival monolingual performance.
   If no parallel corpus is available, pseudo-parallel texts produced by an MT system can partially overcome the lack of parallel text.
   While stemming is useful normally, with a very large parallel corpus for Arabic-English, stemming hurt performance in our empirical studies with Arabic, a highly inflected language. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Numerous methods have been developed for generating a machine translation (MT) bilingual dictionary from a parallel text corpus. Such methods extract bilingual collocations from sentence pairs of source and target language sentences. Then those collocations are registered in an MT bilingual dictionary. Bilingual collocations are lexically corresponding pairs of parts extracted from sentence pairs. This paper describes a new method for automatic extraction of bilingual collocations from a parallel text corpus using no linguistic knowledge. We use Recursive Chain-link-type Learning (RCL), which is a learning algorithm, to extract bilingual collocations. Our method offers two main advantages. One benefit is that this RCL system requires no linguistic knowledge. The other advantage is that it can extract many bilingual collocations, even if the frequency of appearance of the bilingual collocations is very low. Experimental results verify that our system extracts bilingual collocations efficiently. The extraction rate of bilingual collocations was 74.9% for all bilingual collocations that corresponded to nouns in the parallel corpus.

AB Tofind correctness of the grammatical structure of a natural language sentence, unambiguous parse is the basic requirement. Therefore, Parsing of the source language plays a key role for reliable machine translation. In this paper a language oriented parsing algorithm is presented for Urdu language sentences by initiating tagging only for morphologically closed classes of words like postpositions, conjunctions, verb morphemes, etc. By utilizing linguistics features of these closed classes neighbor words are collected into chunks' The chunks are formed by applying grammar rules in order through ordered context free grammar. Finally, full parsing on chunks is achieved which have much lesser search space. The functional structures are unified throughout the process of chunking and parsing to support the correctness of parsing. It is found that use of closed classes ahead of open classes and chunking process reduces the number of grammar rules and enhances the reliability of final parse.

AB The multi-head attention mechanism, which has been successfully applied in, e.g., machine translation and ASR, was also found to be a promising approach for temporal modeling in speech enhancement DNNs. Since speech enhancement can be expected to take less profit from long-term temporal context than machine translation or ASR, we propose to employ self-attention with modified context access. We first show that a restriction of the employed temporal context in the self-attention layers of a CNN-based network architecture is crucial for good speech enhancement performance. Furthermore, we propose to combine restricted attention with a subsampled attention variant that considers long-term context with a lower temporal resolution, which helps to effectively consider both long- and short-term context. We show that our proposed attention-based network outperforms similar networks using RNNs for temporal modeling as well as a strong reference method using unrestricted attention.

AB There has been recent success in pre-training on monolingual data and fine-tuning on Machine Translation (MT), but it remains unclear how to best leverage a pre-trained model for a given MT task. This paper investigates the benefits and drawbacks of freezing parameters, and adding new ones, when fine-tuning a pre-trained model on MT. We focus on 1) Fine-tuning a model trained only on English monolingual data, BART. 2) Fine-tuning a model trained on monolingual data from 25 languages, mBART. For BART we get the best performance by freezing most of the model parameters, and adding extra positional embeddings. For mBART we match or outperform the performance of naive fine-tuning for most language pairs with the encoder, and most of the decoder, frozen. The encoder-decoder attention parameters are most important to fine-tune. When constraining ourselves to an out-of-domain training set for Vietnamese to English we see the largest improvements over the fine-tuning baseline.

AB Machine translation systems have various problems although they have been developed continuously. Especially, in Korean-English translation system, zero pronoun problem is an important problem, since omitted subject or object Korean are must be restored in English. In order to solve this problem, various methods have been proposed In this paper, we focus on the gender determination problem in Korean names as a first-step for solving a zero pronoun problem in Korean. Since this problem can be viewed as a binary classification problem, we adopt support vector machines which are well-known for solving binary classification. The bag-of-words model is used to represent a name with context as a vector and information entropy of words is adopted for selecting features. An evaluation of the proposed method shows about 86% of accuracy. This method achieves higher accuracy than baseline which determines the gender of a name by its majority and additionally resolves the limitation of memory based and statistical method which use only names.

AB The cumulative effort over the past few decades that have gone into developing linguistic resources for tasks ranging from machine readable dictionaries to translation systems is enormous. Such effort is prohibitively expensive for languages outside the (largely) European family. The possibility of building such resources automatically by accessing electronic corpora of such languages are therefore of great interest to those involved in studying these 'new' - 'lesser known' languages. The main stumbling block to applying these data driven techniques directly is that most of them require large corpora rarely available for such 'new' languages. This paper describes an attempt at setting up a bootstrapping agenda to exploit the scarce corpus resources that may be available at the outset to a researcher concerned with such languages. In particular it reports on results of an experiment to use state-of-the-art data-driven techniques for building linguistic resources for Sinhala - a non-European language with virtually no electronic resources.

AB Most dominant neural machine translation (NMT) models are restricted to make predictions only according to the local context of preceding words in a left-to-right manner. Although many previous studies try to incorporate global information into NMT models, there still exist limitations on how to effectively exploit bidirectional global context. In this paper, we propose a Confidence Based Bidirectional Global Context Aware (CB-BGCA) training framework for NMT, where the NMT model is jointly trained with an auxiliary conditional masked language model (CMLM). The training consists of two stages: (1) multi-task joint training; (2) confidence based knowledge distillation. At the first stage, by sharing encoder parameters, the NMT model is additionally supervised by the signal from the CMLM decoder that contains bidirectional global contexts. Moreover, at the second stage, using the CMLM as teacher, we further pertinently incorporate bidirectional global context to the NMT model on its unconfidently-predicted target words via knowledge distillation. Experimental results show that our proposed CB-BGCA training framework significantly improves the NMT model by +1.02, +1.30 and +0.57 BLEU scores on three large-scale translation datasets, namely WMT'14 English-to-German, WMT'19 Chinese-to-English and WMT'14 English-to-French, respectively.

TI MuST-C: A multilingual corpus for end-to-end speech translation
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB End-to-end spoken language translation (SLT) has recently gained popularity thanks to the advancement of sequence to sequence learning in its two parent tasks: automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT). However, research in the field has to confront with the scarcity of publicly available corpora to train data-hungry neural networks. Indeed, while traditional cascade solutions can build on sizable ASR and MT training data for a variety of languages, the available SLT corpora suitable for end-to-end training are few, typically small and of limited language coverage. We contribute to fill this gap by presenting MuST-C, a large and freely available Multilingual Speech Translation Corpus built from English TED Talks. Its unique features include: i) language coverage and diversity (from English into 14 languages from different families), ii) size (at least 237 hours of transcribed recordings per language, 430 on average), iii) variety of topics and speakers, and iv) data quality. Besides describing the corpus creation methodology and discussing the outcomes of empirical and manual quality evaluations, we present baseline results computed with strong systems on each language direction covered by MuST-C.

TI x86-Android performance improvement for x86 smart mobile devices
SO CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB With more and more smartphones with Intel inside available, the compatibility issues of Android applications have been rising. The efficiency on the emulated architecture is best translated into efficiency on the target machine if target instructions also operated on register operands. However, conventional binary translators of popular binary translators do not take into account instruction dependency among two or more basic blocks. This results in performance degradation because of intertranslation block dependency. Actually, x86 binary translators do not take into account instruction dependency within a basic block. Binary translation makes use of one or two registers for the majority of translation blocks. This is because the translation block corresponds to a guest instruction, which in turn the amount of work is not large. Even though there are no dependencies between translation blocks, false dependencies are generated by the same register usage order. In order to maximize the parallelism within a basic block, we maintain two different register usage orders, applying them in turn. This approach resolves the problem and outperforms conventional approach by up to around 27% for some cases. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This article proposes a hybrid analytical modeling procedure for the performance parameter estimation of synchronous reluctance machine, including its operation in the region of magnetic saturation. The proposed model better estimated the torque profile through improved translation and stepped transition of rotor flux barriers. The non-linear operation is simulated by considering the global saturation and estimating the machine's operating point on the magnetization curve of the core material. The procedure formulation focuses on improving the accuracy and rapidness of the iterative design process. The obtained results are validated against an already established design analysis technique, finite-element analysis, and the frequency spectrum analysis of practical machine results. With the improved accuracy and the least requirement of simulation runtime and computational resources, the modeling procedure can be utilized as an initial design iteration tool.

AB High-performing machine translation (MT) systems can help overcome language barriers while making it possible for everyone to communicate and use language technologies in the language of their choice. However, such systems require large amounts of parallel sentences for training, and translators can be difficult to find and expensive. Here, we present a data collection strategy for MT which, in contrast, is cheap and simple, as it does not require bilingual speakers. Based on the insight that humans pay specific attention to movements, we use graphics interchange formats (GIFs) as a pivot to collect parallel sentences from monolingual annotators. We use our strategy to collect data in Hindi, Tamil and English. As a baseline, we also collect data using images as a pivot. We perform an intrinsic evaluation by manually evaluating a subset of the sentence pairs and an extrinsic evaluation by finetuning mBART (Liu et al., 2020) on the collected data. We find that sentences collected via GIFs are indeed of higher quality.

AB This paper examines the agreement and word-order tackling in Arabic MT systems. The paper represents an English to Arabic approach for translating well-structured English sentences into well-structured Arabic sentences using a new rules to handle the problems of ordering and agreement. The methodology is flexible and scalable, the main advantages are: first, it is a rule-based approach, and second, it can be applied on some other languages with minor modifications. The database has been designed to be flexible where most of the rules are defined in tables in order to generalize the code. Validation rules have been applied in both the database design and the programming code in order to ensure the integrity of data. A major design goal of this system is that it will be used as a stand-alone tool and can be very well integrated with a general machine translation system for English sentence.

AB Generating code-switched text is a problem of growing interest, especially given the scarcity of corpora containing large volumes of real code-switched text. In this work, we adapt a state-of-the-art neural machine translation model to generate Hindi-English code-switched sentences starting from monolingual Hindi sentences. We outline a carefully designed curriculum of pretraining steps, including the use of synthetic code-switched text, that enable the model to generate high-quality code-switched text. Using text generated from our model as data augmentation, we show significant reductions in perplexity on a language modeling task, compared to using text from other generative models of CS text. We also show improvements using our text for a downstream code-switched natural language inference task. Our generated text is further subjected to a rigorous evaluation using a human evaluation study and a range of objective metrics, where we show performance comparable (and sometimes even superior) to code-switched text obtained via crowd workers who are native Hindi speakers.

AB In this paper we use Nooj to solve a recognition and translation task on medical terms with a morphosemantic approach. The Medical domain is characterized by a huge number of different terms that appear in corpora with very low frequencies. For this reason, machine learning or statistical approaches do not achieve good results on this domain. In our work we apply a morphosemantic approach that take advantage from a number of Italian and English word-formation strategies for the automatic analysis of Italian words and for the generation of Italian/English bilingual lexicons in the medical sub-code. Using Nooj we built a series of Italian and bilingual dictionaries of morphemes, a set of morphological grammars that specify how morphemes combine with each other, a syntactic grammar for the recognition of compound terms and a Finite State Transducer (FST) for the translation of medical terms based on morphemes. This approach produces as output: a categorized Italian electronic dictionary of medical simple words, provided with labels specifying the meaning of each term; a Thesaurus of simples and compounds medical terms, organized in 22 medical subcategories; A an Italian/English translation of medical terms.

TI Paraphrase Generation: A Review from RNN to Transformer based Approaches
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEXT-GENERATION COMPUTING
AB Paraphrasing is an act of generating similar text to the source text with different expressions. Paraphrase generation is an important task in various Natural Language Processing applications such as machine translation, question-answering, information retrieval and sentence simplification. The advancements in deep learning improved paraphrase generation. So, the aim of this paper is to provide a review from RNN based approaches to current state-of-the-art models. The current paraphrase generation techniques are using basic seq2seq with attention, neural machine translation, deep generative models and reinforcement learning methodologies. A comprehensive study is presented based on the methodology used, strengths of the systems and datasets used in these approaches. The paper will help the readers to know the basics of paraphrasing concepts, their types, various applications of paraphrase generation and the current algorithms developed for generating paraphrases. The various datasets for paraphrasing models are also explored along with future directions for scholars and persons from industry in the proposed article.

AB Recurrent sequence generators conditioned on input data through an attention mechanism have recently shown very good performance on a range of tasks including machine translation, handwriting synthesis [1, 2] and image caption generation [3]. We extend the attention-mechanism with features needed for speech recognition. We show that while an adaptation of the model used for machine translation in [2] reaches a competitive 18.7% phoneme error rate (PER) on the TIMIT phoneme recognition task, it can only be applied to utterances which are roughly as long as the ones it was trained on. We offer a qualitative explanation of this failure and propose a novel and generic method of adding location-awareness to the attention mechanism to alleviate this issue. The new method yields a model that is robust to long inputs and achieves 18% PER in single utterances and 20% in 10-times longer (repeated) utterances. Finally, we propose a change to the attention mechanism that prevents it from concentrating too much on single frames, which further reduces PER to 17.6% level.

AB This paper investigates several approaches to bootstrapping a new spoken language understanding (SLU) component in a target language given a large dataset of semantically-annotated utterances in some other source language. The aim is to reduce the cost associated with porting a spoken dialogue system from one language to another by minimising the amount of data required in the target language. Since word-level semantic annotations are costly, Semantic Tuple Classifiers (STCs) are used in conjunction with statistical machine translation models both of which are trained from unaligned data to further reduce development time. The paper presents experiments in which a French SLU component in the tourist information domain is bootstrapped from English data. Results show that training STCs on automatically translated data produced the best performance for predicting the utterance's dialogue act type, however individual slot/value pairs are best predicted by training STCs on the source language and using them to decode translated utterances.

AB Many multi-domain neural machine translation (NMT) models achieve knowledge transfer by enforcing one encoder to learn shared embedding across domains. However, this design lacks adaptation to individual domains. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-domain NMT model using individual modules for each domain, on which we apply word-level, adaptive and layer-wise domain mixing. We first observe that words in a sentence are often related to multiple domains. Hence, we assume each word has a domain proportion, which indicates its domain preference. Then word representations are obtained by mixing their embedding in individual domains based on their domain proportions. We show this can be achieved by carefully designing multi-head dot-product attention modules for different domains, and eventually taking weighted averages of their parameters by word-level layer-wise domain proportions. Through this, we can achieve effective domain knowledge sharing, and capture fine-grained domain-specific knowledge as well. Our experiments show that our proposed model outperforms existing ones in several NMT tasks.

AB Recently, image captioning has received much attention from the artificial-intelligent (AI) research community. Most of the current works follow the encoder-decoder machine translation model to automatically generate captions for images. However, most of these works used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as an image encoder and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) as a decoder to generate the caption. In this paper, we propose a sequence-to-sequence model that uses RNN as an image encoder that follows the encoder-decoder machine translation model, such that the input to the model is a sequence of images that represents the objects in the image. These objects are ordered based on their order in the captions. We demonstrate the results of the model on Flickr30K dataset and compare the results with the state-ofthe- art methods that use the same dataset. The proposed model outperformed the state-of-the-art methods on all metrics.

TI Machine learning algorithms for predicting scapular kinematics
SO MEDICAL ENGINEERING & PHYSICS
AB The goal of this study was to develop and validate a non-invasive approach to estimate scapular kinematics in individual patients. We hypothesized that machine learning algorithms could be developed using motion capture data to accurately estimate dynamic scapula orientation based on measured humeral orientations and acromion process positions. The accuracy of the algorithms was evaluated against a gold standard of biplane fluoroscopy using a 2D to 3D fluoroscopy/model matching process. Individualized neural networks were developed for nine healthy adult shoulders. These models were used to predict scapulothoracic kinematics, and the predicted kinematics were compared to kinematics obtained using biplane fluoroscopy to determine the accuracy of the machine learning algorithms. Results showed correlations between predicted kinematics and validation kinematics. Estimated kinematics were within 10 of validation kinematics. We concluded that individualized machine learning algorithms show promise for providing accurate, non-invasive measurements of scapulothoracic kinematics. (C) 2019 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Human-centered design of wearable robots involves the development of innovative science and technologies that minimize the mismatch between humans' and machines' capabilities, leading to their intuitive integration and confluent interaction. Here, we summarize our human-centered approach to the design of closed-loop brain-machine interfaces powered prostheses and exoskeletons that allow people to act beyond their impaired or diminished physical or sensorimotor capabilities. The goal is to develop multifunctional human-machine interfaces with integrated diagnostic, assistive, and therapeutic functions. Moreover, these complex human-machine systems should be effective, reliable, safe, and engaging and support the patient in performing intended actions with minimal effort and errors with adequate interaction time. To illustrate our approach, we review an example of a user-in-the-loop, patient-centered, noninvasive BMI system to a powered exoskeleton for persons with paraplegia. We conclude with a summary of challenges to the translation of these complex human-machine systems to the end user.

TI SPARQL Generation with an NMT-based Approach
SO JOURNAL OF WEB ENGINEERING
AB SPARQL is a powerful query language which has been widely used in various natural language question answering (QA) systems. As the advances of deep neural networks, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models are employed to directly translate natural language questions to SPARQL queries in recent years. In this paper, we propose an NMT-based approach with Transformer model to generate SPARQL queries. Transformer model is chosen due to its relatively high efficiency and effectiveness. We design a format to encode a SPARQL query into a simple sequence with only RDF triples reserved. The main purpose of this step is to shorten the sequences and reduce the complexity of the target language. Moreover, we employ entity type tags to further resolve mistranslated problems. The proposed approach is evaluated against three open-domain question answering datasets (QALD-7, QALD-8, and LC-QuAD) on BLEU score and accuracy, and obtains outstanding results (83.49%, 90.13%, and 76.32% on BLEU score, respectively) which considerably outperform all known studies.

TI Cross-lingual sentiment transfer with limited resources
SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB We describe two transfer approaches for building sentiment analysis systems without having gold labeled data in the target language. Unlike previous work that is focused on using only English as the source language and a small number of target languages, we use multiple source languages to learn a more robust sentiment transfer model for 16 languages from different language families. Our approaches explore the potential of using an annotation projection approach and a direct transfer approach using cross-lingual word representations and neural networks. Whereas most previous work relies on machine translation, we show that we can build cross-lingual sentiment analysis systems without machine translation or even high quality parallel data. We have conducted experiments assessing the availability of different resources such as in-domain parallel data, out-of-domain parallel data, and in-domain comparable data. Our experiments show that we can build a robust transfer system whose performance can in some cases approach that of a supervised system.

AB Maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) is one of the most widely used approaches for training structured prediction models for textgeneration based natural language processing applications. However, besides exposure bias, models trained with MLE suffer from wrong objective problem where they are trained to maximize the word-level correct next step prediction, but are evaluated with respect to sequence-level discrete metrics such as ROUGE and BLEU. Several variants of policy-gradient methods address some of these problems by optimizing for final discrete evaluation metrics and showing improvements over MLE training for downstream tasks like text summarization and machine translation. However, policy-gradient methods suffers from high sample variance, making the training process very difficult and unstable. In this paper, we present an alternative direction towards mitigating this problem by introducing a new objective (CALCS) based on a differentiable surrogate of longest common subsequence (LCS) measure that captures sequence-level structure similarity. Experimental results on abstractive summarization and machine translation validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB General principles of structure and function of the ribosome are surveyed, and the translating ribosome is regarded as a molecular conveying machine. Two coupled conveying processes, the passing of compact tRNA globules and the drawing of linear mRNA chain through intraribosomal channel, are considered driven by discrete acts of translocation during translation. Instead of mechanical transmission mechanisms and power-stroke 'motors', thermal motion and chemically induced changes in affinities of ribosomal binding sites for their ligands (tRNAs, mRNA, elongation factors) are proposed to underlie all the directional movements within the ribosomal complex. The GTP-dependent catalysis of conformational transitions by elongation factors during translation is also discussed.

AB This work presents a system called Rice Watch, which has been developed to track, extract and process market price information and production yield for strategic planning in the economics and marketing of rice. Even though many sources of market information, such as commodity prices and stocks, are available on websites at any given time, such information is scattered and cannot be recomputed toward providing more usable information. Moreover, it is difficult to monitor large-scale areas under cultivation for production-market planning by using only surveys or statistical methods. Therefore, this work aims to apply integrated technologies, such as Information Extraction techniques, Machine aided Translation and Multi-Temporal Profile Matching techniques on satellite images, with two main goals: to provide market-information services to farmers and entrepreneurs for planning rice cultivation with better economic returns, and also to provide estimates for rice production at each stage of rice growth for market planning.

AB Machine aided human translation (MAHT) for the abstract of patent texts is an important step to the deep processing of the patent data, where the terms have significant application value. This paper investigates the automatic term recognition (ATR), and proposes a new hybrid method based on two-phase analysis and statistic to generate English candidate terms. The segments including stop words were not simply discarded; instead, a rewriting method using beginning patterns, ending patterns, and inner patterns on the phase two was employed for the processing of the segments. In the meantime, generalized statistical measures were used for the evaluation of the candidates such as the generalized mutual information (MI), Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR), and C-value to filter the low score's candidate terms and to attain the intersection set of them. The experiments on the patent abstract texts extracted randomly show the availability of the method.

AB We improve automatic correction of grammatical, orthographic, and collocation errors in text using a multilayer convolutional encoder-decoder neural network. The network is initialized with embeddings that make use of character N-gram information to better suit this task. When evaluated on common benchmark test data sets (CoNLL-2014 and JF-LEG), our model substantially outperforms all prior neural approaches on this task as well as strong statistical machine translation-based systems with neural and task-specific features trained on the same data. Our analysis shows the superiority of convolutional neural networks over recurrent neural networks such as long short-term memory (LSTM) networks in capturing the local context via attention, and thereby improving the coverage in correcting grammatical errors. By ensembling multiple models, and incorporating an N-gram language model and edit features via rescoring, our novel method becomes the first neural approach to outperform the current state-of-the-art statistical machine translation-based approach, both in terms of grammaticality and fluency.

TI Reciprocal translation between SAR and optical remote sensing images
   with cascaded-residual adversarial networks
SO SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Despite the advantages of all-weather and all-day high-resolution imaging, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are much less viewed and used by general people because human vision is not adapted to microwave scattering phenomenon. However, expert interpreters can be trained by comparing side-by-side SAR and optical images to learn the mapping rules from SAR to optical. This paper attempts to develop machine intelligence that is trainable with large-volume co-registered SAR and optical images to translate SAR images to optical version for assisted SAR image interpretation. Reciprocal SAR-optical image translation is a challenging task because it is a raw data translation between two physically very different sensing modalities. Inspired by recent progresses in image translation studies in computer vision, this paper tackles the problem of SAR-optical reciprocal translation with an adversarial network scheme where cascaded residual connections and hybrid L1-GAN loss are employed. It is trained and tested on both spaceborne Gaofen-3 (GF-3) and airborne Uninhabited Airborne Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) images. Results are presented for datasets of different resolutions and polarizations and compared with other state-of-the-art methods. The Frechet inception distance (FID) is used to quantitatively evaluate the translation performance. The possibility of unsupervised learning with unpaired/unregistered SAR and optical images is also explored. Results show that the proposed translation network works well under many scenarios and it could potentially be used for assisted SAR interpretation.

AB This paper presents a blind and robust watermark approach for authentication 2D Map based on polar coordinates mapping and support vector machine is presented. The proposed system is composed of three phases. Firstly, in the preprocessing phase, the proposed algorithm mapped all vertices into polar coordinate system. Then, in the support vector machine phase, the watermark portable points will be chosen using support vector machine to reduce the number of these points which increases the imperceptibility without any effect on the robustness of the watermark. Afterwards, in the watermarking algorithm phase, the watermark is embedded into the map vertices using the random table of the decimal valued of the polar coordinates through the digit substitution of the decimal part. Finally, in the theoretical analysis and experimental results shows that the presented approach is robust against a various attacks including rotation, scaling, and translation. The proposed approach attained high imperceptibility.

TI Incorporating Relative Position Information in Transformer-Based Sign
   Language Recognition and Translation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Recent advancements in machine translation tasks, with the advent of attention mechanisms and Transformer networks, have accelerated the research in Sign Language Translation (SLT), a spatio-temporal vision translation task. Fundamentally, Transformers are unaware of the sequential orderings in input, and therefore position-information should be explicitly fed into them. The sequence learning capability of Transformers is heavily dependent on this ordering information. Compared to the existing Transformer models for SLT that use baseline version with sinusoidal position embedding, this work focuses on incorporating a new positioning scheme into the Transformer networks, in the context of SLT. This is the first work in SLT that explores the positioning scheme of Transformers for optimizing translation scores. The study proposes Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-Relative Sign Transformer (RST) for jointly learning Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) and translation. This model significantly improves the video translation quality. In this approach, GRU acts as the relative position encoder and RST is the Transformer model with relative position incorporated in the Multi-Head Attention (MHA). The evaluation was done on the RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T benchmark dataset. This study reports state-of-the-art Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU-4) score of 22.4 and Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) score of 48.55 for SLT, with GRU-RST. The best Word Error Rate (WER) obtained with this approach is 23.5. A detailed study of the position encoding schemes of Transformers is presented. Further, we analyze the translation performance under various combinations of the positioning schemes.

The goal of this review is to provide an accessible understanding of why this approach is important for future practice given its potential to augment decisions associated with the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of people suffering from mental illness using clinical and biological data. To this end, the limitations of current statistical paradigms in mental health research are critiqued, and an introduction is provided to critical machine learning methods used in clinical studies. A selective literature review is then presented aiming to reinforce the usefulness of machine learning methods and provide evidence of their potential. In the context of promising initial results, the current limitations of machine learning approaches are addressed, and considerations for future clinical translation are outlined.

AB Old Turkic language is the basis of all modern Turkic languages. Its study is very important for Turkic peoples who possess modern Turkic languages. This is important both from a historical point of view and for the study of modern issues of neural machine translation, issues of the linguistic distance of modern Turkic languages from their progenitor. This paper proposes the development of a computational model of the morphology of Old Turkic language based on the CSE (Complete Set of Endings) - model of morphology and a study on this basis of the issue of morphological segmentation of the texts of Old Turkic language, which will subsequently be used for neural machine translation of Old Turkic language into modern Turkic languages. Since most of the modern Turkic languages, except for the Turkish language, belong to low-resource languages, the issues of developing computational models of morphology, developing models, algorithms and software for processing Turkic languages are relevant.

AB Medical text mining has gained increasing popularity in recent years. Now a days, large amount of medical text data are daily generated in health institutions, but never refer again as it is very time consuming task. In Radiology domain, most of the reports are in free text format and usually unprocessed, hence it is difficult to access the valuable information for medical professional unless proper text mining is not applied. There are some systems existing for radiology report information retrieval like MedLEE, NeuRadIR, CBIR but very few of them make use of text associated with image. This paper proposes a text mining system to deals with this problem by using statistical machine translation approach. The System stores the text and image features to find the match report. The SVM classifier is use in SMT approach to check whether entered report present in database or not. The system will return the similar report match with the entered report from the database.

SO MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Automated Machine Translation (AMT) has a potential to digitally unite the whole world. Universal Networking Language (UNL) has been used by various researchers as an interlingual approach for AMT. The UNL system consists of two main components, namely, EnConverter (used for converting the text from a source language to UNL) and DeConverter (used for converting the text from UNL to a target language). This paper discusses the framework for designing EnConverter for Punjabi language with a special focus on generation of UNL attributes and relations from Punjabi source text. The architecture of Punjabi EnConverter, algorithm for understanding the Punjabi input sentence and resolution of UNL relations and attributes is also discussed in this paper. The paper highlights the EnConversion analysis rules for the EnConverter and indicates its usage in the generation of UNL expressions. This paper also covers the results of implementation of Punjabi EnConverter and compares these with the system available at Spanish Language Server.

AB NLP system developers and corpus lexicographers would both benefit from a tool for finding and organizing the distinctive patterns of use of words in texts. Such a tool would be an asset for both language research and lexicon development, particularly for lexicons for Machine Translation. We have developed the WASPBENCH, a tool that (1) presents a "word sketch", a summary of the corpus evidence for a word, to the lexicographer; (2) supports the lexicographer in analysing the word into its distinct meanings and (3) uses the lexicographer's analysis as the input to a state-of-the-art word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithm, the output of which is a "word expert" for the word which can then disambiguate new instances of the word. In this paper we describe a set of evaluation experiments, designed to establish whether WASPBENCH can be used to save time and improve performance in the development of a lexicon for Machine Translation or other NLP application.

TI Escherichia coli beta-clamp slows down DNA polymerase I dependent nick
   translation while accelerating ligation
SO PLOS ONE
AB The nick translation property of DNA polymerase I (Pol I) ensures the maturation of Okazaki fragments by removing primer RNAs and facilitating ligation. However, prolonged nick translation traversing downstream DNA is an energy wasting futile process, as Pol I simultaneously polymerizes and depolymerizes at the nick sites utilizing energy-rich dNTPs. Using an in vitro assay system, we demonstrate that the beta-clamp of the Escherichia coli replisome strongly inhibits nick translation on the DNA substrate. To do so, beta-clamp inhibits the strand displacement activity of Pol I by interfering with the interaction between the finger subdomain of Pol I and the downstream primer-template junction. Conversely, beta-clamp stimulates the 5' exonuclease property of Pol I to cleave single nucleotides or shorter oligonucleotide flaps. This single nucleotide flap removal at high frequency increases the probability of ligation between the upstream and downstream DNA strands at an early phase, terminating nick translation. Besides beta-clamp-mediated ligation helps DNA ligase to seal the nick promptly during the maturation of Okazaki fragments.

SO DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP IN THE HUMANITIES
AB This study aims to test the classification of literary translations by human and machine translators in a bid to explore stylistic distinctions between the two groups and among machine translators and their evolution over 1 year between 2019 and 2020. For this, the study takes a stylometric approach by employing two statistical methods popularly used in authorship attribution-support vector machine (SVM) and principal component analysis (PCA), which are applied to analyzing three types of features-1-grams, 2-grams, and 3 grams. The results show that over the researched period, the three machine translators investigated (Google, Bing, and Papago) moved in the direction of converging in style while advancing toward human translators. The distance gained by them on human translators, however, was not significant enough to challenge the clear-cut divide between the two groups. The PCA tests additionally revealed some characteristics of the machine translator that might be responsible for the stylistic distinction between them and their human counterparts including their tendency of overusing basic standard language.

TI Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Anesthesiology
SO ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB Commercial applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning have made remarkable progress recently, particularly in areas such as image recognition, natural speech processing, language translation, textual analysis, and self-learning. Progress had historically languished in these areas, such that these skills had come to seem ineffably bound to intelligence. However, these commercial advances have performed best at single-task applications in which imperfect outputs and occasional frank errors can be tolerated. The practice of anesthesiology is different. It embodies a requirement for high reliability, and a pressured cycle of interpretation, physical action, and response rather than any single cognitive act. This review covers the basics of what is meant by artificial intelligence and machine learning for the practicing anesthesiologist, describing how decision-making behaviors can emerge from simple equations. Relevant clinical questions are introduced to illustrate how machine learning might help solve them-perhaps bringing anesthesiology into an era of machine-assisted discovery.

AB We explore space improvements in LRP, a polymorphically typed call-by-need functional core language. A relaxed space measure is chosen for the maximal size usage during an evaluation. It abstracts from the details of the implementation via abstract machines, but it takes garbage collection into account and thus can be seen as a realistic approximation of space usage. The results are: a context lemma for space improving translations and for space equivalences; all but one reduction rule of the calculus are shown to be space improvements, and for the exceptional one we show bounds on the space increase. Several further program transformations are shown to be space improvements or space equivalences, in particular the translation into machine expressions is a space equivalence. We also classify certain space-worsening transformations as space-leaks or as space-safe. These results are a step forward in making predictions about the change in runtime space behavior of optimizing transformations in call-by-need functional languages.

AB Pseudo-code written in natural language can aid the comprehension of source code in unfamiliar programming languages. However, the great majority of source code has no corresponding pseudo-code, because pseudo-code is redundant and laborious to create. If pseudo-code could be generated automatically and instantly from given source code, we could allow for on-demand production of pseudo-code without human effort. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically generate pseudo-code from source code, specifically adopting the statistical machine translation (SMT) framework. SMT, which was originally designed to translate between two natural languages, allows us to automatically learn the relationship between source code/pseudo-code pairs, making it possible to create a pseudo-code generator with less human effort. In experiments, we generated English or Japanese pseudo-code from Python statements using SMT, and find that the generated pseudo-code is largely accurate, and aids code understanding.

TI Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation: A Review
SO SENSORS
AB Supervised image-to-image translation has been proven to generate realistic images with sharp details and to have good quantitative performance. Such methods are trained on a paired dataset, where an image from the source domain already has a corresponding translated image in the target domain. However, this paired dataset requirement imposes a huge practical constraint, requires domain knowledge or is even impossible to obtain in certain cases. Due to these problems, unsupervised image-to-image translation has been proposed, which does not require domain expertise and can take advantage of a large unlabeled dataset. Although such models perform well, they are hard to train due to the major constraints induced in their loss functions, which make training unstable. Since CycleGAN has been released, numerous methods have been proposed which try to address various problems from different perspectives. In this review, we firstly describe the general image-to-image translation framework and discuss the datasets and metrics involved in the topic. Furthermore, we revise the current state-of-the-art with a classification of existing works. This part is followed by a small quantitative evaluation, for which results were taken from papers.

TI Neural Network-Based Tree Translation for Knowledge Base Construction
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Knowledge bases (KB), such as Probase and ConceptNet, play an important role in many natural language processing tasks. Compared with resource-poor languages such as Chinese, the scale and quality of English knowledge bases are obviously superior. To expand Chinese KBs by using English KB resources, translating English KBs into Chinese is an effective way. In this direction, two major challenges are how to model more structure semantics to improve translation quality and how to avoid labor-intensive feature engineering. We address these challenges by presenting a neural network approach, which learns tree representation by different structure features. We also build a new dataset for English-Chinese KB translation from Probase and ConceptNet, and compare our proposed approach with several baselines on it. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the translation accuracy compared with baseline methods. Meanwhile, we translate Probase and ConceptNet into Zh-Probase and Zh-ConceptNet by our proposed model, and release them to the public, in hope of speeding up the research in Chinese natural language processing tasks.

AB No doubt, big data technology can be a key enabler for data-driven decision making. However, there are caveats. Processing technology for unstructured and structured data alone-with or without Artificial Intelligence-will not suffice to catch up the promises made by big data pundits. This article argues that we should be level-headed about what we can achieve with big data. We can achieve a lot of these promises if we also achieve to get our interests and requirements better reflected in design or adaptation of big data technology. Economy of scale urges provider of big data technology to address mainstream requirements, that is, analytic requirements of a broad clientele. Our analytical problems, however, are rather individual, albeit mainstream only to a certain extent. We will see many technology add-ons for specific requirements, with more emphasis on human interaction too, that will be essential for the success in big data. In this article, we take machine translation as an example and a prototypical translation memory as add-on technology that supports users to turn the faulty automatic translation into a useful one.

AB Knowledge bases such as Wikidata amass vast amounts of named entity information, such as multilingual labels, which can be extremely useful for various multilingual and cross-lingual applications. However, such labels are not guaranteed to match across languages from an information consistency standpoint, greatly compromising their usefulness for fields such as machine translation. In this work, we investigate the application of word and sentence alignment techniques coupled with a matching algorithm to align cross-lingual entity labels extracted from Wikidata in 10 languages. Our results indicate that mapping between Wikidata's main labels stands to be considerably improved (up to 20 points in F1-score) by any of the employed methods. We show how methods relying on sentence embeddings outperform all others, even across different scripts. We believe the application of such techniques to measure the similarity of label pairs, coupled with a knowledge base rich in high-quality entity labels, to be an excellent asset to machine translation.

AB We present a machine-readable structured data version of Wiktionary. Unlike previous Wiktionary extractions, the new extractor, Wiktextract, fully interprets and expands templates and Lua modules in Wiktionary. This enables it to perform a more complete, robust, and maintainable extraction. The extracted data is multilingual and includes lemmas, inflected forms, translations, etymology, usage examples, pronunciations (including URLs of sound files), lexical and semantic relations, and various morphological, syntactic, semantic, topical, and dialectal annotations. We extract all data from the English Wiktionary. Comparing against previous extractions from language-specific dictionaries, we find that its coverage for non-English languages often matches or exceeds the coverage in the language-specific editions, with the added benefit that all glosses are in English. The data is freely available and regularly updated, enabling anyone to add more data and correct errors by editing Wiktionary. The extracted data is in JSON format and designed to be easy to use by researchers, downstream resources, and application developers.

TI Morphological Segmentation to Improve Crosslingual Word Embeddings for
   Low Resource Languages
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB Crosslingual word embeddings developed from multiple parallel corpora help in understanding the relationships between languages and improving the prediction quality of machine translation. However, in low resource languages with complex and agglutinative morphologies, inducing good-quality crosslingual embeddings becomes challenging due to the problem of complex morphological forms and rare words. This is true even for languages that share common linguistic structure. In our work, we have shown that performing a simple morphological segmentation upon the corpora prior to the generation of crosslingual word embeddings for both roots and suffixes greatly improves the prediction quality and captures semantic similarities more effectively. To exhibit this, we have chosen two related languages: Telugu and Kannada of the Dravidian language family. We have also tested our method upon a widely spoken North Indian language, Hindi, belonging to the Indo-European language family, and have observed encouraging results.

AB Tools capable of automatic code generation have the potential to augment programmer's capabilities. While straightforward code retrieval is incorporated into many IDEs, an emerging area is explicit code generation. Code generation is currently approached as a Machine Translation task, with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) based encoder-decoder architectures trained on code-description pairs. In this work we introduce and study modern Transformer architectures for this task. We further propose a new model called the Relevance Transformer that incorporates external knowledge using pseudo-relevance feedback. The Relevance Transformer biases the decoding process to be similar to existing retrieved code while enforcing diversity. We perform experiments on multiple standard benchmark datasets for code generation including Django, Hearthstone, and CoNaLa. The results show improvements over state-of-the-art methods based on BLEU evaluation. The Relevance Transformer model shows the potential of Transformer-based architectures for code generation and introduces a method of incorporating pseudo-relevance feedback during inference.

AB Sentiment analysis in low-resource languages suffers from a lack of annotated corpora to estimate high-performing models. Machine translation and bilingual word embeddings provide some relief through cross-lingual sentiment approaches. However, they either require large amounts of parallel data or do not sufficiently capture sentiment information. We introduce Bilingual Sentiment Embeddings (BLSE), which jointly represent sentiment information in a source and target language. This model only requires a small bilingual lexicon, a source-language corpus annotated for sentiment, and monolingual word embeddings for each language. We perform experiments on three language combinations (Spanish, Catalan, Basque) for sentence-level cross-lingual sentiment classification and find that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four out of six experimental setups, as well as capturing complementary information to machine translation. Our analysis of the resulting embedding space provides evidence that it represents sentiment information in the resource-poor target language without any annotated data in that language.

TI Mechanism of ribosome translation through mRNA secondary structures
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB A ribosome is a macromolecular machine that is responsible for translating the genetic codes in messenger RNA (mRNA) into polypeptide chains. It has been determined that besides translating through the single-stranded region, the ribosome can also translate through the duplex region of mRNA by unwinding the duplex. To understand the mechanism of ribosome translation through the duplex, several models have been proposed to study the dynamics of mRNA unwinding. Here, we present a comprehensive review of these models and also discuss other possible models. We evaluate each model and discuss the consistency and/or inconsistency between the theoretical results that are obtained based on each model and the available experimental data, thus determining which model is the most reasonable one to describe the mRNA unwinding mechanism and dynamics of the ribosome. Moreover, a framework for future studies in this subject is provided.

AB The performance of transliteration from a source language to a target language builds the ground work in support of proper name Cross Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR). Traditionally, this task is accomplished by two separate modules: transliteration and retrieval. Queries are first transliterated to target language using one or multiple hypotheses. The retrieval is then carried out based on translated queries. The transliteration often results in 30-50% errors with top I hypothesis, thus leading to significant performance degradation in CUR. Therefore, we proposed a unified transliteration retrieval model that incorporates the transliteration similarity measurement into the relevance scoring function. In addition, we presented an efficient and robust method in similarity measurement for a given proper name pair using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based alignment and a Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) framework. Experimental data showed significant results with the proposed integrated method on the NTCIR7 IR4QA task, which demonstrated a greater flexibility and acceptance in transliteration.

AB This paper presents an exploration procedure for mapping given functional specifications of an analog system to the specification parameters of individual component blocks of the system topology. A meet-in-the-middle approach has been followed for constructing the feasible design space. It is constructed as the intersection of an application-bounded specification space and a circuit-realizable specification space. The least squares support vector machine principle is used to accurately identify the actual geometry of the feasible design space. The reduced design space speeds up the exploration procedure. The benefit of our methodology is the ability to obtain practically correct circuit-level specifications of the component blocks of the system in a single pass. The effectiveness of the procedure has been demonstrated by considering a complete system. The simulation results satisfy the desired specifications of the system, validating the overall procedure.

SO ORIGINS OF LIFE AND EVOLUTION OF BIOSPHERES
AB We set up a scenario for the operation of primordial synthesis machines operating in outer space quasi one dimensional channels, where polymers interact with fixed particles. The scheme allows for polymerization, translocation and translation. We will show that under very general conditions the particle/polymer interaction potential has spatial regularities with an average distance of three between neighboring minima. We present a model that exhibits how primitive molecular machines may convert the structural properties of the potential into locomotion regularities. On average, polymer movement takes place by shifts with long time intervals every three displacements. We argue that this feature is generic and lies at the origin of the three base codon composition.

AB Recently, non-recurrent architectures (convolutional, self-attentional) have outperformed RNNs in neural machine translation. CNNs and self-attentional networks can connect distant words via shorter network paths than RNNs, and it has been speculated that this improves their ability to model long-range dependencies. However, this theoretical argument has not been tested empirically, nor have alternative explanations for their strong performance been explored in-depth. We hypothesize that the strong performance of CNNs and self-attentional networks could also be due to their ability to extract semantic features from the source text, and we evaluate RNNs, CNNs and self-attention networks on two tasks: subject-verb agreement (where capturing long-range dependencies is required) and word sense disambiguation (where semantic feature extraction is required). Our experimental results show that: 1) self-attentional networks and CNNs do not outperform RNNs in modeling subject-verb agreement over long distances; 2) self-attentional networks perform distinctly better than RNNs and CNNs on word sense disambiguation.

TI Latent semantics in language models
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB This paper investigates three different sources of information and their integration into language modelling. Global semantics is modelled by Latent Dirichlet allocation and brings long range dependencies into language models. Word clusters given by semantic spaces enrich these language models with short range semantics. Finally, our own stemming algorithm is used to further enhance the performance of language modelling for inflectional languages.
   Our research shows that these three sources of information enrich each other and their combination dramatically improves language modelling. All investigated models are acquired in a fully unsupervised manner.
   We show the efficiency of our methods for several languages such as Czech, Slovenian, Slovak, Polish, Hungarian, and English, proving their multilingualism. The perplexity tests are accompanied by machine translation tests that prove the ability of the proposed models to improve the performance of a real-world application. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Subword segmentation algorithms have been a de facto choice when building neural machine translation systems. However, most of them need to learn a segmentation model based on some heuristics, which may produce sub-optimal segmentation. This can be problematic in some scenarios when the target language has rich morphological changes or there is not enough data for learning compact composition rules. Translating at fully character level has the potential to alleviate the issue, but empirical performances of character-based models has not been fully explored. In this paper, we present an in-depth comparison between character-based and subword-based NMT systems under three settings: translating to typologically diverse languages, training with low resource, and adapting to unseen domains. Experimental results show strong competitiveness of character-based models. Further analyses show that compared to subword-based models, character-based models are better at handling morphological phenomena, generating rare and unknown words, and more suitable for transferring to unseen domains.

AB Well-chosen variable names are critical to source code readability, reusability, and maintainability. Unfortunately, in deployed JavaScript code (which is ubiquitous on the web) the identifier names are frequently minified and overloaded. This is done both for eficiency and also to protect potentially proprietary intellectual property. In this paper, we describe an approach based on statistical machine translation (SMT) that recovers some of the original names from the JavaScript programs minified by the very popular UGLI-FYJS. This simple tool, AUTONYM, performs comparably to the best currently available de-obfuscator for JavaScript, JSNICE, which uses sophisticated static analysis. In fact, AUTONYM is quite complementary to JSNICE, performing well when it does not, and vice versa. We also introduce a new tool, JSNAGHTY, which blends AUTONYM and JSNICE, and significantly outperforms both at identifier name recovery, while remaining just as easy to use as JSNICE. JSNAGHTY is available online at http://jsnaughty.org.

AB Since the quality of statistical machine translation (SMT) is heavily dependent upon the size and quality of training data, many approaches have been proposed for automatically mining bilingual text from comparable corpora. However, the existing solutions are restricted to extract either bilingual sentences or sub-sentential fragments. Instead, we present an efficient framework to extract both sentential and sub-sentential units. At sentential level, we consider the parallel sentence identification as a classification problem and extract more representative and effective features. At sub-sentential level, we refer to the idea of phrase table's acquisition in SMT to extract parallel fragments. A novel word alignment model is specially designed for comparable sentence pairs and parallel fragments can be extracted based on such word alignment. We integrate the two levels' extraction task into a united framework. Experimental results on SMT show that the baseline SMT system can achieve significant improvement by adding those extra-mined knowledge.

AB Many measures have been proposed for machine translation evaluation (MTE) while little research has been done on the performance of MTE methods. This paper is an effort for MTE performance analysis. A general frame is proposed for the description of the MTE measure and the test suite, including whether the automatic measure is consistent with human evaluation, whether different results from various measures or test suites are consistent, whether the content of the test suite is suitable for performance evaluation, the degree of difficulty of the test suite and its influence on the MTE, the relationship of MTE result significance and the size of the test suite, etc. For a better clarification of the frame, several experiment results are analyzed relating human evaluation, BLEU evaluation, and typological MTE. A visualization method is introduced for better presentation of the results. The study aims for aid in construction of test suite and method selection in MTE practice.

AB We have developed a technique for automatic transliteration of named entities for English-Chinese cross-language spoken document retrieval (CL-SDR). Our retrieval system integrates machine translation, speech recognition and information retrieval technologies. An English news story forms a textual query that is automatically translated into Chinese words, which are mapped into Mandarin syllables by pronunciation dictionary lookup. Mandarin radio news broadcasts form spoken documents that are indexed by word and syllable recognition. The information retrieval engine performs matching in both word and syllable scales. The English queries contain many named entities that tend to be out-of-vocabulary words for machine translation and speech recognition, and are omitted in retrieval. Names are often transliterated across languages and are generally important for retrieval. We present a technique that takes in a name spelling and automatically generates a phonetic cognate in terms of Chinese syllables to be used in retrieval. Experiments show consistent retrieval performance improvements by including the use of named entities in this way.

TI ANF preserves dependent types up to extensional equality
SO JOURNAL OF FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
AB Many programmers use dependently typed languages such as Coq to machine-verify high-assurance software. However, existing compilers for these languages provide no guarantees after compiling, nor when linking after compilation. Type-preserving compilers preserve guarantees encoded in types and then use type checking to verify compiled code and ensure safe linking with external code. Unfortunately, standard compiler passes do not preserve the dependent typing of commonly used (intensional) type theories. This is because assumptions valid in simpler type systems no longer hold, and intensional dependent type systems are highly sensitive to syntactic changes, including compilation. We develop an A-normal form (ANF) translation with join-point optimization-a standard translation for making control flow explicit in functional languages-from the Extended Calculus of Constructions (ECC) with dependent elimination of booleans and natural numbers (a representative subset of Coq). Our dependently typed target language has equality reflection, allowing the type system to encode semantic equality of terms. This is key to proving type preservation and correctness of separate compilation for this translation. This is the first ANF translation for dependent types. Unlike related translations, it supports the universe hierarchy, and does not rely on parametricity or impredicativity.

AB Pivoting through a popular language with more parallel corpora available (e.g. English and Chinese) is a common approach to build machine translation (MT) systems for low-resource languages. For example, to build a Russian-to-Spanish MT system, we could build one system using the Russian-Spanish corpus directly. We could also build two systems, Russian-to-English and English-to-Spanish, as the resources of the two language pairs are much larger than the Russian-Spanish pair, and use them cascadingly to translate texts in Russian into Spanish by pivoting through English. There are, however, some confusing results on the Pivot MT approach in the literature. In this paper, we reviewed the performance of Pivot MT with the United Nations Parallel Corpus v1.0 (UN6Way) using both English and Chinese as pivot languages. We also report our system performance on the CWMT 2018 Pivot MT shared task, where Japanese patent sentences are translated into English using Chinese as the pivot language.

AB The control software of the CERN Compact Muon Solenoid experiment contains over 27 500 finite state machines. These state machines are organised hierarchically: commands are sent down the hierarchy and state changes are sent upwards. The sheer size of the system makes it virtually impossible to fully understand the details of its behaviour at the macro level. This is fuelled by unclarities that already exist at the micro level. We have solved the latter problem by formally describing the finite state machines in the mCRL2 process algebra. The translation has been implemented using the ASF+SDF meta-environment, and its correctness was assessed by means of simulations and visualisations of individual finite state machines and through formal verification of subsystems of the control software. Based on the formalised semantics of the finite state machines, we have developed dedicated tooling for checking properties that can be verified on finite state machines in isolation.

AB The recent improvements in neural MT (NMT) have driven a shift from statistical MT (SMT) to NMT. However, to assess the usefulness of MT models for post-editing (PE) and have a detailed insight of the output they produce, we need to analyse the most frequent errors and how they affect the task. We present a pilot study of a fine-grained analysis of MT errors based on post-editors corrections for an English to Spanish medical text translated with SMT and NMT. We use the MQM taxonomy to compare the two MT models and have a categorized classification of the errors produced. Even though results show a great variation among post-editors' corrections, for this language combination fewer errors are corrected by post-editors in the NMT output. NMT also produces fewer accuracy errors and errors that are less critical.

AB Concerning the problems of the comparative translation is not accurate in machine translation and the useful information is unable to match in information retrieval, a liheci word sense disambiguation method is adopted and a classifier model is established using Support Vector Machines(SVM). To improve the accuracy of the liheci word sense disambiguation, it extracts not only local words(LW), local part-of-speeches(POS), local words and part-of-speeches (LWP) but also the middle insert part of the separated form as disambiguation features according to the characteristics of liheci; When the text features are converted to feature vectors for improving on boolean weight method, we can fix feature weights of some type in turn and change the other two types' to verify the disambiguation effect of three kinds of features, respectively. The results show that the effect of LW, LWP is higher than POS. Setting higher feature weights to LW and LWP, the disambiguation accuracy can effectively improve.

AB Attention networks, a deep neural network architecture inspired by humans' attention mechanism, have seen significant success in image captioning, machine translation, and many other applications. Recently, they have been further evolved into an advanced approach called multi-head self-attention networks, which can encode a set of input vectors, e.g., word vectors in a sentence, into another set of vectors. Such encoding aims at simultaneously capturing diverse syntactic and semantic features within a set, each of which corresponds to a particular attention head, forming altogether multi-head attention. Meanwhile, the increased model complexity prevents users from easily understanding and manipulating the inner workings of models. To tackle the challenges, we present a visual analytics system called SANVis, which helps users understand the behaviors and the characteristics of multi-head self-attention networks. Using a state-of-the-art self-attention model called Transformer, we demonstrate usage scenarios of SANVis in machine translation tasks. Our system is available at http://short.sanvis.org.

AB Transformer is the state-of-the-art model in recent machine translation evaluations. Two strands of research are promising to improve models of this kind: the first uses wide networks (a.k.a. Transformer-Big) and has been the de facto standard for the development of the Transformer system, and the other uses deeper language representation but faces the difficulty arising from learning deep networks. Here, we continue the line of research on the latter. We claim that a truly deep Transformer model can surpass the Transformer-Big counterpart by 1) proper use of layer normalization and 2) a novel way of passing the combination of previous layers to the next. On WMT'16 English-German, NIST OpenMT'12 Chinese-English and larger WMT'18 Chinese-English tasks, our deep system (30/25-layer encoder) outperforms the shallow Transformer-Big/Base baseline (6-layer encoder) by 0.4 similar to 2.4 BLEU points. As another bonus, the deep model is 1.6X smaller in size and 3X faster in training than Transformer-Big(1).

AB Attention mechanism advances the neural machine translation (NMT) by reducing the confusion introduced by irrelevant words in long sentences. However, the confusion caused by ambiguous words hasn't been handled yet and it may be a bottleneck for the NMT model. This paper validates the hypothesis and proposes a simple and flexible framework, which enables the NMT model to only focus on the relevant sense type of the input word in current context. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves substantial improvements on every test set over competitive baselines. Our contributions come from twofold. Firstly, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to introduce the multi-sense representation, which represents each sense type of the word with a sense-specific embedding, into NMT. Secondly, We propose a sense search module which can detect the sense type of the word automatically. Flexibility and versatility are the most attractive characteristic of the proposed sense search module. It can be applied to any other semantic related NLP tasks with little modification.

AB Dataflow formalisms are widely used for modeling and analyzing streaming applications. An important distinction is between static and dynamic formalisms, the latter allowing for the workload to change on-the-fly. The recently introduced finite-state machine based scenario aware dataflow (FSM-SADF) is a dynamic dataflow formalism that increases the expressiveness of the static synchronous dataflow (SDF) formalism, by allowing finite-state control, while to a large extent retaining its design-time analyzability.
   This paper reports on the translation of the FSM-SADF formalism to UPPAAL timed automata that enables a more general verification than currently supported by existing tools. We base our translation on a compositional approach where the input FSM-SADF model is represented as a parallel composition of its integral components modeled as automata. Thereafter, we show how to model check quantitative and qualitative properties both supported and not supported by the existing tools. We demonstrate our approach on a realistic case study from the multimedia domain.

AB The concept of virtual machines dates back to the 1960s. Both IBM and MIT developed operating system features that enabled user and peripheral time sharing, the underpinnings of which were early virtual machines. Modern virtual machines present a translation layer of system devices between a guest operating system and the host operating system executing on a computer system, while isolating each of the guest operating systems from each other.
   In the past several years, enterprise computing has embraced virtual machines to deploy a wide variety of capabilities from business management systems to email server farms. Those who have adopted virtual deployment environments have capitalized on a variety of advantages including server consolidation, service migration, and higher service reliability. But they have also ended up with some challenges including a sacrifice in performance and more complex system management.
   Some of these advantages and challenges also apply to HPC in virtualized environments. In this paper, we analyze the effectiveness of using virtual machines in a high performance computing (HPC) environment. We propose adding some virtual machine capability to already robust HPC environments for specific scenarios where the productivity gained outweighs the performance lost for using virtual machines. Finally, we discuss an implementation of augmenting virtual machines into the software stack of a HPC cluster, and we analyze the affect on job launch time of this implementation.

SO INTERPRETER AND TRANSLATOR TRAINER
AB The growing need to improve the quality and efficiency of translation by using technology has stimulated the practice of and research into translation technology teaching (TTT). Naturally, there is a need to analyse the state of the art and development of TTT from a quantitative perspective, because such research is still very scarce. This paper uses the bibliometric technologies, CiteSpace and VOSviewer in particular, to delineate the publication information of TTT-related research mainly in two citation databases, i.e., Web of Science (WoS) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), from the year 1999 to 2020. It finds that China is gaining importance in TTT-related research, that international English-language publications pay more attention to the teaching of MTPE, while Chinese-language publications focus more on corpus-based TTT, and that English publications tend to use empirical methods, while Chinese publications tend to adopt non-empirical methods. The differences between the two publication communities in research methods and focuses call for contact and exchange between the two communities.

AB This article presents a new French Sign Language (LSF) corpus called Rosetta-LSF. It was created to support future studies on the automatic translation of written French into LSF, rendered through the animation of a virtual signer. An overview of the field highlights the importance of a quality representation of LSF. In order to obtain quality animations understandable by signers, it must surpass the simple "gloss transcription" of the LSF lexical units to use in the discourse. To achieve this, we designed a corpus composed of four types of aligned data, and evaluated its usability. These are: news headlines in French, translations of these headlines into LSF in the form of videos showing animations of a virtual signer, gloss annotations of the "traditional" type-although including additional information on the context in which each gestural unit is performed as well as their potential for adaptation to another context-and AZee representations of the videos, i.e. formal expressions capturing the necessary and sufficient linguistic information. This article describes this data, exhibiting an example from the corpus. It is available online for public research.

AB Metric learning has drawn great interests for the last decade in the field of computer vision and machine learning. In this paper, we address the importance of the translation invariance (TI) of a metric. Intuitively, translation invariance should be a fundamental requirement for any reasonable image metric, but few metric learning or subspace methods are aware of the TI property when dealing with images. We propose to solve the quadratic metric learning problem in the transform domain based on the result of [1]. The solution is guaranteed to be translation invariant. The TI assumption simplifies the optimization problems considerably. Specifically, it reduces the number of optimization parameters from of O(n2) to O(n); it turns the semi-definite constraint on a matrix to a bound constraint on a function; it applies to multi-dimensional data without having to be stacked to vectors. Experimental results show that the TI solutions are generally on par with the non-TI solutions. Specifically, the TI solutions usually favor small sample size and small reduction dimension. The framework proposed for quadratic metric learning and linear subspace method seems quite promising.

AB In this paper, we design a user-support system for vision information using smart phones. When the user takes a picture of a target using the smart phone camera, our system can recognize the image of the target and recommend a suitable service to the user. The system with executes simple image analysis and determines a suitable service for the target image. The simple image analysis can extract 13 parameters (e.g., color information (RGB), number of intersections, depth of intersection, line width, and line depth). We use machine learning to classify the parameters into each service. In our research, we use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a learning machine tool. Our system design provides user support for several services such as translation, barcode readers, and diagnosis of skin images and demonstrates the effectiveness of our research.

AB The use of machine tools within the framework of high speed machining puts heavy demands on the material structure, thus generating damaging vibrations during machining phases. Two complementary methods can be planned to improve the dynamic behaviour:
   - Mechanical solution (rigidify, ...)
   - Taking the dynamic behaviour into account by a judicious control law. It is this second method that we explore. In this paper, we propose:
   - Firstly, to explore the classic industrial control methods based on a PI controller and filtering methods applied to translation resonant load.
   - Secondly to explain how, starting from a strategy of Behaviour Model Control, we can make the whole chain rigid, thus making it possible to obtain significant dynamic performances and a higher degree of accuracy. This Behaviour Model Control, based on the techniques of pole assignment, constrains the flexible process to behave like the model.

AB Multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) aims to translate multiple languages with a single model and has been proved successful thanks to effective knowledge transfer among different languages with shared parameters. However, it is still an open question which parameters should be shared and which ones need to be task-specific. Currently, the common practice is to heuristically design or search language-specific modules, which is difficult to find the optimal configuration. In this paper, we propose a novel parameter differentiation based method that allows the model to determine which parameters should be language-specific during training. Inspired by cellular differentiation, each shared parameter in our method can dynamically differentiate into more specialized types. We further define the differentiation criterion as inter-task gradient similarity. Therefore, parameters with conflicting inter-task gradients are more likely to be language-specific. Extensive experiments on multilingual datasets have demonstrated that our method significantly outperforms various strong baselines with different parameter sharing configurations. Further analyses reveal that the parameter sharing configuration obtained by our method correlates well with the linguistic proximities.

TI Data augmentation for low-resource languages NMT guided by constrained
   sampling
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB Data augmentation (DA) is a ubiquitous approach for several text generation tasks. Intuitively, in the machine translation paradigm, especially in low-resource languages scenario, many DA methods have appeared. The most commonly used methods are building pseudocorpus by randomly sampling, omitting, or replacing some words in the text. However, previous approaches hardly guarantee the quality of augmented data. In this study, we try to augment the corpus by introducing a constrained sampling method. Additionally, we also build the evaluation framework to select higher quality data after augmentation. Namely, we use the discriminator submodel to mitigate syntactic and semantic errors to some extent. Experimental results show that our augmentation method consistently outperforms all the previous state-of-the-art methods on both small and large-scale corpora in eight language pairs from four corpora by 2.38-4.18 bilingual evaluation understudy points.

That software was firstly developed as PC-FIL 2.0 to control a 8-axes filament winder including the rotation of the mandrel, two translations and one rotation of the feed-eye and at last, two translations and two rotations of the heating head. The motions of both the feed-eye and the heating head were completely dissociated. /1/. This paper shows the simplifications realised to reduce from eight to five the number of axes to control. The controlling software PC-FIL 2.1 generates data for programming the control unit and also provides the user with simulation facilities, to visualize the process. The present version of PC-FIL 2.1 is available for revolution vessels of general shape.

AB Machine reading comprehension is a question answering mechanism in which a machine reads, understands, and answers questions from a given text. These reasoning skills can be sufficiently grafted into the Korean College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) to bring about new scientific and educational advances. In this paper, we propose a novel Korean CSAT Question and Answering (KCQA) model and effectively utilize four easy data augmentation strategies with round trip translation to augment the insufficient data in the training dataset. To evaluate the effectiveness of KCQA, 30 students appeared for the test under conditions identical to the proposed model. Our qualitative and quantitative analysis along with experimental results revealed that KCQA achieved better performance than humans with a higher F1 score of 3.86.

TI Auto-correlation wavelet support vector machine
SO IMAGE AND VISION COMPUTING
AB A support vector machine (SVM) with the auto-correlation of a compactly supported wavelet as a kernel is proposed in this paper. The authors prove that this kernel is an admissible support vector kernel. The main advantage of the auto-correlation of a compactly supported wavelet is that it satisfies the translation invariance property, which is very important for its use in signal processing. Also, we can choose a better wavelet by selecting from different wavelet families for our auto-correlation wavelet kernel. This is because for different applications we should choose wavelet filters selectively for the autocorrelation kernel. We should not always select the same wavelet fllters independent of the application, as we demonstrate. Experiments on signal regression and pattern recognition show that this kernel is a feasible kernel for practical applications. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rapid growth in data, computational methods, and computing power is driving a remarkable revolution in what variously is termed machine learning (ML), statistical learning, computational learning, and artificial intelligence. In addition to highly visible successes in machine-based natural language translation, playing the game Go, and self-driving cars, these new technologies also have profound implications for computational and experimental science and engineering, as well as for the exascale computing systems that the Department of Energy (DOE) is developing to support those disciplines. Not only do these learning technologies open up exciting opportunities for scientific discovery on exascale systems, they also appear poised to have important implications for the design and use of exascale computers themselves, including high-performance computing (HPC) for ML and ML for HPC. The overarching goal of the ExaLearn co-design project is to provide exascale ML software for use by Exascale Computing Project (ECP) applications, other ECP co-design centers, and DOE experimental facilities and leadership class computing facilities.

AB Simultaneous interpretation, translation of the spoken word in real-time, is both highly challenging and physically demanding. Methods to predict interpreter confidence and the adequacy of the interpreted message have a number of potential applications, such as in computer-assisted interpretation interfaces or pedagogical tools. We propose the task of predicting simultaneous interpreter performance by building on existing methodology for quality estimation (QE) of machine translation output. In experiments over five settings in three language pairs, we extend a QE pipeline to estimate interpreter performance (as approximated by the METEOR evaluation metric) and propose novel features reflecting interpretation strategy and evaluation measures that further improve prediction accuracy.(1)

TI Reading Machines: On the Surface of Meaning - Beyond the Surface of
   Discourse
SO ARCADIA
AB Reading machines are technological devices promising to support or even perfect processes of reading. Although the concept of reading machines is almost as old as the notion of writing machines, it has received far less attention in literary and cultural studies. The following essay addresses this gap. The first part of the argument links the reading machine to Freud's definition of a tool. As a prosthesis connected to the human body and mind, a tool produces 'trouble at times': translation difficulties between the machine and its user affecting matters of materiality, discourse, and meaning alike. The reading machine embodies such 'trouble at times' that results from the paradox tension between machine and meaning. While the machine requires the mechanized processes to be unambiguous, the reading process is ambiguous by definition. Most of the reading machines invented in the past decades, do not take into account the trouble that results from such a tension: first and foremost, they serve to support reading processes mechanically. Yet, some of them stand out and hold a specific potential to stage such troubles and render the underlying tensions productive. The article discusses three of them, each of them focussing on a different aspect of the reading process: the first one is a 'pedagogical reading machine' (1767) concerned with the alphabetization process, the second one is an 'aesthetic reading machine' (1930) designed for reading literary texts, and the third one is a 'critical reading machine' (2007) that focuses on literary criticism.

AB The performance of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for natural language tasks including Machine Translation (MT) is crucially dependent on the reward formulation. This is due to the intrinsic difficulty of the task in the high-dimensional discrete action space as well as the sparseness of the standard reward functions defined for limited set of ground-truth sequences biased towards singular lexical choices. To address this issue, we formulate SURF, a maximally dense semantic-level unsupervised reward function which mimics human evaluation by considering both sentence fluency and semantic similarity. We demonstrate the strong potential of SURF to leverage a family of Actor-Critic Transformer-based Architectures with synchronous and asynchronous multi-agent variants. To tackle the problem of large action-state spaces, each agent is equipped with unique exploration strategies, promoting diversity during its exploration of the hypothesis space. When BLEU scores are compared, our dense unsupervised reward outperforms the standard sparse reward by 2% on average for in- and out-of-domain settings.

RN is a modeless method of unsupervised machine learning, what makes it a fairly simple but effective way of analyzing big amounts of data while keeping acceptable speed of execution and taking up little run-time space. In the first preparatory stage of our research, we discovered that RN gives better results than well-known K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) in some cases. We then extended our research to simulating the adjustments of floating radiuses, various volumes of the training data sets and ups and downs of the dimensions to tune RN for its optimum accuracy. We took experimental approach of not only extending the number of dimensions, but, instead, shrinking and modifying them in order to keep the predicted value' neighbors close by.

AB Information distillation aims to analyze and interpret large volumes of speech and text archives in multiple languages and produce structured information of interest to the user. In this work, we investigate cross-lingual information distillation, where non-English (source language) documents are searched for user queries that are in English (target language). We propose to perform distillation both on the original source language data and their English translations output by machine translation, and combine the two outputs. We experimentally show that combination approach results in 8% to 16% absolute (13% to 31% relative) F-measure improvement over the previous work.

TI REGISTER ALLOCATION OVER THE PROGRAM DEPENDENCE GRAPH
SO SIGPLAN NOTICES
AB This paper describes RAP, a Register Allocator that allocates registers over the Program Dependence Graph (PDG) representation of a program in a hierarchical manner. The PDG program representation has been used successfully for scalar optimizations, the detection and improvement of parallelism for vector machines, multiple processor machines, and machines that exhibit instruction level parallelism, as well as debugging, the integration of different versions of a program, and translation of imperative programs for data flow machines. By basing register allocation on the PDG, the register allocation phase may be more easily integrated and intertwined with other optimization analyses and transformations, In addition, the advantages of a hierarchical approach to global register allocation can be attained without constructing an additional structure used solely for register allocation.   Our experimental results have shown that on average, code allocated registers via RAP executed 2.7% faster than code allocated registers via a standard global register allocator

AB Compiling queries to machine code is a very efficient way for executing queries. One often overlooked problem with compilation is the time it takes to generate machine code. Even with fast compilation frameworks like LLVM, generating machine code for complex queries often takes hundreds of milliseconds. Such durations can be a major disadvantage for workloads that execute many complex, but quick queries. To solve this problem, we propose an adaptive execution framework, which dynamically switches from interpretation to compilation. We also propose a fast bytecode interpreter for LLVM, which can execute queries without costly translation to machine code and dramatically reduces the query latency. Adaptive execution is fine-grained, and can execute code paths of the same query using different execution modes. Our evaluation shows that this approach achieves optimal performance in a wide variety of settings-low latency for small data sets and maximum throughput for large data sizes.

This paper describes our submission (Team ID: CFILT-IITB) for the MultiIndicMT: An Indic Language Multilingual Task at WAT 2021. We train multilingual NMT systems by sharing encoder and decoder parameters with language embedding associated with each token in both encoder and decoder. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of transliteration (script conversion) for Indic languages in reducing the lexical gap for training a multilingual NMT system. Further, we show improvement in performance by training a multilingual NMT system using languages of the same family, i.e., related languages.

AB The relation between evolving mechanical faults in rotating electrical machines and their reflection in the machines' electrical parameters still requires a lot of research. This implies serious obstructions in the evolution of e.g. Motor Current Signature Analysis as a complete and reliable condition monitoring technology. This paper presents the translation of common bearing faults into specific rotor-stator movements using finite element modeling. Subsequently, a novel method to elucidate the complex relation between rotor movements and the electrical parameters of an induction machine using an experimental test setup is described, dimensioned and simulated. Replacing one of the induction machine's bearings with an Active Magnetic Bearing will give the opportunity to create specific rotor movements and consequently evaluate different programmable mechanical faults and their reflection in the stator current and/or voltage with high relevance and reproducibility.

AB Language Identification is an NLP task which aims at predicting the language of a given text. For the Arabic dialects many attempts have been done to address this topic. In this paper, we present our approach to build a Language Identification system in order to distinguish between Moroccan Colloquial Arabic and Arabic languages using two different methods. The first is rule-based and relies on stop word frequency, while the second is statically-based and uses several machine learning classifiers. Obtained results show that the statistical approach outperforms the rule-based approach. Furthermore, the Support Vector Machines classifier is more accurate than other statistical classifiers. Our goal in this paper is to pave the way toward building advanced Moroccan dialect NLP tools such as morphological analyzer and machine translation system.

TI Algorithmic Iteration for Computational Intelligence
SO MINDS AND MACHINES
AB Machine awareness is a disputed research topic, in some circles considered a crucial step in realising Artificial General Intelligence. Understanding what that is, under which conditions such feature could arise and how it can be controlled is still a matter of speculation. A more concrete object of theoretical analysis is algorithmic iteration for computational intelligence, intended as the theoretical and practical ability of algorithms to design other algorithms for actions aimed at solving well-specified tasks. We know this ability is already shown by current AIs, and understanding its limits is an essential step in qualifying claims about machine awareness and Super-AI. We propose a formal translation of algorithmic iteration in a fragment of modal logic, formulate principles of transparency and faithfulness across human and machine intelligence, and consider the relevance to theoretical research on (Super)-AI as well as the practical import of our results.

TI Spherical mandrelling method implementation on conventional machine
   tools
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS & MANUFACTURE
AB The paper presents a new method of finishing holes by means of plastic deformation referred to as spherical mandrelling (SM). The tool motion with respect to the fixed workpiece is a superposition of spherical and translation motion. The surface plastic deformation can be carried out on lathes, drilling and milling machines and machining centres and considerably widens their manufacturing potentials. The mechanics of the SM method has been-explained. Two model problems have been formulated and solved and their solutions show the SM kinematics when implemented on conventional machine tools. The solutions to the set variational problems are found by means of an approach called analogy to mass geometry. A simplified diagram of a device and tool for implementing the SM method on conventional machine tools has been shown. The power characteristics of SM process have been determined both theoretically and experimentally and rational operating conditions have been found. A new method of measuring small changes in the load of a.c. motors of machine tools has been presented. SM has been compared to conventional mandrelling and SM efficiency has been proved.

We describe the characteristics of these resources and the process of their creation in detail. We also report the results of various experiments on the performance of both lexicon- and machine learning-based models for Georgian sentiment classification. We consider both three- (positive, neutral, negative) and four-tier (positive, neutral, negative, mixed) classifications. The machine learning models explored include, logistic regression, support vector machines (SVMs), and transformer-based models. We also explore approaches based on transfer learning and translation (into a well-supported language). The results obtained for Georgian are on a par with state-of-the-art results in sentiment classification for well studied languages when using training data of comparable size.

We report magnetic probe measurements on our FIX machine, and the existence of toroidal field in the FRC plasma during its translation. The magnitude of the toroidal field is 100 approximately 150 G at the peak, and the direction of the toroidal field is counterclockwise looking toward the theta-pinch region, irrespective of the direction of the external axial field. The obtained toroidal field has a direction opposite to the toroidal field in FRX-C/LSM.

The Sinhala parsing system comprises of a Sinhal a morphological analyzer that connects with three dictionaries, namely, base dictionary, rule dictionary and concept dictionary. The morphological analyzer of the parsing system implements inflection and derivation rules of the Sinhala grammar, and provides grammatical information of the words to be considered by the parser. The current version of the parser is capable of handling simple and complex sentences of Sinhala language. The entire system has been developed using Java and SWI-Prolog that runs on both Linux and Windows.

At first, position, velocity and acceleration inverse solution models of machine driven by the outer translation pairs that contain parallelogram strut structures are developed, and the inverse dynamics model of the rigid body has been set up by means of virtual work principle. Based on above, making the mean square error of the trajectory of the moving platform least as the optimum goal, and considering the real-timely variational inertial load along with its pose at the same time, the overshoot, adjusting time of the unit step response of the servo system and the optimum range of PID parameters are given through simulations. At last, the correctness and effectiveness of the method are proved by the experiments.

Computer vision, speech recognition and language translation have all seen a near human level performance. We expect, in the near future, most business applications will have some form of ML. However, testing such applications is extremely challenging and would be very expensive if we follow today's methodologies. In this work, we present an articulation of the challenges in testing ML based applications. We then present our solution approach, based on the concept of Metamorphic Testing, which aims to identify implementation bugs in ML based image classifiers. We have developed metamorphic relations for an application based on Support Vector Machine and a Deep Learning based application. Empirical validation showed that our approach was able to catch 71% of the implementation bugs in the ML applications.

AB Deep learning is a rapidly growing research area having state of art achievement in various applications including but not limited to speech recognition, object recognition, machine translation, and image segmentation. In the current modern industrial manufacturing system, Machine Health Surveillance System (MHSS) is achieving increasing popularity because of the widespread availability of low cost sensors internet connectivity. Deep learning architecture gives useful tools to analyze and process these vast amounts of machinery data. In this paper, we review the latest deep learning techniques and their variant used for MHSS. We used Gearbox Fault Diagnosis dataset in this paper that contains the sets of vibration attributes recorded by SpectraQuest's Gearbox Fault Diagnostics Simulator. In addition, we used the variant of auto encoders for feature extraction to achieve higher accuracy in machine health surveillance. The results showed that the bagging ensemble classifier based on voting techniques achieved 99% accuracy.

Unlike previously published work on proof-producing compilation from a theorem prover, our compiler provides broad support for user-defined extensions, targets multiple carefully modelled commercial machine languages, and does not require termination proofs for input functions. As a case study, the compiler is used to construct verified interpreters for a small LISP-like language. The compiler has been implemented in the HOL4 theorem prover.

The system stiffness and workspace of the parallel manipulator are conducted in the paper. In order to locate the maximum system stiffness and workspace, single and multi objective optimizations are performed in terms of rotation angles in x and y axes and translation displacement in z axis with Genetic Algorithms. By optimizing the design variables including geometric dimensions of the manipulator, the system stiffness and workspace of the proposed parallel kinematic manipulator has been greatly improved.

AB Multilingual NMT has become an attractive solution for MT deployment in production. But to match bilingual quality, it comes at the cost of larger and slower models. In this work, we consider several ways to make multilingual NMT faster at inference without degrading its quality. We experiment with several "light decoder" architectures in two 20-language multi-parallel settings: small-scale on TED Talks and large-scale on ParaCrawl. Our experiments demonstrate that combining a shallow decoder with vocabulary filtering leads to more than x2 faster inference with no loss in translation quality. We validate our findings with BLEU and chrF (on 380 language pairs), robustness evaluation and human evaluation.

AB Automatic sentence simplification aims to reduce the complexity of vocabulary and expressions in a sentence while retaining its original meaning. We constructed a simplification model that does not require a parallel corpus using an unsupervised translation model. In order to learn simplification by unsupervised manner, we show that pseudo-corpus is constructed from the web corpus and that the corpus expansion contributes to output more simplified sentences. In addition, we confirm that it is possible to learn the operation of simplification by preparing large-scale pseudo data even if there is non-parallel corpus for simplification.

AB For the CLEF 2004 ImageCLEF St Andrew's Collection task the Dublin City University group carried out three sets of experiments: standard cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) runs using topic translation via machine translation (MT), combination of this run with image matching results from the GIFT/Viper system, and a novel document rescoring approach based on automatic MT evaluation metrics. Our standard MT-based CLIR works well on this task. Encouragingly combination with image matching lists is also observed to produce small positive changes in the retrieval output. However, rescoring using the MT evaluation metrics in their current form significantly reduced retrieval effectiveness.

AB CAPTCHA is a technique that is used to prevent automatic programs from being able to acquire free e-mail or online service accounts. However, as many researchers have already reported, conventional CAPTCHA could be overcome by state-of-the-art malware since the capabilities of computers are approaching those of humans. Therefore, CAPTCHA should be based on even more advanced human-cognitive-processing abilities. We propose using the human ability of recognizing "strangeness" to achieve a new CAPTCHA. This paper focuses on strangeness in machine-translated sentences as an example, and proposes CAPTCHA using Strangeness in Sentences (SS-CAPTCHA), which detects malware by checking if users can distinguish natural sentences created by humans from machine-translated sentences. We discuss possible threats to SS-CAPTCHA and countermeasures against these threats. We also carried out basic experiments to confirm its usability by human users.

AB Recently, the key issues of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications also known as Machine Type Communications (MTC) are widely discussed in 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). One of the key issues for MTC is the IP addressing issue. IPv6 address space is preferred to use in MTC. However, the private IPv4 addresses are used for current configurations. Thus, the Network Address Translation (NAT) traversal problem should be resolved for MTC in 3GPP architecture. In this paper, we introduce the architectures and call flows of three NAT traversal solutions defined in 3GPP 23.888. Those are the NAT Traversal through Tunneling (NATTT) solution, the Managed NAT solution and the Non-managed NAT solution. Then we propose an Enhanced Port Forwarding (EPF) solution to minimize the impacts on the MTC device and 3GPP core network. Finally, we analyze and compare the proposed EPF solution with the existing solutions.

AB A Support Vector Machine (SVM) with the auto-correlation of compactly supported wavelet as kernel is proposed in this paper. It is proved that this kernel is an admissible support vector kernel. The main advantage of the auto-correlation of a compactly supported wavelet is that it satisfies the translation invariant property, which is very important for signal processing. Also, we can choose a better wavelet from different choices of wavelet families for our auto- correlation wavelet kernel. Experiments on signal regression show that this method is better than the existing SVM function regression with the scalar wavelet kernel, the Gaussian kernel, and the exponential radial basis function kernel. It can be easily extended to other applications such as pattern recognition by using this newly developed auto- correlation wavelet SVM.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has made remarkable achievements in various fields. Especially, deep learning technology that is the representative technology of AI, showed high accuracy in speech recognition, image recognition, pattern recognition, natural language processing and translation. In addition, there are many interesting research results such as art, literature and music that cannot be distinguished whether it was made by human or AI. In the field of networks, attempts to solve problems that have not been able to be solved or complex problems using AI have started to become a global trend. However, there is a lack of data sets to apply machine learning to the network and it is difficult to know network problem to solve. So far, there have been a lot of efforts to study network machine learning, but there are few studies to make a necessary dataset. In this paper, we introduce basic network machine learning technology and propose a method to easily generate data for network machine learning. Based on the data generation framework proposed in this paper, the results of automatic generation of labelled data and the results of learning and inferencing from the corresponding dataset are also provided.

TI Intelligent Thai text-Thai sign translation for language learning
SO COMPUTERS & EDUCATION
AB We present the Intelligent Thai text - Thai sign translation for language learning ((ITSTL)-S-3). (ITSTL)-S-3 is able to translate Thai text into Thai sign language simply and conveniently anytime, anywhere. Thai sign language is the language of the deaf in Thailand. In the translation process, the distinction between Thai text and Thai sign language in both grammar and vocabulary are concerned in each processing step to ensure the accuracy of translation. (ITSTL)-S-3 was designed not only to be an automatic interpreter but also to be a language tutor assistant. It provides meaning of each word and describes the structure formation and word order of the translated sentence. With (ITSTL)-S-3, the deaf and hearing-impaired are able to enhance their communication ability and to improve their knowledge and learning skills. Moreover (ITSTL)-S-3 has increased motivation and opportunity for them to access multimedia and e-learning.
   In our initial experiment, (ITSTL)-S-3 was implemented to translate sentences/phrases which were collected from different sources including textbooks, cartoons, bedtime story, newspapers and the public labels. IT 3 STL was tested and evaluated in terms of the translation accuracy and user satisfaction. The evaluation results show that the translation accuracy and sign representation are acceptable, and it satisfies the users' needs. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Optical Character Recognition is the process of translating images of handwritten, typewritten, or printed text into a format understood by machines. The purposes of Optical Character Recognition are editing, indexing/searching, and reduction in storage size. This is achieved by first scanning the photo of the text character-by-character, then it is followed by analysis of the scanned image, and finally the translation of the character image into character codes, such as ASCII. In this paper, we have used segmentation algorithm to divide the image into lines, words and then characters. The characters are recognized using Convolutional Neural Network. The results obtained by Convolutional Neural Networks seems to be promising in recognizing the characters in comparison to results obtained through other machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Networks.

We create a corpus of 600K word pairs mined from parallel translation corpora and monolingual corpora, which is the largest transliteration corpora for Indian languages mined from public sources. We perform a detailed analysis of multilingual transliteration and propose an improved multilingual training pipeline for Indic languages. We analyse various factors affecting transliteration quality like language family, transliteration direction and word origin.

The work presented in this paper aims at developing a robust system for automatic translation of static gestures of alphabets. The proposed methods used the Support Vector Machine classifier and features extracted from a novel signature, Inner-Centroid Distance. In the experiments, a comparison between the proposed methods and Zernike moments is performed by using a public sign database. Experiments show that the proposed approach is effective and simple to implement.

AB Dravidian languages, such as Kannada and Tamil, are notoriously difficult to translate by state-of-the-art neural models. This stems from the fact that these languages are morphologically very rich as well as being lowresourced. In this paper, we focus on subword segmentation and evaluate Linguistically Motivated Vocabulary Reduction (LMVR) against the more commonly used SentencePiece (SP) for the task of translating from English into four different Dravidian languages. Additionally we investigate the optimal subword vocabulary size for each language. We find that SP is the overall best choice for segmentation, and that larger subword vocabulary sizes lead to higher translation quality.

SO INFORMATION AND COMPUTATION
AB In this paper we summarise Safe, a first-order functional language for programming small devices and embedded systems with strict memory requirements, which has been introduced elsewhere. It has some unusual memory management features such as heap regions and explicit cell deallocation. It is targeted at a Proof Carrying Code environment, and consistently with this aim the Safe compiler provides machine checkable certificates about important safety properties such as the absence of dangling pointers and bounded memory consumption.
   The kernel of the paper is devoted to developing part of the Safe compiler's back-end, by deriving an appropriate abstract machine from the language semantics, by providing the code generation functions, and by formally proving that the translation is sound, both in the semantic and in the memory consumption senses.

AB Character recognition also truncated to OCR (Optical Character Recognition), is the translation of images: handwritten, typewritten (either mechanically or electronically), or even just a simple text printed into a machine-editable text. Among them, one of the most relevant types is handwritten character recognition. Each handwritten content is composed of symbols, alphabets, etc. that are very syllabic with a distinct font style. Character recognition is achieved through segmentation, feature extraction, and classification, by using any one the machine learning methods thereby making tremendous advancements. This paper keenly focuses on the recognition of handwritten Kannada alphabets. Different machine learning classification strategies have known to be applied to achieve this recognition. Although, in this paper, we mostly center around the procedures dependency on the solution provided by Support Vector Machine(SVM) classifiers using Python. For simplicity, we focus on only four Kannada alphabets in this paper.

Self-adjustment module has 2 degrees of freedom of translation motion and 3 degrees of freedom of rotation by porous air bearing and spring to compensate for alignment error automatically. The allowable alignment error and proper inserting force to assembly lens parts successfully was investigated and evaluated compared to conventional lens assembly machine and also optimum orientation of each lens to minimize lens aberration is examined through experiment. Self-adjustment module guarantees accurate arrangement of lens parts during assembly process in spite of alignment error so that remarkable price reduction and miniaturization of assembly machine could be achieved.

AB As devices proliferate, the ability for us to interact with them in an intuitive and meaningful way becomes increasingly challenging. In this paper we take the typical home as an experimental environment to investigate the challenges and potential solutions arising from ever-increasing device proliferation and complexity. We show a potential solution based on conversational interactions between "things" in the environment where those things can be either machine devices or human users. Our key innovation is the use of a Controlled Natural Language (CNL) technology as the underpinning information representation language for both machine and human agents, enabling humans and machines to trivially "read" the information being exchanged. The core CNL is augmented with a conversational protocol enabling different speech acts to be exchanged within the system. This conversational layer enables key contextual information to be conveyed, as well as providing a mechanism for translation from the core CNL to other forms, such as device specific API requests, or more easily consumable human representations. Our goal is to show that a single, uniform language can support machine-machine, machine-human, human-machine and human-human interaction in a dynamic environment that is able to rapidly evolve to accommodate new devices and capabilities as they are encountered.

AB The globalization of the information exchange made possible by the Internet and the World Wide Web has led to an increasing demand for translation and other language-enabled tools and services. Developers of Machine Translation (MT) systems are best positioned to address the international community ever growing need for information processing technologies. Today Logos offers its MT technology in a relational model on NT and Unix servers with net-centric Java clients. The new model realized in Logos8 is also preparing the system for use on the Internet as an information-gathering utility. This paper describes the new Logos8 system and presents the product developments made possible by the new system.

AB Machine learning has shown promise for automatic detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through speech; however, efforts are hampered by a scarcity of data, especially in languages other than English. We propose a method to learn a correspondence between independently engineered lexicosyntactic features in two languages, using a large parallel corpus of out-of-domain movie dialogue data. We apply it to dementia detection in Mandarin Chinese, and demonstrate that our method outperforms both unilingual and machine translation-based baselines. This appears to be the first study that transfers feature domains in detecting cognitive decline.

AB Back-translation (BT) of target monolingual corpora is a widely used data augmentation strategy for neural machine translation (NMT), especially for low-resource language pairs. To improve effectiveness of the available BT data, we introduce HintedBT-a family of techniques which provides hints (through tags) to the encoder and decoder. First, we propose a novel method of using both high and low quality BT data by providing hints (as source tags on the encoder) to the model about the quality of each source-target pair. We don't filter out low quality data but instead show that these hints enable the model to learn effectively from noisy data. Second, we address the problem of predicting whether a source token needs to be translated or transliterated to the target language, which is common in cross-script translation tasks (i.e., where source and target do not share the written script). For such cases, we propose training the model with additional hints (as target tags on the decoder) that provide information about the operation required on the source (translation or both translation and transliteration). We conduct experiments and detailed analyses on standard WMT benchmarks for three cross-script low/medium-resource language pairs: {Hindi,Gujarati,Tamil}!English. Our methods compare favorably with five strong and well established baselines. We show that using these hints, both separately and together, significantly improves translation quality and leads to state-of-the-art performance in all three language pairs in corresponding bilingual settings.

AB Deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many artificial intelligence areas, such as object recognition, speech recognition, and machine translation. While deep neural networks have high expression capabilities, they are prone to over fitting due to the high dimensionalities of the networks. In recent applications, deep neural networks have been found to be unstable in adversarial perturbations, which are small but can increase the network's prediction errors. This paper proposes a novel training algorithm to improve the robustness of the neural networks in adversarial examples.

In this paper we propose an XML Schema and semantic based relational data translation approach, which aims at providing a coherent and meaningful view of the relational data and enabling distributed users to cooperate on large data volumes online. We define a directed-graph data model as the common data model, present a key-based relational schema reverse reconstruction arithmetic to capture the full structures and semantic constraints in relational schema, and propose a constraints-preserving mapping algorithm to translate relational data into the global XML representations.

AB We present a first attempt to perform attentional word segmentation directly from the speech signal, with the final goal to automatically identify lexical units in a low-resource, unwritten language (UL). Our methodology assumes a pairing between recordings in the UL with translations in a well-resourced language. It uses Acoustic Unit Discovery (AUD) to convert speech into a sequence of pseudo-phones that is segmented using neural soft-alignments produced by a neural machine translation model. Evaluation uses an actual Bantu UL, Mboshi; comparisons to monolingual and bilingual baselines illustrate the potential of attentional word segmentation for language documentation.

   Language Processing
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In natural language processing, semantic document exchange ensures unambiguity and shares the same meaning for documents sender and receiver cross different natural languages (e.g., English to Chinese), this difference makes the translation between natural languages becomes complex and inaccurate. This paper proposed a novel framework of Context-Free Machine Universal Grammar which consists of local mode (sender and receiver) and mediation mode (Machine Universal Language) based on the concept of collaboration, the framework improves semantic unambiguity and accuracy in crossing language document, meanwhile makes document computer-readable through unique ID for each word or phrase. More importantly, inspired by grammatical case in linguistics, a novel Machine Universal Grammar provides a universal grammar that accepts all coming languages and improves semantic accuracy in natural language processing.

AB Transliteration is a common translation method when named entities are introduced into another language. Direct orthographical mapping (DOM) approach is successfully applied in machine transliteration by segmenting a word according to syllables and then mapping them directly into target language without considering its pronunciation. The paper studies the performance of two-stage machine transliteration based on Conditional Random Fields. To reduce the amount of computation in model training, we propose an error-driven learning by dividing the training data into several groups and training the transliteration model step by step based on the error prediction data until the performance doesn't increase or the limitation of the computer. Experiments on data of NEWS2011 show that error-driven model training reduces computational complexity and saves the time of model training. Compared to the combining transliteration model, our transliteration system increases the accuracy of top-1 output with 0.06, reaching 0.652.

This combination is extremely powerful for scientific discovery as well as translation into clinical practice. Several topics where TBI research is at the leading edge are 1) the use of large-scale biobanks linked to electronic health records, 2) pharmacogenomics, and 3) artificial intelligence and machine learning. This perspective discusses these three topics and points to the important elements for driving precision medicine into the future.

A formal method for automatic generation of programs is developed around this model. The method starts from modeling the desired behavior of the system under design by means of a UML-based state machine with the ability to measure time, and ends up with a complete program written in one of the IEC 1131 languages. The translation process is done automatically, and the semantics of the resulting program is isomorphic to the semantics of the model.

Here, we present in vitro and in vivo evidence that the a/eIF2 gamma-subunit exhibits an additional function with resemblance to the eukaryotic cap-complex. It binds to the 5'-triphosphate end of mRNA and protects the 5' part from degradation. This unprecedented capacity of the archaeal initiation factor further indicates that 5' -> 3' directional mRNA decay is a pathway common to all domains of life.

We describe a syntactic transformation model based on the probabilistic context-free grammar. This model is trained by using bilingual corpus and a broad coverage parser of the source language. This phrase-based SMT approach is applicable to language pairs in which the target language is poor in resources. We considered translation from English to Vietnamese and from English to French. Our experiments showed significant BLEU-score improvements in comparison with Pharaoh, a state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT system.

SO JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME
AB Aerospace, die, and mold industries utilize parts with sculptured surfaces, which are machined on five-axis computer numerical controlled machine tools. Accurate path tracking for contouring is not always possible along the desired space curves due to the loss of joint coordination during the five-axis motion. This two-part paper presents modeling and robust control of contouring errors for five-axis machines. In Part I, two types of contouring errors are defined by considering the normal deviation of tool tip from the reference path, and by the normal deviation of the tool axis orientation from the reference orientation trajectory defined in the spherical coordinates. Overall contouring errors are modeled during five-axis motion that has simultaneous translation and rotary motions. The coupled kinematic configuration and the rigid body dynamics of all five drives are considered. The contouring error model is experimentally validated on a five-axis machine tool. The error model developed in this paper is then used for simultaneous, real-time robust control of all five drives in Part II.

TI Development of machine translation technology for assisting health
   communication: A systematic review
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS
AB Objectives: To (1) characterize how machine translation (MT) is being developed to overcome language barriers in health settings; and (2) based on evaluations presented in the literature, determine which MT approaches show evidence of promise and what steps need to be taken to encourage adoption of MT technologies in health settings.
   Materials & methods: We performed a systematic literature search covering 2006-2016 in major health, engineering, and computer science databases. After removing duplicates, two levels of screening identified 27 articles for full text review and analysis. Our review and qualitative analysis covered application setting, target users, underlying technology, whether MT was used in isolation or in combination with human editing, languages tested, evaluation methods, findings, and identified gaps.
   Results: Of 27 studies, a majority focused on MT systems for use in clinical settings (n = 18), and eight of these involved speech-based MT systems for facilitating patient-provider communications. Text-based MT systems (n = 19) aimed at generating a range of multilingual health materials. Almost a third of all studies (n = 8) pointed to MT's potential as a starting point before human input. Studies employed a variety of human and automatic MT evaluation methods. In comparison studies, statistical machine translation (SMT) systems were more accurate than rule-based systems when large corpora were available. For a variety of systems, performance was best for translations of simple, less technical sentences and from English to Western European languages. Only one system has been fully deployed.
   Conclusions: MT is currently being developed primarily through pilot studies to improve multilingual communication in health settings and to increase access to health resources for a variety of languages. However, continued concerns about accuracy limit the deployment of MT systems in these settings. The variety of piloted systems and the lack of shared evaluation criteria will likely continue to impede adoption in health settings, where excellent accuracy and a strong evidence base are critical. Greater translation accuracy and use of standard evaluation criteria would encourage deployment of MT into health settings. For now, the literature points to using MT in health communication as an initial step to be followed by human correction.

We conduct an analysis of the impact of those features on other subsets of features (prosody, words...) when combined through CRFs. The syntactic cues can help characterizing large syntactic patterns such as appositions and lists which are not necessarily marked by prosody.

AB Industrial knitting machines can produce finely detailed, seamless, 3D surfaces quickly and without human intervention. However, the tools used to program them require detailed manipulation and understanding of low-level knitting operations. We present a compiler that can automatically turn assemblies of high-level shape primitives (tubes, sheets) into low-level machine instructions. These high-level shape primitives allow knit objects to be scheduled, scaled, and otherwise shaped in ways that require thousands of edits to low-level instructions. At the core of our compiler is a heuristic transfer planning algorithm for knit cycles, which we prove is both sound and complete. This algorithm enables the translation of high-level shaping and scheduling operations into needle-level operations. We show a wide range of examples produced with our compiler and demonstrate a basic visual design interface that uses our compiler as a backend.

SO COGNITIVE COMPUTATION
AB The maximum entropy (ME) method is a powerful supervised machine learning technique that is useful for various tasks. In this paper, we introduce new studies that successfully employ ME for natural language processing (NLP) problems including machine translation and information extraction. Specifically, we demonstrate, using simulation results, three applications of ME for NLP: estimation of categories, extraction of important features, and correction of error data items. We also evaluate the comparative performance of the proposed ME methods with other state-of-the-art approaches.

TI Alignment-Supervised Bidimensional Attention-Based Recursive
   Autoencoders for Bilingual Phrase Representation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS
AB Exploiting semantic interactions between the source and target linguistic items at different levels of granularity is crucial for generating compact vector representations for bilingual phrases. To achieve this, we propose alignment-supervised bidimensional attention-based recursive autoencoders (ABattRAE) in this paper. ABattRAE first individually employs two recursive autoencoders to recover hierarchical tree structures of bilingual phrase, and treats the subphrase covered by each node on the tree as a linguistic item. Unlike previous methods, ABattRAE introduces a bidimensional attention network to measure the semantic matching degree between linguistic items of different languages, which enables our model to integrate information from all nodes by dynamically assigning varying weights to their corresponding embeddings. To ensure the accuracy of the generated attention weights in the attention network, ABattRAE incorporates word alignments as supervision signals to guide the learning procedure. Using the general stochastic gradient descent algorithm, we train our model in an end-to-end fashion, where the semantic similarity of translation equivalents is maximized while the semantic similarity of nontranslation pairs is minimized. Finally, we incorporate a semantic feature based on the learned bilingual phrase representations into a machine translation system for better translation selection. Experimental results on NIST Chinese-English and WMT English-German test sets show that our model achieves substantial improvements of up to 2.86 and 1.09 BLEU points over the baseline, respectively. Extensive in-depth analyses demonstrate the superiority of our model in learning bilingual phrase embeddings.

TI Specialised ribosomes as versatile regulators of gene expression
SO RNA BIOLOGY
AB The ribosome has long been thought to be a homogeneous cellular machine that constitutively and globally synthesises proteins from mRNA. However, recent studies have revealed that ribosomes are highly heterogeneous, dynamic macromolecular complexes with specialised roles in translational regulation in many organisms across the kingdoms. In this review, we summarise the current understanding of ribosome heterogeneity and the specialised functions of heterogeneous ribosomes. We also discuss specialised translation systems that utilise orthogonal ribosomes.

TI Analysing patterns of right brain-hemisphere activity prior to speech
   articulation for identification of system-directed speech
SO SPEECH COMMUNICATION
AB Autonomous speech-enabled applications such as speech-to-speech machine translation, conversational agents, and spoken dialogue systems need to be able to distinguish system-directed user input from "off-talk" to function appropriately. "Off-talk" occurs when users speak to themselves or to others, often causing the system to mistakenly respond to speech that was not directed to it. Automatic detection of off-talk could help prevent such errors, and make the user's interaction with the system more natural. It has been observed that speech in human-human dialogue and in soliloquy is prosodically different from speech directed at machines, and that the right hemisphere of the human brain is the locus of control of speech prosody. In this study, we explore human brain activity prior to speech articulation alone and in combination with prosodic features to create models for off-talk prediction. The proposed EEG based models are a step towards improving response time in detecting system-directed speech in comparison with audio-based methods of detection, opening new possibilities for the integration of brain-computer interface techniques into interactive speech systems.

AB A laser interferometer, a vision system, and 1-D precision translation stage are used to develop a high precision measuring station with a working range of 12 mm. The object inspected by the laser-and-vision system is moved using a linear translation stage (LUMINOS INDUSTRIES I1000 - 1-Axis Stage) so that the camera can take images of the feature points of the object at two (or more) different positions. Meanwhile, the displacement of the table is measured using a laser interferometer. Putting these two feature points successively in focus the distance between them can be evaluated and adding the displacement measured by the laser interferometer, the real distance between these two feature points is obtained. The developed 1-D laser-and-vision measuring system is used to measure the geometric size (pitch) of grating type linear encoders or industrial line scales. Software counts automatically the number of lines and the laser interferometer produces the corresponding length. For dial instruments the vision machine observes the coincidence of the moving needle with divisions representing (sub) units of length. The displacements measured by laser interferometer are compared with dial indicator and the measuring errors are observed.

AB This study focuses on the properties of Human-to-Human (H2H) communication in spontaneous dialogues in two different settings. Direct H2H dialogues are compared to the ones that are mediated by a Speech-to-Speech machine translation system. For the analysis, dialogues from the HCRC Map Task Corpus, for direct H2H conversations, and dialogues from the ILMT-s2s Corpus, for computer mediated conversations, were used. In the conversations speakers take the roles of information giver and follower and all the utterances are labelled as instructions, questions or statement, etc. While direct H2H communication enables speakers also to benefit from non-verbal acts, gestures and facial expressions, machine mediated conversation is more complex for the interlocutors. Due to errors made by speech recognition system, speakers adapt their speaking style and also apply repair strategies in order to accomplish the tasks successfully. Comparing the two corpora showed that in the case of computer mediated communication the utterances of the speakers contained less words than in the case of direct H2H interaction where utterances were longer. Also, different word count was found depending on the role of the speaker as well as on the type of the utterance.

AB The last decade has witnessed a dramatic growth of social networks, such as Twitter, Sina Microblog, etc. Messages/ short texts on these platforms are generally of limited length, causing difficulties for machines to understand. Moreover, it is rarely possible for users to read and understand all the content due to the large quantity. So it is imperative to cluster and extract the viewpoints of these short texts. To solve this, the representation of a word is enriched with additional features from external, but it is demanding in terms of computational and time resources. In this paper, we proposed OnSeS, a novel short text summarization method which makes full use of word2vec to represent a word and utilizes neural network model to generate each word of the summary. OnSeS consists of three phrases: 1) clustering short texts using the k-means algorithm; 2) ranking content of each cluster by building a graph-based ranking model using BM25; 3) generating main point of each cluster with the help of neural machine translation model on the top ranked sentence. The experimental results reveal that our proposed fully data-driven approach outperforms state-of-the-art method.

TI Image classification using separable invariant moments of
   Charlier-Meixner and support vector machine
SO MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB In this paper, we propose a new method for image classification by the content in heterogeneous databases. This approach is based on the use of new series of separable discrete orthogonal moments as shape descriptors and the Support Vector Machine as classifier. In fact, the proposed descriptors moments are defined from the bivariate discrete orthogonal polynomials of Charlier-Meixner which are invariant to translation, scaling and rotation of the image. We also propose a new algorithm to accelerate the image classification process. This algorithm is based on two steps: the first step is the fast computation of the values of Charlier-Meixner polynomials by using a new recurrence relationship between the values of polynomials Charlier-Meixner. The second one is the new image representation and slice blocks. The proposed method is tested on three different sets of standard data which are well known to computer vision: COIL-100, 256-CALTECH and Corel. The simulation results show the invariance of the discrete orthogonal separable moments of Charlier-Meixner against the various geometric transformations and the ability for the classification of heterogeneous images.

TI Deep learning of the back-splicing code for circular RNA formation
SO BIOINFORMATICS
AB Motivation: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a new class of endogenous RNAs in animals and plants. During pre-RNA splicing, the 50 and 30 termini of exon(s) can be covalently ligated to form circRNAs through back-splicing (head-to-tail splicing). CircRNAs can be conserved across species, show tissue-and developmental stage-specific expression patterns, and may be associated with human disease. However, the mechanism of circRNA formation is still unclear although some sequence features have been shown to affect back-splicing.
   Results: In this study, by applying the state-of-art machine learning techniques, we have developed the first deep learning model, DeepCirCode, to predict back-splicing for human circRNA formation. DeepCirCode utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) with nucleotide sequence as the input, and shows superior performance over conventional machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine and random forest. Relevant features learnt by DeepCirCode are represented as sequence motifs, some of which match human known motifs involved in RNA splicing, transcription or translation. Analysis of these motifs shows that their distribution in RNA sequences can be important for back-splicing. Moreover, some of the human motifs appear to be conserved in mouse and fruit fly. The findings provide new insight into the back-splicing code for circRNA formation.

TI Reaching the End-Game for GWAS: Machine Learning Approaches for the
   Prioritization of Complex Disease Loci
SO FRONTIERS IN GENETICS
AB Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed thousands of genetic loci that underpin the complex biology of many human traits. However, the strength of GWAS - the ability to detect genetic association by linkage disequilibrium (LD) - is also its limitation. Whilst the ever-increasing study size and improved design have augmented the power of GWAS to detect effects, differentiation of causal variants or genes from other highly correlated genes associated by LD remains the real challenge. This has severely hindered the biological insights and clinical translation of GWAS findings. Although thousands of disease susceptibility loci have been reported, causal genes at these loci remain elusive. Machine learning (ML) techniques offer an opportunity to dissect the heterogeneity of variant and gene signals in the post-GWAS analysis phase. ML models for GWAS prioritization vary greatly in their complexity, ranging from relatively simple logistic regression approaches to more complex ensemble models such as random forests and gradient boosting, as well as deep learning models, i.e., neural networks. Paired with functional validation, these methods show important promise for clinical translation, providing a strong evidence-based approach to direct post-GWAS research. However, as ML approaches continue to evolve to meet the challenge of causal gene identification, a critical assessment of the underlying methodologies and their applicability to the GWAS prioritization problem is needed. This review investigates the landscape of ML applications in three parts: selected models, input features, and output model performance, with a focus on prioritizations of complex disease associated loci. Overall, we explore the contributions ML has made towards reaching the GWAS end-game with consequent wide-ranging translational impact.

TI Evolution of Gaussian Process kernels for machine translation
   post-editing effort estimation
SO ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB In many Natural Language Processing problems the combination of machine learning and optimization techniques is essential. One of these problems is the estimation of the human effort needed to improve a text that has been translated using a machine translation method. Recent advances in this area have shown that Gaussian Processes can be effective in post-editing effort prediction. However, Gaussian Processes require a kernel function to be defined, the choice of which highly influences the quality of the prediction. On the other hand, the extraction of features from the text can be very labor-intensive, although recent advances in sentence embedding have shown that this process can be automated. In this paper, we use a Genetic Programming algorithm to evolve kernels for Gaussian Processes to predict post-editing effort based on sentence embeddings. We show that the combination of evolutionary optimization and Gaussian Processes removes the need for a-priori specification of the kernel choice, and, by using a multi-objective variant of the Genetic Programming approach, kernels that are suitable for predicting several metrics can be learned. We also investigate the effect that the choice of the sentence embedding method has on the kernel learning process.

AB To enable lightly staffed or fully autonomous machining operations, it is essential that both the condition of the cutter and the health of the machine tool system be known. In this paper, the health of the spindle positioning drive (Z axis) on a Proteo D/94 precision machining center is investigated using time, frequency and time-frequency techniques. Investigated is a cogging phenomenon produced as a result of the DC servomotor brushes sticking due to poor design. This incipient fault reduces the accuracy and controllability of the machine tool, and always leads to total drive failure. Thus, it is important to determine the fault signature of the drive so that corrective action may be taken before failure can occur, permanently damaging both the motor and the workpiece. The vibratory signatures of both a healthy and a faulty spindle during translation are analyzed. It is shown that a spindle under fault conditions behaves differently from a healthy one, and that time and time-frequency domain methods provide useful information on the status of the system. This paper lays the groundwork for the development of a future machine condition monitoring system, which can be easily retrofitted to any machine tool system.

TI SG-Net: Syntax Guided Transformer for Language Representation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Understanding human language is one of the key themes of artificial intelligence. For language representation, the capacity of effectively modeling the linguistic knowledge from the detail-riddled and lengthy texts and getting ride of the noises is essential to improve its performance. Traditional attentive models attend to all words without explicit constraint, which results in inaccurate concentration on some dispensable words. In this work, we propose using syntax to guide the text modeling by incorporating explicit syntactic constraints into attention mechanisms for better linguistically motivated word representations. In detail, for self-attention network (SAN) sponsored Transformer-based encoder, we introduce syntactic dependency of interest (SDOI) design into the SAN to form an SDOI-SAN with syntax-guided self-attention. Syntax-guided network (SG-Net) is then composed of this extra SDOI-SAN and the SAN from the original Transformer encoder through a dual contextual architecture for better linguistics inspired representation. The proposed SG-Net is applied to typical Transformer encoders. Extensive experiments on popular benchmark tasks, including machine reading comprehension, natural language inference, and neural machine translation show the effectiveness of the proposed SG-Net design.

AB Encoder pre-training is promising in end-to-end Speech Translation (ST), given the fact that speech-to-translation data is scarce. But ST encoders are not simple instances of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Machine Translation (MT) encoders. For example, we find that ASR encoders lack the global context representation, which is necessary for translation, whereas MT encoders are not designed to deal with long but locally attentive acoustic sequences. In this work, we propose a Stacked Acoustic-and-Textual Encoding (SATE) method for speech translation. Our encoder begins with processing the acoustic sequence as usual, but later behaves more like an MT encoder for a global representation of the input sequence. In this way, it is straightforward to incorporate the pre-trained models into the system. Also, we develop an adaptor module to alleviate the representation inconsistency between the pre-trained ASR encoder and MT encoder, and develop a multi-teacher knowledge distillation method to preserve the pre-training knowledge. Experimental results on the LibriSpeech En-Fr and MuST-C En-De ST tasks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art BLEU scores of 18.3 and 25.2. To our knowledge, we are the first to develop an end-to-end ST system that achieves comparable or even better BLEU performance than the cascaded ST counterpart when large-scale ASR and MT data is available(1).

AB In many spoken language understanding systems (SLUS), domain classification is the most crucial component, as system responses based on wrong domains often yield very unpleasant user experiences. In multi-lingual domain classification, the training data for some poor-resource languages often comes from machine translation. Some of the higher order n-gram features are distorted during machine translation. Feature co-occurrence becomes reliable feature in multi-lingual domain classification. In this paper, in order to effectively model feature co-occurrences, we propose Factorization Networks that are combinations of Factorization Machines (FMs) with Neural Networks (NNs). FNs extend the linear connections from the input feature layer to the hidden layer in NNs to factorization connections that represent the weights of feature co-occurrences using factorized method. In addition to FNs, we also propose a hybrid model that integrates FNs, NNs and Maximum Entropy (ME) models together. The component models in the hybrid model share the same input features. Based on two data sets (ATIS data set and Microsoft Cortana Chinese data), the proposed models shows promising results. Especially for large Microsoft Cortana Chinese data which is translated from well annotated English data, FNs using unigram, class and query length features achieve more than 20% relative error reduction over linear (SVMS).

TI Robust Data Augmentation for Neural Machine Translation through EVALNET
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Since building Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems requires a large parallel corpus, various data augmentation techniques have been adopted, especially for low-resource languages. In order to achieve the best performance through data augmentation, the NMT systems should be able to evaluate the quality of augmented data. Several studies have addressed data weighting techniques to assess data quality. The basic idea of data weighting adopted in previous studies is the loss value that a system calculates when learning from training data. The weight derived from the loss value of the data, through simple heuristic rules or neural models, can adjust the loss used in the next step of the learning process. In this study, we propose EvalNet, a data evaluation network, to assess parallel data of NMT. EvalNet exploits a loss value, a cross-attention map, and a semantic similarity between parallel data as its features. The cross-attention map is an encoded representation of cross-attention layers of Transformer, which is a base architecture of an NMT system. The semantic similarity is a cosine distance between two semantic embeddings of a source sentence and a target sentence. Owing to the parallelism of data, the combination of the cross-attention map and the semantic similarity proved to be effective features for data quality evaluation, besides the loss value. EvalNet is the first NMT data evaluator network that introduces the cross-attention map and the semantic similarity as its features. Through various experiments, we conclude that EvalNet is simple yet beneficial for robust training of an NMT system and outperforms the previous studies as a data evaluator.

TI Turning Bilingual Lexicography Upside Down: Improving Quality and
   Productivity with New Methods and Technology
SO LEXIKOS
AB This is a report from the real world. It informs about the outcome of a project, which the author conducted during a months-long research stay at the Danish company Ordbogen where he integrated its research and development (R&D) team. The first part of the project was to test machine translation and find out to what extent it is usable in the compilation of bilingual lexicographical databases. The hypothesis was that the technology was not yet mature. But surprisingly, it turned out that the accuracy rate is already so high that it is worth considering how to implement it. The second part of the project aimed at further developing an idea formulated by Fuertes-Olivera et al. (2018) on how to invert a dictionary without losing semantic content. The new vision is to compile a monolingual L2 database, bilingualize it to an L2-L1 database using machine translation, and then invert the relationship between L2 lemmata and L1 equivalents using the L1 definitions of the L2 lemmata as the axis. The third part of the project was to test this idea using a specially designed ad hoc program. The program automatically uploads relevant data from existing lexicographical databases, translates L2 definitions and example sentences into L1, suggests adequate L1 equivalents, and eventually inverts the relationship between the two languages. It worked, but the methodology still needs further refinement to be implementable on a large scale. The report concludes by listing some of the remaining challenges and defining the new role of the lexicographer in this type of project.

AB Language localisation, where the strings in interface and documentation are translated to a new language, is a rigorous and time consuming task. On the other hand machine translation systems, specifically Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems, are successfully used among many language pairs. A few SMT systems have been developed for generic domain; however, there are no systems available to aid localisation yet. This research proposes a new methodology in which language localisation can be done using SMT. This research also identifies suitable parameters on which a SMT aided localisation system could be built. A pilot system is developed and the system is also outlined in this paper. A RESTful APT has also been developed to facilitate localisation in remote tools. Several open source software have been translated already to Tamil. Those translated English - Tamil pairs were collected from various language resource flies and then cleaned, tokenised and were used to train the system. Another similar system is prepared with data from generic domain apart from the collected technical data. Systems were trained with 2-gram, 3-gram and 4-gram language models that are created using two different language modelling tools namely KenLM and TRSTLM. Then the results were evaluated using BLEU algorithm. Appropriate parameters for setting up SMT system for localisation were identified from the evaluation. The results show that it would be enough to train a system with 3-gram, and the modified BLEU algorithm will give better understanding of the results compare to the original implementation of it. Further KenLM was found to perform better than TRSTM in terms of accuracy of results and the speed of execution.

TI SeqTrans: Automatic Vulnerability Fix Via Sequence to Sequence Learning
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
AB Software vulnerabilities are now reported unprecedentedly due to the recent development of automated vulnerability hunting tools. However, fixing vulnerabilities still mainly depends on programmers' manual efforts. Developers need to deeply understand the vulnerability and affect the system's functions as little as possible. In this paper, with the advancement of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) techniques, we provide a novel approach called SeqTrans to exploit historical vulnerability fixes to provide suggestions and automatically fix the source code. To capture the contextual information around the vulnerable code, we propose to leverage data-flow dependencies to construct code sequences and feed them into the state-of-the-art transformer model. The fine-tuning strategy has been introduced to overcome the small sample size problem. We evaluate SeqTrans on a dataset containing 1,282 commits that fix 624 CVEs in 205 Java projects. Results show that the accuracy of SeqTrans outperforms the latest techniques and achieves 23.3% in statement-level fix and 25.3% in CVE-level fix. In the meantime, we look deep inside the result and observe that the NMT model performs very well in certain kinds of vulnerabilities like CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization).

AB Measuring the informational content of text in economic and financial news is useful for market participants to adjust their perception and expectations on the dynamics of financial markets. In this work, we adopt a neural machine translation and deep learning approach to extract the emotional content of economic and financial news from Spanish journals. To this end, we exploit a dataset of over 14 million articles published in Spanish newspapers over the period from 1st of July 1996 until 31st of December 2019. We then examine the role of these news-based emotions indicators in forecasting the Spanish IBEX-35 stock market index by using DeepAR, an advanced neural forecasting method based on autoregressive Recurrent Neural Networks operating in a probabilistic setting. The aim is to evaluate if the combination of a richer information set including the emotional content of economic and financial news with state-of-the-art machine learning can help in such a challenging prediction task. The DeepAR model is trained by adopting a rolling-window approach and employed to produce point and density forecasts. Results look promising, showing an improvement in the IBEX-35 index fitting when the emotional variables are included in the model.

AB A GUI skeleton is the starting point for implementing a UI design image. To obtain a GUI skeleton from a UI design image, developers have to visually understand UI elements and their spatial layout in the image, and then translate this understanding into proper GUI components and their compositions. Automating this visual understanding and translation would be beneficial for bootstraping mobile GUI implementation, but it is a challenging task due to the diversity of UI designs and the complexity of GUI skeletons to generate. Existing tools are rigid as they depend on heuristically-designed visual understanding and GUI generation rules. In this paper, we present a neural machine translator that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation for translating a UI design image into a GUI skeleton. Our translator learns to extract visual features in UI images, encode these features' spatial layouts, and generate GUI skeletons in a unified neural network framework, without requiring manual rule development. For training our translator, we develop an automated GUI exploration method to automatically collect large-scale UI data from real-world applications. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate the accuracy, generality and usefulness of our approach.

TI A Panoramic Survey of Natural Language Processing in the Arab World
SO COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM
AB The term natural language refers to any system of symbolic communication (spoken, signed or written) without intentional human planning and design. This distinguishes natural languages such as Arabic and Japanese from artificially constructed languages such as Esperanto or Python. Natural language processing (NLP) is the sub-field of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on modeling natural languages to build applications such as speech recognition and synthesis, machine translation, optical character recognition (OCR), sentiment analysis (SA), question answering, dialogue systems, etc. NLP is a highly interdisciplinary field with connections to computer science, linguistics, cognitive science, psychology, mathematics and others. Some of the earliest AI applications were in NLP (e.g., machine translation); and the last decade (2010-2020) in particular has witnessed an incredible increase in quality, matched with a rise in public awareness, use, and expectations of what may have seemed like science fiction in the past. NLP researchers pride themselves on developing language independent models and tools that can be applied to all human languages, e.g. machine translation systems can be built for a variety of languages using the same basic mechanisms and models. However, the reality is that some languages do get more attention (e.g., English and Chinese) than others (e.g., Hindi and Swahili). Arabic, the primary language of the Arab world and the religious language of millions of non-Arab Muslims is somewhere in the middle of this continuum. Though Arabic NLP has many challenges, it has seen many successes and developments. Next we discuss Arabic's main challenges as a necessary background, and we present a brief history of Arabic NLP. We then survey a number of its research areas, and close with a critical discussion of the future of Arabic NLP.

TI New method to characterize a machining system: application in turning
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATERIAL FORMING
AB Many studies simulates the machining process by using a single degree of freedom spring-mass system to model the tool stiffness, or the workpiece stiffness, or the unit tool-workpiece stiffness in modelings 2D. Others impose the tool action, or use more or less complex modelings of the efforts applied by the tool taking account the tool geometry. Thus, all these models remain two-dimensional or sometimes partially three-dimensional. This paper aims at developing an experimental method allowing to determine accurately the real three-dimensional behaviour of a machining system (machine tool, cutting tool, tool-holder and associated system of force metrology six-component dynamometer). In the work-space model of machining, a new experimental procedure is implemented to determine the machining system elastic behaviour. An experimental study of machining system is presented. We propose a machining system static characterization. A decomposition in two distinct blocks of the system "Workpiece-Tool-Machine" is realized. The block Tool and the block Workpiece are studied and characterized separately by matrix stiffness and displacement (three translations and three rotations). The Castigliano's theory allows us to calculate the total stiffness matrix and the total displacement matrix. A stiffness center point and a plan of tool tip static displacement are presented in agreement with the turning machining dynamic model and especially during the self induced vibration. These results are necessary to have a good three-dimensional machining system dynamic characterization (presented in a next paper).

TI Combining translation-invariant wavelet frames and convolutional neural
   network for intelligent tool wear state identification
SO COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY
AB On-machine monitoring of tool wear in machining processes has found its importance to reduce equipment downtime and reduce tooling costs. As the tool wears out gradually, the contact state of the cutting edge and the workpiece changes, which has a significant influence on the vibration state of the spindle. The performance of traditional intelligent fault diagnosis methods depend on feature extraction of dynamic signals, which requires expert knowledge and human labor. Recently, deep learning algorithms have been applied widely in machine health monitoring. In this paper, we present a novel intelligent technique for tool wear state recognition using machine spindle vibration signals. The proposed technique combines derived wavelet frames (DWFs) and convolutional neural network (CNN). Constructed based on dual tree wavelets, DWF are equipped with merits of centralized multiresolution and nearly translation-invariance. In this method, DWFs are employed to decompose the original signal into frequency bands of different bandwidths and different center frequencies, which are more pronounced as the tool wears. Further, the reconstructed sub-signals are stacked into a 2-D signal matrix to match the structure of 2-D CNN while retaining more dynamic information. The 2-D convolutional neural network is utilized to automatically recognize features from the multiscale 2-D signal matrix. End-milling experiments were performed on a S45C steel workpiece at different machining parameters. The experiment results of the recognition for tool wear state show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
AB The aims are to ameliorate the dull classroom atmosphere and unsatisfactory teacher-student interaction and cultivate students' reading, writing, and translation (R-W-T) English proficiency level (EPL). Specifically, this paper designs an optimized polynomial kernel-based support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm based on the machine learning (ML) theory. Firstly, this paper expounds on the correlation between ML and teaching classrooms to analyze the optimization direction in the application of ML in classroom teaching. Afterward, SVM and RF algorithms are selected for data normalization optimization, and their optimal hyperparameters are analyzed. Consequently, an experiment is designed to compare the classification accuracy of the algorithms before and after optimization, and the polynomial kernel-based SVM algorithm is proved to present the most remarkable improvement and accuracy after optimization, which is as high as 95.23% or 66.96% improvement. Therefore, the polynomial kernel-based SVM algorithm is chosen for the college English (R-W-T) classroom-oriented human pose recognition (HPR) system. Thus, English teachers can better grasp the students' psychological state and classroom atmosphere and ameliorate unsatisfactory teacher-student interaction in students' English (R-W-T). The proposal plays a positive role in cultivating college students' strong (R-W-T) EPL, which is of great significance in improving the English classroom.

   Models evaluation
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB One of the aims of assistive technologies is to help people with disabilities to communicate with others and to provide means of access to information. As an aid to Deaf people, in this work we present a novel prototype Rule Based Machine Translation (RBMT) system for the creation of large and quality written Greek Sign Language (GSL) glossed corpora from Greek text. In particular, the proposed RBMT system assists the professional GSL translator in speeding up the production of different kinds of GSL glossed corpora. Then each glossed corpus is used for the production/creation of Language Model (LM) n-grams. With the GSL glossed corpus from Greek text, we can build, test and evaluate different kinds of Language Models for different kinds of glossed GSL corpora. Here, it should be noted that it does not require grammar knowledge of GSL but only very basic GSL phenomena covered by manual RBMT rules as it assists the professional human translator. Furthermore, it should also be stressed that Language Models for written GSL gloss are missing from the scientific literature, thus this work is pioneer in this field. Evaluation of the proposed scheme is carried out for the weather reports domain, where 20,284 tokens and 1000 sentences have been produced. By using the BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) metric score, our prototype RBMT system achieves a relative score of 0.84 (84%) for 4-grams and 0.9 (90%) for 1-grams. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Automatic Acquisition of Annotated Training Corpora for Test-Code
   Generation
SO INFORMATION
AB Open software repositories make large amounts of source code publicly available. Potentially, this source code could be used as training data to develop new, machine learning-based programming tools. For many applications, however, raw code scraped from online repositories does not constitute an adequate training dataset. Building on the recent and rapid improvements in machine translation (MT), one possibly very interesting application is code generation from natural language descriptions. One of the bottlenecks in developing these MT-inspired systems is the acquisition of parallel text-code corpora required for training code-generative models. This paper addresses the problem of automatically synthetizing parallel text-code corpora in the software testing domain. Our approach is based on the observation that self-documentation through descriptive method names is widely adopted in test automation, in particular for unit testing. Therefore, we propose synthesizing parallel corpora comprised of parsed test function names serving as code descriptions, aligned with the corresponding function bodies. We present the results of applying one of the state-of-the-art MT methods on such a generated dataset. Our experiments show that a neural MT model trained on our dataset can generate syntactically correct and semantically relevant short Java functions from quasi-natural language descriptions of functionality.

AB Numerous attempts have been made in the recent past for the task of free-form and open-ended Visual Question Answering (VQA). Solving VQA problem typically requires techniques from both computer vision for a deeper understanding of the images and Natural language processing for understanding the semantics of the question and generating appropriate answers. It has caught the attention of a lot of researchers because of its enormous applications in the real world scenarios. But none of the existing approaches are designed for the medical image-question pairs which require a sequence of words as an answer. We propose a novel approach by combining the tasks of Image captioning and Machine translation and provided a comprehensive model that takes a medical image-question pair as an input and generates a sequence of words as an answer. We evaluate our model on the dataset provided by ImageCLEF as a part of the ImageCLEF 2018 VQA-med challenge. We outperformed all the contestants of the challenge by achieving the best BLEU and WBSS scores. Furthermore, we provide additional insights that can be adopted to develop our baseline model and the challenges that lie ahead of us while building Machine learning models for medical datasets.

AB Ambiguous requirements are problematic in requirement engineering as various stakeholders can debate on the interpretation of the requirements leading to a variety of issues in the development stages. Since requirement specifications are usually written in natural language, analyzing ambiguous requirements is currently a manual process as it has not been fully automated to meet the industry standards. In this paper, we used transfer learning by using ULMFiT where we pre-trained our model to a general-domain corpus and then fine-tuned it to classify ambiguous vs unambiguous requirements (target task). We then compared its accuracy with machine learning classifiers like SVM, Linear Regression, and Multinomial Naive Bayes. We also used back translation (BT) as a text augmentation technique to see if it improved the classification accuracy. Our results showed that ULMFiT achieved higher accuracy than SVM (Support Vector Machines), Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naive Bayes for our initial data set. Further by augmenting requirements using BT, ULMFiT got a higher accuracy than SVM, Logistic Regression, and Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, improving the initial performance by 5.371%. Our proposed research provides some promising insights on how transfer learning and text augmentation can be applied to small data sets in requirements engineering.

TI Ten-dimensional anthropomorphic arm control in a human brain-machine
   interface: difficulties, solutions, and limitations
SO JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING
AB Objective. In a previous study we demonstrated continuous translation, orientation and one-dimensional grasping control of a prosthetic limb (seven degrees of freedom) by a human subject with tetraplegia using a brain-machine interface (BMI). The current study, in the same subject, immediately followed the previous work and expanded the scope of the control signal by also extracting hand-shape commands from the two 96-channel intracortical electrode arrays implanted in the subject's left motor cortex. Approach. Four new control signals, dictating prosthetic hand shape, replaced the one-dimensional grasping in the previous study, allowing the subject to control the prosthetic limb with ten degrees of freedom (three-dimensional (3D) translation, 3D orientation, four-dimensional hand shaping) simultaneously. Main results. Robust neural tuning to hand shaping was found, leading to ten-dimensional (10D) performance well above chance levels in all tests. Neural unit preferred directions were broadly distributed through the 10D space, with the majority of units significantly tuned to all ten dimensions, instead of being restricted to isolated domains (e. g. translation, orientation or hand shape). The addition of hand shaping emphasized object-interaction behavior. A fundamental component of BMIs is the calibration used to associate neural activity to intended movement. We found that the presence of an object during calibration enhanced successful shaping of the prosthetic hand as it closed around the object during grasping. Significance. Our results show that individual motor cortical neurons encode many parameters of movement, that object interaction is an important factor when extracting these signals, and that high-dimensional operation of prosthetic devices can be achieved with simple decoding algorithms.

TI The Translator's Extended Mind
SO MINDS AND MACHINES
AB The rapid development of natural language processing in the last three decades has drastically changed the way professional translators do their work. Nowadays most of them usecomputer-assisted translation(CAT) ortranslation memory(TM) tools whose evolution has been overshadowed by the much more sensational development ofmachine translation(MT) systems, with which TM tools are sometimes confused. These two language technologies now interact in mutually enhancing ways, and their increasing role in human translation has become a subject of behavioral studies. Philosophers and linguists, however, have been slow in coming to grips with these important developments. The present paper seeks to fill in this lacuna. I focus on the semantic aspects of the highly distributed human-computer interaction in the CAT process which presents an interesting case of anextended cognitive systeminvolving a human translator, a TM tool, an MT engine, and sometimes other human translators or editors. Considered as a whole, such a system is engaged in representing the linguistic meaning of the source document in the target language. But the roles played by its various components, natural as well as artificial, are far from trivial, and the division of linguistic labor between them throws new light on the familiar notions that were initially inspired by rather different phenomena in the philosophy of language, mind, and cognitive science.

TI Model-Based Representation and Deinterleaving of Mixed Radar Pulse
   Sequences With Neural Machine Translation Network
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS
AB Deinterleaving mixtures of radar pulse sequences is the first and the most vital step for modern electronic reconnaissance systems to intercept and analyze the intentions of noncooperative radars. Currently, these systems are facing great challenges due to the emerging complexity of radar modulations. This article proposes a novel method for deinterleaving mixtures of radar pulse sequences based on the time series characteristics of each source (component pulse sequences). First, the mathematical representations are established to describe the structural characteristics of each source. Then, the deinterleaving problem is formulated as a minimization of a maximum-likelihood cost function that can be solved efficiently through a supervised neural machine translation (NMT) network, i.e., to translate each received pulse in the interleaved pulse sequence to the corresponding source label. A sequence-to-sequence NMT model is proposed to capture the structural relationships among the nonadjacent pulses originated from the same source in the mixtures and assign the corresponding label to each pulse. The proposed method does not require the exact knowledge of each component pulse sequence. The experimental results based on the time of arrival sequence of mixed pulse sequences show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art deinterleaving methods and achieves satisfactory performance under highly nonideal situations with measuring noise and lost pulse conditions. The proposed method can be directly applied to other fields involving deinterleaving problems and multivariate input conditions.

AB Translation quality evaluation plays a crucial role in machine translation. According to the input format, it is mainly separated into three tasks, i.e., reference-only, source-only and source-reference-combined. Recent methods, despite their promising results, are specifically designed and optimized on one of them. This limits the convenience of these methods, and overlooks the commonalities among tasks. In this paper, we propose UniTE, which is the first unified framework engaged with abilities to handle all three evaluation tasks. Concretely, we propose monotonic regional attention to control the interaction among input segments, and unified pretraining to better adapt multi-task learning. We testify our framework on WMT 2019 Metrics and WMT 2020 Quality Estimation benchmarks. Extensive analyses show that our single model can universally surpass various state-of-the-art or winner methods across tasks. Both source code and associated models are available at https://github.com/NLP2CT/UniTE.

AB The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

SO SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
AB Accurate recognition and analysis of semantics is the most important research field in the process of English translation with the help of natural language processing technology. This paper proposes an English semantic analysis method based on the neural network. First, the idea of model transfer is used to construct a topic segmentation model and the topic granularity segmentation of the translated text is carried out. Then, in order to obtain all the information in the English text, the recursive neural network is selected to recognize the word model. In order to recognize English texts with different sentence patterns, the long-term and short-term memory network is selected to extract the useful information of the text. Through the experimental data measurement and analysis results, compared with the traditional sentence analysis methods, the accuracy of the proposed method is as high as 95.8% and the model occupies less hardware resources.

TI In-cell architecture of an actively transcribing-translating expressome
SO SCIENCE
AB Structural biology studies performed inside cells can capture molecular machines in action within their native context. In this work, we developed an integrative in-cell structural approach using the genome-reduced human pathogen Mycoplasma pneumoniae. We combined whole-cell cross-linking mass spectrometry, cellular cryo-electron tomography, and integrative modeling to determine an in-cell architecture of a transcribing and translating expressome at subnanometer resolution. The expressome comprises RNA polymerase (RNAP), the ribosome, and the transcription elongation factors NusG and NusA. We pinpointed NusA at the interface between a NusG-bound elongating RNAP and the ribosome and propose that it can mediate transcription-translation coupling. Translation inhibition dissociated the expressome, whereas transcription inhibition stalled and rearranged it. Thus, the active expressome architecture requires both translation and transcription elongation within the cell.

Nevertheless there still remains a huge segment of legacy systems and application ranging from accounting and management information systems to scientific software based on classic desktop or simple client-server architectures. Although in the past years more and more companies and organizations have invested important budgets in translating legacy apps to online cloud-enabled environment there still remains an important segment of applications that for various reasons (budget related in most cases) have not been translated. This paper proposes an innovative pipeline model architecture for automated translation and migration of legacy application to cloud-enabled environment with a minimal software development costs.

AB Most machine translators are implemented using example based, rule based, and statistical approaches. However, each of these paradigms has its drawbacks. Example based and statistical based approaches are domain specific and requires a large database of examples to produce accurate translation results. Although rule based approach is known to produce high quality translations, a linguist is necessary in deriving the set of rules to be used. To address these problems, we present an approach that uses the rule based approach in translating from English to Filipino text. It incorporates learning of rules based on the analysis of a bilingual corpus in an attempt to eliminate the need for a linguist. The learning algorithm is based on seeded version space learning alogrithm as presented by Probst (2002). Implementation of the algorithm has been modified to allow learning of non-lexically aligned languages and to adapt to the complex free word order of the ZD Filipino language.

Variations in the spot-to-spot translation distance provide an alternative means of average depth and roughness control when compared to fluence changes and focal distance variations. We find that the average depth is proportional to the inverse of the translation distance, while the root mean square surface roughness reaches a minimum when the translation distance is approximately equal to the full width half maximum of a single ablation mark on the surface. Conductive silver metal lines are deposited on the surface machined features demonstrating the ability to produce conductors with good adhesion over stepped structures on polyimide.

TI Recursive editing with Google Translate: the impact on writing and error
   correction
SO COMPUTER ASSISTED LANGUAGE LEARNING
AB Machine Translation (MT) tools have advanced to a level of reliability such that it is now opportune to consider their place in language teaching and learning. Given their potential, the current study sought to engage EFL university sophomores in recursive editing afforded by Google Translate (GT) for one semester, and investigated (1) whether the students were able to correct errors assisted by GT, (2) whether GT facilitated better writing, (3) which aspects of writing, fluency, complexity or accuracy GT better assisted the learners with, and (4) the student's attitudes toward GT. A quasi-experimental approach was adopted where the experimental group, comprising 34 students, received training in recursive editing while the control group, comprising 33 students, did not. Both groups completed an error-correction test and an essay pre- and post-intervention. The experimental group completed an additional Affective Filter and Task Difficulty questionnaire post-intervention. The results showed that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group on the error correction test; however, no significant difference in the two groups' writing scores was found. Further, the evaluation of writing fluency, accuracy, and complexity yielded a mixed picture. The control group demonstrated significantly better fluency as shown in sentence, clause, and T-unit counts, but not in total word count. The experimental group, conversely, showed significantly higher syntactic complexity in mean length of clause, and significantly better accuracy in writing post-intervention. Finally, the students were generally positive about using GT to learn in terms of anxiety, motivational belief, and task complexity.

Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), with several enhancements such as 100-hot encoding, embeddings, Conditional Random Field (CRF), and Block-Normalized Gradient (BNG). The models are tested on the only freely available benchmark dataset and the results show that our models are either better or on par with other models even those requiring human-crafted language-dependent post-processing steps, unlike ours. Moreover, we show how diacritics in Arabic can be used to enhance the models of downstream NLP tasks such as Machine Translation (MT) and Sentiment Analysis (SA) by proposing novel Translation over Diacritization (ToD) and Sentiment over Diacritization (SoD) approaches.

TI Using every part of the buffalo in Windows memory analysis
SO DIGITAL INVESTIGATION
AB All Windows memory analysis techniques depend on the examiner's ability to translate the virtual addresses used by programs and operating system components into the true locations of data in a memory image. In some memory images up to 20% of all the virtual addresses in use point to so called "invalid" pages that cannot be found using a naive method for address translation. This paper explains virtual address translation, enumerates the different states of invalid memory pages, and presents a more robust strategy for address translation. This new method incorporates invalid pages and even the paging file to greatly increase the completeness of the analysis. By using every available page, every part of the buffalo as it were, the examiner can better recreate the state of the machine as it existed at the time of imaging. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Cross-Lingual Classification of Political Texts Using Multilingual
   Sentence Embeddings
SO POLITICAL ANALYSIS
AB Established approaches to analyze multilingual text corpora require either a duplication of analysts' efforts or high-quality machine translation (MT). In this paper, I argue that multilingual sentence embedding (MSE) is an attractive alternative approach to language-independent text representation. To support this argument, I evaluate MSE for cross-lingual supervised text classification. Specifically, I assess how reliably MSE-based classifiers detect manifesto sentences' topics and positions compared to classifiers trained using bag-ofwords representations of machine-translated texts, and how this depends on the amount of training data. These analyses show that when training data are relatively scarce (e.g., 20K or less-labeled sentences), MSE-based classifiers can be more reliable and are at least no less reliable than their MT-based counterparts. Furthermore, I examine how reliable MSE-based classifiers label sentences written in languages not in the training data, focusing on the task of discriminating sentences that discuss the issue of immigration from those that do not. This analysis shows that compared to the within-language classification benchmark, such "cross-lingual transfer" tends to result in fewer reliability losses when relying on the MSE instead of the MT approach. This study thus presents an important addition to the cross-lingual text analysis toolkit.

CL SAN DIEGO, CA
SP IEEE TC MARCH, ACM SIGMICRO
AB A virtual instruction set architecture (V-ISA) implemented via a processor-specific software translation layer can provide great flexibility to processor designers. Recent examples such as Crusoe and DAISY however have used existing hardware instruction sets as virtual ISAs, which complicates translation and optimization. In fact, there has been little research on specific designs for a virtual ISA for processors. This paper proposes a novel virtual ISA (LLVA) and a translation strategy for implementing it on arbitrary hardware. The instruction set is typed, uses an infinite virtual register set in Static Single Assignment farm, and provides explicit control-flow and dataflow information, and yet uses low-level operations closely matched to traditional hardware. It includes novel mechanisms to allow more flexible optimization of native code, including a flexible exception model and minor constraints on self-modifying code. We propose a translation strategy that enables offline translation and transparent offline caching of native code and profile information, while remaining completely OS-independent. It also supports optimizations directly on the representation at install-time, runtime, and offline between executions. We show experimentally that despite its rich information content, virtual object code is comparable in size to native machine code, virtual instructions expand to only 2-4 ordinary hardware instructions on average, and simple translation costs under 1% of total execution time except for very short runs.

SO ACTA LINGUISTICA ACADEMICA
AB The Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC, proposed by Levesque, Davis & Morgenstern 2012) is considered to be the novel Turing Test to examine machine intelligence. Winograd schema questions require the resolution of anaphora with the help of world knowledge and commonsense reasoning. Anaphora reso-lution is itself an important and difficult issue in natural language processing, therefore, many other datasets have been created to address this issue. In this paper we look into the Winograd schemata and other Winograd-like datasets and the translations of the schemata to other languages, such as Chinese, French and Portuguese. We present the Hungarian translation of the original Winograd schemata and a parallel corpus of all the translations of the schemata currently available. We also adapted some other anaphora resolution datasets to Hungarian. We aim to discuss the challenges we faced during the trans-lation/adaption process.

AB Cross-domain alignment plays a key role in tasks ranging from image-text retrieval to machine translation. The main objective is to associate related entities across different domains. Recently, purely unsupervised methods operating on monolingual embeddings have successfully been used to infer a bilingual lexicon without relying on supervision. However, current state-of-the art methods only focus on point vectors although distributional embeddings have proven to embed richer semantic information when representing words. This paper investigates a novel stochastic optimization approach for aligning word distributional embeddings. Our method builds upon techniques in optimal transport to resolve the cross-domain matching problem in a principled manner. We evaluate our method on the problem of unsupervised word translation, by aligning word embeddings trained on monolingual data. We present empirical evidence to demonstrate the validity of our approach to the bilingual lexicon induction task across several language pairs.

AB This paper presents the systems developed by Beijing Jiao-tong University and Toshiba (China) Co., Ltd. for the CCMT 2021 quality estimation (QE) and automatic-post editing (APE) task. For QE task, we mainly rely on multiple pretrained language models, and propose a multi-phase pre-finetuning scheme, to adapt the pretrained models to the target domain and task. The pre-finetuning scheme consists of language-adaptative finetuning, domain-adaptative finetuning and task-adaptative finetuning. For APE task, we use BERT-initialized Transformer as the backbone model, and create different groups of synthetic data by different data augmentation methods, i.e. forward translation, round-trip translation and multi-source denoising autoencoder. Multi-model ensemble is adopted in both tasks. Experiment results on the development set show high accuracy on both QE and APE tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

AB Resolution and sequent calculus are two well-known formal proof systems. Their differences make them suitable for distinct tasks. Resolution and its variants are very efficient for automated reasoning and are in fact the theoretical basis of many theorem provers. However, being intentionally machine oriented, the resolution calculus is not as natural for human beings and the input problem needs to be pre-processed to clause normal form. Sequent calculus, on the other hand, is a modular formalism that is useful for analysing meta-properties of various logics and is, therefore, popular among proof theorists. The input problem does not need to be pre-processed, and proofs are more detailed. However, proofs also tend to be larger and more verbose. When the worlds of proof theory and automated theorem proving meet, translations between resolution and sequent calculus are often necessary. In this paper, we compare three translation methods and analyse their complexity.

AB Data quality is one of the key factors in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). Previous research addressed the data quality problem in SMT by corpus weighting or phrase scoring, but these two types of methods were often investigated independently. To leverage the dependencies between them, we propose an intuitive approach to improve translation modeling by collective corpus weighting and phrase scoring. The method uses the mutual reinforcement between the sentence pairs and the extracted phrase pairs, based on the observation that better sentence pairs often lead to better phrase extraction and vice versa. An effective graph-based random walk is designed to estimate the quality of sentence pairs and phrase pairs simultaneously. Extensive experimental results show that our method improves performance significantly and consistently in several Chinese-to-English translation tasks.

AB We propose a new approach to object recognition problem motivated by the availability of large annotated image and video collections. Similar to translation from one language to another, this approach considers the object recognition problem as the translation of visual elements to words. The visual elements represented in feature space are first categorized into a finite set of blobs. Then, the correspondences between the blobs and the words are learned using a method adapted from Statistical Machine Translation. Finally, the correspondences, in the form of a probability table, are used to predict words for particular image regions (region naming), for entire images (auto-annotation), or to associate the automatically generated speech transcript text with the correct video frames (video alignment). Experimental results are presented on TRECVID 2004 data set, which consists of about 150 hours of news videos associated with manual annotations and speech transcript text.

AB Engaging deaf and hearing people in common discussions requires interfaces to help them understand each other, such as robot agents that translate spoken language into Sign Language (SL) expressions and vice-versa. However, the recognition and generation of signed sentences is a complex task of high dimensionality that cannot be solved in sufficient quality yet. Thus, it is necessary to develop new technologies of improved performances. The sequence to sequence neural network model, traditionally used for machine translation, is adapted to the above two tasks by treating a SL sequence as a multi-dimensional sentence. We defined an encoding of the SL annotations and conducted experiments on the network structure to define a most accurate translation model. This study proves the network trainable and possibly applicable in real-life with an extended dataset, which shall be tested for deployment in virtual translation assistants in the following.

TI Lightweight Random Indexing for Polylingual Text Classification
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
AB Multilingual Text Classification (MLTC) is a text classification task in which documents are written each in one among a set L of natural languages, and in which all documents must be classified under the same classification scheme, irrespective of language. There are two main variants of MLTC, namely Cross-Lingual Text Classification (CLTC) and Polylingual Text Classification (PLTC). In PLTC, which is the focus of this paper, we assume (differently from CLTC) that for each language in L there is a representative set of training documents; PLTC consists of improving the accuracy of each of the vertical bar L vertical bar monolingual classifiers by also leveraging the training documents written in the other (vertical bar L vertical bar - 1) languages. The obvious solution, consisting of generating a single polylingual classifier from the juxtaposed monolingual vector spaces, is usually infeasible, since the dimensionality of the resulting vector space is roughly vertical bar L vertical bar times that of a monolingual one, and is thus often unmanageable. As a response, the use of machine translation tools or multilingual dictionaries has been proposed. However, these resources are not always available, or are not always free to use.
   One machine-translation-free and dictionary-free method that, to the best of our knowledge, has never been applied to PLTC before, is Random Indexing (RI). We analyse RI in terms of space and time efficiency, and propose a particular con figuration of it (that we dub Lightweight Random Indexing - LRI). By running experiments on two well known public benchmarks, Reuters RCV1/RCV2 (a comparable corpus) and JRC-Acquis (a parallel one), we show LRI to outperform (both in terms of effectiveness and efficiency) a number of previously proposed machine-translation-free and dictionary-free PLTC methods that we use as baselines.

AB To improve the translation quality of less resourced language pairs, the most natural answer is to build larger and larger aligned training data, that is to make those language pairs well resourced. But aligned data is not always easy to collect. In contrast, monolingual data are usually easier to access. In this paper we show how to leverage unrelated unaligned monolingual data to construct additional training data that varies only a little from the original training data. We measure the contribution of such additional data to translation quality. We report an experiment between Chinese and Japanese where we use 70,000 sentences of unrelated unaligned monolingual additional data in each language to construct new sentence pairs that are not perfectly aligned. We add these sentence pairs to a training corpus of 110,000 sentence pairs, and report an increase of 6 BLEU points.

TI MCMA: A Symbolic Multitrack Contrapuntal Music Archive
SO EMPIRICAL MUSICOLOGY REVIEW
AB We present Multitrack Contrapuntal Music Archive (MCMA, available at https://mcma.readthedocs.io), a symbolic dataset of pieces specifically curated to comprise, for any given polyphonic work, independent voices. So far, MCMA consists only of pieces from the Baroque repertoire but we aim to extend it to other contrapuntal music. MCMA is FAIR-compliant and it is geared towards musicological tasks such as (computational) analysis or education, as it brings to the fore contrapuntal interactions by explicit and independent representation. Furthermore, it affords for a more apt usage of recent advances in the field of natural language processing (e.g., neural machine translation). For example, MCMA can be particularly useful in the context of language based machine learning models for music generation. Despite its current modest size, we believe MCMA to be an important addition to online contrapuntal music databases, and we thus open it to contributions from the wider community, in the hope that MCMA can continue to grow beyond our efforts. In this article, we provide the rationale for this corpus, suggest possible use cases, offer an overview of the compiling process (data sourcing and processing), and present a brief statistical analysis of the corpus at the time of writing. Finally, future work that we endeavor to undertake is discussed.

AB The flank milling of complex forms is a very effective process from the point of view of productivity and surface quality. Many works deal with research on the optimal positioning of the too] which is considered as a rigid body in order to minimize tool path errors. The purpose of our work is to integrate the compensation of the tool distortions in this optimal positioning calculation. In flank milling with long tools, the distortion of the cutter generates a significant wave (that can reach 0,6 mm) on the machined surface due to the effects of the helical angle and the radial force which varies during the cotter rotation. After detailing an analysis of the force evolution and the associated model calculation, we will present a test protocol, that can be implemented in industry, in order to characterize the model parameters as a function of the couple tool-workpiece material. Then we will present a test to assess our prediction model of the straightness defects of the machined surface according to all machining parameters. These results make it possible to make up for defects by applying a translation to the tool in 3-axis and by applying a translation combined with a rotation in 5-axis milling.

TI Universalities of reproducing kernels revisited
SO APPLICABLE ANALYSIS
AB Kernel methods have been widely applied to machine learning and other questions of approximating an unknown function from its finite sample data. To ensure arbitrary accuracy of such an approximation, various denseness conditions are imposed on the selected kernel. This note contributes to the study of universal, characteristic, and C-0-universal kernels. We first give a simple and direct description of the difference and relation among these three kinds of universalities of kernels. We then focus on translation-invariant and Hilbert-Schmidt kernels formed by polynomials. A simple and shorter proof of the known characterization of characteristic translation-invariant kernels will be presented. The main purpose of the note is to give a delicate discussion on the universalities of Hilbert-Schmidt kernels formed by weighted polynomials.

AB JHU/APL has long espoused the use of language-neutral methods for cross-language information retrieval. This year we participated in the ad hoe cross-language track and submitted both monolingual and bilingual runs. We undertook our first investigations in the Bulgarian and Hungarian languages. In our bilingual experiments we used several non-traditional CLEF query languages such as Greek, Hungarian, and Indonesian, in addition to several western European languages. We found that character n-grams remain an attractive option for representing documents and queries in these new languages. In our monolingual tests n-grams were more effective than unnormalized words for retrieval in Bulgarian (+30%) and Hungarian (+63%). Our bilingual runs made use of subword translation, statistical translation of character n-grams using aligned corpora, when parallel data were available, and web-based machine translation, when no suitable data could be found.

AB Most of the ongoing research for image classification happens in English and there is very little research about classification of images in regional Indian languages like Kannada. There are several uses and advantages of classifying images natively in Kannada. A diverse dataset of 425,723 images which is accurately labelled in Kannada is obtained through this study, which adds to the contribution this paper makes to image classification literature, that is verified and corrected by a human judge. It consists of 1,083 unique classes which was constructed by a combination of randomly selecting classes from ImageNet, a database commonly used for Image classification in English as well as 193 manually thought out classes. The classes were translated first using an online translation service and later corrected by a human judge to achieve a translation accuracy of 97.15% on the entire dataset.

TI A composite machine-learning-based framework for supporting low-level
   event logs to high-level business process model activities mappings
   enhanced by flexible BPMN model translation
SO SOFT COMPUTING
AB Process mining is an emerging discipline that aims to analyze business processes using event data logged by IT systems. In process mining, the focus is on how to effectively and efficiently predict the next process/trace to be activated among all the possible processes/traces that are available in the process schema (usually modeled as a graph). Most of the existing process mining techniques assume that there is a one-to-one mapping between process model activities and the events that are recorded during process execution. However, event logs and process model activities are at different level of granularity. In this paper, we present a machine-learning-based approach to map low-level event logs to high-level activities. With this work, we can bridge the abstraction levels when the high-level labels of the low-level events are not available. The proposed approach consists of two main phases: automatic labeling and machine-learning-based classification. In automatic labeling, a modified k-prototypes clustering approach has been used in order to obtain the labeled examples. Then, in the second phase, we trained different ML classifiers using the obtained labeled examples. Since, in real-life applications and systems, business processes are expressed according to the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) format, we improve our proposed framework by means of an innovative, flexible BPMN model translation methodology that acts at the first phase. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed framework using two case studies with real-world event logs, and provide its experimental assessment and analysis.

TI A comparative study of machine translation for multilingual
   sentence-level sentiment analysis
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Sentiment analysis has become a key tool for several social media applications, including, analysis of user's opinions about products and services, support for politics during campaigns and even identification of market trending. Multiple existing sentiment analysis methods explore different techniques, usually relying on lexical resources or learning approaches. Despite the significant interest in this theme and amount of research efforts in the field, almost all existing methods are designed to work with only English content. Most current strategies in other languages consist of adapting existing lexical resources, without presenting proper validations and basic baseline comparisons. In this work, we take a different step into this field. We focus on evaluating existing efforts proposed to do language specific sentiment analysis with a simple yet effective baseline approach. To do it, we evaluated sixteen methods for sentence-level sentiment analysis proposed for English, and compared them with three language-specific methods. Based on fourteen human labeled language-specific datasets, we provide an extensive quantitative analysis of existing multilingual approaches. Our results suggest that simply translating the input text in a specific language to English and then using one of the existing best methods developed for English can be better than the existing language-specific approach evaluated. We also rank methods according to their prediction performance and identify those that acquired the best results using machine translation across different languages. As a final contribution to the research community, we release our codes, datasets, and the iFeel 3.0 system, a Web framework and tool for multilingual sentence-level sentiment analysis'. We hope our system sets up a new baseline for future sentence-level methods developed in a wide set of languages. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI RESHAPE: Reverse-Edited Synthetic Hypotheses for Automatic Post-Editing
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Synthetic training data has been extensively used to train Automatic Post-Editing (APE) models in many recent studies because the quantity of human-created data has been considered insufficient. However, the most widely used synthetic APE dataset, eSCAPE, overlooks respecting the minimal editing property of genuine data, and this defect may have been a limiting factor for the performance of APE models. This article suggests adapting back-translation to APE to constrain edit distance, while using stochastic sampling in decoding to maintain the diversity of outputs, to create a new synthetic APE dataset, RESHAPE. Our experiments show that (1) RESHAPE contains more samples resembling genuine APE data than eSCAPE does, and (2) using RESHAPE as new training data improves APE models' performance substantially over using eSCAPE.

TI Sentence Level Alignment of Digitized Books Parallel Corpora
SO INFORMATICA
AB In this paper, we propose a framework for extracting translation memory from a corpus of fiction and non-fiction books. In recent years, there have been several proposals to align bilingual corpus and extract translation memory from legal and technical documents. Yet, when it comes to an alignment of the corpus of translated fiction and non-fiction books, the existing alignment algorithms give low precision results. In order to solve this low precision problem, we propose a new method that incorporates existing alignment algorithms with proactive learning approach. We define several feature functions that are used to build two classifiers for text filtering and alignment. We report results on English-Lithuanian language pair and on bilingual corpus from 200 books. We demonstrate a significant improvement in alignment accuracy over currently available alignment systems.

TI Evolutionary origins of the RNA-guided nucleotide-modification
   complexes: from the primitive translation apparatus?
SO TRENDS IN BIOCHEMICAL SCIENCES
AB Eukarya and Archaea possess scores of RNA-guided nucleotide-modification complexes that target specific rilbonucleotides for 2'-O-methylation or pseudouridylation. Recent characterization of these RNA-modification machines has yielded striking results with implications for their evolutionary origins: the two main classes of nucleotide-modification complex in Archaea share a common ribonucleoprotein (RNP) core element that has evolved from a progenitor RNP. The fact that this common RNP element is also found in ribosomes suggests that the origin of the progenitor RNP lies in the primitive translation apparatus. Thus, the trans-acting, RNA-guided nucleotide-modification complexes of the modern RNP world seem to have evolved from cis-acting RNA or RNP elements contained in the primitive translation apparatus during the transition from the ancient RNA world to the modern RNP world.

TI A Scalable Distributed Syntactic, Semantic, and Lexical Language Model
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB This paper presents an attempt at building a large scale distributed composite language model that is formed by seamlessly integrating an n-gram model, a structured language model, and probabilistic latent semantic analysis under a directed Markov random field paradigm to simultaneously account for local word lexical information, mid-range sentence syntactic structure, and long-span document semantic content. The composite language model has been trained by performing a convergent N-best list approximate EM algorithm and a follow-up EM algorithm to improve word prediction power on corpora with up to a billion tokens and stored on a supercomputer. The large scale distributed composite language model gives drastic perplexity reduction over n-grams and achieves significantly better translation quality measured by the Bleu score and "readability" of translations when applied to the task of re-ranking the N-best list from a state-of-the-art parsing-based machine translation system.

AB The multi-decoder (MD) end-to-end speech translation model has demonstrated high translation quality by searching for better intermediate automatic speech recognition (ASR) decoder states as hidden intermediates (HI). It is a two-pass decoding model decomposing the overall task into ASR and machine translation sub-tasks. However, the decoding speed is not fast enough for real-world applications because it conducts beam search for both sub-tasks during inference. We propose Fast-MD, a fast MD model that generates HI by non-autoregressive (NAR) decoding based on connectionist temporal classification (CTC) outputs followed by an ASR decoder. We investigated two types of NAR HI: (1) parallel HI by using an autoregressive Transformer ASR decoder and (2) masked HI by using Mask-CTC, which combines CTC and the conditional masked language model. To reduce a mismatch in the ASR decoder between teacher-forcing during training and conditioning on CTC outputs during testing, we also propose sampling CTC outputs during training Experimental evaluations on three corpora show that Fast-MD achieved about 2x and 4x faster decoding speed than that of the naive MD model on GPU and CPU with comparable translation quality. Adopting the Conformer encoder and intermediate CTC loss further boosts its quality without sacrificing decoding speed.

TI The thorny problem of translation and interpreting quality
SO LINGUISTICA ANTVERPIENSIA NEW SERIES-THEMES IN TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB Judging quality in translation and interpreting and in the associated task of revision has a long and controversial history. We briefly comment on some aspects of this history to provide context for the contemporary perspectives on and investigations into quality assessment that are represented in this volume of Linguistica Antverpiensia, New Series: Themes in Translation Studies. A fundamental obstacle to progress is the lack of consensus about how to characterize high-quality translation or interpreting, let alone the identification of broadly accepted models for measuring translation or interpreting quality or the ability of translators or interpreters. The advent of machine translation and post-editing has focused attention on the very nature of quality: Is it proximity to a "gold standard" of perfection or is it characteristic of a product that simply serves its purpose well enough to satisfy the needs of the consumer? In other words, is quality something that should be measured and judged in absolute terms or in relative terms? Different philosophies of quality assessment reflect these dichotomies, with the absolutists seeking objective assessments based on detailed analyses of taxonomies of errors, whereas the relativists prefer a more holistic approach that is more sympathetic to subjective judgements. The contributors to this volume present a broad range of approaches to quality assessment in a variety of contexts. We describe their achievements and provide brief analyses through the lens of the framework above.

CL ELECTR NETWORK
AB We propose a new training objective named orderagnostic cross entropy (OAXE) for fully non-autoregressive translation (NAT) models. OAXE improves the standard cross-entropy loss to ameliorate the effect of word reordering, which is a common source of the critical multimodality problem in NAT. Concretely, OAXE removes the penalty for word order errors, and computes the cross entropy loss based on the best possible alignment between model predictions and target tokens. Since the log loss is very sensitive to invalid references, we leverage cross entropy initialization and loss truncation to ensure the model focuses on a good part of the search space. Extensive experiments on major WMT benchmarks show that OAXE substantially improves translation performance, setting new state of the art for fully NAT models. Further analyses show that OAXE alleviates the multimodality problem by reducing token repetitions and increasing prediction confidence. Our code, data, and trained models are available at https://github.com/ tencent-ailab/ICML21_OAXE.

AB In Neural Machine Translation, using word-level tokens leads to degradation in translation quality. The dominant approaches use subword-level tokens, but this increases the length of the sequences and makes it difficult to profit from word-level information such as POS tags or semantic dependencies.
   We propose a modification to the Transformer model to combine subword-level representations into word-level ones in the first layers of the encoder, reducing the effective length of the sequences in the following layers and providing a natural point to incorporate extra word-level information.
   Our experiments show that this approach maintains the translation quality with respect to the normal Transformer model when no extra word-level information is injected and that it is superior to the currently dominant method for incorporating word-level source language information to models based on subword-level vocabularies.

TI Mechanical rotation at low Reynolds number via reinforcement learning
SO PHYSICS OF FLUIDS
AB There is growing interest in the development of artificial microscopic machines that can perform complex maneuvers like swimming microorganisms for potential biomedical applications. At the microscopic scales, the dominance of viscous over inertial forces imposes stringent constraints on locomotion. In the absence of inertia, Purcell first proposed an elegant way to generate net translation using kinematically irreversible motions [E. M. Purcell, "Life at low Reynolds number," Am. J. Phys. 45, 3-11 (1977)]. In addition to net translation, a more recent prototype known as Purcell's "rotator" has been proposed in Dreyfus et al. ["Purcell's "rotator": Mechanical rotation at low Reynolds number," Eur. Phys. J. B 47, 161-164 (2005)] as a mechanical implementation of net rotation at low Reynolds numbers. These ingenious designs rely on knowledge of the surrounding environment and the physics of locomotion within the environment, which may be incomplete or unclear in more complex scenarios. More recently, reinforcement learning has been used as an alternative approach to enable a machine to learn effective locomotory gaits for net translation based on its interaction with the surroundings. In this work, we demonstrate the use of reinforcement learning to generate net mechanical rotation at low Reynolds numbers without requiring prior knowledge of locomotion. For a three-sphere configuration, the reinforcement learning recovers the strategy proposed by Dreyfus et al. As the number of spheres increases, multiple effective rotational strategies emerge from the learning process. However, given sufficiently long learning processes, all machines considered in this work converge to a single type of rotational policies that consist of traveling waves of actuation, suggesting its optimality of the strategy in generating net rotation at low Reynolds numbers.

AB The development of a Spanish-Catalan statistical machine translation system is described in this paper. The methodology used attempts to solve the problem using a purely inductive approach, without using linguistic knowledge. To obtain the translator we use the following steps: First, we obtain a bilingual corpus from the internet. Second, we fragment the corpus into units (sentences and tokens). Third, we align the sentences from the two different languages and we use the aligned corpus to train statistical models. We use a trigram model as the target language model and a phrase-based model as translation model. Finally, we use these models to translate. In other words, given a source sentence, we search for the most probable target sentence. We have compared our translator with the most commonly used Spanish-Catalan translators and we have obtained similar translation results to the other commercial systems.

AB Code search is a widely used technique by developers during software development. It provides semantically similar implementations from a large code corpus to developers based on their queries. Existing techniques leverage deep learning models to construct embedding representations for code snippets and queries, respectively. Features such as abstract syntactic trees, control flow graphs, etc., are commonly employed for representing the semantics of code snippets. However, the same structure of these features does not necessarily denote the same semantics of code snippets, and vice versa. In addition, these techniques utilize multiple different word mapping functions that map query words/code tokens to embedding representations. This causes diverged embeddings of the same word/token in queries and code snippets. We propose a novel context-aware code translation technique that translates code snippets into natural language descriptions (called translations). The code translation is conducted on machine instructions, where the context information is collected by simulating the execution of instructions. We further design a shared word mapping function using one single vocabulary for generating embeddings for both translations and queries. We evaluate the effectiveness of our technique, called TranCS, on the CodeSearchNet corpus with 1,000 queries. Experimental results show that TranCS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by 49.31% to 66.50% in terms of MRR (mean reciprocal rank).

AB The cascade approach to Speech Translation (ST) is based on a pipeline that concatenates an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system followed by a Machine Translation (MT) system. These systems are usually connected by a segmenter that splits the ASR output into, hopefully, semantically self-contained chunks to be fed into the MT system. This is specially challenging in the case of streaming ST, where latency requirements must also be taken into account. This work proposes novel segmentation models for streaming ST that incorporate not only textual, but also acoustic information to decide when the ASR output is split into a chunk. An extensive and thorough experimental setup is carried out on the Europarl-ST dataset to prove the contribution of acoustic information to the performance of the segmentation model in terms of BLEU score in a streaming ST scenario. Finally, comparative results with previous work also show the superiority of the segmentation models proposed in this work.

AB SRI International's Iraq Comm system performs bidirectional speech-to-speech machine translation between English and Iraqi Arabic in the domains of force protection, municipal and medical services, and training. The system was developed primarily under DARPA's TRANSTAC Program and includes: speech recognition components using SRI's Dynaspeak engine; MT components using SRI's Gemini and SRInterp; and speech synthesis from Cepstral, LLC. The communication between these components is coordinated by SRI's Flexible Translation (Flex Trans) Framework, which has an intuitive easy-to-use graphical user interface and an eyes-free hands-free mode, and is highly configurable and adaptable to user needs. It runs on a variety of standard portable hardware platforms and was designed to make it as easy as possible to build systems for other languages, as shown by the rapid development of an analogous system in English/Malay.

AB In general, the direct Speech-to-text translation (ST) is jointly trained with Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), and Machine Translation (MT) tasks. However, the issues with the current joint learning strategies inhibit the knowledge transfer across these tasks. We propose a task modulation network which allows the model to learn task specific features, while learning the shared features simultaneously. This proposed approach removes the need for separate finetuning step resulting in a single model which performs all these tasks. This single model achieves a performance of 28.64 BLEU score on ST MuST-C English-German, WER of 11.61% on ASR TEDLium v3, 23.35 BLEU score on MT WMT'15 English-German task. This sets a new state-of-the-art performance (SOTA) on the ST task while outperforming the existing end-to-end ASR systems.

AB Using a language model (LM) pretrained on two languages with large monolingual data in order to initialize an unsupervised neural machine translation (UNMT) system yields stateof-the-art results. When limited data is available for one language, however, this method leads to poor translations. We present an effective approach that reuses an LM that is pretrained only on a high-resource language. The monolingual LM is fine-tuned on both languages and is then used to initialize a UNMT model. To reuse the pretrained LM, we have to modify its predefined vocabulary, to account for the new language. We therefore propose a novel vocabulary extension method. Our approach, RE- LM, outperforms a competitive cross-lingual pretraining model ( XLM) in English-Macedonian (En-Mk) and EnglishAlbanian (En-Sq), yielding more than +8:3 BLEU points for all four translation directions.

AB Automatic cross-language Spoken Language Understanding porting is plagued by two limitations. First, SLU are usually trained on limited domain corpora. Second, language pair resources (e. g. aligned corpora) are scarce or unmatched in style (e. g. news vs. conversation). We present experiments on automatic style adaptation of the input for the translation systems and their output for SLU. We approach the problem of scarce aligned data by adapting the available parallel data to the target domain using limited in-domain and larger web crawled close-to-domain corpora. SLU performance is optimized by re-ranking its output with Recurrent Neural Network-based joint language model. We evaluate end-to-end SLU porting on close and distant language pairs: Spanish - Italian and Turkish - Italian; and achieve significant improvements both in translation quality and SLU performance.

SO PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATION THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB This article explores the relationship between language and power in the EU and discusses the possibilities of studying this relationship wit the analytical tools provided by Translation Studies. it presents the central institutions of the EU and the language services which cater for them. It discusses the rationale behind the policy of multilingualism and the many practical challenges which the execution of this policy poses for administrators, translators, interpreters and translation scholars. It also discusses to what degree practice in the EU corresponds with the ideal of multilingualism and equality of languages. This discussion includes deliberations on the influence of the increasing use of machine translation. Finally, the article looks to the future, where the admission of up to thirteen new countries poses great challenges ti the existing structures and practices, and discusses different suggestions to change the language policy of the EU and how it can be studied.

AB Reactive systems can be designed graphically using statecharts. This paper presents a scheme for the translation of statecharts into the Abstract Machine Notation (AMN) of the B method. By an example of a conveyor system, we ii lustrate how the design can be initially expressed graphically with statecharts, then translated to AMN and analysed in AMN, and then further refined to executable code.

AB The present article aims at presenting the results of an exploratory post-editing process study carried out in a Belgian university, the University of Mons. For this experiment, 64 final-year translation students with no post-editing experience post-edited from English into French parts of five different institutional texts from the Directorate-General for Translation (DGT) of the European Commission. They were additionally asked to fill in a prospective questionnaire and a retrospective one, related to their post-editing perception and strategies. Four students took part in the experiment on a separate computer equipped with an eye-tracking device, so that eye-tracking data could be collected and compared with these students' questionnaires. We found that results related to eye-tracking data correlate well with previous research, and that students' perceptions of post-editing depend on each university's particular context.

AB The purpose of the Universal Networking Language (UNL) is to allow people to access information on the Internet in their own language. UNL has been studied and applied to 48 languages. UNL system consists of two main components: EnConverter and DeConverter. EnConverter is used for converting a text from the source language to UNL, and DeConverter is used for converting a text from UNL to a target language. The UNL system has not yet been developed for Vietnamese. In this paper, we present the process of encoding a Vietnamese simple sentence into its corresponding UNL expression. We propose the algorithm using enconversion rules generate attributes and solve other relations. The achievement of result that we were able to create the CoDeVie tool to perform encode function for some cases of Vietnamese simple sentence.

AB Certain distinctions made in the lexicon of one language may be redundant when translating into another language. We quantify redundancy among source types by the similarity of their distributions over target types. We propose a language-independent framework for minimising lexical redundancy that can be optimised directly from parallel text. Optimisation of the source lexicon for a given target language is viewed as model selection over a set of cluster-based translation models.
   Redundant distinctions between types may exhibit monolingual regularities, for example, inflexion patterns. We define a prior over model structure using a Markov random field and learn features over sets of monolingual types that are predictive of bilingual redundancy. The prior makes model selection more robust without the need for language-specific assumptions regarding redundancy. Using these models in a phrase-based SMT system, we show significant improvements in translation quality for certain language pairs.
