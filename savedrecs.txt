TI Artificial Intelligence-based Machine English-Assisted Translation in
   the Internet of Things Environment
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB With the development of Internet of Things technology, the things that machines do instead of humans are becoming more and more complicated. Machine translation has developed rapidly in the past few decades, and the translation system has also been greatly improved. People's life and work are inseparable from machine translation, which brings a lot of convenience to people. But machine translation also has many flaws. Although machine translation can translate long texts in a very short time, its translation quality is quite poor, especially in the face of advanced English such as professional English, terminology, abbreviations, etc. To this end, machine English-assisted translation systems have been developed in recent years. Different from the working principle of machine English translation, machine English-assisted translation is a method of artificial intelligence + human-computer interaction. It uses convolutional neural networks and deep learning to translate words efficiently. The translator puts the original text and the translation into the machine database each time, and the machine can process some English terms, complex sentences, technical English, and other advanced English after continuous learning. Machine English-assisted translation can reduce repeated translations and greatly improve translation quality and translation efficiency. In this paper, the combination of artificial intelligence and machine English-assisted translation is compared with machine English translation, and comparative experiments are carried out by setting different matching degrees. Experiments show that the translation efficiency of machine English-assisted translation is much better than that of machine English translation. As the matching rate increases, the translation efficiency of machine English-assisted translation is higher. When the matching rate is greater than 80%, the translation efficiency is three times that of machine English translation. However, it is slightly insufficient in processing pure, simple statements. It highlights the advantages of machine English-assisted translation in terms of term translation and long complex sentences.

AB Machine translation is a discipline of applied computer science whose main purpose is to develop computer programs for the aim of fully automatic or computer-aided translation from one natural language into another. The method of Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT), which was introduced in the 1990s, changed the traditional approach to the development of machine translation systems that relied mainly on rule-based systems. Further, translation processes based on bilingual corpora were introduced. In the paper we describe an implementation of the example-based method for the purpose of development of a specialized machine translation system for automatic translation of reports concerning capital markets.

AB This paper intends to figure out the limitations of machine translation by conducting a comparative study of machine translation and human translation at lexical level and syntactic level. The outcome demonstrates that the most severe defect of machine translation is that it lacks human's cognitive competence. With this defect, machine translation repeatedly makes errors in the target text, reducing the output quality. In order to address this issue, this paper states that human involvement should be supplemented to machine translation by pre-editing the source text and post-editing the target text. Finally, this paper expects that, with the improvement and advance in machine translation technology, machine translation could obtain a leap in its output quality, promoting the development of translation.

AB Machine Translation (MT) has progressively evolved since 1940' s. It is a topic of active research now a days as the results found so far from machine translation tools are very unrealistic as compared to the human translation. Many different new approaches and techniques have evolved along with the new advent in machine translation. There are different paradigm of machine translation including Statistics Based Machine Translation (SBMT), Rule Based Machine Translation(RBMT), Hybrid machine translation(HMT). Besides these, Neural Network Based Systems have been developed for machine translation [1].
   We have not yet imparted the human kind of translation capabilities to the machine. Various online MT tools when tested on various input paragraphs from literature, though performed remarkably good but could hardly translate the sentences comparable to us, the humans.
   This paper provides a comparative study based on the translation of paragraphs by various online machine translation tools. The tools tested for this research involves rule based systems(Angla Bharti and Anubaad), and statistical systems (Bing, Google translator, IM translate that is supported by Microsoft Translator, Google Translate, Babylon Translator and other MT engines).
   The results shows that though statistical MT systems outperform the rule based machine translation, but as of yet human mankind is far from achieving its dream of creating a "perfect" automatic translation tool.

TI The Relationship between Machine Translation and Human Translation under
   the Influence of Artificial Intelligence Machine Translation
SO MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Machine translation based on artificial intelligence has many commercial applications, such as Google translation, Baidu translation, and Youdao translation. More artificial intelligence and its translation are still used in all aspects of life. Therefore, we should reexamine its impact on the relationship between human translation and machine translation. Therefore, based on this background, this paper discusses the impact of the development of artificial intelligence machine translation on the relationship between human translation and machine translation. Although the translation accuracy and overall situation of machine translation based on artificial intelligence are similar to that of human translation, the basic algorithm of machine translation is still a program that judges right and wrong through computer code. It cannot simulate the "faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance" of human translation in combination with social background and human culture. However, for some mechanical operations, such as business translation, scenes with low requirements, such as common vocabulary in daily tourism, can still meet the needs. Therefore, under the influence of artificial intelligence machine translation, the relationship between the two is that machine translation can replace human translation in some aspects, but it cannot replace human translation.

TI Adequacy in Machine vs. Human Translation: A Comparative Study of
   English and Persian Languages
SO APPLIED LINGUISTICS RESEARCH JOURNAL
AB Adequacy as the extent to which translation corresponds to the source text has always been a salient feature of any machine translation service. For this reason, the main objective of this comparative study was to analyze and compare translation adequacy in machine vs. human translation from English into the Persian language. In other words, this study sought to investigate whether machine translation product was adequate enough as compared to human translation. For this purpose, seven various texts were selected and translated from Persian to English by two translation students as well as machine translation services including Google Translate and Bing Translation. In addition, a reference translation by two expert translators was prepared against which human and machine translations were compared and analyzed. Moreover, the Sketch Engine software was exploited to analyze the translations. The results of the study revealed that there was no statistically significant difference between human and machine translations as compared to the reference translation and that machine translations were adequately appropriate translations. The findings of this research might have useful implications for research in the field of machine translations. In addition, the results of this research have practical implications for those who are interested in doing research in machine translation.

AB In the machine translation field, a common approach for more than two decades has been phrase-based statistical machine translation (PSMT). However, deep learning-based machine translation, also called neural machine translation (NMT), has emerged as a potential new approach to machine translation. Initial findings show that NMT yields better results than PSMT in some language pairs, while NMT results for some language pairs are less than or equal to PSMT results. In this paper, we initially studied and performed machine translation-based NMT for the Chinese-Vietnamese language pair. In addition, we performed machine translation-based PSMT on the same Chinese-Vietnamese bilingual corpus. The experimental results showed that NMT yielded better results (indicated by Bilingual-Evaluation-Understudy (BLEU) scores) than PSMT, although in some specific cases, NMT translation results were lower than those of PSMT.

TI A Comprehensive Survey on Various Fully Automatic Machine Translation
   Evaluation Metrics
SO NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS
AB The fast advancement in machine translation models necessitates the development of accurate evaluation metrics that would allow researchers to track the progress in text languages. The evaluation of machine translation models is crucial since its results are exploited for improvements of translation models. However fully automatically evaluating the machine translation models in itself is a huge challenge for the researchers as human evaluation is very expensive, time-consuming, unreproducible. This paper presents a detailed classification and comprehensive survey on various fully automated evaluation metrics, which are used to assess the performance or quality of machine translated output. Various fully automatic evaluation metrics are classified into five categories that are lexical, character, semantic, syntactic, and semantic & syntactic evaluation metrics for better understanding purpose. Taking account of the challenges posed in the field of machine translation evaluation by Statistical Machine Translation and Neural Machine Translation, along with a discussion on the advantages, disadvantages, and gaps for each fully automatic machine translation evaluation metric has been provided. The presented study will help machine translation researchers in quickly identifying automatic machine translation evaluation metrics that are most appropriate for the improvement or development of their machine translation model, as well as researchers in gaining a general understanding of how automatic machine translation evaluation research evolved.

TI Design and Testing of Automatic Machine Translation System Based on
   Chinese-English Phrase Translation
SO MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB With the development of linguistics and the improvement of computer performance, the effect of machine translation is getting better and better, and it is widely used. The automatic expression translation method based on the Chinese-English machine takes short sentences as the basic translation unit and makes full use of the order of short sentences. Compared with word-based statistical machine translation methods, the effect is greatly improved. The performance of machine translation is constantly improving. This article aims to study the design of phrase-based automatic machine translation systems by introducing machine translation methods and Chinese-English phrase translation, explore the design and testing of machine automatic translation systems based on the combination of Chinese-English phrase translation, and explain the role of machine automatic translation in promoting the development of translation. In this article, through the combination of machine translation experiments and machine automatic translation system design methods, the design and testing of machine automatic translation systems based on Chinese-English phrase translation combinations are studied to cultivate people's understanding of language, knowledge, and intelligence and then help solve other problems. Language processing issues promote the development of corpus linguistics. The experimental results in this article show that when the Chinese-English phrase translation probability table is changed from 82% to 51%, the BLEU translation evaluation system for the combination of Chinese-English phrases is improved. Automatic machine translation saves time and energy of translation work, which shows that machine translation shows its advantages due to its short development cycle and easy processing of large-scale corpora.

SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
AB Globalization is a trend in the future, and the exchanges among countries in the world in economy, politics, and culture are becoming more and more frequent. In order to overcome the increasingly prominent language barriers, translation has become an indispensable "bridge" for communication between countries. Manual translation has long been unable to meet the growing needs of translation. So, machine translation came into being, especially in recent years, machine translation has developed rapidly. Compared with manual translation, machine translation has unique advantages, that is, fast translation speed and free access. With the gradual improvement of the quality of machine translation, the quality of translation has basically met the requirements of rough reading, which makes machine translation one of the hotspots in recent years. However, to achieve the level of intensive reading, the quality of machine translation needs to be further improved. A thorough study of translation error analysis is an important step to improve the quality of machine translation. At present, there are few studies on error analysis of business English in academic circles, and most of them are just simple classification of translation errors, lacking in in-depth empirical research. This study aims to study the advantages and disadvantages of machine translation in translation practice based on wireless sensor network communication algorithms, analyze the typical errors in machine translation, put forward the idea that posttranslation editing can make up for the shortcomings of machine translation, treat English machine translation more objectively, make full use of machine translation tools, combine machine translation with post-manual editing perfectly, improve translation speed, and guarantee translation quality at the same time.

Furthermore, we developed baseline statistical and neural machine translation systems; we trained statistical and neural machine translation models using the corpus. In the experiments, we also used a large monolingual corpus for the language model of statistical machine translation and back-translation of neural machine translation. In the automatic evaluation, neural machine translation models outperform statistical machine translation models by approximately six to seven Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) points. Besides, among the neural machine translation models, the subword models outperform the word-based models by three to four BLEU points. Moreover, two other relevant automatic evaluation metrics, Translation Edit Rate on Character Level and Better Evaluation as Ranking, reflect corresponding differences among the trained models.

AB With the development of artificial intelligence, machine translation related technologies have been continuously improved, making machine translation to a more cutting-edge level. To solve the problem that traditional machine translation, this paper presents the machine online translation system based on deep neural network method. First, the principle of machine translation and attention mechanism based on neural network is analyzed and then the attention mechanisms implemented by PyTorch are studied. In addition, a neural network machine translation model and a machine online translation system are also designed. The proposed model can prepare the target text, and can achieve better BLEU score and word error rate. The BLEU value of the system in this paper is higher than that of the benchmark system, indicating that the system can guarantee the quality of translation and reach the level of use. Experiments show that the machine online translation system based on the deep neural network method can improve the translation quality and efficiency and meet the translation needs of a large number of visits.

Many systems has been proposed in the Indian perspective including rule-based, example-based, statistical based and a hybrid of these machine translation techniques. But, recent study has shown that Neural Machine Translation provides better results.
   In recent times Google and Facebook have developed Neural Machine Translation system. These systems are one-fits -all kind of systems which do not take into consideration the complexities in a language, like Indian languages. So, this paper proposes a broad framework for implementing Neural Machine Translation for Indian-English languages.

AB Nowadays two people who speak different languages are able to communicate with real-time translation software. This is benefited from machine translation technology. In China, there are multiple languages with great diversity. Uyghur and Chinese are the official languages of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China, which makes it urgent to improve the quality of Chinese-Uyghur (Uyghur-Chinese) machine translation. Recently, Neural machine translation (NMT) has reached promising results for most language pairs. Therefore, in this work, we first briefly analyze the difficulties of Uyghur machine translation. And then study the performance of Chinese-Uyghur machine translation with a statistical framework (PBMT) and two neural network frameworks (NMT and M-NMT), respectively. As a result, we not only have a better understanding of Chinese-Uyghur machine translation but also get our baseline system.

AB Parallel Machine Translation (PMT) is a new machine translation paradigm that takes advantage of high-speed and large-memory computers and existing machine translation systems with different characteristics to solve the difficult machine translation problem. PMT is based on technologies of parallel computing, machine translation, and artificial intelligence. A PMT system consists of many machine translation procedures running in parallel, coordinated by a controller to dissolve various ambiguities in machine translation. We have designed and implemented a PMT system based on the above approach at a coarse parallel level. The system consists of four independent machine translation subsystems. Each subsystem is implemented using an existing machine translation technique and has its own characteristics.
   In this paper we present the principles and practice of PMT. We also present some results of experiments with our experimental PMT system and point out some future research on PMT.

TI Neural Machine Translation With Explicit Phrase Alignment
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB While neural machine translation has achieved state-of-the-art translation performance, it is unable to capture the alignment between the input and output during the translation process. The lack of alignment in neural machine translation models leads to three problems: it is hard to (1) interpret the translation process, (2) impose lexical constraints, and (3) impose structural constraints. These problems not only increase the difficulty of designing new architectures for neural machine translation, but also limit its applications in practice. To alleviate these problems, we propose to introduce explicit phrase alignment into the translation process of arbitrary neural machine translation models. The key idea is to build a search space similar to that of phrase-based statistical machine translation for neural machine translation where phrase alignment is readily available. We design a new decoding algorithm that can easily impose lexical and structural constraints. Experiments show that our approach makes the translation process of neural machine translation more interpretable without sacrificing translation quality. In addition, our approach achieves significant improvements in lexically and structurally constrained translation tasks.

AB Arabic machine translation has an important role in most NLP tasks. Many machine translation systems that support Arabic exist already; however the quality of the translation needs to be improved. In this paper, we review different research approaches for Arabic-to-English machine translation. The approaches use various evaluation methods, datasets, and tools to measure their performance. Moreover, this paper sheds light on several methods and assessment efforts, and future ideas to improve the machine translation quality of Arabic-to-English. The review results depict three major findings; first neural machine translation approaches outperform other approaches in many aspects. Second, the recently emerging attention-based approach is being useful to improve the performance of neural machine translation for all languages. Third, the translation performance quality depends on the quality of the dataset, well-behaved aligned corpus, and the evaluation technique used.

TI Paraphrase Based Data Augmentation For Chinese-English Medical Machine
   Translation
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Medical machine translation is of great value for cross-border medical translation. Chinese to English neural machine translation has made great progress based on deep learning, powerful modeling ability and large-scale bilingual parallel data. Neural machine translation relies usually on large-scale parallel sentence pairs to train translation models. At present, Chinese-English translation data are mainly in the fields of news, policy and so on. Due to the lack of parallel data in the medical field, the performance of Chinese to English machine translation in the medical field is not compromising. To reduce the size of parallel data for training medical machine translation models, this paper proposes a paraphrase based data augmentation mechanism. The experimental results on a variety of neural machine translation models show that data augmentation through paraphrase augmentation can effectively improve the performance of medical machine translation, and has achieved consistency improvements on mainstream models such as RNNSearch and Transformers, which verifies the effectiveness of paraphrase augmentation method for domain machine translation. Meanwhile, the medical machine translation performances could be further improved based on large-scale pre-training language model, such as MT5.

A good QE system can help in three aspects of translation processes involving machine translation and post-editing: increasing productivity (by ruling out poor quality machine translation), estimating costs (by helping to forecast the cost of post-editing) and selecting a provider (if several machine translation systems are available). Interest in this research area has grown significantly in recent years, leading to regular shared tasks in the main machine translation conferences and intense scientific activity.

In particular, the paper evaluates the application of phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBSMT) and neural machine translation (NMT) for automating translation between Lumasaaba (an East African Bantu language) and English. As expected, the PBSMT approach outperforms the NMT approach on a small Bible-based corpus of parallel sentences.

TI Translation Mechanism of Neural Machine Algorithm for Online English
   Resources
SO COMPLEXITY
AB At the level of English resource vocabulary, due to the lack of vocabulary alignment structure, the translation of neural machine translation has the problem of unfaithfulness. This paper proposes a framework that integrates vocabulary alignment structure for neural machine translation at the vocabulary level. Under the proposed framework, the neural machine translation decoder receives external vocabulary alignment information during each step of the decoding process to further alleviate the problem of missing vocabulary alignment structure. Specifically, this article uses the word alignment structure of statistical machine translation as the external vocabulary alignment information and introduces it into the decoding step of neural machine translation. The model is mainly based on neural machine translation, and the statistical machine translation vocabulary alignment structure is integrated on the basis of neural networks and continuous expression of words. In the model decoding stage, the statistical machine translation system provides appropriate vocabulary alignment information based on the decoding information of the neural machine translation and recommends vocabulary based on the vocabulary alignment information to guide the neural machine translation decoder to more accurately estimate its vocabulary in the target language. From the aspects of data processing methods and machine translation technology, experiments are carried out to compare the data processing methods based on language model and sentence similarity and the effectiveness of machine translation models based on fusion principles. Comparative experiment results show that the data processing method based on language model and sentence similarity effectively guarantees data quality and indirectly improves the algorithm performance of machine translation model; the translation effect of neural machine translation model integrated with statistical machine translation vocabulary alignment structure is compared with other models.

TI Context based machine translation with recurrent neural network for
   English-Amharic translation
SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB Context-aware machine translation approaches improve the quality of translation by incorporating the context of the surrounding phrases in the translation of a phrase. So far, for the low-resource language pair English-Amharic, context-aware machine translation approaches have not been investigated in depth. Moreover, the current approaches for machine translation of the low-resource language pair English-Amharic usually require a large set of parallel corpus to achieve fluency. This research investigates a new approach that translates English text to Amharic text using a combination of context based machine translation (CBMT) and a recurrent neural network machine translation (RNNMT). We built a bilingual dictionary for the CBMT to use along with a target corpus. The RNNMT model is then provided with the output of the CBMT and a parallel corpus for training. The approach is evaluated using the New Testament Bible as a corpus. Our combinational approach on English-Amharic language pair yields a performance improvement over the simple neural machine translation (NMT), while no improvement is seen over CBMT for a small dataset. We have also assessed the impact of the dictionary used by CBMT on the overall performance of the approach. The result shows that the dictionary accuracy, and hence, the CBMT output is found to affect the combinational approach.

TI Machine English Translation Evaluation System Based on BP Neural Network
   Algorithm
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB In order to solve the problems of machine translation efficiency and translation quality, this paper proposes an English translation evaluation system based on the BP neural network algorithm. This method provides users with a more intelligent machine translation service experience. With the help of the BP neural network algorithm, taking English online translation as the research object, Google's translation quality is the best, with an error frequency of only 167, while Baidu translation and iFLYTEK translation in China have a high error rate of 266 and 301, respectively, which is much higher than Google translation. A model of machine translation evaluation based on the neural network algorithm is proposed to better solve the disadvantages of traditional English machine translation. The results show that the machine translation system based on the neural network algorithm can further optimize the problems existing in machine translation, such as insufficient use of information and large scale of model parameters, and further improve the performance of neural network machine translation.

AB Machine translation is one of the important research directions in the field of artificial intelligence and natural language. It has important scientific research value and practical value. Neural machine translation (NMT) is a new machine translation model which uses neural network to realize the transformation from source language to target language. In recent years, neural machine translation method based on sequence to sequence has major breakthrough in machine translation task, in most of the language of the translation effect beyond the effects of statistical machine translation, but for the translation under the condition of scarce resources, neural machine translation has yet to achieve the desired effect, this paper mainly introduces several effective methods and models under low resource conditions, as well as their problems and challenges, and the existing problems and challenges. Then look forward to the future research direction and development trend.

AB Constructing a classifier that distinguishes machine translations from human translations is a promising approach to automatic evaluation of machine-translated sentences. Using this approach, we constructed a classifier using Support Vector Machines based on word-alignment distributions between source sentences and human or machine translations. This paper investigates the validity of the classification-based method by comparing it with well-known evaluation methods. The experimental results show that our classification-based method can accurately evaluate fluency of machine translations.

AB Since 1980s, Translation Memory (TM) have been accessible. It becomes an important language technology to assist the translation. It is a database that saves "segments", which may be sentences, paragraphs or sentence-kind elements. Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) is planned to use along with Machine Translation System (MTS). To make efficient machine translation and to reduce the response time of online machine translation, we come up with the use of a TM. The combined architecture of machine translation with translation memory is indicated. To make the translator's task faster, more efficient and easier, translator tools were designed. Translation tools were designed with the objective to minimize monotonous translation work.

AB Machine Translation has become one of the top research interests for a few years. Compared to others, statistical and neural network approaches toward machine translation are performing the best. However, both approaches have advantages over one another. In recent years, few researchers have conducted experiments to create hybrid machine translation systems that combine the strength of statistical and neural network approach to produce a better translation. In this paper, we review all of these research methodologies, datasets, evaluation scores and point out their shortcomings.

SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
AB We propose Generate and Repair Machine Translation (GRMT), a constraint-based approach to machine translation that focuses on accurate translation output, GRMT performs the translation by generating a Translation Candidate (TC), verifying the syntax and semantics of the TC and repairing the TC when required, GRMT comprises three modules: Analysis Lite Machine Translation (ALMT), Translation Candidate Evaluation (TCF) and Repair and Iterate (RI). The key features of GRMT are simplicity, modularity, extendibility, and multilinguality.
   An English-Thai translation system has been implemented to illustrate the performance of GRMT. The system has been developed and run under SWI-Prolog 3.2.8. The English and Thai grammars hake been developed based on Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) and implemented on the Attribute Logic Engine (ALE). GRMT was tested to generate the translations for a number of sentences, phrases Examples are provided throughout the article to illustrate how GRMT performs the translation process.

SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB Despite the promising results achieved in last years by statistical machine translation, and more precisely, by the neural machine translation systems, this technology is still not error-free. The outputs of a machine translation system must be corrected by a human agent in a post-editing phase. Interactive protocols foster a human computer collaboration, in order to increase productivity. In this work, we integrate the neural machine translation into the interactive machine translation framework. Moreover, we propose new interactivity protocols, in order to provide the user an enhanced experience and a higher productivity. Results obtained over a simulated benchmark show that interactive neural systems can significantly improve the classical phrase-based approach in an interactive-predictive machine translation scenario.

AB The quality of machine translation is rapidly evolving. Today one can find several machine translation systems on the web that provide reasonable translations, although the systems are not perfect. In some specific domains, the quality may decrease. A recently proposed approach to this domain is neural machine translation. It aims at building a jointly-tuned single neural network that maximizes translation performance, a very different approach from traditional statistical machine translation. Recently proposed neural machine translation models often belong to the encoder-decoder family in which a source sentence is encoded into a fixed length vector that is, in turn, decoded to generate a translation. The present research examines the effects of different training methods on a Polish-English Machine Translation system used for medical data. The European Medicines Agency parallel text corpus was used as the basis for training of neural and statistical network-based translation systems. The main machine translation evaluation metrics have also been used in analysis of the systems. A comparison and implementation of a real-time medical translator is the main focus of our experiments.

It's based on the characteristics of English Machine Translation by searching for HEMTM relevant to the model building of hierarchical English machine translation depending on the intelligent fuzzy decision tree algorithm from the Internet. On the other hand, the differences of relevant HEMTM on machine translation are also considered in this model by ranking the accuracy of machine translation through the popularity and importance from relevant HEMTM. In the end the model building was proved reasonable and accurate through experiments.

AB Nowadays, machine translation has important role in general communication. The need for machine translation system is higher in this era, resolving culture and nation boundary. Finding correct and optimal translation is not an easy task in language processing. Several machine translation system already exists, but the quality of the translation needed to be improved further. This paper discusses machine translation researches that involve Indonesian language to the other languages by systematic literature review. This paper exposes different approaches and tools for machine translation. The approaches also use various evaluation methods to measure the performance. Moreover, this paper proposes several future works to improve the machine translation quality of Indonesian to the other languages. The review results show that the attention-based approach is being increasingly used to improve the performance of neural machine translation. The translation performance quality depends on the number of the corpus, well-behaved aligned corpus, and the technique used.

The method acquires translation rules automatically as translation knowledge from a parallel corpus without depending on linguistic tools. The translation rules, which are acquired based on Intuitive Common Parts Continuum (ICPC), can deal with the correspondence of the global structure of a source sentence and that of a target sentence without requiring linguistic tools. Moreover, it generates better translation results by application of translation rules to translation results obtained through statistical machine translation. The experimentally obtained results underscore the effectiveness of applying the translation rules for statistical machine translation.

SO JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND CHINESE LANGUAGE TEACHING
AB This study was conducted at an Ivy League University and analyzes approximately 500 translation exercises that were collected from 10 homework assignments of 13 students in an intermediate Chinese language course. Through content analysis, interviews, and participant observation, this research finds that machine translation poses challenges to the traditional format of Chinese language assignments, especially translation homework. This research shows that students rely on machine translation to varying degrees to do these translation exercises. The stress of receiving a good score after finishing a huge amount of homework is one of the main reasons that motivates students to use machine translation. The accuracy of machine translation, especially Sogou Translate is extremely high. This finding is likely to shatter the myth that machine translation is not accurate enough hence students cannot use it as a short cut to receive a good score.

AB Neural machine translation is an approach to learn automatic translation using a large, single neural network. It models the whole translation process in an end-to-end manner without requiring any additional components as in statistical machine translation systems. Neural machine translation has achieved promising translation performances. It has become the conventional approach in machine translation research nowadays. In this work, we applied neural machine translation for English-Punjabi language pair. In particular, attention based mechanism was used for developing the machine translation system. We also developed the parallel corpus for English-Punjabi language pair. As of now, we are releasing version-1 of the corpus and it is freely available for any non-commercial research. To the best of author's knowledge, there is no relevant literature on neural/statistical machine translation implementation for English-Punjabi language pair as of this writing. To evaluate the system, BLEU evaluation metric was used. To quantify system's performance, the results obtained were further compared with existing systems such as AnglaMT and Google Translate. The BLEU score of the developed system exceeds both of these systems marginally.

TI Hybrid Translation with Classification: Revisiting Rule-Based and Neural
   Machine Translation
SO ELECTRONICS
AB This paper proposes a hybrid machine-translation system that combines neural machine translation with well-developed rule-based machine translation to utilize the stability of the latter to compensate for the inadequacy of neural machine translation in rare-resource domains. A classifier is introduced to predict which translation from the two systems is more reliable. We explore a set of features that reflect the reliability of translation and its process, and training data is automatically expanded with a small, human-labeled dataset to solve the insufficient-data problem. A series of experiments shows that the hybrid system's translation accuracy is improved, especially in out-of-domain translations, and classification accuracy is greatly improved when using the proposed features and the automatically constructed training set. A comparison between feature- and text-based classification is also performed, and the results show that the feature-based model achieves better classification accuracy, even when compared to neural network text classifiers.

AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has attracted increasing attention in the recent years. However, it tends to require very large training corpora which could prove problematic for languages with low resources. For this reason, Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) continues to be a popular approach for low-resource language pairs. In this work, we address English-Basque translation and compare the performance of three contemporary statistical and neural machine translation systems: OpenNMT, Moses SMT and Google Translate. For evaluation, we employ an open-domain and an IT-domain corpora from the WMT16 resources for machine translation. In addition, we release a small dataset (Berriak) of 500 highly-accurate English-Basque translations of complex sentences useful for a thorough testing of the translation systems.

AB Machine translation services to facilitate social interaction are strongly needed. This paper discusses forms of communication with machine translation services and the required translation quality. The Multi-Level Machine Translation method based on semantic analysis is proposed to realize the required translation quality.
   Test experiments to date indicate that conventional machine translation systems, which place emphasis on syntax developed from compositional semantics, are limited to a translation success rate of about 30% for Japanese to English machine translation. The proposed method achieves a success rate of up to 80%. This level of translation quality is sufficient to make many new communication services feasible such as E-mail with translation.

AB In this paper, an extended combined approach of phrase based statistical machine translation (SMT), example based MT (EBMT) and rule based MT (RBMT) is proposed to develop a novel hybrid data driven MT system capable of outperforming the baseline SMT, EBMT and RBMT systems from which it is derived. In short, the proposed hybrid MT process is guided by the rule based MT after getting a set of partial candidate translations provided by EBMT and SMT subsystems. Previous works have shown that EBMT systems are capable of outperforming the phrase-based SMT systems and RBMT approach has the strength of generating structurally and morphologically more accurate results. This hybrid approach increases the fluency, accuracy and grammatical precision which improve the quality of a machine translation system. A comparison of the proposed hybrid machine translation (HTM) model with renowned translators i.e. Google, BING and Babylonian is also presented which shows that the proposed model works better on sentences with ambiguity as well as comprised of idioms than others.

AB Because human evaluation of machine translation is extensive but expensive, we often use automatic evaluation in developing a machine translation system. From viewpoint of evaluation cost, there are two types of evaluation methods: one uses (multiple) reference translation, e.g., METEOR, and the other classifies machine translation either into machine-like or human-like translation based on translation properties, i.e., a classification-based method. Previous studies showed that classification-based methods could perform evaluation properly. These studies constructed a classifier by learning linguistic properties of translation such as length of a sentence, syntactic complexity, and literal translation, and their classifiers marked high classification accuracy. These previous studies, however, have not examined whether their classification accuracy could present translation quality. Hence, we investigated whether classification accuracy depends on translation quality. The experiment results showed that our method could correctly distinguish the degrees of translation quality.

AB Low-resource machine translation research often requires building baselines to benchmark estimates of progress in translation quality. Neural and statistical phrase-based systems are often used with out-of-the-box settings to build these initial baselines before analyzing more sophisticated approaches, implicitly comparing the first machine translation system to the absence of any translation assistance. We argue that this approach overlooks a basic resource: if you have parallel text, you have a translation memory. In this work, we show that using available text as a translation memory baseline against which to compare machine translation systems is simple, effective, and can shed light on additional translation challenges.

SO TRANSLATION SPACES
AB In the context of recent improvements in the quality of machine translation (MT) output and new use cases being found for that output, this article reports on an experiment using statistical and neural MT systems to translate literature. Six professional translators with experience of literary translation produced English-to-Catalan translations under three conditions: translation from scratch, neural MT post-editing, and statistical MT post-editing. They provided feedback before and after the translation via questionnaires and interviews. While all participants prefer to translate from scratch, mostly due to the freedom to be creative without the constraints of segment-level segmentation, those with less experience find the MT suggestions useful.

AB Whenever the quality provided by a machine translation system is not enough, a human expert is required to correct the sentences provided by the machine translation system. In this environment, the human translator is generating bilingual data after each translation has been marked as correct, and expects the system to be able to learn from the errors made. In this paper, we analyse the appropriateness of discriminative ridge regression for adapting the scaling factors of a state-of-the-art machine translation system within a conventional post-editing scenario and also within an interactive machine translation setup. Results show that the strategies applied in the former setup cannot be directly applied in the latter framework. Hence, the discriminative ridge regression is revised and adapted for the interactive machine translation framework, with encouraging results.

AB Automatic machine translation is gaining more and more attention in a particular segment of the research community that treats various topics from artificial intelligence, natural language processing, computational linguistics, machine learning and data science. Machine translation is a complex task in which a computer is utilised for the purpose of translating from source to one or more target languages without human involvement, or with a minimum of interventions. In general, machine translation could be implemented in higher education and academic curricula in a variety of possible fields and applications. Although there are several approaches to machine translation, two are dominant today - statistical and neural machine translation. Both are being used in this research in form of two online machine translation systems. The aim of this paper is to examine the usability of machine translation for poetry and a low-resource language pair, such as Croatian-German. The authors chose to use a data set that contained the works of a relevant contemporary poet of the Croatian language and the translations of his poems in German that were conducted by two professional literary translators. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of machine translation of poetry with regard to special automatic quality metrics.

The speech-to-speech translation system consists of three components: speech recognition, machine translation and speech synthesis. Many techniques for integration of speech recognition and machine translation have been proposed. However, speech synthesis has not yet been considered. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on machine translation and speech synthesis, and report a subjective evaluation to analyze the impact of each component. The results of these analyses show that the naturalness and intelligibility of synthesized speech are strongly affected by the fluency of the translated sentences.

Deep learning-based automatic machine translation was made. During the unsupervised and supervised learning stages, language information extraction executes unsupervised learning and reconstructs automated translation samples of bilingual words using a noise lessening automatic coding machine. To improve the effect of language vector feature extraction, the machine optimizes the effect of language vector feature extraction by importing language vector function and machine automatic translation information into bilingual words. The machine automatic translation language vector function is imported into the translation quality evaluation model based on deep learning to realize the automatic machine translation quality evaluation. The experimental results show that the constructed model can accurately evaluate the quality of machine automatic translation, the pattern of translated sentences and the number of sentences do not adversely affect the evaluation performance of the model, and the model exerts a good effect is showing.

SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB Machine Translation bridges communication barriers and eases interaction among people having different linguistic backgrounds. Machine Translation mechanisms exploit a range of techniques and linguistic resources for translation prediction. Neural machine translation (NMT), in particular, seeks optimality in translation through training of neural network, using a parallel corpus having a considerable number of instances in the form of a parallel running source and target sentences. Easy availability of parallel corpora for major Indian language forms and the ability of NMT systems to better analyze context and produce fluent translation make NMT a prominent choice for the translation of Indian languages. We have trained, tested, and analyzed NMT systems for English to Tamil, English to Hindi, and English to Punjabi translations. Predicted translations have been evaluated using Bilingual Evaluation Understudy and by human evaluators to assess the quality of translation in terms of its adequacy, fluency, and correspondence with human-predicted translation.

Some translationese features tend to appear in simultaneous interpreting with higher frequency than in human text translation, but the reasons for this are unclear. This study analyzes translationese patterns in translation, interpreting, and machine translation outputs in order to explore possible reasons. In our analysis we (i) detail two non-invasive ways of detecting translationese and (ii) compare translationese across human and machine translations from text and speech. We find that machine translation shows traces of translationese, but does not reproduce the patterns found in human translation, offering support to the hypothesis that such patterns are due to the model (human vs. machine) rather than to the data (written vs. spoken).

AB Discriminatively trained classification techniques have been shown to out-perform generative techniques on many speech and natural language processing problems. However, most of the research in machine translation has been based on generative modeling techniques. The application of classification techniques to machine translation requires scaling classifiers to deal with very large label sets (the vocabulary of the target language). In this paper, we present a method to scale classifiers to very large label sets and apply it to train classifiers for machine translation. We contrast this approach to a generatively trained machine translation model represented as a weighted finite-state transducer. We show translation accuracy results on spoken language corpora in English to Spanish and English to Japanese translation tasks.

TI Machine Intelligence for Language Translation from Kashmiri to English
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT
AB Machine translation (MT) is an emerging research as well as application area in the contemporary world. It is receiving significant attention from academia, industry and corporate houses. A wide range of translation techniques are being applied either individually or in combination for machine translation of different languages across the globe. However, there are still many languages that are either completely missing or poorly visible on the machine translation map. The Kashmiri language is one such language where very little or negligible work has been done related to its machine translation. This paper aims to present a Kashmiri-to-English Machine Translation System and highlight various features of the Kashmiri language. The system is based on machine intelligence having the ability to learn various translation rules from the translated set of input sentences, using Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) architecture for deep sequence learning. The paper also discusses various challenges related to machine translation from Kashmiri to English or other languages. The work presented in this paper is the first of its nature and can serve as a bedrock for research community interested to work on machine translation of Kashmiri language.

SO ONOMAZEIN
AB Computer-assisted translation tools are increasingly supplemented by the presence of machine translation (MT) in different areas and working environments, from technical translation to translation in international organizations. MT is also present in the translation of tourism texts, from brochures to food menus, websites and tourist guides. Its need or suitability for use is the subject of growing debate. This article presents a comparative analysis of tourist guides translated by a human translator and three machine translation systems. The aims are to determine a first approach to the level of quality of machine translation in tourist texts and to establish whether some tourist texts can be translated using machine translation alone or whether human participation is necessary, either for the complete translation of the text or only for post-editing tasks.

TI Exploring the further integration of machine translation in
   English-Chinese cross language information access
SO PROGRAM-ELECTRONIC LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Purpose - This paper seeks to examine the further integration of machine translation technologies with cross language information access in providing web users the capabilities of accessing information beyond language barriers. Machine translation and cross language information access are related technologies, and yet they have their own unique contributions in handling information in multiple languages. This paper aims to demonstrate that there are many opportunities to further integrate machine translation with cross language information access, and the combination can greatly empower web users in their information access.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using English and Chinese as the language pair for studying, this paper looks at machine translation in query translation-based cross language information access at multiple important aspects, which include query translation, relevance feedback, interactive cross language information access, out-of-vocabulary term translation, and data fusion. The goal is to obtain more insights about the wide range usages of machine translation in cross language information access, and to help the community to identify promising future directions for both machine translation and cross language access.
   Findings - Machine translation can be applied effectively in many places in the whole cross language information access process. Queries translated by a machine translation system are high quality and are more robust in handling potential untranslated terms. Translation enhancement, a relevance feedback method using machine translation generated returned documents, is not only a valid technique by itself, but also helps to generate more robust cross language information access performance when combined with other relevance feedback. techniques. Machine translation is also found to play a significant role in resolving untranslated terms and in data fusion.
   Originality/value - This set of comparative empirical studies on integrating machine translation and cross language information access was performed on a common evaluation framework, and examined integration at multiple points of the cross language access process. The experimental results demonstrate the value of further integrating machine translation in cross language information access, and identify interesting future directions for both machine translation and cross language information access research.

AB One of difficult issues in pattern-based machine translation system is maybe to find how to overcome the domain difference in adapting a system from one domain to other domain. This paper describes how we have resolved such barriers among domains as default target word of any domain, domain-specific patterns, and domain adaptation of engine modules in pattern-based machine translation system, especially English-Korean pattern-based machine translation system. For this, we will discuss two types of customization methods which mean a method adapting an existing system to new domain. One is the pure customization method introduced for patent machine translation system in 2006 and another is the upgraded customization method applied to scientific paper machine translation system In 2007. By introducing an upgraded customization method, we could implement a practical machine translation system for scientific paper translation within 8 months, in comparison with the patent machine translation system that was completed even in 24 months by the pure customization method. The translation accuracy of scientific paper machine translation system also rose 77.25% to 81.10% in spite of short term of 8 months.

AB This study is focused on the comparison of phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) systems and neural machine translation (NMT) systems using automatic metrics for translation quality evaluation for the language pair of English and Slovak. As the statistical approach is the predecessor of neural machine translation, it was assumed that the neural network approach would generate results with a better quality. An experiment was performed using residuals to compare the scores of automatic metrics of the accuracy (BLEU_n) of the statistical machine translation with those of the neural machine translation. The results showed that the assumption of better neural machine translation quality regardless of the system used was confirmed. There were statistically significant differences between the SMT and NMT in favor of the NMT based on all BLEU_n scores. The neural machine translation achieved a better quality of translation of journalistic texts from English into Slovak, regardless of if it was a system trained on general texts, such as Google Translate, or specific ones, such as the European Commission's (EC's) tool, which was trained on a specific-domain.

We propose a novel way to deal with the rare and unknown words. Based on neural machine translation of using pointers over input sequence, our approach which consists of preprocess and post-process can be used in all neural machine translation model. Pre-process modify the Uyghur-Chinese corpus to extend the ability of pointer network, and the post-process retranslating the raw translation by a phrase-based machine translation model or a wordlist. Experiment show that neural machine translation model used the approach proposed by this paper get a higher BLEU score than the phrase-based model in Uyghur-Chinese MT.

AB Machine translation usually relies on parallel corpora to provide parallel signals for training The advent of unsupervised machine translation has brought machine translation away from this reliance, though performance still lags behind traditional supervised machine translation. In unsupervised machine translation, the model seeks symmetric language similarities as a source of weak parallel signal to achieve translation. Chomsky's Universal Grammar theory postulates that grammar is an innate form of knowledge to humans and is governed by universal principles and constraints. Therefore, in this paper, we seek to leverage such shared grammar clues to provide more explicit language parallel signals to enhance the training of unsupervised machine translation models. Through experiments on multiple typical language pairs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches.

Machine translation is a sub-field of computational linguistics that uses computer software to translate text in one natural language to another language. Alignment is one of the major challenges in machine translation. Hidden markov model (HMM) based alignment described in this paper is more accurate, avoids invalid alignments and improves translation quality. HMM uses bigram translation probabilities for keeping word context in the language model which produce close to error-free output that reads fluently in the target language.

TI Hybrid Machine Translation by Combining Output from Multiple Machine
   Translation Systems
SO BALTIC JOURNAL OF MODERN COMPUTING
AB This paper aims to combine output from various machine translation (MT) systems so that the overall translation quality of the source text would increase. Applicability of the developed methods for small, morphologically rich and under-resourced languages is evaluated, especially Latvian and Estonian. Existing methods have been analysed, and several combinations of methods have been proposed. The proposed methods have been implemented and evaluated using automatic and human evaluation. During this research novel methods have been created that structure source language sentences into linguistically motivated fragments and combine them using a character level neural language model; combine neural machine translation output by employing sourcetranslation attention alignments; use a multi-pass approach to produce additional incrementally improving training data. The key results of this research are new state-of-the-art machine translation systems for English <-> Estonian; approaches for utilising neural MT generated attention alignments for MT combination and comprehension of resulting translations; MT combination systems for combining output from English -> Latvian statistical MT. A practical application of the methods is implemented and described.

AB In recent years, machine translation has made outstanding achievements, but there are also the problems such as fuzzy rules, insufficient data and improper order in the machine translation practice, which makes it still unsatisfactory. Machine learning can abstract learning features, and establish complex mapping relationship between input and output signals, and effectively improve the problems existing in the translation system. The concepts and common models of machine learning and deep learning are given in this paper. Based on the neural model, the paper analyses the rules, structure and models of machine translation system. According to the requirement of the translation system, this paper develops a translation system based on machine learning, and gives the design process of the pre-processing module, the coding module, the attention module and the decoding module. Practice has proved that the system has a good performance in translation performance.

TI THE TRANSLATION QUALITY PROBLEMS OF MACHINE TRANSLATION SYSTEMS FOR THE
   KAZAKH LANGUAGE
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS MECHANICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Kazakh language is related to languages with complex morphology and syntax. Today, most machine translation systems consider Kazakh language too, like Google, Yandex, Prompt, etc. This article describes the errors, shortcomings, and problems of machine translation (MT) into the Kazakh language. To analyze errors in machine translation into the Kazakh language, the most popular electronic translation programs were selected. When translating from Russian and English into Kazakh (and vice versa), various errors may occur, since the Kazakh language is different from other languages, and has special characteristics. To compare the results, an empirical method was used, namely, monitoring and testing the translation results of machine translation systems. Considering the results of statistical methods, the rule-based and neural networks based methods in machine translations were also analyzed. The practical significance of the study lies in the development of recommendations for the identification and elimination of errors when editing the results of MT. The scientific significance of the study lies in the fact that for the first time errors and inaccuracies arising from machine translation of the Kazakh language have been systematized. The assessment of the quality of MT is also presented. The research carried out in this article will be used for the post-editing problem in machine translation.

TI Machine Translation in Indian Languages: Challenges and Resolution
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB English to Indian language machine translation poses the challenge of structural and morphological divergence. This paper describes English to Indian language statistical machine translation using preordering and suffix separation. The preordering uses rules to transfer the structure of the source sentences prior to training and translation. This syntactic restructuring helps statistical machine translation to tackle the structural divergence and hence provides better translation quality. The suffix separation is used to tackle the morphological divergence between English and highly agglutinative Indian languages. We demonstrate that the use of preordering and suffix separation helps in improving the quality of English to Indian language machine translation.

AB Patent documents involve many professional fields and include multiple paragraphs, which have brought great difficulties for patent machine translation. This paper presents a hybrid strategy for patent machine translation, which combines the template-based machine translation (TBMT), the semantic rule-based machine translation (RBMT) and the statistics-based machine translation (SMT). The TBMT and RBMT are combined to translate the claim texts in patent documents, and the RBMT and SMT are combined to translate the other texts. In order to find the optimal hybrid strategy, three larger patent fields are selected to train specific models, and then compared with the general model. The experiment results show that the hybrid strategy method outperforms each individual system across a varied set of automatic translation evaluation metrics, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid strategy method in patent machine translation.

TI Assessing the effectiveness of machine translation in the Chinese EFL
   writing context: A replication of Lee (2020)
SO RECALL
AB With the dramatic improvement in quality, machine translation has emerged as a tool widely adopted by language learners. Its use, however, has been a divisive issue in language education. We conducted an approximate replication of Lee (2020) about the impact of machine translation on EFL writing. This study used a mixed-methods approach with automatic text analyzer Coh-Metrix and human ratings, supplemented with questionnaires, interviews, and screen recordings. The findings obtained support most of the original work, suggesting that machine translation can help language learners improve their EFL writing proficiency, specifically in strengthening lexical expressions. Students generally hold positive attitudes towards machine translation, despite some skeptical views regarding the values of machine translation. Most students express a strong wish to learn how to effectively use machine translation. Machine translation literacy instruction is therefore suggested for incorporation into the curriculum for language students.

AB In a multilingual diversity country like India, language translation plays a significant factor in the area of text processing application such as information extraction, machine learning, natural language understanding, information retrieval and machine translation. Thereexists many challenges and issues in translation between languages, especially the Dravidian language, such as ambiguities, lexical divergence, syntactic, lexical mismatches and semantic issues, etc. The n - gram language model (LM) performs very well machine translation. However the existing approach is not efficient for generating n - gram from large bi-lingual parallel corpora. Most existing approaches are limited to monolingual to minimize redundant n - gram. To overcome this, this work presents an efficient machine translation model using machine learning techniques. No prior work has considered machine translation of Kannada and Telugu. The experimentis conducted on Wikipedia dataset show significant performance in term of accuracy and computation complexity of alignment considering different threshold.

AB Language translation is one task in which machine is definitely lagging behind the cognitive powers of human beings. Statistical Machine Translation is one of the conventional ways of solving the problem of machine translation. This method requires huge data sets and performs well on similar grammar structured language pairs. In recent years, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has emerged as an alternate way of addressing the same issue. In this paper, we explore different configurations for setting up a Neural Machine Translation System for Indian language Hindi. We have experimented with eight different architecture combinations of NMT for English to Hindi and compared our results with conventional machine translation techniques. We have also observed in this work that NMT requires very less amount of data size for training and thus exhibits satisfactory translation for few thousands of training sentences as well.

AB Lay people discussing machine translation systems often perform a round trip translation, that is translating a text into a foreign language and back, to measure the quality of the system. The idea behind this is that a good system will produce a round trip translation that is exactly (or perhaps very close to) the original text. However, people working with machine translation systems intuitively know that round trip translation is not a good evaluation method. In this article we will show empirically that round trip translation cannot be used as a measure of the quality of a machine translation system. Even when using translations of multiple machine translation systems into account, to reduce the impact of errors of a single system, round trip translation cannot be used to measure machine translation quality.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
AB Machine translation has developed rapidly. But there are some problems in machine translation, such as good reading, unable to reflect the mood and context, and even some languages machines cannot recognize. In order to improve the quality of translation, this paper uses the SSCI method to improve the quality of translation. It is found that the translation quality of hierarchical phrases is significantly improved after using the parallel algorithm of machine translation, which is about 9% higher than before, and the problem of context free grammar is also solved. The research also found that the use of parallel algorithm can effectively reduce the network memory occupation; the original 10-character content, after using the parallel algorithm, only need to occupy 8 characters, and the optimization reaches 20%. This means that the parallel algorithm of hierarchical phrase machine translation based on distributed network memory can play a very important role in machine translation.

The phrase-based statistical machine translation model has made significant advancement in translation quality over the word-based model. In this paper, we attempt to apply the technique of proportional analogy to statistical machine translation systems. We propose a novel approach to apply proportional analogy to generate translations of unseen n-grams from the phrase table for phrase-based statistical machine translation. Experiments are conducted with two datasets of different sizes. We also investigate two methods to integrate n-grams translations produced by proportional analogy into the state-of-the-art statistical machine translation system, Moses.(1) The experimental results show that unseen n-grams translations generated using the technique of proportional analogy are rewarding for statistical machine translation systems with small datasets.

We propose two models: (i) a Transformer-based unified neural network for the quality estimation of machine translation, which consists of a Transformer bottleneck layer and a bidirectional long short-term memory network that are jointly optimized and fine-tuned for quality estimation, and (ii) a Transformer-based re-decoding model for machine translation, which takes the generated machine translation outputs as the approximate contextual environment of the target language and synchronously re-decodes each token in the machine translation outputs. Experimental results on the development set show that the proposed approaches outperform the baseline systems.

AB Although many machine-translation programs are currently available, few evaluation methods of such translation exist for any given application area. It is difficult to evaluate machine-translation systems objectively because the quality of a translation depends on the combination of three factors:  the translation program, the dictionary, and the original document. In this study, we developed a quantitative evaluation method for assessing machine translation, which evaluates these three factors separately. We applied this method to the translation of English to Japanese for medical literature and the method proved to be a good indicator for further system improvement. Using this method we also discovered other important points for machine translation, such as the examination of target documents for the construction of a better application dictionary.

AB Machine translation errors are classified into groups of three grammatical levels: clause errors, clause-complex errors and textual errors, with a purpose to unravel causes leading to these errors. As illustrated with examples, clause complex presents different grammatical features from clause and the structural differences between Chinese and English at clause-complex level are the fundamental source of machine translation errors. This research, from perspectives of translation from Chinese to English and translation from English to Chinese, categorized clause-complex level structural differences between English and Chinese. The effects of these differences on machine translation are also analyzed, while future improvement suggestions on machine translation technology are provided accordingly.

AB Both learner translation and machine translation demand quality assessment. Several influential metrics used for machine translation evaluation have been applied to learner translation. Although multiple references are employed in learner translation assessment, no machine translation evaluation metric performs consistently well on all source topics. In this study, we train a new assessment model by combining the scores of several machine translation evaluation metrics into Support Vector Regression (SVR) learning model. With minimum language resources, the outputs of SVR evaluation model correlate with expert judgments significantly better than individual metric does and have better stability on our experimental corpus, which contains 9 topics EFL learners' Chinese-English translations and 9 topics English-Chinese translations respectively.

TI Measuring the usability of machine translation in the classroom context
SO TRANSLATION AND INTERPRETING STUDIES
AB Usability is a key factor for increasing adoption of machine translation. This study aims to measure the usability of machine translation in the classroom context by comparing translation students' machine translation post-editing output with their manual translation in two comparable translation tasks. Three dimensions of usability were empirically measured: efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction. The findings suggest that machine translation post-editing is more efficient than human translation and post-editing produces fewer errors than human translation. While the types of errors vary, errors in terms of accuracy outnumber those related to fluency. In addition, participants perceive the amount of time and work that is saved when post-editing to be greater benefit than the overall utility of post-editing. Likewise, students report a strong desire to learn post-editing skills in training programs.

AB New confidence measures for machine translation using lexical translation models are presented. Confidence estimation for machine translation is a method for labeling each word as "correct" or "incorrect" in the output of a machine translation system. Compared to the existing measures, the measures proposed in this paper, offer the advantage of not relying on the system output, such as N- best lists or word graphs. As a result, these confidence measures are applicable to all types of machine translation systems. Experiments have been carried out on the translation of news lines in English- Farsi language pair. The result indicates the superior performance of the new confidence measures to similar existing ones. Finally, a method of tagging unlabeled training samples is introduced. This method - which has given promising results in the evaluation of machine translation, but not yet used in confidence estimation - is called translation error rate.

AB Machine translation is an active area of research that has received a significant amount of attention over the past decade. With the advent of deep learning models, the translation of several languages has been performed with high accuracy and precision. In spite of the development in machine translation techniques, there is very limited work focused on translating low-resource African languages, particularly Nigerian languages. Nigeria is one of the most populous countries in Africa with diverse language and ethnic groups. In this paper, we survey the current state of the art of machine translation research on Nigerian languages with a major emphasis on neural machine translation techniques. We outline the limitations of research in machine translation on Nigerian languages and propose future directions in increasing research and participation.

TI An English Translation Quality Evaluation Model Integrating Knowledge
   Transfer and Wireless Network
SO MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Machine translation is to automatically translate one natural language text into another. It is one of the important applications of natural language processing. The research of machine translation is closely related to machine translation evaluation technology. Therefore, with the progress of machine translation technology in recent years, researchers are also committed to designing more reasonable evaluation methods. Manual evaluation is costly, time-consuming, and subjective, so it has been difficult to provide practical help for the development of machine translation systems. Finding a feasible automatic machine translation evaluation method has been a hot spot in machine translation evaluation research in recent years. Based on this, this paper proposes an English translation quality evaluation model integrating knowledge transfer and wireless network. Firstly, wireless network technology is used to coordinate multitasks, and then knowledge transfer optimization technology is used to construct an English translation quality evaluation model. In this paper, simulation experiments are designed to verify the effectiveness of the model. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the evaluation method based on fusion technology is significantly improved compared with the existing evaluation methods.

TI Machine Translation of Scheduling Joint Optimization Algorithm in
   Japanese Passive Statistics
SO SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
AB Machine translation is different from written translation. How to improve the performance of machine translation has been a research hotspot in current research on machine translation. In this paper, based on the semantic analysis and research of Japanese passive, a joint optimization algorithm of scheduling has been proposed, and the machine translation of Japanese passive has been studied. At present, machine translation is more and more widely used. Machine translation has solved many vocabulary problems, and it can complete a large amount of translation work and save a lot of manual translation time. While improving the translation speed, in the process of Japanese passive translation, it is also found that direct machine translation shows many shortcomings, and the quality of passive translation is not particularly ideal, exposing the basic problems of machine translation, such as semantic errors, syntactic errors, unclear and rigid expressions, and messy structures. In response to the problems above, this paper has improved the machine translation model for scheduling joint optimization algorithms. The paper has proposed several optimization algorithms and used resource awareness and computing power scheduling algorithms to conduct experimental analysis of translation performance. Finally, it is found that, among the two scheduling optimization algorithms, the resource-aware scheduling algorithm has better performance. With the same data, the resource-aware scheduling algorithm has saved 15.5% of the time compared with the computing power scheduling algorithm, and the accuracy of Japanese passive translation was 6%, 5%, and 21% higher than the computing power scheduling algorithm under different data volumes. Not only has the time taken been shortened, but the translation accuracy has also been improved.

AB One of the most difficult problems machine translations must deal with is translating irregular expressions in the natural conversation, such as ungrammatical, or ill-formed sentences. However most existing machine translation systems reject utterances including irregular expressions. In order to improve the quality of translation and to make the machine translation systems easier to tune to the needs of different users, we propose a new Multi-Engine based Machine Translation approach. In the approach, several different types of translation engine as following are used in original language analysis and target language generation processing simultaneously. (1) Role based Translation Engine, (11) Example Based Translation Engine, (III) Family Modal based Translation Engine, and (IV) Super Function based Translation Engine. It is very difficult to select the best result when more than one translation engines are successful and the results are difference in traditional multi-engines method. To address the multi-selection problem, we propose a WMV (weighted maximum value) algorithm. The weight of each engine is decided by our experience and statistical information. A prototype system based on the proposed method is built and some experiments are carried out. Experimental results show that the proposed method in this paper is effective for the implement of robust machine translation and the development of practical machine translation system.

SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
AB The importance of translation services has become increasingly prominent with the acceleration of economic globalization. Compared with human translation, machine translation is cheaper and faster, and therefore more suitable for the current era. The current mainstream machine translation method is neural machine translation, which employs machine methods to train on parallel corpora and create translation models. Research into neural machine translation has yielded a wealth of information. Learning and generalization abilities of neural networks have substantially enhanced the effectiveness of neural machine translation. This work applies machine learning and wireless network technology to build an online translation system for real-time translation. First, this work proposes a multigranularity feature fusion method based on a directed acyclic graph, which uses a directed acyclic graph to fuse different granularities as input and obtain a position representation. Secondly, this paper improves the Transformer model and proposes multigranularity position encoding and multigranularity self-attention. Then, on the basis of multigranularity features as input, this work introduces dynamic word vectors to improve the word embedding module, and uses the ELMo model to obtain dynamic word vector embeddings. Finally, this work builds a multigranularity feature-dynamic word vector machine translation model with above strategy, deploys it on server. Users can upload the content to be translated and download the translated content through the wireless network and realize an online translation system based on machine learning and wireless network.

AB It is not easy for western people to learn Chinese. Native German speakers find it difficult to understand how Chinese sentences convey meanings without using cases. Statistical machine translation tools may deliver correct German-Chinese translations, but would not explain educational matters. This article reviews some interdisciplinary research on bilingualism, and expounds on how translation is carried out through cross-linguistic cue switching processes. Machine translation approaches are revisited from the perspective of cue switching concluding that: the word order cue is explicitly simulated in all machine translation approaches, and the case cue being implicitly simulated in statistical machine translation approaches can be explicitly simulated in rule-based and example-based machine translation approaches. A convergent result of machine translation research is to advocate an explicit deep-linguistic representation. Here, a novel machine translation method is motivated by blending existing machine translation methods from the viewpoint of cue-switching, and is firstly aimed as an educational tool. This approach takes a limited amount of German-Chinese translations in textbooks as examples, whose cues can be manually obtained, and for which we have developed MultiNet-like deep linguistic representations and cross-linguistic cue-switching processes. Based on this corpus, our present tool is aimed at helping native German speakers to learn Chinese more efficiently, and shall later be expanded to a more comprehensive machine translation system.

TI Is machine translation post-editing worth the effort? A survey of
   research into post-editing and effort
SO JOURNAL OF SPECIALISED TRANSLATION
AB Advances in the field of machine translation have recently generated new interest in the use of this technology in various scenarios. This development raises questions over the roles of humans and machines as machine translation appears to be moving from the peripheries of the translation field closer to the centre. The situation which influences the work of professional translators most involves post-editing machine translation, i.e. the use of machine translations as raw versions to be edited by translators. Such practice is increasingly commonplace for many language pairs and domains and is likely to form an even larger part of the work of translators in the future. While recent studies indicate that post-editing high-quality machine translations can indeed increase productivity in terms of translation speed, editing poor machine translations can be an unproductive task. The question of effort involved in post-editing therefore remains a central issue. The objective of this article is to present an overview of the use of post-editing of machine translation as an increasingly central practice in the translation field. Based on a literature review, the article presents a view of current knowledge concerning post-editing productivity and effort. Findings related to specific source text features, as well as machine translation errors that appear to be connected with increased post-editing effort, are also discussed.

AB Since twenty-first Century, more and more communication among different countries has made the need for the language translation of the enterprises and individuals more and more. Artificial translation is accurate, but the cost is too high and time-consuming; while the cost of the machine translation is not only low, but the speed is fast. However, the accuracy of machine translation has been criticized by users, therefore, how to build a new generation of machine translation system to improve the accuracy has been imminent. Based on this, a reliable English-Chinese machine translation system based on artificial intelligence is established in this paper, and the principles that should be followed in the process of establishing the system are described in detail, the overall framework, the translation algorithm and the working flow of the system are discussed, and the sentence alignment method based on the translation is proposed. The research results show that the reliable English-Chinese machine translation system based on artificial intelligence designed in this paper can improve the credibility and accuracy of machine translation.

AB This paper presents the systems developed by Beijing Jiaotong University for the CCMT 2020 multilingual translation evaluation task. For this translation task, we need to build a Japanese-English translation system based on only Japanese-Chinese and English-Chinese data. Our method mainly relies on synthetic data generated by back translation. We implemented three different architectures, namely Transformer-big, Transformer-base and Dynamic-Conv. We also implemented multi-model ensemble technique to further boost the final result. Experiments show that our machine translation system achieved high accuracy without relying on any bilingual training data.

AB The recent advances in neural machine translation enable it to be state-of-the-art. However, although there are significant improvements in neural machine translation for a few high-resource languages, its performance is still low for less-resourced languages as the amount of training data significantly affects the quality of the machine translation models. Therefore, identifying a neural machine translation architecture that can train the best models in low-data conditions is essential for less-resourced languages. This research modified the Transformer-based neural machine translation architectures for low-resource polysynthetic languages. Our proposed system outperformed the strong baseline in the automatic evaluation of the experiments on the public benchmark datasets.

AB Traditional machine translation based on RNN has two major defects: (1)it can only process word-by-word and result in slow training speed; (2)when the sentence is too long, gradient disappearance and explosion reduce the accuracy of translation. To solve this problem, this paper designs a Transformer based machine translation implemented by PyTorch. Compared with traditional machine translation, Transformer uses the attention mechanism to redesign the defects of RNN and effectively solves the problems of efficiency and forgetting. The French-English machine translation based on Transformer designed in this paper achieves a translation accuracy rate of 80% from French to English after training and practical application.

AB Machine translation systems are conventionally trained on textual resources that do not model phenomena that occur in spoken language. While the evaluation of neural machine translation systems on textual inputs is actively researched in the literature, little has been discovered about the complexities of translating spoken language data with neural models. We introduce and motivate interesting problems one faces when considering the translation of automatic speech recognition (ASR) outputs on neural machine translation (NMT) systems. We test the robustness of sentence encoding approaches for NMT encoder decoder modeling, focusing on word-based over byte-pair encoding. We compare the translation of utterances containing ASR errors in state-of-the-art NMT encoder-decoder systems against a strong phrase-based machine translation baseline in order to better understand which phenomena present in ASR outputs are better represented under the NMT framework than approaches that represent translation as a linear model.

AB This paper presents a hybrid machine translation (HMT) system that pursues syntactic analysis to acquire phrases of source sentences, translates the phrases using multiple online machine translation (MT) system application program interfaces (APIs) and generates output by combining translated chunks to obtain the best possible translation. The aim of this study is to improve translation quality of English - Latvian texts over each of the individual MT APIs. The selection of the best translation hypothesis is done by calculating the perplexity for each hypothesis using an n-gram language model. The result is a phrase-based multi-system machine translation system that allows to improve MT output compared to individual online MT systems. The proposed approach show improvement up to +1.48 points in BLEU and -0.015 in TER scores compared to the baselines and related research.

AB Recent research on machine translation has achieved substantial progress. However, the machine translation results are still not error-free, and need to be post-edited by a human translator (user) to produce correct translations. Interactive machine translation enhanced the human-computer collaboration through having human validate the longest correct prefix in the suggested translation. In this paper, we refine the interactivity protocol to provide more natural collaboration. Users are allowed to validate bilingual segments, which give more direct guidance to the decoder and more hints to the users. Besides, validating bilingual segments is easier than identifying correct segments from the incorrect translations. Experimental results with real users show that the new protocol improved the translation efficiency and translation quality on three Chinese-English translation tasks.

In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically learn reordering rules as preprocessing step based on a dependency parser in phrase-based statistical machine translation for English to Vietnamese. We used dependency parsing and rules extracting from training the features-rich discriminative classifiers for reordering source-side sentences. We evaluated our approach on English-Vietnamese machine translation tasks, and showed that it outperform the baseline phrase-based SMT system.

We have created a pipeline tool allowing evaluation of machine translation outputs and identification of errors. A statistical analysis based on cumulative link models is performed also in order to have a global overview about errors of statistical machine translation from English to Arabic, and to investigate the relationship between encountered errors and the human perception of machine translation quality. As expected, this analysis demonstrates that the impact of lexical, semantic and reordering errors is more significant than other errors related to the fluency of the machine translation outputs.

AB This paper analyzes the impacts of machine translation and speech synthesis on speech-to-speech translation systems. A typical speech-to-speech translation system consists of three components: speech recognition, machine translation and speech synthesis. Many techniques have been proposed for integration of speech recognition and machine translation. However, corresponding techniques have not yet been considered for speech synthesis. The focus of the current work is machine translation and speech synthesis, and we present a subjective evaluation designed to analyze their impact on speech-to-speech translation. The results of these analyses show that the naturalness and intelligibility of the synthesized speech are strongly affected by the fluency of the translated sentences. In addition, several features were found to correlate well with the average fluency of the translated sentences and the average naturalness of the synthesized speech. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, most of the language pairs, such as Korean-Arabic and Korean-Vietnamese, do not have enough resources to train machine translation systems. In this paper, we propose the use of synthetic methods for extending a low-resource corpus and apply it to a multi-source neural machine translation model. We showed the improvement of machine translation performance through corpus extension using the synthetic method. We specifically focused on how to create source sentences that can make better target sentences, including the use of synthetic methods. We found that the corpus extension could also improve the performance of multi-source neural machine translation. We showed the corpus extension and multi-source model to be efficient methods for a low-resource language pair. Furthermore, when both methods were used together, we found better machine translation performance.

However, rule based machine translation tools have to face significant complication in rule sets building, especially in translation of chemical names between English and Chinese, which are the two most used languages of chemical nomenclature in the world. We applied two types of neural networks in the task of chemical nomenclature translation between English and Chinese, and made a comparison with an existing rule based machine translation tool. The result shows that deep learning based approaches have a great chance to precede rule based translation tools in machine translation of chemical nomenclature between English and Chinese.

SO CLCWEB-COMPARATIVE LITERATURE AND CULTURE
AB In his article "Intermediality and Human vs. Machine Translation" Harry J. Huang analyzes translation as a process of transferring meaning and/or information. The process and the translated text represent a new medium. When machine translation originating from human translation is integrated into the world wide web, it becomes part of global media. Accordingly, machine translation may best be studied within the context of intermediality, especially its quality vs. that of human translation. Based upon data generated from an international survey of 300 translators, writers, editors, and translation scholars, Huang analyses the participants' expectations and their acceptance of imperfection in the translated text. Huang postulates the dividing line between the acceptability and unacceptability of the translated text demystifies the concept of "good" translation versus "bad." Huang also proposes a statistical approach toward translation quality assessment intended for machine translation and human translation.

TI Classification-Based Approach for Hybridizing Statistical and Rule-Based
   Machine Translation
SO ETRI JOURNAL
AB In this paper, we propose a classification-based approach for hybridizing statistical machine translation and rule-based machine translation. Both the training dataset used in the learning of our proposed classifier and our feature extraction method affect the hybridization quality. To create one such training dataset, a previous approach used auto-evaluation metrics to determine from a set of component machine translation (MT) systems which gave the more accurate translation (by a comparative method). Once this had been determined, the most accurate translation was then labelled in such a way so as to indicate the MT system from which it came. In this previous approach, when the metric evaluation scores were low, there existed a high level of uncertainty as to which of the component MT systems was actually producing the better translation. To relax such uncertainty or error in classification, we propose an alternative approach to such labeling; that is, a cut-off method. In our experiments, using the aforementioned cut-off method in our proposed classifier, we managed to achieve a translation accuracy of 81.5% - a 5.0% improvement over existing methods.

AB Speech translation systems commonly couple automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) components. Hereby the automatic segmentation of the ASR output for the subsequent MT is critical for the overall performance. In simultaneous translation systems, which require a continuous output with a low latency, chunking of the ASR output into translatable segments is even more critical. This paper addresses the question how utterance chunking influences machine translation performance in an empirical study. In addition, the machine translation performance is also set in relation to the segment length produced by the chunking strategy, which is important for simultaneous translation. Therefore, we compare different chunking/ segmentation strategies on speech recognition hypotheses as well as on reference transcripts.

AB Nowadays machine translation is widely used, but the required data for training, tuning and testing a machine translation engine is often not sufficient or not useful. The automatic selection of data that are qualitatively appropriate for building translation models can help improve translation accuracy. In this paper, we used a large parallel corpus of educational video lecture subtitles as well as text posted by students and lecturers on the course fora. The text is quite challenging to translate due to the scientific domains involved and its informal genre. We applied a random forest classification schema on the output of three machine translation models (one based on statistical machine translation and two on neural machine translation) in order to automatically identify the best output. The unorthodox language phenomena observed as well as the rich-in-terminology scientific domains addressed in the educational video lectures, the language-independent nature of the approach, and the tackled three-class classification problem constitute innovative challenges of the work described herein.

AB We present an evaluation of the benefits of domain adaptation for machine translation, on three separate domains and language pairs, with varying degrees of domain specificity and amounts of available training data. Domain-adapted statistical and neural machine translation systems are compared to each other and to generic online systems, thus providing an evaluation of the main options in terms of machine translation. Alongside automated translation metrics, we present experimental results involving professional translators, in terms of quality assessment, subjective evaluations of the task and post-editing productivity measurements. The results we present quantify the clear advantages of domain adaptation for machine translation, with marked impacts for domains with higher specificity. Additionally, the results of the experiments show domain-adapted neural machine translation systems to be the optimal choice overall.

AB The demand of automatic translation is truly emergent, especially in some narrow areas such as health, education, law, etc. However, the quality of machine translation (MT) in general and Vietnamese-related in particular is still very low compared to the need of the practice. There are many factors affecting the quality of machine translation systems, in which the two most important ones are the machine translation model and training corpus. Currently, statistical translation method has been applying for several Vietnamese translation systems, however their results have not been improved significantly. In this paper, we propose a solution of applying new machine translation model using neural network approach in combination with a large and good corpus. Based on the proposed solution, we have implemented and deployed a dedicated English-Vietnamese machine translation system for the legal documents. We have experimented our MT system by using a good corpus of legal domain with 460,000 pairs of Vietnamese-English sentences. Our MT system has produced results in the narrow field of legal documents much better than the two common English-Vietnamese translators using different translation models. Especially, it can translate quite correctly both specialized terms as well as long sentences in this field whereas others can't.

AB In order to solve the problem that traditional machine translation cannot meet users' needs due to its slow translation speed, an in-depth study on English translation model based on neural network was proposed. Firstly, three methods of model frame design, translation system design, and training frame design are studied. In order to improve the effectiveness and stability of the English translation model of recursive neural network, a model of English-Chinese machine translation system is designed. The system uses a knowledge-based context vector to map English and Chinese words, and uses a codec recursive neural network to achieve the results. After experiments and researches, the neural network can also efficiently deal with the long-distance reordering problem of multilanguage machine translation, which is difficult for statistical machine translation to deal with effectively. The neural network has opened a broad field of vision for machine translation research.

TI Visualization-based improvement of neural machine translation
SO COMPUTERS & GRAPHICS-UK
AB We introduce a novel visual-interactive approach for analyzing, understanding, and correcting neural machine translation. Our system supports users in automatically translating documents using neural machine translation and identifying and correcting possible erroneous translations. User corrections can then be used to fine-tune the neural machine translation model and automatically improve the whole document. While translation results of neural machine translation can be impressive, there are still many challenges such as over- and under-translation, domain-specific terminology, and handling long sentences, making it necessary for users to verify translation results. Our system aims at supporting users in this task. Our visual analytics approach combines several visualization techniques in an interactive system. A parallel coordinates plot with multiple metrics related to translation quality can be used to find, filter, and select translations that might contain errors. An interactive beam search visualization and graph- or matrix-based visualizations for attention weights can be used for post-editing and understanding machine-generated translations. The machine translation model is updated from user corrections to improve the translation quality of the whole document. We designed our approach for an LSTM-based translation model and extended it to also include the Transformer architecture. We show for representative examples possible mistranslations and how to use our system to deal with them. A user study revealed that many participants favor such a system over manual text-based translation, especially for translating large documents. Furthermore, we performed quantitative computer-based experiments that show that our system can be used to improve translation quality and reduce post-editing efforts for domain-specific documents.

   coherence
SO ACROSS LANGUAGES AND CULTURES
AB Earlier studies have corroborated that human translation exhibits unique linguistic features, usually referred to as translationese. However, research on machine translationese, in spite of some sparse efforts, is still in its infancy. By comparing machine translation with human translation and original target language texts, this study aims to investigate if machine translation has unique linguistic features of its own too, to what extent machine translations are different from human translations and target-language originals, and what characteristics are typical of machine translations. To this end, we collected a corpus containing English translations of modern Chinese literary texts produced by neural machine translation systems and human professional translators and comparable original texts in the target language. Based on the corpus, a quantitative study of discourse coherence was conducted by observing metrics in three dimensions bor-rowed from Coh-Metrix, including connectives, latent semantic analysis and the situation/mental model. The results support the existence of translationese in both human and machine translations when they are compared with original texts. However, machine translationese is not the same as human translationese in some metrics of discourse coherence. Additionally, machine translation systems, such as Google and DeepL, when compared with each other, show unique features in some coherence metrics, although on the whole they are not significantly different from each other in those coherence metrics.

TI English-Thai translation: Initial experiments with a multiphase
   translation system
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
AB A multiphase machine translation approach, Generate and Repair Machine Translation (GRMT), is proposed. GRMT is designed to generate accurate translations that focus primarily on retaining the linguistic meaning of the source language sentence. GRMT presently incorporates a limited multilingual translation capability. The central idea behind the GRMT approach is to generate a translation candidate (TC) by quick and dirty machine translation (QDMT), then investigate the accuracy of that TC by translation candidate evaluation (TCE), and, if necessary, revise the translation in the repair and iterate (RI) phase. To demonstrate the GRMT approach, a translation system that translates from English to Thai has been developed. This paper presents the design characteristics and some experimental results of QDMT and also the initial design, some experiments, and proposed ideas behind TCE and RI.

AB Dynamic binary translation is the process of translating and optimizing executable code for one machine to another at runtime, while the program is "executing" on the target machine.
   Dynamic translation techniques have normally been limited to two particular machines; a competitor's machine and the hardware manufacturer's machine. This research provides for a more general framework for dynamic translations, by providing a framework based on specifications of machines that can be reused or adapted to new hardware architectures. In this way, developers of such techniques can isolate design issues from machine descriptions and reuse many components and analyses.
   We describe our dynamic translation framework and provide some initial results obtained by using this system.

SO TARGET-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB There is still much to learn about the ways in which human and machine translation differ with regard to the contexts that regulate the production and interpretation of discourse. The present study explores whether a corpus-driven lexical analysis of human and machine translation can unveil discourse features that set the two apart. A balanced corpus of source texts aligned with authentic, professional translations and neural machine translations was compiled for the study. Lexical discrepancies in the two translation corpora were then extracted via a corpus-driven keyword analysis, and examined qualitatively through parallel concordances of source texts aligned with human and machine translation. The study shows that keyword analysis not only reiterates known problems of discourse in machine translation such as lexical inconsistency and pronoun resolution, but can also provide valuable insights regarding contextual aspects of translated discourse deserving further research.

TI Low resource machine translation of english-manipuri: A semi-supervised
   approach
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB The language barrier is one of the practical challenges human being face during communication. To overcome this, researchers are focusing on using machines to translate a source language to a target language using the textual representations of the languages. Thus, machine translation (MT) could achieve a near humanlevel performance in terms of translation quality for several resource-rich languages. However, machine translation performance is still far from a production-level quality for the low resource languages. This work reports a semi-supervised neural machine translation system to boost the translation quality for an extremely resource constraint language pair, i.e. English-Manipuri. Our proposed approach exploits self-training and back-translation in a combined technique. The quantitative evaluation shows that the system performance improves by +0.9 BLEU score after introducing external noise to the input data. Additionally, a multi-reference test dataset developed in-house is used to evaluate the linguistic diversity of the highly agglutinative and morphologically rich Manipuri language. Experimental result attests that the proposed semi-supervised system outperforms the supervised, the pretrained mBART and existing semi-supervised baselines in terms of automatic score and subjective evaluation parameters by a significant margin up to +4.5 and +1.2 BLEU improvements against the supervised and mBART baselines respectively.

AB The quality of literary translation was from the beginning of literacy an important factor in publishing and, as a consequence, in research and education. The quality of literary text translation is of utmost significance for researchers and students, especially in higher education. Only complete and high-standard translations are believed to be necessary for the use in the evaluation and study of style and concepts of a given author or a literary genre. This quality verification applies even more to machine translation in general, due to the fact that such translations are deemed subpar and unsuitable for further dissemination and examination. The need for human quality evaluation of machine-translated text is therefore highly emphasised, since human translations are considered to be the "gold standard" and reference translations in the machine translation process. The aim of this paper is to explore, on the example of a data set consisting of poems written by a relevant contemporary Croatian poet, the effectiveness of applying machine translation on the Croatian-German language pair in the domain of poetry, with regard to human judgment of machine translation quality. Human evaluation in this paper is conducted by taking into account two machine translation quality criteria - adequacy and fluency, after which an inter-rater agreement analysis is performed.

The corpus is collected from the religious domain and to check the usability of the collected parallel corpora a bi-directional Neural Machine Translation experiments were conducted. The neural machine translation shows good results as a baseline experiment of BLEU score of 13.8 in Wolaita-English and 8.2 English-Wolaita machine translation. The Wolaita-English translation shows a better result than the other pairs of Ethiopian languages and the result of neural machine translation performs well when the amount of dataset increases, thus the amount of dataset has a great impact on the performance. Besides these, the morphological richness of Ethiopian language contributed to the low performance of neural machine translation when the Ethiopian language is used as the target language. Further, we are working on minimizing the effect of morphological richness through different morphological processing techniques in the translation of Ethiopian languages.

TI Improving Statistical Machine Translation Quality Using Differential

SO INFORMATICA
AB Machine Translation has become an important tool in overcoming the language barrier. The quality of translations depends on the languages and used methods. The research presented in this paper is based on well-known standard methods for Statistical Machine Translation that are advanced by a newly proposed approach for optimizing the weights of translation system components. Better weights of system components improve the translation quality. In most cases, machine translation systems translate to/from English and, in our research, English is paired with a Slavic language, Slovenian. In our experiment, we built two Statistical Machine Translation systems for the Slovenian-English language pair of the Acquis Communautaire corpus. Both systems were optimized using self-adaptive Differential Evolution and compared to the other related optimization methods. The results show improvement in the translation quality, and are comparable to the other related methods.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN LEARNING
AB With the rapid development of machine translation, the research of man-machine coordinated translation is drawing much concern. This paper explores roles of machine translation on advance preparation for simultaneous interpreting. We carry out a comparative study on 14 student interpreters, which are divided into experimental group and control group. The students in experimental group are allowed to use machine translation to prepare for a simultaneous interpreting, while the students in control group are not. The experimental results show that errors in machine translation might mislead the students in the simultaneous interpreting practice. On the other hand, if the time of preparation is limited, it is better not to resort to machine to make preparation because of time-consuming proofreading, or twice the effort would achieve half the result.

TI Consequences of neuronal machine translation on target languages
SO TRADUMATICA-TRADUCCIO I TECNOLOGIES DE LA INFORMACIO I LA COMUNICACIO
AB This article deals with the consequences of using a neural machine translation trained from corpora compiled from translations of specific text genres produced in particular professional contexts. Phenomena such as translationese and post-editese, associated with the use of machine translation, underline the need to orient research towards new approaches to the question of professional translation quality. Working from the viewpoint that languages should be safeguarded as intangible cultural heritage, it poses a range of questions related to the impact of machine translation on target cultures and languages: how it is perceived, quality and how its use can alter the standard language. It points out the need to define translation quality thresholds that go beyond the aspects most commonly related to error detection, which is the most economically viable type of correction.

AB Machine translation services available on the Web are getting increasingly popular. Multiple translation services are often combined for intercultural communication. Furthermore, since English is most frequently used as a hub language, it is often necessary to cascade different translation services to realize translations between non-English languages. As a result, the word sense is often changed because of the inconsistency, asymmetry, and intransitivity of word selections between machine translation services. Therefore, we propose a context-based coordination framework in which the context is propagated among cascaded translation services by referring to multilingual equivalent terms. By considering machine translation services as black boxes, we achieve substantial quality improvements through Web service coordination.

AB In this modern era, it is a necessity that people communicate with other parts of world without any language barriers. Machine translation system can be very useful tool in this context. The main purpose of a machine translation system is to convert text of one natural language to a different natural language without losing its meaning. The translation of text can be done in several ways mainly, rule based and corpus based-each of which uses various approaches to obtain correct translation. In this paper, we focus on the various machine translation approaches with a core focus on English to Malayalam translation using Rule Based approach.

AB Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) is a part of Natural Language Processing. This translates one language to another language. SMT consists of Language Model (LM), Translation Model (TM) and decoder. The decoder will make use of LM and TM to generate the translation. In this, probability of target language sentences is computed by LM, the given source sentence probability of the target sentence is computed by TM and maximizing the probability of translated text is done by Moses. English and Telugu parallel corpus have been used for training the system. Translation mainly depends on quality and quantity of corpus. In this, a model was proposed for translation of Telugu language to English language.

   translation
SO SADHANA-ACADEMY PROCEEDINGS IN ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB Computational linguistics deals with the computational modelling of natural languages, in which machine translation is a popular task. The aim of machine translation is to automatically translate one natural language into another, which minimizes the linguistic barrier of different linguistic backgrounds. The data-driven approach of machine translation, namely, neural machine translation achieves state-of-the-art results on different language pairs, however it needs a sufficient amount of parallel training data to attain reasonable translation performance. In this work, we have explored different machine translation models on a low-resource English-Assamese language pair and investigated different sources of errors, particularly due to negation in English-to-Assamese and Assamese-to-English translation. Negation is a universal, essential feature of human language that has a substantial impact on the semantics of a statement. Moreover, a rule-based approach is proposed in the data preprocessing step which handles modal-verb negation problem that shows significant improvement in translation performance in terms of automatic and manual evaluation scores.

This paper focuses on the research-oriented, as opposed to the practically-oriented, translation program. We argue that computer studies in such a program should prepare students for research at either the receiving or production ends of machine translation systems, both of which require linguistic, computational and translational expertise. We discuss some general considerations for the design of such computer studies, based on a seminar given in the M.A. Translation program at the University of Ottawa, Canada.

TI Variational multimodal machine translation with underlying semantic
SO INFORMATION FUSION
AB Capturing the underlying semantic relationships of sentences is helpful for machine translation. Variational neural machine translation approaches provide an effective way to model the uncertain underlying semantics in languages by introducing latent variables. Multitask learning is applied in multimodal machine translation to integrate multimodal data. However, these approaches usually lack a strong interpretation in utilizing out of-text information in machine translation tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture-free multimodal translation model, called variational multimodal machine translation (VMMT), under the variational framework which can model the uncertainty in languages caused by ambiguity through utilizing visual and textual information. In addition, the proposed model can eliminate the discrepancy between training and prediction in the existing variational translation models by constructing encoders only relying on source data. More importantly, the proposed multimodal translation model is designed as multitask learning in which the shared semantic representation for different modes is learned and the gap among semantic representation from various modes is reduced by incorporating additional constraints. Moreover, the information bottleneck theory is adopted in our variational encoder?decoder model, which helps the encoder to filter redundancy and the decoder to concentrate on useful information. Experiments on multimodal machine translation demonstrate that the proposed model is competitive.

However, existing methods are not good enough for domain adaptation translation. Consequently, we may understand the cutting-edge techniques in a field better and faster with the aid of our machine translation. This paper proposes a method of calculating the balance factor based on model fusion algorithm and logarithmic linear interpolation. A neural machine translation technique is used to train a domain adaptation translation model. In our experiments, the BLEU score of the in-domain corpus reaches 43.55, which shows a certain increase when comparing to existing methods.

AB English for Science and Technology (EST), as a special language style, is widely used in the field of Science and Technology. For this kind of articles, the requirements of translation quality are relatively high. Therefore, this paper studies a quality evaluation method of Sci-Tech English translation for cross-cultural communication. As statistical machine translation has almost reached the limits of its capacity, neural machine translation is becoming the technology of the future. This paper also describes the evaluation of machine translation quality with and automatic evaluation process with machine learning technology. The evaluation index of EST translation quality is selected according to the selection principle and expert consultation method. Then, the weight of the index is calculated by using the analytic hierarchy process. Finally, the translation quality evaluation is given by using the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, glass-box and black-box evaluation with machine learning method. The results show that under the application of the research method, the evaluation results are completely corresponding to the actual competition results of four competitors, which proves the effectiveness of the research method.

AB In this paper, we present our hybrid methodology for building a bidirectional Amazigh-English machine translation. The architecture of the proposed system is based on both Interlingua-Based Machine Translation (IBMT) and Statistical-Based Machine Translation (SBMT) approaches. Amazigh is a less-resourced language. It does not have parallel corpora with enough size. So, using statistical approach for such language will not be a good choice, because this approach requires large parallel corpora to well train probabilistic models, and to ensure a translation of good quality. Since we dispose of an Amazigh IBMT based deconverter, we thought, firstly, to use it in building an Amazigh-English parallel corpus. This latter have been exploited to train the necessary models in SBMT.

In this paper, we present an approach to learn reordering rules as pre-processing step based on a dependency parser in phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) from Vietnamese to English. Dependency parser and transformation rules are used to reorder the source sentence and applied for systems translating Vietnamese to English. We evaluated our approach on Vietnamese-English machine translation tasks, and showed that it outperform the baseline phrase-based SMT system.

One-hundred and fourteen community members participated in a recipient evaluation survey, in which they evaluated four different versions of a translated portion of the library's website - a professional human translation, a maximally post-edited machine translation, a rapidly post-edited machine translation, and a raw machine translation. Participants also considered metadata such as the time and cost required to produce each version. Findings show that while machine translation cannot address every need, there are some instances for which the faster and cheaper post-edited versions are considered useful and acceptable to the community.

AB Contemporary machine translation systems usually rely on offline data retrieved from the web for individual model training, such as translation models and language models. In contrast to existing methods, we propose a novel approach that treats machine translation as a web search task and utilizes the web on the fly to acquire translation knowledge. This end-to-end approach takes advantage of fresh web search results that are capable of leveraging tremendous web knowledge to obtain phrase-level candidates on demand and then compose sentence-level translations. Experimental results show that our web-based machine translation method demonstrates very promising performance in leveraging fresh translation knowledge and making translation decisions. Furthermore, when combined with offline models, it significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical machine translation system.

SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB With the steady growth of the global economy, the communication between countries in the world has become increasingly close. Due to its translation efficiency and other problems, the traditional manual translation has gradually failed to meet the current people's translation requirements. With the rapid development of machine-learning and deep-learning related technologies, artificial intelligence-related technologies have affected various industries, including the field of machine translation. Compared with traditional methods, neural network-based machine translation has high efficiency, so this field has attracted many scholars' intensive research. How to improve the accuracy of neural machine translation through deep learning technology is the core problem that researchers study. In this paper, the neural machine translation model based on generative adversarial network is studied to make the translation result of neural network more accurate and three-dimensional. The model uses adversarial thinking to consider the sequence of emotion direction so that the translation results are more humanized. We set up several experiments to verify the efficiency of the model, and the experimental results prove that the proposed model is suitable for Chinese-English machine translation.

AB India is a multilingual country; different states have different territorial languages but not all Indians are polyglots. There are 18 constitutional languages and ten prominent scripts. The majority of the Indians, especially the remote villagers, do not understand, read or write English, therefore implementing an efficient language translator is needed. Machine translation systems, that translate text form one language to another, will enhance the knowledgeable society of Indians without any language barrier. English, being a universal language and Hindi, the language used by the majority of Indians, we propose an English to Hindi machine translation system design based on declension rules. This paper also describes the different approaches of Machine Translation.

The discussion on ethical issues draws on recent studies on translation technology and on the usage of machine(-assisted) translation for literary language. An overview of the consequences of the recent increase in technologization for both non-literary and literary translation is provided and an argument for sustainable development in literary translation is made, based on a holistic understanding of translation quality. The notion of voice is taken as an example of the special challenges related to the translation of literary language, which research on machine(-assisted) translation of literary language has not yet sufficiently taken into account. Lastly, avant-garde aesthetic views and usages of machine translation are presented through the notion of noise.

ConceptNet is a knowledge-based graph that represents relation between words using relations like "RelatedTo" and "TranslatedFrom". Baseline method doesn't appropriately translate the sentences. This work increases the accuracy of translation by using common sense knowledge for translation of those words which are obscured or not translated. We used BLEU score to check the accuracy of our English to Hindi translation system. This approach provides the improved quality of translation.

AB Machine translation (MT) system translates one natural language into another language with the help of computers. MT is a key application in the field of natural language processing. In proposed system, Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) approach has been used for developing Punjabi to Hindi Machine Translation System. In SMT, every sentence in the target language i.e. Hindi is a translation of the source language i.e. Punjabi with some probability and the best translation will be of high probability which the system will attain in the form of sentence. The key activities involved during translation process are pre-processing, translation engine and post processing. Unigram algorithm, N-Gram string matching algorithm etc formed the basis for solving these issues. The accuracy of the system has been evaluated using subjective tests i.e. intelligibility test and accuracy test. A proposed system is found to perform better than the existing system.

TI Artificial Intelligence Machine Translation Based on Fuzzy Algorithm
SO MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB In order to study machine translation more in-depth, it is particularly important for the research of artificial intelligence with fuzzy algorithms to convert an unfamiliar language into a mature language. The neural network translation model has been developed in recent years and has achieved rich research results. Aiming at the current lack of accuracy of neural machine translation (NMT), which may cause ambiguity, this paper takes English machine translation as an example and proposes an artificial intelligence machine translation optimization model based on fuzzy theory. On the basis of NMT model translation, first the semantics of English machine translation is classified, a semantic selection model is built, then the analytic hierarchy process is used to determine the semantic order of English machine translation, and the corresponding fault-tolerant operation is carried out to the error-prone errors, weight the semantics, and introduce the fuzzy theory to arrange the English semantics of English machine translation. Finally, the performance of the model is analyzed through specific application experiments. The results show that the accuracy of the machine translation selection permutation model is improved by nearly 4.5% and can reach more than 90% compared with other models, and the timeliness is better than other models, which is improved by nearly 15%, which has obvious advantages.

AB Despite the fact that study of statistical machine translation has been growing rapidly to date, there has not been much research done about Indonesian-Japanese statistical machine translation. The previous research about Indonesian-Japanese statistical machine translation has shown several problems in translation process, such as low coverage corpus data, unknown words, and sentence reordering problem. In this research, we propose two methods to address these problems. The proposed methods are lemma translation with generated surface form and additional post-process. Lemma translation uses lemma and POSTAG of word in its translation process. Rule based katakana translation and unknown word substitution are also used for additional post-process. Experimental data was collected from JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) Level 3 with total 1132 sentences. Experimental results using these methods showed an improvement over the baseline system with a 116% increased BLEU score on Japanese to Indonesian translation and 26% increased BLEU score on Indonesian to Japanese translation.

The quite recently developed example-based machine translation technique seems to be a serious alternative to the existing automatic translation techniques. In the paper the usage of the example based machine translation technique for the development of a system, which would be able to translate an unrestricted Norwegian text into Polish is proposed. The new approach to the example-based machine translation technique that takes into account the peculiarity of the Polish grammar is developed. The obtained primary results of development of the proposed system seem to be very promising and appear to be a step made in the right direction towards a fully-automatic high quality Norwegian-into-Polish machine translation system aimed for an unrestricted text.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Neural machine translation has been widely adopted in modern machine translation as it brings the state-of-the-art performance to large-scale parallel corpora. For real-world applications, high-quality translation for text in a specific domain is crucial. However, performances of general neural machine models drop when being applied in a specific domain. To alleviate this issue, this paper presents a novel method of machine translation, which explores both model fusion algorithm and logarithmic linear interpolation. The method can improve the performance of in-domain translation model, while preserving or even improving the performance of out-domain translation model. This paper has carried out extensive experiments on proposed translation model using the public United Nations corpus. The bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) score of the in-domain corpus and the out-domain corpus reaches 30.27 and 43.17 respectively, which shows a certain improvement over existing methods.

SO LANGUAGE AND EDUCATION
AB The use of machine translation is increasingly prevalent in language education and social communication. This study explored how multilingual pupils who are learning English as an additional language (EAL) use machine translation within their formal education and everyday lives. A translanguaging framework was employed to understand the ways in which learners use machine translation and how they interpret these practices. Qualitative data was collected from a series of pupil (n = 28) focus groups and teacher (n = 14) interviews across five secondary schools in Northern Ireland. The findings demonstrate that machine translation permeates various learning and communicative aspects of learners' lives across each stage of their multilingual development. In addition, learners view machine translation as a legitimate multimodal tool which they flexibly, critically and pragmatically incorporate within their semiotic repertoires. These findings show how EAL learners are empowered by their own, and their teachers', use of machine translation and offer insights which inform the continued development of translanguaging pedagogies.

However, with the ever-growing improvements of technologies in the field of machine translation, the possibilities of adopting machine-translated literary texts are in constant progress. Nevertheless, human evaluation of machine-translated text is a necessity. The aim of this paper is to examine what makes machine translations appear bad in terms of error types that occur within such translations. Therefore, a human error classification analysis on a machine-translated text corpus in the domain of poetry is conducted. This study could be used for improving the methodology for machine translation evaluation of literary texts.

AB Speech synthesizers are optimized for fluent natural text. However, in a speech to speech translation system, they have to process machine translation output, which is often not fluent. Rendering machine translations as speech makes them even harder to understand than the synthesis of natural text. A speech synthesizer must deal with the disfluencies in translations in order to be comprehensible and communicate the content. In this paper, we explore three synthesis strategies that address different problems found in translation output. By carrying out listening tasks and measuring transcription accuracies, we find that these methods can make the synthesis of translations more intelligible.

AB Rule based machine translation systems face different challenges in building the translation model in a form of transfer rules. Some of these problems require enormous human effort to state rules and their consistency. This is where different human linguists make different rules for the same sentence. A human linguist states rules to be understood by human rather than machines.
   The proposed translation model (from Arabic to English) tackles the mentioned problem of building translation model. This model employs Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to learn the language model from a set of example pairs acquired from parallel corpora and represent the language model in a rule-based format that maps Arabic sentence pattern to English sentence pattern.
   By testing the model on a small set of data, it generated translation rules with logarithmic growing rate and with word error rate 11%

AB Myanmar language is one of the low resource languages. There are a few resources that include bilingual sentences. Therefore, there are some difficulties to collect or crawl the parallel sentences. Existing Myanmar Translation systems use rule-based as well as statistical-based approach with the small amount of parallel corpus. Therefore, the performance of Myanmar to English Machine Translation system is still low. In this paper, large scale parallel corpus is prepared and introduces the Myanmar to English Neural Machine Translation system. Nowadays, neural machine translation models became a popular research field and it reaches good results in some languages. In this work, we did the experiment on the word-level model and character-level model based on neural method for Myanmar to English translation. The evaluation results show that neural machine translation models lead to improve the performance of Myanmar to English translation.

SO INTERPRETER AND TRANSLATOR TRAINER
AB Graduates of translation programmes increasingly encounter machine translation in the language industry. In response to this identified market need, translation education programmes have begun to incorporate machine translation into the curriculum. In order for translation graduates to serve as professional post-editors in the language industry, this content must be embedded in multiple courses across the curriculum, rather than concentrating the material in a stand-alone course or module. This article argues for the incorporation of terminology management, controlled authoring, post-editing, and engine tuning into translation practice courses to prepare students for the evolving market.

Many ideas that were previously difficult to implement can turn from theory to reality. On the one hand, it can be seen that machine translation relies on traditional theory of natural language, and on the other hand, thanks to the development of natural language processing technology. Under this opportunity, machine translation has developed in an all-round way and has been a world-wide prosperity. This paper attempts to sort out the development process of machine translation and analyze the technology at each stage. Based on these, the article puts forward the prospect of natural language processing and machine translation at the end.

SO HUMAN BEHAVIOR AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES
AB With the improvement in machine translation output quality, postediting of machine translation has made far-reaching impact upon the language service industry. As a result, it has been introduced to translation training to avoid split between academic discipline and profession. However, postediting of machine translation and its application to undergraduate translation program in China are less studied, and few researches have touched on the students' own perceptions. Based on a literature review on postediting of machine translation, this study is aimed at identifying the vital role of it and then proposing a practical postediting workflow for undergraduate translation education in China. The study adopted a mixed methods approach. Data were collected via online questionnaire responded by students of undergraduate translation program at a university in northwest China and then analyzed from the perspective of technology acceptance model. The results and findings showed that as a promising workflow, postediting of machine translation gained positive responses in general from students who have learnt the basics of translation technology. The themes of negative responses include confusing postediting standard, inconsistent quality, ways to choose machine translation providers, and technical issues. The results and findings indicated that a tailored postediting workflow for undergraduate translation program is feasible. By focusing on undergraduate pedagogical settings in China, this study confirmed the findings of previous studies on the more positive attitude on postediting of machine translation, suggesting that postediting be considered as an important subcompetence in translation education.

AB Machine translation quality estimation (Quality Estimation, QE) aims to evaluate the quality of machine translation automatically without golden reference. QE is an important component in making machine translation useful in real-world applications. Existing approaches require large amounts of expert annotated data. Recently, there are some trials to perform QE in an unsupervised manner, but these methods are based on glass-box features which demands probation inside the machine translation system. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm to perform unsupervised QE in black-box setting, without relying on human-annotated data or model-related features. We create pseudo-data based on Machine Translation Evaluation (MTE) metrics from existing machine translation parallel dataset, and the data are used to fine-tune multilingual pre-trained language models to fit human evaluation. Experiment results show that our model surpasses the previous unsupervised methods by a large margin, and achieve state-of-the-art results on MLQE Dataset.

We investigate the ability of our system to assist such users in decoding and correcting faulty, machine translations. We found that by collaborating with our application, end-users can overcome many difficult translation errors and disambiguate translated passages that were otherwise baffling.

Then, we studied the morpheme-based Mongolian-Chinese end-to-end neural machine translation under the framework of bidirectional encoder and attention-based decoder. The experimental results show that the segmentation of Mongolian word effectively solves the data sparsity of Mongolian, and the morpheme-based Mongolian-Chinese neural machine translation model can improve the quality of machine translation.

UnsupNMT proposes a radically different approach to machine translation: unsupervised translation, that is, translation based on monolingual data alone with no need for bilingual resources. This method is based on deep learning of temporal sequences and uses cutting-edge interlingual word representations in the form of cross-lingual word embeddings. This project is not only a highly innovative proposal but it also opens a new paradigm in machine translation which branches out to other disciplines, such us transfer learning. Despite the current limitations of unsupervised machine translation, the techniques developed are expected to have great repercussions in areas where machine translation achieves worse results, such as translation between languages which have little contact, e.g. German and Russian.

In this paper, we propose a novel method, namely bag-of-words decoding, to evaluate n-gram language models in phrase-based statistical machine translation. As compared with perplexity, our approach has more remarkable correlation with translation quality measured by BLEU. Experimental results on NIST data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

TI Machine translation and its evaluation: a study
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW
AB Machine translation (namely MT) has been one of the most popular fields in computational linguistics and Artificial Intelligence (AI). As one of the most promising approaches, MT can potentially break the language barrier of people from all over the world. Despite a number of studies in MT, there are few studies in summarizing and comparing MT methods. To this end, in this paper, we principally focus on presenting the two mainstream MT schemes: statistical machine translation (SMT) and neural machine translation (NMT), including their basic rationales and developments. Meanwhile, the detailed translation models are also presented, such as the word-based model, syntax-based model, and phrase-based model in statistical machine translation. Similarly, approaches in NMT, such as the recurrent neural network-based, attention mechanism-based, and transformer-based models are presented. Last but not least, the evaluation approaches also play an important role in helping developers to improve their methods better in MT. The prevailing machine translation evaluation methodologies are also presented in this article.

TI Model and Verification of Medical English Machine Translation Based on
   Optimized Generalized Likelihood Ratio Algorithm
SO JOURNAL OF SENSORS
AB Phrase identification plays an important role in medical English machine translation. However, the phrases in medical English are complicated in internal structure and semantic relationship, which hinders the identification of machine translation and thus affects the accuracy of translation results. With the aim of breaking through the bottleneck of machine translation in medical field, this paper designed a machine translation model based on the optimized generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) algorithm. Specifically, the model in question established a medical phrase corpus of 250,000 English and 280,000 Chinese words, applied the symbol mapping function to the identification of the phrase's part of speech, and employed the syntactic function of the multioutput analysis table structure to correct the structural ambiguity in the identification of the part of speech, eventually obtaining the final identification result. According to the comprehensive verification, the translation model employing the optimized GLR algorithm was seen to improve the speed, accuracy, and update performance of machine translation and was seen to be more suitable for machine translation in medical field, therefore providing a new perspective for the employment of medical machine translation.

AB Journalistic translation is governed by a target-oriented norm that allows varying degrees of intervention by journalists. Given the public's expectations for the fidelity of translated news, this norm entails ethical issues. This paper examines the ethical dimensions of journalistic translation through a case study of political news translation in the South Korean context. It investigates how newspapers translated a US president's references to two South Korean presidents in accordance with the newspapers' ideologies and then came to apply the translations as negative labels as the political situation evolved over time. The study demonstrates how even word-level translation can require an intricate understanding of the sociopolitical context and cumulative meanings of a word. It then draws its implications for machine translation by comparing the human translations with machine translations of the references in question. It concludes by discussing why machine translation cannot yet replace human translation, at least between Korean and English, and what translation studies should do regarding the ethics of journalistic translation.

Recently, some studies have found that well-processing method can improve quality of machine translation such as a model for word-to-phrase translation. However, there are still cases that the word - to - phrase model cannot pick a correct phrase to build target sentence. This study establishes a model, based on word - to - phrase translation model, which enhances quality of machine translation using Vietnamese Lexical Functional Grammar (VLFG) rule set for Vietnamese noun phrase in reconstruction algorithm.

AB Machine translation performs automatic translation from one natural language to another. Neural machine translation attains a state-of-the-art approach in machine translation, but it requires adequate training data, which is a severe problem for low-resource language pairs translation. The concept of multimodal is introduced in neural machine translation (NMT) by merging textual features with visual features to improve low-resource pair translation. WAT2021 (Workshop on Asian Translation 2021) organizes a shared task of multimodal translation for English to Hindi. We have participated the same with team name CNLP-NITS-PP in two submissions: multimodal and text-only translation. This work investigates phrase pairs injection via data augmentation approach and attains improvement over our previous work at WAT2020 on the same task in both text-only and multimodal translation. We have achieved second rank on the challenge test set for English to Hindi multimodal translation where Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score of 39.28, Rank-based Intuitive Bilingual Evaluation Score (RIBES) 0.792097, and Adequacy-Fluency Metrics (AMFM) score 0.830230 respectively.

AB The approach based on translation pieces is appealing for neural machine translation with a translation memory (TM), owing to its efficiency in both computation and memory consumption. Unfortunately, it is incapable of capturing sufficient contextual translation leading to a limited translation performance. This paper thereby proposes a simple yet effective approach to address this issue. Its key idea is to employ the word position information from a TM as additional rewards to guide the decoding of neural machine translation (NMT). Experiments on seven tasks show that the proposed approach yields consistent gains particularly for those source sentences whose TM is very similar to themselves, while maintaining similar efficiency to the counterpart of translation pieces.

AB In order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of Chinese English translation accuracy detection, this paper proposes a new Chinese English translation accuracy detection method based on machine learning. In order to test the accuracy of Chinese English translation, a bilingual statistical dictionary is constructed firstly, and the language words are counted according to the dictionary. According to the calculation results of translation length probability, the Chinese English semantic ontology mapping model is constructed to improve the detection accuracy of translation accuracy. In order to accurately detect the accuracy of Chinese English translation, machine learning method is used to detect the semantic similarity of Chinese English translation. Machine learning can detect the similarity of Chinese and English translation texts by constructing knowledge map. According to the calculation results of Chinese and English Translation Association similarity, using machine learning method combined with similarity function to detect semantic similarity, the accuracy of Chinese and English translation can be obtained. Experimental results show that, compared with the traditional detection methods, the detection accuracy and efficiency of the text method are significantly improved.

   translation
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB Neural machine translation systems require large amounts of training data and resources. Even with this, the quality of the translations may be insufficient for some users or domains. In such cases, the output of the system must be revised by a human agent. This can be done in a post-editing stage or following an interactive machine translation protocol.
   We explore the incremental update of neural machine translation systems during the post-editing or interactive translation processes. Such modifications aim to incorporate the new knowledge, from the edited sentences, into the translation system. Updates to the model are performed on-the-fly, as sentences are corrected, via online learning techniques. In addition, we implement a novel interactive, adaptive system, able to react to single-character interactions. This system greatly reduces the human effort required for obtaining high-quality translations.
   In order to stress our proposals, we conduct exhaustive experiments varying the amount and type of data available for training. Results show that online learning effectively achieves the objective of reducing the human effort required during the post-editing or the interactive machine translation stages. Moreover, these adaptive systems also perform well in scenarios with scarce resources. We show that a neural machine translation system can be rapidly adapted to a specific domain, exclusively by means of online learning techniques. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB BLEU and NIST as official machine translation evaluation metrics are widely used to assess system translation quality. These n-gram co-occurrence algorithms are applied to evaluate language learners' translations in this paper. Subtle differences of evaluation on machine translation and learners' translation are discussed. Dependent on n-gram matching between target translation and references, BLEU and NIST evaluate translation quality completely disregarding the source language. Based on sense overlapping in original language, we make pseudo translations for BLEU and NIST by substituting words or phrases in target translation for synonymous words and phrases in references. Pseudo translations expand n-gram co-occurrence between target translation and references. Evaluation experiments on learners' translation and machine translation corpus with expanded n-gram co-occurrence outperform pure BLEU and NIST evaluation in higher correlation with human assessments.

TI AccurIT: a prototype of a machine translation engine for English to

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND LEARNING
AB Current machine translators have reached an unprecedented level of sophistication in dealing with not only isolated words, but also longer sentences and paragraphs. Despite the advances achieved in this field, several challenges remain to be resolved for machine translation (MT) to be on par with professional human translation, including the quality of grammar and context accuracy, pragmatics, relevance, choice of vocabulary and ability to translate large files effectively based on this list's criteria. Another extremely problematic area that we have observed is incorrect literal translation of English phrases, proverbs, idioms, figurative speech and cliches, which proves to be an issue with most current translation programs, even ones built using a phrase-based approach. Therefore, this study's objective was to develop a prototype of an English-Arabic MT engine, AccurIT, to address MTs' English-to-Arabic translation-accuracy issues in general. We compared the results of our tool against Google and Azure Translation Hub based on some excerpts from the legal realm to demonstrate AccurIT's efficacy, and the results are promising.

AB In this paper, we study on the problem of statistical machine translation (SMT) for English language, and the main innovation is that we introduce the SVM classifier to solve this problem. Particularly, the process of statistical machine translation is constructed of two modules, that is, 1) constructing the target language sentence, and 2) translating from target texts to source texts language. Afterwards, framework of the statistical machine translation system is provided. The main idea of statistical machine translation is in that the sentence with highest probability is selected by optimizing an objective function, which describes the relationships between source language sentences and target language sentences. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms Topic-Based SMT and Rule Based SMT.

This article synthesizes the literature that focuses specifically on the use of machine translation by Chinese speakers who seek to write in English in a scholarly context. This article also reports on a pilot study carried out with international students from China at a Canadian university. The students participated in a machine translation literacy workshop where they learned tips to use this technology more effectively to help them with writing in English. Overall, the workshop was a success with students reporting increased knowledge about and confidence in using machine translation; however, they also suggested that future iterations of the workshop could be improved by adding more language-pair specific tips for translation-friendly writing, as well as more information on post-editing the Chinese-English language pair.

TI USING MACHINE TRANSLATION ENGINES IN THE CLASSROOM: A SURVEY OF
   TRANSLATION STUDENTS' PERFORMANCE
SO ADVANCED EDUCATION
AB This paper outlines the results of the experimental study aiming to explore the impact of using machine translation engines on the performance of translation students. Machine translation engines refer to the software developed to translate source texts into target languages in a fully automatic mode which can be classified according to the algorithm (example-based, rule-based, statistical, pragmatics-based, neural, hybrid) and the level of customisation (generic, customised, adaptive). The study was carried out in the form of a translation test held during the first semester of 2019/2020 academic year (September). The subjects included 48 undergraduate students of the School of Foreign Languages of V. N. Karazin Kharkiv National University (42 women and 6 men aged from 19 to 22) majoring in translation. They were subdivided into two sample groups: sample group 1 performed translation from English into Ukrainian with the help of the MT engine while sample group 2 translated the same text from English into Ukrainian by hand. The MT engine chosen for conducting the research was Microsoft Translator for personal use. The research was arranged into the following stages: preliminary (designing the experiment), main (implementing the experiment into life), conclusive (processing the results and interpreting them). The comparison of the students' average results allowed us to come to the conclusion that the hypothesis preconceived in the beginning of the study was confirmed: the quality of the text translated by the students who received no previous training in post-editing with the use of a modem machine translation engine was of a poorer quality compared to the translation of the same text made by the students without the use of a machine translation engine. The students using the machine translation engine showed the tendency not to treat critically the output of the machine translation engine, thus scoring more penal points than the students translating on their own. The evidence from this study implies the necessity of teaching students to use machine translation in their work and to post-edit texts by means of developing the appropriate cross-curricular methodology of teaching.

SO TARGET-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB The default option of the Google Translator Toolkit (GTT), released in June 2009, is to "pre-fill with machine translation" all segments for which a 'no match' has been returned by the memories, while the Settings window clearly advises that "[m]lost users should not modify this". To confirm whether this approach indeed benefits translators and translation quality, we designed and performed tests whereby trainee translators used the GTT to translate passages from English into Chinese either entirely from the source text, or after seeding of empty segments by the Google Translate engine as recommended. The translations were timed, and their quality assessed by independent experienced markers following Australian NAATI test criteria. Our results show that, while time differences were not significant, the machine translation seeded passages were more favourably assessed by the markers in thirty three of fifty six cases. This indicates that, at least for certain tasks and language combinations and against the received wisdom of translation professionals and translator trainers translating by proofreading machine translation may be advantageous.

TI Towards Sustainable Use of Machine Translation: Usability and Perceived
   Quality from the End-User Perspective
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Artificial intelligence-grounded machine translation has fundamentally changed public awareness and attitudes towards multilingual communication. In some language pairs, the accuracy, quality and efficiency of machine-translated texts of certain types can be quite high. Hence, the end-user acceptability and reliance on machine-translated content could be justified. However, machine translation in small and/or low-resource languages might yield significantly lower quality, which in turn may lead to potentially negative consequences and risks if machine translation is used in high-risk contexts without awareness of the drawbacks, critical assessment and modifications to the raw output. The current study, which is part of a more extensive project focusing on the societal impact of machine translation, is aimed at revealing the attitudes towards usability and quality as perceived from the end-user perspective. The research questions addressed revolve around the machine translation types used, purposes of using machine translation, perceived quality of the generated output, and actions taken to improve the quality by users with various backgrounds. The research findings rely on a survey of the population (N = 402) conducted in 2021 in Lithuania. The study reveals the frequent use of machine translation for a diversity of purposes. The most common uses include work, research and studies, and household environments. A higher level of education correlates with user dissatisfaction with the generated quality and actions taken to improve it. The findings also reveal that age correlates with the use of machine translation. Sustainable measures to reduce machine translation related risks have to be established based on the perceptions of different social groups in different societies and cultures.

AB A complex expression is more difficult for machine translation than a simplified sentence. One efficient method to handle this problem is to rewrite the source text into a simplified version before translation while keeping its meaning. In this paper, we propose a novel method to automatically rewrite source sentences based on neural machine translation. We propose a round-trip machine translation method to automatically generate a large amount of high quality rewritten pairs from bilingual corpus and then build an end-to-end sentence rewriting system based on neural network. Experimental results on Chinese-English IWSLT translation tasks show that our method leads to significant improvements over a strong baseline system.

AB In the field of machine translation ample amount of work has been done to improve the essence of translation systems. It all started in 1949 when Warren Weaver proposed the first idea of using computer for translation. Since then several approaches have been followed out to ameliorate the quality of translation. But even after continuing development in this field, we haven't reached the level where we could get the exact translation of the source text. The aim of this paper is to brief about different approaches of machine translation and introduce a mechanism for the evaluation of the efficiency of translation systems based on the lexical, syntactical and semantics differences between source text and translated text. This mechanism provides a statistical analysis of translation systems, the results of this analysis can be used as a rating mechanism on the translation systems used worldwide. In this paper, we have emphasized on translation between English and Hindi.

AB Decoding is a core process of the statistical machine translation, and determines the final results of it. In this paper, a decoding optimization for Chinese-English SMT with a dependent syntax language model was proposed, in order to improve the performance of the decoder in Chinese-English statistical machine translation. The data set was firstly trained in a dependent language model, and then calculated scores of NBEST list from decoding with the model. According to adding the original score of NBEST list from the decoder, the NBEST list of machine translation was reordered. The experimental results show that this approach can optimize the decoder results, and to some extent, improve the translation quality of the machine translation system.

AB Despite the success of neural machine translation (NMT), simultaneous neural machine translation (SNMT), the task of translating in real time before a full sentence has been observed, remains challenging due to the syntactic structure difference and simultaneity requirements. In this paper, we propose a general framework for adapting neural machine translation to translate simultaneously. Our framework contains two parts: prefix translation that utilizes a consecutive NMT model to translate source prefixes and a stopping criterion that determines when to stop the prefix translation. Experiments on three translation corpora and two language pairs show the efficacy of the proposed framework on balancing the quality and latency in adapting NMT to perform simultaneous translation.

TI Measuring word alignment quality for statistical machine translation
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Automatic word alignment plays a critical role in statistical machine translation. Unfortunately, the relationship between alignment quality and statistical machine translation performance has not been well understood. In the recent literature, the alignment task has frequently been decoupled from the translation task and assumptions have been made about measuring alignment quality for machine translation which, it turns out, are not justified. In particular, none of the tens of papers published over the last five years has shown that significant decreases in alignment error rate (AER) result in significant increases in translation performance. This paper explains this state of affairs and presents steps towards measuring alignment quality in a way which is predictive of statistical machine translation performance.

AB In most languages, many words have multiple senses, thus machine translation systems have to choose between several candidates representing different senses of an input word. Although neural machine translation has recently become a dominant paradigm and achieved great progress, it still has to confront with the challenge of word sense disambiguation. Neural machine translation models are trained to identify the correct sense of a word as part of an end-to-end translation task, and their performances on word sense disambiguation are not satisfactory. This paper presents a case study of machine translation for Korean language. We have manually built a Korean lexical semantic network - UWordMap - as a large-scale lexical semantic knowledge-based in which each sense of every polysemous word is associated with a sense-code constituting a network node. Then, based on UWordMap, we determine the correct sense and tag the appropriated sense-code for polysemous words of the training corpus before training neural machine translation models. Experiments on translation from Korean to English and Vietnamese show that UWordMap can significantly improve quality of Korean neural machine translation systems in terms of BLEU and TER cores.

AB When building rule-based machine translation systems, a considerable human effort is needed to code the transfer rules that are able to translate source-language sentences into grammatically correct target-language sentences. In this paper we describe how to adapt the alignment templates used in statistical machine translation to the rule-based machine translation framework. The alignment templates are converted into structural transfer rules that are used by a shallow-transfer machine translation engine to produce grammatically correct translations. As the experimental results show there is a considerable improvement in the translation quality as compared to word-for-word translation (when no transfer rules are used), and the translation quality is close to that achieved when hand-coded transfer rules are used. The method presented is entirely unsupervised, and needs only a parallel corpus, two morphological analysers, and two part-of-speech taggers, such as those used by the machine translation system in which the inferred transfer rules are integrated.

AB In recent years, machine translation software has increasingly been integrated into our daily lives. People routinely use machine translation for various applications, such as describing symptoms to a foreign doctor and reading political news in a foreign language. However, the complexity and intractability of neural machine translation (NMT) models that power modern machine translation make the robustness of these systems difficult to even assess, much less guarantee. Machine translation systems can return inferior results that lead to misunderstanding, medical misdiagnoses, threats to personal safety, or political conflicts. Despite its apparent importance, validating the robustness of machine translation systems is very difficult and has, therefore, been much under-explored.
   To tackle this challenge, we introduce structure-invariant testing (SIT), a novel metamorphic testing approach for validating machine translation software. Our key insight is that the translation results of "similar" source sentences should typically exhibit similar sentence structures. Specifically, SIT (1) generates similar source sentences by substituting one word in a given sentence with semantically similar, syntactically equivalent words; (2) represents sentence structure by syntax parse trees (obtained via constituency or dependency parsing); (3) reports sentence pairs whose structures differ quantitatively by more than some threshold. To evaluate SIT, we use it to test Google Translate and Bing Microsoft Translator with 200 source sentences as input, which led to 64 and 70 buggy issues with 69.5% and 70% top-1 accuracy, respectively. The translation errors are diverse, including under-translation, over-translation, incorrect modification, word/phrase mistranslation, and unclear logic.

AB This paper focuses on the improvement of translation results by neural network Since different translation models and methods have their own advantages and disadvantages, sentence-level paraphrase is used to rewrite the translation, which is regarded as a translation task between the same language. In the absence of large-scale parallel paraphrase corpus, we approximate parallel paraphrase corpus using machine translation results and reference translations of source language. Then, the model is used to train a repetition system from machine translation results to reference translation, to produce sentence-level repetition results with consistent semantics. After that, the restatement results are introduced into the translation hypothesis candidates for system integration. Finally, based on translation and paraphrase, mobile application-oriented design and development are performed to achieve machine translation between Chinese and English.

SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
AB Machine translation requires a large amount of parallel data for a production level of translation quality. This is one of the significant factors behind the lack of machine translation systems for most spoken/written languages. Likewise, Manipuri is a low resource Indian language, and there is very little digital textual available data for the same. In this work, we attempt to address the low resource neural machine translation for Manipuri and English using other Indian languages in a multilingual setup. We train an LSTM based many-to-many multilingual neural machine translation system that is infused with cross-lingual features. Experimental results show that our method improves over the vanilla many-to-many multilingual and bilingual baselines for both Manipuri to/from English translation tasks. Furthermore, our method also improves over the vanilla many-to-many multilingual system for the translation task of all the other Indian languages to/from English. We also examine the generalizability of our multilingual model by evaluating the translation among the language pairs which do not have a direct link via the zero-shot translation and compare it against the pivot-based translation.

AB When users communicate with each other via machine translation, it is important to improve the quality of the translations. The "Back Translation" technique can improve the translation accuracy. A back translation, first, translates the input language into the target language (outward), and then translates the target language into the input language (homeward). This allows the users to confirm the accuracy of the machine translation by themselves. If the user finds that his input sentence is unsuitable for machine translator, he can rewrite the input sentence. For effective multilingual communication, it is important that the back translation offer good accuracy and good usability. This paper focuses on these two points; we evaluated the accuracy of back translation, and developed a user interface that improves the usability of back translation. The outward and homeward translations show a correlation. Back translation can improve the accuracy of outward translation for users.

This is the first work that applies neural-based machine translation method to this problem and gives a thorough comparison to the phrase-based machine translation method which is the current state-of-the-art method for this problem. On a large dataset, the phrase-based approach has an accuracy of 97.32% while that of the neural-based approach is 96.15%. While the neural-based method has a slightly lower accuracy, it is about twice faster than the phrase-based method in terms of inference speed. Moreover, neural-based machine translation method has much room for future improvement such as incorporating pre-trained word embeddings and collecting more training data.

AB Quality estimation is an essential step in applying machine translation systems in practice, however state-of-the-art approaches require manual post-edits and other expensive resources. We introduce an approach to quality estimation that uses the attention weights of a neural machine translation system and can be applied to a translation produced by any machine translation system; a lighter version of the approach does not even require any post-edits. Our experiments with German-Estonian and English-Estonian translations show that its performance matches the state-of-the-art baseline.

AB In this paper, we present MISS, an assistant for multi-style simultaneous translation. Our proposed translation system has five key features: highly accurate translation, simultaneous translation, translation for multiple text styles, back-translation for translation quality evaluation, and grammatical error correction. With this system, we aim to provide a complete translation experience for machine translation users. Our design goals are high translation accuracy, real-time translation, flexibility, and measurable translation quality. Compared with the free commercial translation systems commonly used, our translation assistance system regards the machine translation application as a more complete and fully-featured tool for users. By incorporating additional features and giving the user better control over their experience, we improve translation efficiency and performance. Additionally, our assistant system combines machine translation, grammatical error correction, and interactive edits, and uses a crowd-sourcing mode to collect more data for further training to improve both the machine translation and grammatical error correction models. A short video demonstrating our system is available at https : / /www .youtube .com/watch?v-ZGCo7KtRKd8.

AB This paper considers some ethical implications of machine translation for low-resourced languages. I use Armenian as a case study and investigate specific needs for and concerns arising from the creation and deployment of improved machine translation between English and Armenian. To do this, I conduct stakeholder interviews and construct Value Scenarios (Nathan et al., 2007) from the themes that emerge. These scenarios illustrate some of the potential harms that low-resourced language communities may face due to the deployment of improved machine translation systems. Based on these scenarios, I recommend 1) collaborating with stakeholders in order to create more useful and reliable machine translation tools, and 2) determining which other forms of language technology should be developed alongside efforts to improve machine translation in order to mitigate harms rendered to vulnerable language communities. Both of these goals require treating low-resourced machine translation as a language-specific, rather than language-agnostic, task.

AB Neural machine translation (NMT) has shown very promising results for some resourceful languages like En-Fr and En-De. The success partly relies on the availability of large scale and high quality parallel corpora. We research on how to adapt NMT to very low-resource Mongolian-Chinese machine translation by introducing attention mechanism, sub-words translation, monolingual data and a NMT correction model. We proposed a sub-words model to address the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem in attention-based NMT model. Monolingual data help alleviate the low-resource problem. Besides, we explore a Chinese NMT correction model to enhance the translation performance. The experiments show that the adapted Mongolian-Chinese attention-based NMT machine translation obtains an improvement of 1.70 BLEU points over the phrased-based statistical machine translation baseline and 3.86 BLEU points over normal NMT baseline on an open training set.

TI Integrating Prior Translation Knowledge Into Neural Machine Translation
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Neural machine translation (NMT), which is an encoder-decoder joint neural language model with an attention mechanism, has achieved impressive results on various machine translation tasks in the past several years. However, the language model attribute of NMT tends to produce fluent yet sometimes unfaithful translations, which hinders the improvement of translation capacity. In response to this problem, we propose a simple and efficient method to integrate prior translation knowledge into NMT in a universal manner that is compatible with neural networks. Meanwhile, it enables NMT to consider the crossing language translation knowledge from the source-side of the training pipeline of NMT, thereby making full use of the prior translation knowledge to enhance the performance of NMT. The experimental results on two large-scale benchmark translation tasks demonstrated that our approach achieved a significant improvement over a strong baseline.

AB This paper gives an insight into the role of Sanskrit as inter-lingua language in Multi-language machine translation. Inter-lingua and direct transformation based approaches have been used for a long period complementing each other while sometimes competing with each other. Inter-lingua based approach is efficient when used for multi-lingual machine translation e.g. Angla-Bharati system uses pseudo lingua for Indian language (PLIL) as inter-lingua language for translation from Hindi to other Indian regional language. It is proposed to use Sanskrit as an inter-lingua in Multi-language machine translation.

This translator was implemented using the part of speech tagging and lemmatization techniques with implementations in Aelius and CoGrOO, respectively. Then, we developed a convolutional translator seeking to replicate the rule-based translation with a sintetic corpus. In this corpus, preprocessing techniques such as substitution of names, numbers and spelling errors by symbols were applied to improve processing. The translator were tested on two corpus, Bosque e OpenSub (extracted from a site of subtitles), of 69 and 36.858 lines respectively, and compared with translations generated by interpreters and translations generated by the application VLibras (LAVID-UFPB).

TI Minimum Bayes' risk subsequence combination for machine translation
SO PATTERN ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS
AB System combination has proved to be a successful technique in the pattern recognition field. However, several difficulties arise when combining the outputs of tasks, e.g. machine translation, that generates structured patterns. So far, machine translation system combination approaches either implement sophisticated classifiers to select one of the provided translations, or generate new sentences by combining the "best" subsequences of the provided translations. We present minimum Bayes' risk system combination (MBRSC), a system combination method for machine translation that gathers together the advantages of sentence-selection and subsequence-combination methods. MBRSC is able to detect and utilize the "best" subsequences of the provided translations to generate the optimal consensus translation with respect to a particular performance metric. Experiments show that MBRSC obtains significant improvements in translation quality, and a particularly competitive performance when applied to languages with scarce resources.

TI Translation Agent: A New Metaphor for Machine Translation
SO NEW GENERATION COMPUTING
AB We present agent metaphor as a novel interactive system to promote the efficiency in machine translation mediated communication. Machine translation is increasingly used to support multilingual communication. In the traditional, transparent-channel way of using machine translation for the multilingual communication, translation errors are ignorable, due to the quality limitation of current machine translators. Those translation errors will break the communication and lead to miscommunication. We propose to shift the paradigm from the transparent-channel metaphor to the human-interpreter metaphor, which motives the interactions between the users and the machine translator. Following this paradigm shifting, the interpreter (agent) encourages the dialog participants to collaborate, as their interactivity will be helpful in reducing the number of translation errors, the noise of the channel. We examine the translation issues raised by multilingual communication, and analyze the impact of interactivity on the elimination of translation errors. We propose an implementation of the agent metaphor, which promotes interactivity between dialog participants and the machine translator. We design the architecture of our agent, analyze the interaction process, describe decision support and autonomous behavior, and provide an example of preparing repair strategy. We conduct an English-Chinese communication task experiment on tangram arrangement. The experiment shows that compared to the transparent-channel metaphor, our agent metaphor reduces human communication effort by 21.6%.

This paper briefly introduced the English speech recognition algorithm based on the back-propagation (BP) neural network algorithm and the machine translation algorithm based on the long short-term memory-recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) algorithm. Then, the machine translation algorithm was simulated and compared with BP-RNN and RNN- RNN algorithms. The results showed that the BP neural network algorithm had a lower word error rate and shorter recognition time compared with the manual recognition approach; the LSTM-RNN-based machine translation algorithm had the lowest error rate for the translation of speech recognition results, and the translation gained the highest rating in the evaluation of ten professional translators.

SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB Machine translation (MT) from English to foreign languages is a fast developing area of research, and various techniques of translation are discussed in the literature. However, translation from English to Malayalam, a Dravidian language, is still in the rising stage, and works in this field have not flourished to a great extent, so far. The main reason of this shortcoming is the non-availability of linguistic resources and translation tools in the Malayalam language. A parallel corpus with alignment is one of such resources that are essential for a machine translator system. This paper focuses on a technique that enables automatic setting up of a verb-aligned parallel corpus by exploring the internal structure of the English and Malayalam language, which in turn facilitates the task of machine translation from English to Malayalam.

The study results show that both human translation and machine translation can experience translation inaccuracies. The English translation based on the binomial theorem is more objective and accurate. The professional English translation corpus established by this method can help us solve the problem of professional terminology translation.

In this paper, a regional vocabulary-based application-oriented Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model is proposed over the data set of emails used at the University for communication over a period of three years. A state-of-the-art Sequenceto-Sequence Neural Network for ML -> EN (Malay to English) and EN -> ML (English to Malay) translations is compared with Google Translate using Gated Recurrent Unit Recurrent Neural Network machine translation model with attention decoder. The low BLEU score of Google Translation in comparison to our model indicates that the application based regional models are better. The low BLEU score of English to Malay of our model and Google Translation indicates that the Malay Language has complex language features corresponding to English.

AB Machine translation for social communication is necessary in daily life. However, spoken language translation faces many challenges especially in the translation of zero pronouns which is absent in the source language but appear in the target language. Dropping of pronouns severely affects the machine translation from pronoun dropped language such as Chinese to other languages. This phenomenon occurs more frequently in the conversational spoken language. In order to solve this problem, we insert the position of missing pronouns into the source side, then we use the word alignment method to filter the pronouns in order to pick up the pronouns which are really helpful for the machine translation. We achieve improvement on the translation of chat, message and telephone conversational corpus.

TI Efficient Embedded Decoding of Neural Network Language Models in a

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS
AB Neural Network Language Models (NNLMs) are a successful approach to Natural Language Processing tasks, such as Machine Translation. We introduce in this work a Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system which fully integrates NNLMs in the decoding stage, breaking the traditional approach based on n-best list rescoring. The neural net models (both language models (LMs) and translation models) are fully coupled in the decoding stage, allowing to more strongly influence the translation quality. Computational issues were solved by using a novel idea based on memorization and smoothing of the softmax constants to avoid their computation, which introduces a trade-off between LM quality and computational cost. These ideas were studied in a machine translation task with different combinations of neural networks used both as translation models and as target LMs, comparing phrase-based and N-gram-based systems, showing that the integrated approach seems more promising for N-gram-based systems, even with nonfull-quality NNLMs.

TI LSTM-Based Attentional Embedding for English Machine Translation
SO SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
AB In order to reduce the workload of manual grading and improve the efficiency of grading, a computerized intelligent grading system for English translation based on natural language processing is designed. An attention-embedded LSTM English machine translation model is proposed. Firstly, according to the characteristics of the standard LSTM network model that uses fixed dimensional vectors to represent words in the encoding stage, an English machine translation model based on LSTM attention embedding is established; the structure level of the English translation scoring system is constructed. A linguistic model of the English translation scoring system is established, and the probability distribution of a particular sentence sequence or word sequence of the translated text is statistically calculated using the model. The results show that the English machine translation model based on LSTM attention embedding proposed in this study can enhance the representation of the source language contextual information and improve the performance of the English machine translation model and the quality of the translation compared with the English machine translation models constructed by existing neural network structures, such as standard LSTM models, RNN models, and GRU-Attention translation models.

AB In natural dialogues, speakers may make some kinds of mistakes or so called irregular expressions. One of the most difficult problems Dialogue Machine Translations must deal with is translating irregular expressions in the natural conversation, such as ungrammatical, incompleted, or ill-formed sentences. However most existing machine translation systems reject utterences including irregular expressions. In, this paper, we propose a multiple Translation Processors (MTP) approach for dialogue machine translation. In the MTP, several different types of translation, processors as following are used in original language analysis and target language generation processing simultaneously. (I) Robust Parser based Translation Processor, (II) Example Based Translation Processor, (III) Family Modal based Translation Processor, and (IV) Super Function based Translation Processor. Robust Parser based Translation Processor consists of following three analysis models: (I) All information, analysis model. (2) Syntactic constraint analysis model, (3) Semantic constraint analysis model, ii prototype MTP system based or, the proposed method has been built. Experiment we made show that the proposed method ill this paper is effective for the implement of robust dialogue translation and the development of practical dialogue machine translation system.

AB We aim to shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of the newly introduced neural machine translation paradigm. To that end, we conduct a multifaceted evaluation in which we compare outputs produced by state-of-the-art neural machine translation and phrase-based machine translation systems for 9 language directions across a number of dimensions. Specifically, we measure the similarity of the outputs, their fluency and amount of reordering, the effect of sentence length and performance across different error categories. We find out that translations produced by neural machine translation systems are considerably different, more fluent and more accurate in terms of word order compared to those produced by phrase-based systems. Neural machine translation systems are also more accurate at producing inflected forms, but they perform poorly when translating very long sentences.

TI An Improved English-to-Mizo Neural Machine Translation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB Machine Translation is an effort to bridge language barriers and misinterpretations, making communication more convenient through the automatic translation of languages. The quality of translations produced by corpus-based approaches predominantly depends on the availability of a large parallel corpus. Although machine translation of many Indian languages has progressively gained attention, there is very limited research on machine translation and the challenges of using various machine translation techniques for a low-resource language such as Mizo. In this article, we have implemented and compared statistical-based approaches with modern neural-based approaches for the English-Mizo language pair. We have experimented with different tokenization methods, architectures, and configurations. The performance of translations predicted by the trained models has been evaluated using automatic and human evaluation measures. Furthermore, we have analyzed the prediction errors of the models and the quality of predictions based on variations in sentence length and compared the model performance with the existing baselines.

TI Machine Translation System for the Industry Domain and Croatian Language
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION AND ORGANIZATIONAL SCIENCES
AB Machine translation is increasingly becoming a hot research topic in information and communication sciences, computer science and computational linguistics, due to the fact that it enables communication and transferring of meaning across different languages. As the Croatian language can be considered low-resourced in terms of available services and technology, development of new domain-specific machine translation systems is important, especially due to raised interest and needs of industry, academia and everyday users. Machine translation is not perfect, but it is crucial to assure acceptable quality, which is purpose-dependent. In this research, different statistical machine translation systems were built - but one system utilized domain adaptation in particular, with the intention of boosting the output of machine translation. Afterwards, extensive evaluation has been performed - in form of applying several automatic quality metrics and human evaluation with focus on various aspects. Evaluation is done in order to assess the quality of specific machine-translated text.

AB We show that it is possible to automatically detect machine translated text at sentence level from monolingual corpora, using text classification methods. We show further that the accuracy with which a learned classifier can detect text as machine translated is strongly correlated with the translation quality of the machine translation system that generated it. Finally, we offer a generic machine translation quality estimation technique based on this approach, which does not require reference sentences.

AB The task of recognizing and generating paraphrases is an essential component in many Arabic natural language processing (NLP) applications. A well-established machine translation approach for automatically extracting paraphrases, leverages bilingual corpora to find the equivalent meaning of phrases in a single language, is performed by "pivoting" over a shared translation in another language. Neural machine translation has recently become a viable alternative approach to the more widely-used statistical machine translation. In this paper, we revisit bilingual pivoting in the context of neural machine translation and present a paraphrasing model based mainly on neural networks. Our model describes paraphrases in a continuous space and generates candidate paraphrases for an Arabic source input. Experimental results across datasets confirm that neural paraphrases significantly outperform those obtained with (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper falls within the field of legal translation education. It explores, from the perspective of legal translation lecturers, the impact of machine translation and post-editing on teaching methodology, the constraints and possibilities of machine translation (MT) in the legal translation classroom, and the beliefs of lecturers in the face of market demands and the search for employability. Applying qualitative research premises, the article gathers the beliefs and perceptions of Spanish legal translation lecturers (n=7) through semi-structured interviews. The results show that there is little inclination to incorporate MT in the planning and teaching methodology of lecturers due to the nature and characteristics of legal translation. However, in general terms, there is no great resistance or rejection of MT, which is rather perceived as something inevitable.

TI Topic-based term translation models for statistical machine translation
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Term translation is of great importance for machine translation. In this article, we investigate three issues of term translation in the context of statistical machine translation and propose three corresponding models: (a) a term translation disambiguation model which selects desirable translations for terms in the source language with domain information, (b) a term translation consistency model that encourages consistent translations for terms with a high strength of translation consistency throughout a document, and (c) a term unithood model that rewards translation hypotheses where source terms are translated into target strings as a whole unit. We integrate the three models into hierarchical phrase-based SMT and evaluate their effectiveness on NIST Chinese-English translation with large-scale training data. Experiment results show that all three models can achieve substantial improvements over the baseline. Our analyses also suggest that the proposed models are capable of improving term translation.

One of the tasks of intelligent systems is machine (automated) translation from one natural language to another. Machine translation (MT) allows people to communicate regardless of language differences, as it removes the language barrier and opens up new languages for communication. Machine translation is a new technology, a special step in human development. This type of translation can help when you need to quickly understand what your interlocutor wrote or said in a letter.
   The work of online translators used to translate into Kazakh and vice versa. Translation errors are identified, general advantages and disadvantages of online machine translation systems in Kazakh are given. A model for the development of a post-editing machine translation system for the Kazakh language is presented.
   OpenNMT (Open Neural Machine Translation) is an open source system for neural machine translation and neural sequence training. To learn languages in OpenNMT, you need parallel corpuses for language pairs. The advantage of OpenNMT is that it can be applied to all languages and can handle large corpora. Experimental data were obtained for the English-Kazakh language pair. Experimental data were obtained for the English-Kazakh language pair.

TI Online Machine Translation Use With Nursing Literature Evaluation Method

SO CIN-COMPUTERS INFORMATICS NURSING
AB Japanese nurses are now being required to use research in clinical practice. As a result, they increasingly need to read nursing research literature written in English. Online machine translation is a convenient tool that may address any existing language barrier. The quality of machine translation has been evaluated using various methods; however, its reliability for nursing literature is unknown. In this study, existing methods for evaluating online machine translation quality were examined for structural accuracy and intelligibility of translations of nursing literature, and the usability of machine translations is discussed. In total, 297 English sentences from nursing study abstracts were evaluated for accuracy and intelligibility; 75 word items were identified as specific terms. Interrater reliability of the evaluation method was measured using two raters. The results showed the strong reliability of the existing evaluation method. Also, a possibly usable online machine translation system being offered in Japan was identified. Specific terms seemed to influence the extent of the intelligibility of the translations. Future studies need to include more samples of the nursing population to examine general perceptions of the usability of online machine translation systems for reading English nursing literature among the Japanese nursing population.

TI A Study on Chinese-English Machine Translation Based on Migration
   Learning and Neural Networks
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS
AB This paper constructs a neural machine translation model for Chinese and English using encoder feature extraction with migration learning, allowing the machine to automatically perform feature migration learning, transforming Chinese and English data into word vectors using a centralized representation, and using neural networks to achieve a direct mapping between Chinese and English languages. In this paper, we study the construction of a neural machine translation model by the neural network structure. Firstly, the neural machine translation model is constructed using the neural network structure, which is simplified based on the neural network structure and achieves good performance while reducing the training complexity. To address the problem that neural machine translation cannot make good use of linguistic knowledge, a neural machine translation model with lexical sequence information is proposed. Based on the translation model of a bidirectional neural network incorporating attention mechanism, syntactic analysis is performed to obtain lexical sequence information, and then it is incorporated into the encoder part of the translation model in the form of bidirectional encoding, and the background vector is formed together by vector splicing. To address the problem that the Chinese-English language sequences of any length in the encoder part are encoded into a fixed dimensional background vector, an attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically adjust the degree of influence of the context at the source language end on the target language sequences to improve the translation model's ability to deal with long-distance dependencies. To better reflect the contextual information, this paper further proposes a machine translation model based on migration learning and neural network and conducts a comparative analysis for various translation models to verify the effectiveness of the model performance improvement.

We aim at the data preparation phase for automatic evaluation of machine translation through POS tagging. The preparation phase for MT evaluation consists of several steps, but only the first step - creation of dataset-parallel corpus is deeply described. We focus on the source text collection of various styles and genres-dataset creation and machine translation collection. Two machine translation systems are used-web SMT Google translator API and MT@EC. As a morphology analyzing tool-TreeTagger is used. The process of dataset creation, which covers not only parallel corpora creation, but also creation of errors' database of Slovak words with morphological annotation, is analyzed. The main contribution consists of a novel approach to research of MT evaluation given by the POS tagging (machine learning methods), to identify differences between MT output and post-edited machine translation output. The ground essential of the research is machine translation errors analysis, their identification and classification, from English language into Slovak.

SO COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
AB With the fast development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, machine translation has become a mainstream field of natural language processing. The low-resource language machine translation tasks have become an essential question. However, traditional machine translation systems usually rely on large amounts of high-quality parallel training data. In terms of this question, data augmentation and transfer learning technique in AI domain have become an effective solution for dealing with low-resource language machine translation. Besides, to better solve the domain mismatch problem of machine translation tasks, leveraging lexical constraint mechanism is a significant measure. We presented an approach which applies the transfer learning techniques for the lexical constraint model in this paper. For the existed problem of the transfer learning and lexical constraint technologies, some improved methods are proposed. We choose the appropriate beam search algorithm for lexical constraint measure and investigate the proper way for transferring parameters across two machine translation models. Besides, we will also investigate the compelling data pre-processing steps to process the low-resource corpus and quote various objective evaluation mechanisms to estimate the performance of our pattern better. The comprehensive experiments and results in the paper demonstrate that our method toward low-resource machine translation tasks is effective.

SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB This paper proposes an English-Chinese machine translation research method based on transfer learning. First, it expounds the theory of neural machine translation and transfer learning and related technologies. Neural machine translation is discussed, the advantages and disadvantages of various models are introduced, and the transformer neural machine translation model framework is selected. For low-resource Chinese-English parallel corpus and Tibetan-Chinese parallel corpus, 30 million Chinese-English parallel corpora, 100,000 Chinese-English low-resource parallel corpora, and 100,000 Tibetan-Chinese parallel corpora were used to pretrain the transformer machine translation architecture. The decoders are all composed of 6 identical hidden layers, the initialization of the model parameters is done by the transformer uniform distribution, and the model training uses Adam as the optimizer. In the model transfer part, the parameters with the better effect of the pretrained model are transferred to the low-resource Chinese-English and Tibetan-Chinese machine translation model training, so as to achieve the purpose of knowledge transfer. The results show that the model transfer learning of low-resource Chinese-English parallel corpus improves the translation system's translation by 3.97 BLEU values compared with the translation system without transfer learning at 0.34 BLEU values. Model transfer learning on low-resource Tibetan-Chinese parallel corpus increases the BLEU value by 2.64 BLEU compared to the translation system without transfer learning. The neural machine translation system that uses BPE technology for preprocessing plus model transfer learning is compared to the translation system that only performs transfer learning and shows an improved 0.26 BLEU value.It is verified that the transfer learning method proposed in this paper has a certain improvement in the effect of low-resource Chinese-English and Tibetan-Chinese neural machine translation models.

TI Language Model Pre-training Method in Machine Translation Based on Named

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS
AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model has become the mainstream technology in machine translation. The supervised neural machine translation model trains with abundant of sentence-level parallel corpora. But for low-resources language or dialect with no such corpus available, it is difficult to achieve good performance. Researchers began to focus on unsupervised neural machine translation (UNMT) that monolingual corpus as training data. UNMT need to construct the language model (LM) which learns semantic information from the monolingual corpus. This paper focuses on the pre-training of LM in unsupervised machine translation and proposes a pre-training method, NER-MLM (named entity recognition masked language model). Through performing NER, the proposed method can obtain better semantic information and language model parameters with better training results. In the unsupervised machine translation task, the BLEU scores on the WMT'16 English-French, English-German, data sets are 35.30, 27.30 respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest results in the field of UNMT reported so far.

The results also show that the benefit of using the most informative corpus outweighs the possible errors introduced by the machine translation. For all languages, the combination of machine translation over the Word2Vec English distributional model provided the best results consistently (average Spearman correlation of 0.68).

AB Selecting the word translation from a set of target language words, one that conveys the correct sense of source word and makes more fluent target language output, is one of core problems in machine translation. In this paper we compare the 3 methods of estimating word translation probabilities for selecting the word translation in Thai - English Machine Translation. The 3 methods are (1) Method based on frequency of word translation (2) Method based on collocation of word translation, and (3) Method based on Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. For evaluation we used Thai - English parallel sentences generated by NECTEC. The method based on EM algorithm is the best method in comparison to the other methods and gives satisfying results.

TI A Study on the Intelligent Translation Model for English Incorporating
   Neural Network Migration Learning
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
AB Under the current artificial intelligence boom, machine translation is a research direction of natural language processing, which has important scientific research value and practical value. In practical applications, the variability of language, the limited capability of representing semantic information, and the scarcity of parallel corpus resources all constrain machine translation towards practicality and popularization. In this paper, we conduct deep mining of source language text data to express complex, high-level, and abstract semantic information using an appropriate text data representation model; then, for machine translation tasks with a large amount of parallel corpus, I use the capability of annotated datasets to build a more effective migration learning-based end-to-end neural network machine translation model on a supervised algorithm; then, for machine translation tasks with parallel corpus data resource-poor language machine translation tasks, migration learning techniques are used to prevent the overfitting problem of neural networks during training and to improve the generalization ability of end-to-end neural network machine translation models under low-resource conditions. Finally, for language translation tasks where the parallel corpus is extremely scarce but monolingual corpus is sufficient, the research focuses on unsupervised machine translation techniques, which will be a future research trend.

TI Indowordnet's help in Indian language machine translation
SO AI & SOCIETY
AB Languages with insufficient digitally available resources, such as, Indian-Indian and English-Indian language Machine Translation (MT) system developments, faces the difficulty to translate various lexical phenomena. In this paper, we present our work on a comparative study of 440 phrase-based statistical trained models for 110 language pairs across 11 Indian languages. We have developed 110 baseline statistical machine translation systems. Then, we have augmented the training corpus with Indowordnet synset word entries of lexical database and further trained 110 models on top of the baseline system. We have done a detailed performance comparison using various evaluation metrics such as BLEU score, METEOR, and TER. We observed significant improvement in evaluations of translation quality across all the 440 models after using the Indowordnet. These experiments give a detailed insight in two ways: (1) usage of lexical database with synset mapping for resource poor languages and (2) efficient usage of Indowordnet synset mapping. Moreover, synset mapped lexical entries helped the SMT system to handle the ambiguity to a great extent during the translation.

AB The main goal of machine translation has been to convey the correct content. Stylistic considerations have been at best secondary. We show that as a consequence, the output of three commercial machine translation systems (Bing, DeepL, Google) make demographically diverse samples from five languages "sound" older and more male than the original. Our findings suggest that translation models reflect demographic bias in the training data. These results open up interesting new research avenues in machine translation to take stylistic considerations into account.

TI Arabic Machine Translation: A Survey With Challenges and Future
   Directions
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In recent years, computer language area has witnessed important evolvement with applications in different domains. Machine Translation MT technology, considered as a subfield, has received important development with different approaches and techniques. Although, many MT systems and tools that support Arabic already exist; however, the quality of the translation is moderate and needs some improvement. In addition, the high demand for effective technologies to process and translate information from/to Arabic motivated the researchers in Arabic Machine Translation (AMT) to propose new approaches and solutions following the mainstream method, notably neural machine translation (NMT). In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review and compare different NMT approaches mainly for Arabic-English (and English-Arabic) machine translation research works. The discussed approaches address different linguistic and technical challenges and problems while demonstrating great success compared to traditional methods. The results of this work can serve the researchers and professional to be up-to-date and provide them with the necessary resources for modelling and improving of the AMT. These resources include corpora, toolkits, techniques and new models. The obtained results outline various findings, critics, and open issues in this area.

TI Areas of undecidability in the machine and human translation
SO META
AB This article examines Jacques Derrida's concept of undecidability in machine and human translation. Defined as the very condition of possibility of acting and deciding (Caputo 1997: 137), undecidability is an essential component of decision-making. Using Derrida's concept as a starting point for thinking the intricacies of translation decision processes, this article explores manifestations of undecidability in the translations of an extract from Henri Meschonnic's Traduire au XXI' siecle (2008). Deliberately selected because of its direct resonance with the notion of undecidability, Meschonnic's comment claims that, except for automated translations, no practice of translation is possible without reflexive decision-making (Meschonnic 2008: 60). The observations discussed in this article challenge clear-cut distinctions between human and automated translations by showing that programmability and undecidability are features shared by both humans and machines in translation. As such, this study suggests that uncertainty, as a pre-condition of ethical decision-making, must be fostered within mechanical translations themselves, and that in-depth training in translation technology is necessary for a responsible use of machine translation.

This technique is somehow analogy to the technique of traditional machine translation but it is, far beyond what we understand about machine translation in the past and nowadays in terms of the scope and the contents. To illustrate the new concept of web services-based data translation, a multilingual machine translation electronic dictionary system and its web services based model including generic services, multilingual translation services are presented. This proposed data translation model aims at achieving better web services in easiness, convenience, efficiency, and higher accuracy, scalability, self-learning, self-adapting.

AB The morphologically rich Arabic language continues to present challenges to Arabic Word Sense Disambiguation researchers. The challenges are quite clear when one compares the gradually emerging Arabic to English Machine Translation with the rapidly developing Machine Translations available today. The lagging of the former may be attributed to two reasons. The first is the impenetrability of some Arabic words, which puzzles their decomposition into morphemes. The second is the incompatibility of existing machine-translation techniques with the Arabic language. The degree of difficulty can easily be observed by checking the results of any artless round-trip machine translation of arbitrary Arabic texts. Even the most advanced technologies that are available today are challenged. Regardless of whether the round trip is Arabic-to-English-to-Arabic or English-to-Arabic-to-English, the inevitable outcome will be disenchanting. This leads to an even more disappointing conclusion. That is, as long as no drastic improvements are made, one must not take output of any machine translation of Arabic as orthodox. Yet another disappointing fact is that most of the intelligent machines are built to produce woodenly literal or paraphrased translations. This paper proposes a framework for a biphasic Arabic translation process. Besides, the paper recommends the all-inclusive Holey Quran's English translation as the most reliable benchmark for Arabic to English Translations.

SO JOURNAL OF SPECIALISED TRANSLATION
AB This article seeks to assess the impact of data-driven methods of machine translation (MT), not just on translators, but more broadly on industry and society. We consider translation as a shared resource that is the result of producers and consumers who share the overall objective of providing sustainable access to reliable multilingual information. This view of translation as a shared knowledge resource is based on the reliance of machine learning-based translation techniques on the pooling and leverage of parallel text in the form of existing translations. These techniques build on the well-established practice of leveraging such resources as translation memories. We use the institutional analysis and development (IAD) framework to assist with analysis of the dynamic situations emerging through the use of MT, and consider why changes, such a shared ownership model, would ultimately benefit all stakeholders. We finally suggest some research questions that might help to assess sustainability for translation as a resource, an industry, and an occupation, such as 'what would happen if we left translation to machines?', 'why do translators not act collectively', and 'could principal and end customer buy-in be heightened by quantifying the threat to sustainability of access to translations?'.

TI Artificial Intelligence: Machine Translation Accuracy in Translating
   French-Indonesian Culinary Texts
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB The use of machine translation as artificial intelligence (AI) keeps increasing and the world's most popular translation tool is Google Translate (GT). This tool is not merely used for the benefits of learning and obtaining information from foreign languages through translation but has also been used as a medium of interaction and communication in hospitals, airports and shopping centers. This paper aims to explore machine translation accuracy in translating French-Indonesian culinary texts (recipes). The samples of culinary text were taken from the internet. The research results show that the semiotic model of machine translation in GT is the translation from the signifier (forms) of the source language to the signifier (forms) of the target language by emphasizing the equivalence of the concept (signified) of the source language and the target language. GT aids to translate the existing French-Indonesian culinary text concepts through words, phrases and sentences. A problem encountered in machine translation for culinary texts is a cultural equivalence. GT machine translation cannot accurately identify the cultural context of the source language and the target language, so the results are in the form of a literal translation. However, the accuracy of GT can be improved by refining the translation of cultural equivalents through words, phrases and sentences from one language to another.

AB Recent research suggests that neural machine translation achieves parity with professional human translation on the WMT ChineseEnglish news translation task. We empirically test this claim with alternative evaluation protocols, contrasting the evaluation of single sentences and entire documents. In a pairwise ranking experiment, human raters assessing adequacy and fluency show a stronger preference for human over machine translation when evaluating documents as compared to isolated sentences. Our findings emphasise the need to shift towards document-level evaluation as machine translation improves to the degree that errors which are hard or impossible to spot at the sentence-level become decisive in discriminating quality of different translation outputs.

SO COMPUTING
AB With the increase of translation demand, the advancement of information technology, the development of linguistic theories and the progress of natural language understanding models in artificial intelligence research, machine translation has gradually gained worldwide attention. However, at present, machine translation research still has problems such as insufficient bilingual data and lack of effective feature representation, which affects the further improvement of key modules of machine translation such as word alignment, sequence adjustment and translation modelling. The effect of machine translation is still unsatisfactory. As a new machine learning method, deep neural network can automatically learn abstract feature representation and establish a complex mapping relationship between input and output signals, which provides a new idea for statistical machine translation research. Firstly, the multi-layer neural network and the undirected probability graph model are combined, and the similarity and context information of vocabulary are effectively utilized to model the word alignment more fully, and the word alignment model named NNWAM is constructed. Secondly, the low dimension will be used. The feature representation is combined with other features into a linearly ordered pre-ordering model to construct the pre-ordering model named NNPR. Finally, the word alignment model and the pre-ordering model are combined in the same deep neural network framework to form DNNAPM, a statistical machine translation model based on deep neural networks. The experimental results show that the statistical machine translation model based on deep neural network has better effect, faster convergence and better reliability than the comparison model algorithm.

AB In order to solve the problems of time-consuming and frequent mistranslations in traditional translation methods, this study designed an English-Chinese machine translation method based on transfer learning. On the basis of analyzing the basic principles and specific strategies of English-Chinese machine translation, the traditional neural machine translation methods are analyzed, and then the translation process is optimized by transfer learning. On the basis of preprocessing English-Chinese translation text data, features of English-Chinese translation text are extracted, features of English-Chinese translation text are rapidly classified by feature transfer learning, and machine models of English-Chinese translation are constructed based on the classification results. The objective of feature transfer learning is to reuse the past knowledge obtained in the form of dataset to be utilized for another target data. The findings of the experiment show the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving the design expectation. The benefit of the proposed method includes a short translation time and fewer mistranslations.

TI Cross-Context Accurate English Translation Method Based on the Machine
   Learning Model
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB The era of big data and cloud computing has come, communication between different languages is becoming more and more common, and the barriers between languages are becoming more and more prominent. As the most important means to overcome language barriers, machine translation will play an increasingly important role in modern society. The previous machine translation technology has more or less disadvantages. The accuracy of translation is too low, which is a huge bottleneck hindering the further development of machine translation technology. Therefore, based on this, we can consider modeling the cross-context accurate English translation model based on the machine translation model and rely on the working principle of machine learning. This experiment shows that the translation accuracy of our method reaches 94.2%, which is higher than 39.5% of the benchmark method. This shows that the method in this paper can reduce the influence of other factors, ensure the accuracy of cross-context English translation to a certain extent, and meet the performance improvement requirements of the English translation system.

This work presents an alternative minimum error-rate training procedure based on structural support vector machines (SSVMs) for log-linear interpolation models which is not limited to the model scaling factors and needs only few iterations to converge. Experimental results are reported on the Spanish-English Europarl corpus.

TI Gutenberg Goes Neural: Comparing Features of Dutch Human Translations

SO INFORMATICS-BASEL
AB Due to the growing success of neural machine translation (NMT), many have started to question its applicability within the field of literary translation. In order to grasp the possibilities of NMT, we studied the output of the neural machine system of Google Translate (GNMT) and DeepL when applied to four classic novels translated from English into Dutch. The quality of the NMT systems is discussed by focusing on manual annotations, and we also employed various metrics in order to get an insight into lexical richness, local cohesion, syntactic, and stylistic difference. Firstly, we discovered that a large proportion of the translated sentences contained errors. We also observed a lower level of lexical richness and local cohesion in the NMTs compared to the human translations. In addition, NMTs are more likely to follow the syntactic structure of a source sentence, whereas human translations can differ. Lastly, the human translations deviate from the machine translations in style.

TI Attending From Foresight: A Novel Attention Mechanism for Neural Machine
   Translation
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Machines translation (MT) is an essential task in natural language processing or even in artificial intelligence. Statistical machine translation has been the dominant approach to MT for decades, but recently neural machine translation achieves increasing interest because of its appealing model architecture and impressive translation performance. In neural machine translation, an attention model is used to identify the aligned source words for the next target word, i.e., target foresight word, to select translation context. However, it does not make use of any information about this target foresight word at all. Previous work proposed an approach to improve the attention model by explicitly accessing this target foresight word and demonstrating substantial alignment tasks. However, this approach cannot be applied in machine translation tasks where the target foresight word is unavailable. This paper proposes several novel enhanced attention models by introducing hidden information (such as part-of-speech) of the target foresight word for the translation task. We incorporate the novel enhanced attention employing hidden information about the target foresight word into both recurrent and self-attention-based neural translation models and theoretically justify that such hidden information can make translation prediction easier. Empirical experiments on four datasets further verify that the proposed attention models deliver significant improvements in translation quality.

SO TRANSLATION SPACES
AB This article intends to contribute to the current debate on the quality of neural machine translation (NMT) vs. (professional) human translation quality, where recently claims concerning (super)human performance of NMT systems have emerged. The article will critically analyse some current machine translation (MT) quality evaluation methodologies employed in studies claiming such performance of their MT systems. This analysis aims to identify areas where these methodologies are potentially biased in favour of MT and hence may overvalue MT performance while undervaluing human translation performance. Then, the article provides some Translation Studies informed suggestions for improving or debiasing these methodologies in order to arrive at a more balanced picture of MT vs. (professional) human translation quality.

This approach can be used to evaluate an MT system, tracking improvements over time; to aid in the kind of failure analysis that can help guide system development; and to select among alternative output strings. The method presented is fully automated and independent of source language, target language and domain.

AB In this paper, we present our work on a case study between statistical machine translation (SMT) and rule-based machine translation (RBMT) systems on English-Indian language and Indian to Indian language perspective. Main objective of our study is to make a five-way performance comparison: such as, (a) SMT and RBMT; (b) SMT on English-Indian language; (c) RBMT on English-Indian language; (d) SMT on Indian to Indian language perspective; (e) RBMT on Indian to Indian language perspective. Through a detailed analysis, we describe the rule-based and the statistical machine translation system developments and its evaluations. Further, with a detailed error analysis, we point out the relative strengths and weaknesses of both the systems. The observations based on our study are: (a) SMT systems outperform RBMT; (b) In the case of SMT: English to Indian language MT systems perform better than Indian to English language MT systems; (c) In the case of RBMT: English to Indian language MT systems perform better than Indian to English language MT systems; (d) SMT systems perform better for Indian to Indian language MT systems compared to RBMT. Effectively, we shall see that even with a small amount of training corpus SMT system has many advantages for high-quality domain-specific machine translation over that of a rule-based counterpart.

AB In order to realize the historical sequence establishment of abstract dynamics in the cooperative translation of Korean language under machine learning and generate an abstract representation dynamically of the translation decoding tree in the recursive model during translation decoding. Combining the advantages of the two kinds of neural networks, this paper constructs a recursive recurrent neural network model, which can not only model the translation process by using the traditional machine translation features but also gradually construct the abstract representation of translation candidates in the process of translation, mining the important language model and other global features in machine translation effectively. This paper has trained the number of Korean-Chinese translation vocabulary, sentence length, and language pairs. Based on the test results, the model can effectively improve the performance of the machine translation model. In addition, based on the adjustment of pre-order word order to optimized the recursive recurring neural network model, and improved the performance of machine translation significantly.

AB Machine translation Quality Estimation (QE) aims to estimate the quality of machine translations without relying on golden references. Current QE researches mainly focus on sentence-level QE models, which could not capture discourse-related translation errors. To tackle this problem, this paper presents a novel document-level QE model based on Centering Theory (CT), which is a linguistics theory for assessing discourse coherence. Furthermore, we construct and release an open-source Chinese-English corpus at https://github.com/ydc/cpqe for document-level machine translation QE, which could be used to support further studies. Finally, experimental results show that the proposed model significantly outperformed the baseline model.

In this paper we have focused on handling the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words as an open problem in neural machine translation. The method we introduce in this paper chooses appropriate alternative words inside the vocabulary for the OOV words by considering the word embeddings trained on monolingual corpora. Both monolingual and bilingual embeddings are used in finding the proper substitute for each OOV word. Using this technique we have improved the quality of translation up to 2.3 BLEU without using any additional annotated data.

AB Translation between one language and another is extensively carried out by students, tourists and business persons. The importance of translation cannot be underestimated, especially with the number of translation devices in use by travellers. Google Translate has set up a multilingual translation system and it is regularly used by people all over the world. In Mauritius, translation of the Mauritian Creole language is not available from Google Translate as the available size of the parallel corpora is quite small. The objective of this study is, therefore, to develop a web-based system for the translation between English language and the Mauritian Creole language for learning the two languages. This project on machine translation for the Mauritian Creole language is a starting point that will benefit the Mauritian population at large as well as the Tourism and Business sectors. Statistical Machine Translation, which is the state of-the-art technique, has been adopted for translation between English and Mauritian Creole language. In this paper, the translation between English and Mauritian Creole language is explored.

For this purpose we set up a number of experiments that in our opinion help to relate machine translation to Big Data. In addition to the experiments, which are rather compact and, frankly, pale in comparison to industry level Big Data applications, we discuss possible scenarios where some of the aspects of machine translation fit firmly in the Big Data realm. This work, however, is not meant to be any sort of guidance on Big Data, machine translation, or a combination of both; the reader is advised to treat the material as an opinion piece.

In this paper we proposed a new machine translation method called Super-Function Based Machine Translation(SFBMT) to try to use for mobile terminal. SFBMT uses Super Function(SF) to translate the sentence without thorough syntactic and semantic analysis. And it can translate the sentence fast and high correct. Our experiment shows that this method can get 70% translation precision using the sentences that learned for extracting Super-Function, And 40% translation precision using the sentences that not learned for extracting Super-Function.

Nevertheless, Statistical Machine Translation effectiveness is limited to situations where large amounts of training data are available. Therefore, the broader the coverage of a SMT system is, the better the chances to get a reasonable output are. In this paper we propose a method to improve quality of translations of a phrase-based Machine Translation system by extending phrase-tables with the use of translation paraphrases learned from a third language. Our experiments were done translating from Spanish to English pivoting through French.

AB The difficulty of obtaining the characteristics of the corpus database of neural machine translation is a factor hindering its development. In order to improve the effect of English intelligent translation, based on the machine learning algorithm, this paper improves the multi-objective optimization algorithm to construct a model based on the English intelligent translation system. Moreover, this paper uses parallel corpus and monolingual corpus for model training and uses semi-supervised neural machine translation method to analyze the data processing path in detail and focuses on the analysis of node distribution and data processing flow. In addition, this paper introduces data-related regularization items through the probabilistic nature of the neural machine translation model and applies it to the monolingual corpus to help the training of the neural machine translation model. Finally, this paper designs experiments to verify the performance of this model. The research results show that the translation model constructed in this paper is highly intelligent and can meet actual translation needs.

The primary task is to score all the phrases of the outputs of different machine translation systems selected for combination. Three steps are involved in the proposed statistical system combination approach, viz., alignment, decoding, and scoring. Pair alignment is done in the first step to prevent duplication so that only a single phrase is chosen from various phrases containing the same information. Thus the alignment and scoring strategy are implemented in our approach. Hypotheses are built in the second step. In the third step, we calculate the scores for all the hypotheses. The hypothesis with the highest score is chosen as the final translated output. Wrong scoring can mislead to identify the best part from different systems. It may be noted that a particular phrase may appear in various ways in different translations. To resolve the challenges, we incorporate WordNet in the alignment phase and word2vec in the scoring phase along with the existing factors. We find that the system combination model using WordNet and word2vec injection improves the machine translation accuracy. In this work, we have merged three systems viz., Hierarchical machine translation system, Bing Microsoft Translate, and Google Translate. The broad tests of translation on eight language pairs with benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed system achieves better quality than the individual systems and the state-of-the-art system combination models.

AB Machine translation came in to light over past decades but couldn't reach the results expected due to grammatical and structural differences between the languages and lack of lexical dictionaries. Even though Kannada-Telugu are closely related languages and believed that they are derived from a common script called as Brahmi script still they exhibit many differences at every grammatical level. These differences make a machine translation for this language pair challenging. The objective of this paper is to understand the different types of divergence problems between the Kannada-Telugu Machine Translation. In this paper the divergences of Kannada Telugu language pair are considered. This divergence strategy helps in improving the machine translation performance.

TI Hybrid System Combination Framework for Uyghur-Chinese Machine
   Translation
SO INFORMATION
AB Both the statistical machine translation (SMT) model and neural machine translation (NMT) model are the representative models in Uyghur-Chinese machine translation tasks with their own merits. Thus, it will be a promising direction to combine the advantages of them to further improve the translation performance. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework of developing a system combination for a Uyghur-Chinese machine translation task that works in three layers to achieve better translation results. In the first layer, we construct various machine translation systems including SMT and NMT. In the second layer, the outputs of multiple systems are combined to leverage the advantage of SMT and NMT models by using a multi-source-based system combination approach and the voting-based system combination approaches. Moreover, instead of selecting an individual system's combined outputs as the final results, we transmit the outputs of the first layer and the second layer into the final layer to make a better prediction. Experiment results on the Uyghur-Chinese translation task show that the proposed framework can significantly outperform the baseline systems in terms of both the accuracy and fluency, which achieves a better performance by 1.75 BLEU points compared with the best individual system and by 0.66 BLEU points compared with the conventional system combination methods, respectively.

AB Machine translation software has seen rapid progress in recent years due to the advancement of deep neural networks. People routinely use machine translation software in their daily lives for tasks such as ordering food in a foreign restaurant, receiving medical diagnosis and treatment from foreign doctors, and reading international political news online. However, due to the complexity and intractability of the underlying neural networks, modern machine translation software is still fa r from robust and can produce poor or incorrect translations; this can lead to misunderstanding, financial loss, threats to personal safety and health, and political conflicts. To address this problem, we introduce referentially transparent inputs (RTIs), a simple, widely applicable methodology for validating machine translation software. A referentially transparent input is a piece of text that should have similar translations when used in different contexts. Our practical implementation, Purity, detects when this property is broken by a translation. To evaluate RTI, we use Purity to test Google Translate and Bing Microsoft Translator with 200 unlabeled sentences, which detected 123 and 142 erroneous translations with high precision (79.3% and 78.3%). The translation errors are diverse, including examples of under-translation, over-translation, word/phrase mistranslation, incorrect modification, and unclear logic.

We describe how they were constructed and applied to a syntax- and example-based machine translation system called Parse and Corpus-Based Machine Translation (PaCo-MT). For the language pair Dutch to English, we present non-terminal alignment evaluation scores for a variety of tree alignment approaches. Finally, based on the parallel treebanks created by these approaches, we evaluate the MT system itself and compare the scores with those of Moses, a current state-of-the-art statistical MT system, when trained on the same data.

AB Half of the world speaks languages that are out of the machine translation and natural language processing technologies mainstream. Then the choice of natural language technology for a given language pair is greatly impacted by technology and resources available. In this paper we describe a hybrid architecture and technology for rapid development of the machine translation system from English to low-density languages. We use state of the art English language processing technologies and resources to transform (compress) the language into the more abstract form. The abstraction level of the transformation is adapted to our knowledge of the low-density (foreign) language. Then statistical machine translation is used to induce translation rules. All tests and implementations have been done on the English Lithuanian language pair. Some of the findings of the research can be useful for all, novel and old machine translation language pairs.

The model is aimed for the general language domain, but it is so far mostly trained for some limited domains like cooking recipes, weather forecast and user manuals for different devices. The proposed model was evaluated according to the matched phrases and by using the BLEU machine translation evaluation method.

This Injected Tags approach has been applied to " English into Arabic translation". This approach is language independent and can be used with any language pair. It has shown considerable improvement of the translation quality of at least 13% increase of BLEU score. The approach has been evaluated and has been compared with several online Machine Translation (MT) services. The experiments reveal that the results achieved by this approach considered significant enhancements over PBSMT.

TI Neural machine translation for Indian language pair using hybrid
   attention mechanism
SO INNOVATIONS IN SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
AB Machine translation is an effective way of achieving suitable translations for a given language pair without human intervention. Machine translation can be a very tedious task when the resources for the concerned language pair are low, and the English-Assamese language pair is one such. Neural machine translation is among the different machine translation techniques that use artificial neural networks to learn the nonlinear relationship between bilingual sentence pairs. In this paper, a neural machine translation model is implemented, which uses our proposed hybrid attention mechanism. This hybrid attention mechanism consists of additive and multiplicative attention mechanisms. The proposed attention mechanism is not only capable of selecting an optimal attention mechanism, but also gives the average loss value per epoch to be minimal. The model with our proposed hybrid attention mechanism outperforms the other two models with additive and multiplicative attention by achieving a BLEU score of 27.20 on English-Assamese and a BLEU score of 25.88 on the Assamese-English language pair.

TI Preventing translation quality deterioration caused by beam search
   decoding in neural machine translation using statistical machine
   translation
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Decoding is an important part of machine translation systems, and the most popular inference algorithm used here is beam search. Beam search algorithm improves translation by allowing a larger search space to be traversed than greedy search. However, as the beam width increases, the translation performance declines after a certain point in neural machine translation (NMT). This problem is usually not observed in statistical machine translation (SMT) due to the decoding method. This paper proposes a hybrid system based method that uses SMT predictions to prevent quality deterioration in the beam search algorithm used in NMT decoding. Our approach is based on the reranking n-best list of NMT according to the SMT system translation sentence. We propose two different algorithms for reranking NMT n-best lists. The first algorithm uses the length information of the SMT outputs. In contrast, the second uses a word-based similarity approach with the Jaccard Index, the Dice's Coefficient, and the Overlap Coefficient. Experiments on three different language pairs show that the method we propose prevents the decrease in translation quality and produces a gain of 1.3 BLEU and 1.6 METEOR for different beam sizes and 1.8 BLEU and 2.1 METEOR average scores compared to the baseline results.

AB By using document-level contextual information, document-level neural machine translation can achieve better results than ordinary machine translation, but traditional document-level machine translation is difficult to focus on the contextual sentence articulation relations and deep positional relations within the discourse while utilizing document-level vocabulary, and the model can concentrate only on relatively shallow inter-sentential relations or positional information. In this paper, we consider that most adjacent sentences are connected in document translation, and such links help improve the quality of translation. We propose a document translation model that focuses more on inter-sentential relations based on the previous work, and propose two methods to strengthen the model's positional information input, and combine these two methods to enhance the traditional Transformer positional information input. This paper also proposes a method for inserting paragraph information to allow inter-sentential relations to be learned by the model, and uses the improved Transformer model for Chinese-Mongolian document translation. Experiments show that in the improved Transformer system, the BLEU scores are enhanced on the Chinese-Mongolian machine translation task after fusing positional information and inter-sentential relation information, and the translation achieves better performance.

Five experiments were conducted using three classifiers in Weka, an open-source ML tool. We found that the highest performance was achieved by applying a dimensionality reduction approach to the classification task, which included collapsing a numeric scale of quality to two categories: high quality and low quality. Our results showed that the Support Vector Machine classifier performed the best at predicting the adequacy (65.65%) and fluency (65.77%) of the translations. More research is needed to explore the methodologies of applying ML to translation evaluation.

TI Semantic ordering of English machine translation based on fuzzy theory
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
AB With the development and popularization of electronic computers and the Internet, the problem of language barriers has once again become prominent in the new era, and people are more in need of machine translation. However, there is currently no suitable method for effective semantic ordering of English machine translation. In order to better perform semantic ordering on English machine translation, the article combines fuzzy theory to construct an algorithm model, and analyzes the experimental results through evaluation indicators. The results show that with the increase of training concentration training examples, the semantic parser can learn more natural language sentence analysis methods from the training examples, and the natural language sentences that can be correctly parsed gradually increase, so with the training examples increased recall rate and F value gradually increased. The experimental results also show that the use of higher precision syntax analyzers can effectively improve the performance of statistical machine translation systems, whether in phrase-based or machine-based translation methods.

AB Translation model containing translation rules with probabilities plays a crucial role in statistical machine translation. Conventional method estimates translation probabilities with only the consideration of co-occurrence frequencies of bilingual translation units, while ignoring document-level context information. In this paper, we extend the conventional translation model to a topic-triggered one. Specifically, we estimate topic-specific translation probabilities of translation rules by leveraging topical context information, and online score selected translation rules according to topic posterior distributions of translated sentences. As compared with the conventional model, our model allows for more fine-grained distinction among different translations. Experiment results on large data set demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.

TI A Cognitive Model of Chinese Word Segmentation for Machine Translation
SO META
AB The Chinese language, unlike English, is written without marked word boundaries, and Chinese word segmentation is often referred to as the bottleneck for Chinese-English machine translation. The current word-segmentation systems in machine translation are either linguistically-oriented or statistically-oriented. Chinese, however, is a pragmatically-oriented language, which explains why the existing Chinese word segmentation systems in machine translation are not successful in dealing with the language. Based on a language investigation consisting of two surveys and eight interviews, and its findings concerning how Chinese people segment a Chinese sentence into words in their reading, we have developed a new word-segmentation model, aiming to address the word-segmentation problem in machine translation from a cognitive perspective.

TI Application of statistical machine translation to public health
   information: a feasibility study
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION
AB Objective Accurate, understandable public health information is important for ensuring the health of the nation. The large portion of the US population with Limited English Proficiency is best served by translations of public-health information into other languages. However, a large number of health departments and primary care clinics face significant barriers to fulfilling federal mandates to provide multilingual materials to Limited English Proficiency individuals. This article presents a pilot study on the feasibility of using freely available statistical machine translation technology to translate health promotion materials.
   Design The authors gathered health-promotion materials in English from local and national public-health websites. Spanish versions were created by translating the documents using a freely available machine-translation website. Translations were rated for adequacy and fluency, analyzed for errors, manually corrected by a human posteditor, and compared with exclusively manual translations.
   Results Machine translation plus postediting took 15-53 min per document, compared to the reported days or even weeks for the standard translation process. A blind comparison of machine-assisted and human translations of six documents revealed overall equivalency between machine-translated and manually translated materials. The analysis of translation errors indicated that the most important errors were word-sense errors.
   Conclusion The results indicate that machine translation plus postediting may be an effective method of producing multilingual health materials with equivalent quality but lower cost compared to manual translations.

TI Preordering for Chinese-Vietnamese Statistical Machine Translation
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB Word order is one of the most significant differences between the Chinese and Vietnamese. In the phrase-based statistical machine translation, the reordering model will learn reordering rules from bilingual corpora. If the bilingual corpora are large and good enough, the reordering rules are exact and coverable. However, Chinese-Vietnamese is a low-resource language pair, the extraction of reordering rules is limited. This leads to the quality of reordering in Chinese-Vietnamese machine translation is not high. In this paper, we have combined Chinese dependency relation and Chinese-Vietnamese word alignment results in order to pre-order Chinese word order to be suitable to Vietnamese one. The experimental results show that our methodology has improved the machine translation performance compared to the translation system using only the reordering models of phrase-based statistical machine translation.

AB Machine translation based on neural networks has been shown to produce superior results, compared with other approaches. To build an efficient neural machine translation (NMT) system, it is essential to have an accurate and massive bilingual corpus for training, and ensure the continuous improvement of the methods and techniques used in the translation system. Despite multiple advantages, one challenging issue for current neural network translation system is long sentence processing [1]. In this paper, we propose a method to extract bilingual phrases to build a phrase-aligned bilingual corpus, and the implementation of a long sentence preprocessing technique to be used in the neural machine translation model. Experimental training of the neural machine translation system to translate Vietnamese into English using our proposed technique shows an improvement in BLEU scores.

TI Syntax-Based Chinese-Vietnamese Tree-to-Tree Statistical Machine
   Translation with Bilingual Features
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB Because of the scarcity of bilingual corpora, current Chinese-Vietnamese machine translation is far from satisfactory. Considering the differences between Chinese and Vietnamese, we investigate whether linguistic differences can be used to supervise machine translation and propose a method of syntax-based Chinese-Vietnamese tree-to-tree statistical machine translation with bilingual features. Analyzing the syntax differences between Chinese and Vietnamese, we define some linguistic difference-based rules, such as attributive position, time adverbial position, and locative adverbial position, and create rewards for similar rules. These rewards are integrated into the extraction of tree-to-tree translation rules, and we optimize the pruning of the search space during the decoding phase. The experiments on Chinese-Vietnamese bilingual sentence translation show that the proposed method performs better than several compared methods. Further, the results show that syntactic difference features, with search pruning, can improve the accuracy of machine translation without degrading the efficiency.

AB Freely available tools and language resources were used to build the VoiceTRAN statistical machine translation (SMT) system. Various configuration variations of the system are presented and evaluated. The VoiceTRAN SMT system outperformed the baseline conventional rule-based NIT system in both English-Slovenian in-domain test setups. To further increase the generalization capability of the translation model for lower-coverage out-of-domain test sentences, an "MSD-recombination" approach was proposed. This approach not only allows a better exploitation of conventional translation models, but also performs well in the more demanding translation direction; that is, into a highly inflectional language. Using this approach in the out-of-domain setup of the English-Slovenian JRC-ACQUIS task, we have achieved significant improvements in translation quality.

AB Globalization suddenly brings many people from different country to interact with each other, requiring them to be able to speak several languages. Human translators are slow and expensive, we find the necessity of developing machine translators to automatize the task. Several approaches of Machine translation have been develop by the researchers. In this work, we use the Statistical Machine Translation approach. Statistical Machine Translation systems perform poorly when applied on new domains. The domain adaptation problem has recently gained interest in Statistical Machine Translation. The basic idea is to improve the performance of the system trained and tuned with different domain than the one to be translated. This article studies different paradigms of domain adaptation. The results report improvements compared with a system trained only with in-domain data and trained with all the available data.

AB Normal sub-sentence is a common language phenomenon. The differences between Chinese and English normal sub-sentence make a transformation processing necessary in machine translation. This paper proposed a method to recognize and transform normal sub-sentences to improve their translation performance in patent machine translation. First, we created a dictionary based on HNC theory to recognize the normal sub-sentence. Then, we compared Chinese normal sub-sentences to English ones and summarized the transformation rules based on the comparison. At last, we applied the method to an existing machine translation to test the processing effect. The experiment results show that the method can effectively recognize and transform normal sub-sentences. The Blue of the translation is raised by about 7%.

Unlike previous work training NMT model through maximizing the likelihood of the human translation, Adversarial NMT minimizes the distinction between human translation and the translation generated by a NMT model. Even though Adversarial NMT has achieved impressive results, while using little in the way of prior knowledge. In this paper, we integrated bilingual dictionaries to Adversarial NMT by leveraging a character model. Extensive experiment shows that our proposed methods can achieve remarkable improvement on the translation quality of Adversarial NMT, and obtain better result than several strong baselines.

AB Machine Translation is the usage of machine learning techniques in translation from one language to another. It has recently been applied to streaming translation, also known as automatic subtitling. The most common challenge in this area is the trade-off between correctness and speed. Due to its real-time feature, streaming translation needs high speed as it has strict playtime constraints. This paper proposes an enhanced Transformer model for fast streaming translation. The proposed machine-learning method is described, implemented, and evaluated based on a common German-English bilingual dataset. The evaluation results have shown that the proposed system successfully achieved a good speed in the training phase, and a high speed in the actual translating phrase that is fast enough for real-time applications, while also maintaining robust correctness. We believe the proposed Transformer model is a significant contribution to natural-language processing, and would be useful for other real-time translation applications.

AB Code-switching (CS) is the phenomenon that occurs when a speaker alternates between two or more languages within an utterance or discourse. In this work, we investigate the existence of code-switching in formal text, namely proceedings of multilingual institutions. Our study is carried out on the Arabic-English code-mixing in a parallel corpus extracted from official documents of United Nations. We build a parallel code-switched corpus with two reference translations one in pure Arabic and the other in pure English. We also carry out a human evaluation of this resource in the aim to use it to evaluate the translation of code-switched documents. To the best of our knowledge, this kind of corpora does not exist. The one we propose is unique. This paper examines several methods to translate code-switched corpus: conventional statistical machine translation, the end-to-end neural machine translation and multitask-learning.

TI Neural Network Machine Translation Method Based on Unsupervised Domain
   Adaptation
SO COMPLEXITY
AB Relying on large-scale parallel corpora, neural machine translation has achieved great success in certain language pairs. However, the acquisition of high-quality parallel corpus is one of the main difficulties in machine translation research. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes unsupervised domain adaptive neural network machine translation. This method can be trained using only two unrelated monolingual corpora and obtain a good translation result. This article first measures the matching degree of translation rules by adding relevant subject information to the translation rules and dynamically calculating the similarity between each translation rule and the document to be translated during the decoding process. Secondly, through the joint training of multiple training tasks, the source language can learn useful semantic and structural information from the monolingual corpus of a third language that is not parallel to the current two languages during the process of translation into the target language. Experimental results show that better results can be obtained than traditional statistical machine translation.

TI Neural Machine Translation With Sentence-Level Topic Context
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Traditional neural machine translation (NMT) methods use theword-level context to predict target language translation while neglecting the sentence-level context, which has been shown to be beneficial for translation prediction in statistical machine translation. This paper represents the sentence-level context as latent topic representations by using a convolution neural network, and designs a topic attention to integrate source sentence-level topic context information into both attention-based and Transformerbased NMT. In particular, our method can improve the performance of NMT by modeling source topics and translations jointly. Experiments on the large-scale LDC Chinese-to-English translation tasks and WMT'14 English-to-German translation tasks show that the proposed approach can achieve significant improvements compared with baseline systems.

TI Named entity translation method based on machine translation lexicon
SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
AB In the context of the rapid development of computer technology, communication between various languages has become increasingly important. Among the research methods of named entities, the research on named entity translation methods based on machine translation is one of the research hotspots. Named entity translation is to realize the switching between entities in two languages, which can be used by browsers, translators, etc., and can greatly reduce the cost of communication between people from all over the world. Due to the immaturity of the existing translation model technology and the lack of integration, the translation of bilingual named entities with unique composition is very challenging. Based on this, this paper proposes a fusion method of bilingual entity class named entity translation based on chunk symmetry strategy and English-Chinese transliteration model based on machine learning strategy. According to the bilingual corpus, a more standard candidate entity translation pair is generated through bilingual named entity alignment. The transliteration model is used to reorder and correct the candidate translation results, so as to achieve the correct selection of translation pairs. Experiments show that the model based on the translation of named entity translations based on chunks and transliteration models based on machine learning strategies not only effectively solves the problem of difficulty in word ordering and selection in bilingual translation, but also makes extraction to a certain extent. The accuracy of the translation results has been improved.

AB Neural machine translation systems typically are trained on curated corpora and break when faced with non-standard orthography or punctuation. Resilience to spelling mistakes and typos, however, is crucial as machine translation systems are used to translate texts of informal origins, such as chat conversations, social media posts and web pages. We propose a simple generative noise model to generate adversarial examples of ten different types. We use these to augment machine translation systems' training data and show that, when tested on noisy data, systems trained using adversarial examples perform almost as well as when translating clean data, while baseline systems' performance drops by 2-3 BLEU points. To measure the robustness and noise invariance of machine translation systems' outputs, we use the average translation edit rate between the translation of the original sentence and its noised variants. Using this measure, we show that systems trained on adversarial examples on average yield 50 % consistency improvements when compared to baselines trained on clean data.

TI On integrating a language model into neural machine translation
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB Recent advances in end-to-end neural machine translation models have achieved promising results on high-resource language pairs such as En -> Fr and En -> De. One of the major factor behind these successes is the availability of high quality parallel corpora. We explore two strategies on leveraging abundant amount of monolingual data for neural machine translation. We observe improvements by both combining scores from neural language model trained only on target monolingual data with neural machine translation model and fusing hidden-states of these two models. We obtain up to 2 BLEU improvement over hierarchical and phrase-based baseline on low-resource language pair, Turkish -> English. Our method was initially motivated towards tasks with less parallel data, but we also show that it extends to high resource languages such as Cs -> En and De -> En translation tasks, where we obtain 0.39 and 0.47 BLEU improvements over the neural machine translation baselines, respectively.

AB Machine translation is a log felt need of the countries those who use English as a second language. Due to inherent complexity of natural languages, most of machine translation systems adopt rather ad-hoc strategies such as word level translation without concerning a proper theoretical basis. This has been a major reason for why the developments in natural language processing could not achieve as expected. This paper presents a theoretical-based approach to English-Sinhala machine translation through the concept of Varanagema (conjugation) in Sinhala Language. The theory of Varanagema in Sinhala language handles major language primitives including noun, verbs and prepositions. The concept of Varanagema also drastically reduces the number of word forms to be stored in the dictionaries of the machine translation system. The design, implementation and results of test versions of English-Sinhala machine translation system has been presented in the paper.

   Translations Reunited in Corpus
SO META
AB In this article we provide a linguistic analysis of a corpus of machine-translated texts from English into French, in comparison with a corpus of original French. Two machine translation tools have been selected: one of them is a generic, general public, neural system while the other is a specific, statistical-based tool developed by a major international organization. Following the corpus-based translation studies approach, we provide a quantitative analysis of a series of linguistic features (lexical and grammatical) which are known to be problematic for English-French translators. We aim to show that linguistic usage, which goes beyond grammatical correctness and needs to be taken into account to provide natural, idiomatic translations in order to meet the demands of today's translation market, is not taken into account by current machine translation systems. Our aim is to show human translators' added value over such systems, in particular for translation trainees.

AB The reordering model plays an important role in phrase-based statistical machine translation. However, there are few works that exploit the reordering information in neural machine translation. In this paper, we propose a reordering mechanism to learn the reordering embedding of a word based on its contextual information. These reordering embeddings are stacked together with self-attention networks to learn sentence representation for machine translation. The reordering mechanism can be easily integrated into both the encoder and the decoder in the Transformer translation system. Experimental results on WMT' 14 English-to-German, NIST Chinese-to-English, and WAT ASPEC Japanese-to-English translation tasks demonstrate that the proposed methods can significantly improve the performance of the Transformer translation system.

AB Statistical machine translation is quite robust when it comes to the choice of input representation. It only requires consistency between training and testing. As a result, there is a wide range of possible preprocessing choices for data used in statistical machine translation. This is even more so for morphologically rich languages such as Arabic. In this paper, we study the effect of different word-level preprocessing schemes for Arabic on the quality of phrase-based statistical machine translation. We also present and evaluate different methods for combining preprocessing schemes resulting in improved translation quality.

AB Leveraging lexical constraint is extremely significant in domain-specific machine translation and interactive machine translation. Previous studies mainly focus on extending beam search algorithm or augmenting the training corpus by replacing source phrases with the corresponding target translation. These methods either suffer from the heavy computation cost during inference or depend on the quality of the bilingual dictionary pre-specified by the user or constructed with statistical machine translation. In response to these problems, we present a conceptually simple and empirically effective data augmentation approach in lexical constrained neural machine translation. Specifically, we construct constraint-aware training data by first randomly sampling the phrases of the reference as constraints, and then packing them together into the source sentence with a separation symbol. Extensive experiments on several language pairs demonstrate that our approach achieves superior translation results over the existing systems, improving translation of constrained sentences without hurting the unconstrained ones.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND CONTROL
AB Extraction of a large number of Super-Function (SF) is the most important factor in realizing SF based machine translation. This paper presents a method for automatic extraction of SF from a Japanese-English bilingual corpus. The extraction process uses a bilingual dictionary to match Japanese and English nouns in each sentence pair. The experimental results using a Japanese-English bilingual corpus show that this method performs very well in automatically extracting SF for machine translation. In addition, we evaluate the extracted SF in SF based machine translation.

AB We have presented a new method called Super-Function Based Machine Translation (SFBMT). SFBMT uses Super-Function (SF) to translate without syntactic and semantic analysis as most conventional MT systems do. SF represents correspondence with a source language sentence structure and a target language sentence Structure directory. According to this feature, the system realizes very fast translation. Moreover we do not feel the sense of Incompatibility the translation result because the SFs are automatically generate from a large corpus. In this paper, we dscribe (1) SF based machine translation, (2) extracting SF, (3) the evaluation experiment. As the experimental results, we obtain 84% of effective rates of translation.

The tool supports user provided translations as well as translations from popular online MT system application program interfaces (APIs). The selection of the best translation hypothesis is done by calculating the perplexity for each hypothesis. The evaluation panel provides sentence tree graphs and chunk statistics. The result is a syntax-based multi-system translation tool that shows an improvement of BLEU scores compared to the best individual baseline MT.

AB This work proposes a Machine Translation system from Tamil to English using a Statistical Approach. Statistical machine translation (SMT) is a machine translation paradigm where translations are generated on the basis of statistical models whose parameters are derived from the analysis of bilingual text corpora. It is the most widely used machine translation paradigm for the tradeoff between efficiency and implementation feasibility and due to its partial language independency. In syntax based approach, a phrase table is created which identifies the most probabilistically likely English translation of each Tamil phrase in the input sentence. In hierarchical phrase based approach, a rule table is used to reduce the input Tamil sentence into the output English sentence. We evaluated the two approaches based on different parameters like corpus size, gram size of language model and achieved a BLEU score of 0.26.

TI Statistical Feature Aided Intelligent Deep Learning Machine Translation
   in Internet of Things
SO MOBILE NETWORKS & APPLICATIONS
AB Internet of Things (IoT) networks have been widely deployed to achieve communication among machines and humans. Machine translation can enable human-machine interactions for IoT equipment. In this paper, we propose to combine the neural machine translation (NMT) and statistical machine translation (SMT) to improve translation precision. In our design, we propose a hybrid deep learning (DL) network that uses the statistical feature extracted from the words as the data set. Namely, we use the SMT model to score the generated words in each decoding step of the NMT model, instead of directly processing their outputs. These scores will be converted to the generation probability corresponding to words by classifiers and used for generating the output of the hybrid MT system. For the NMT, the DL network consists of the input layer, embedding layer, recurrent layer, hidden layer, and output layer. At the offline training stage, the NMT network is jointly trained with SMT models. Then at the online deployment stage, we load the fine-trained models and parameters to generate the outputs. Experimental results on French-to-English translation tasks show that the proposed scheme can take advantage of both NMT and SMT methods, thus higher translation precision could be achieved.

TI Machine Translation and Disclosure of Patent Information
SO IIC-INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND COMPETITION LAW
AB Machine translation represents a revolution in the patent system. It facilitates access to a vast amount of patent information on a global level during the different stages of patent prosecution, especially in searches for prior art documents. Moreover, disclosure represents one of the main arguments to justify the existence of patent rights, but how much of this information is actually disclosed by machine translation? The present research aims to investigate the level of disclosure of patent information made possible by machine translation and its implications for patent law. The guiding research question is: How and to what extent is patent content actually disclosed by machine translation? In order to reach the results, a manual method of translation quality assessment was used to analyse a sample of 100 patents, combined in different pairs of languages. Machine translated patent texts were also submitted for evaluation by researchers skilled in the art. The research is also based on a review of legal and theoretical sources. The results proved that, although improvements in patent machine translation are still necessary, most of the content of the patent is disclosed through it, with the average disclosure being almost 80%. As the concept of disclosure is a central one to patent law, it is hoped that this research will contribute to a better understanding of the current role of machine translation in patent law.

TI Improving Transformer-Based Neural Machine Translation with Prior
   Alignments
SO COMPLEXITY
AB Transformer is a neural machine translation model which revolutionizes machine translation. Compared with traditional statistical machine translation models and other neural machine translation models, the recently proposed transformer model radically and fundamentally changes machine translation with its self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms. These mechanisms effectively model token alignments between source and target sentences. It has been reported that the transformer model provides accurate posterior alignments. In this work, we empirically prove the reverse effect, showing that prior alignments help transformer models produce better translations. Experiment results on Vietnamese-English news translation task show not only the positive effect of manually annotated alignments on transformer models but also the surprising outperformance of statistically constructed alignments reinforced with the flexibility of token-type selection over manual alignments in improving transformer models. Statistically constructed word-to-lemma alignments are used to train a word-to-word transformer model. The novel hybrid transformer model improves the baseline transformer model and transformer model trained with manual alignments by 2.53 and 0.79 BLEU, respectively. In addition to BLEU score, we make limited human judgment on translation results. Strong correlation between human and machine judgment confirms our findings.

AB BLEU is one of the most popular metrics for automatic evaluation of machine translation quality. Focusing on its ignorance of different effects of various translation units upon translation quality, this paper extends proper weights to different words and n-grams in the framework of BLEU. The linear regression method is adopted to capture the human perception on translation quality via word types and n-gram length. Compared with other linguistic-rich metrics based on machine learning, the proposed approach is simple and largely preserves BLEU's advantage of language independence. Experimental results indicate that this method brings a much better evaluation performance for both human translation and machine translation than original BLEU.

AB Neural machine translation (NMT) becomes a new approach to machine translation and generates much more fluent results compared to statistical machine translation (SMT). However, SMT is usually better than NMT in translation adequacy. It is therefore a promising direction to combine the advantages of both NMT and SMT. In this paper, we propose a neural system combination framework leveraging multi-source NMT, which takes as input the outputs of NMT and SMT systems and produces the final translation. Extensive experiments on the Chinese-to-English translation task show that our model archives significant improvement by 5.3 BLEU points over the best single system output and 3.4 BLEU points over the state-of-the-art traditional system combination methods.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEXT-GENERATION COMPUTING
AB Language is one of the effective communication methods to express individual thoughts and feelings. In this multilingual world, to understand the language from one to another an automated language conversion system is required. There are different natural language processing machine translation tools to convert the language from one to another. In this paper, we are discussing the different types of ambiguities to translate the language such as lexical, structural, and semantic. Also focusing on different machine translation tools with commonly used approaches like rules, example, statistical syntactic, and hybrid-based. With the help of the existing machine translation tool, the results were compared, which are converted from the language English to Malayalam vice versa. By this study, we identified some of the disadvantages in automatic translation tools currently available for significant sentence translation between the languages English and Malayalam vice versa.

AB Large amounts of bilingual data and monolingual data in the target language are usually used to train statistical machine translation systems. In this paper we propose several semi-supervised techniques within a Bengali English Phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) System in order to improve translation quality. We conduct experiments on a Bengali-English dataset and our initial experimental results show improvement in translation quality.

AB We present in this paper a twofold contribution to Confidence Measures for Machine Translation. First, in order to train and test confidence measures, we present a method to automatically build corpora containing realistic errors. Errors introduced into reference translation simulate classical machine translation errors (word deletion and word substitution), and are supervised by Wordnet. Second, we use SVM to combine original and classical confidence measures both at word- and sentence-level. We show that the obtained combination outperforms by 14% (absolute) our best single word-level confidence measure, and that combination of sentence-level confidence measures produces meaningful scores.

TI Analysis of lengthy sentences using an English comparative structure
   model
SO SYSTEMS AND COMPUTERS IN JAPAN
AB Today, technological expertise gained from studies on natural languages is applied to various practical systems, including machine translation systems. English-Japanese machine translation, however, still remains difficult in the translation of lengthy sentences that contain multiple complicated expressions. Due to limited information volume installed in current machine translation systems, such systems cannot handle the complicated sentences actually used in English. This paper discusses comparative structures, which frequently appear in long English sentences, clarifies characteristics of such structures through grammatical studies and the statistical analysis of the sentences contained in Corpus, and explains the development of comparative structure models and a new analysis method using such models. Having more flexibility than the conventional machine translation method, the new method proposed in this paper has been proved suitable for long sentences for which the grammatical rules and vocabulary installed in conventional machine translation systems are insufficient. English newspaper articles were analyzed with a commercial machine translation system and the new method. The result showed that the new method provided translations that were 41.6 percent more accurate than the conventional system translations.

Retreating into conventional concepts machine translation while utilizing effective neural models is vital for comprehending the leap accomplished by neural machine translation over phrase-based methods. This work proposes a direct hidden Markov model (HMM) with neural network-based lexicon and alignment models, which are trained jointly using the Baum-Welch algorithm. The direct HMM is applied to rerank the n-best list created by a state-of-the-art phrase-based translation system and it provides improvements by up to 1.0% BLEU scores on two different translation tasks.

TI Semantic Neural Machine Translation Using AMR
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB It is intuitive that semantic representations can be useful for machine translation, mainly because they can help in enforcing meaning preservation and handling data sparsity (many sentences correspond to one meaning) of machine translation models. On the other hand, little work has been done on leveraging semantics for neural machine translation (NMT). In this work, we study the usefulness of AMR (abstract meaning representation) on NMT. Experiments on a standard English-toGerman dataset show that incorporating AMR as additional knowledge can significantly improve a strong attention-based sequenceto-sequence neural translation model.

TI Floating-gate based PN blending optoelectronic synaptic transistor for
   neural machine translation
SO SCIENCE CHINA-MATERIALS
AB Neural machine translation, which has an encoder-decoder framework, is considered to be a feasible way for future machine translation. Nevertheless, with the fusion of multiple languages and the continuous emergence of new words, most current neural machine translation systems based on von Neumann's architecture have seen a substantial increase in the number of devices for the decoder, resulting in high-energy consumption rate. Here, a multilevel photosensitive blending semiconductor optoelectronic synaptic transistor (MOST) with two different trapping mechanisms is firstly demonstrated, which exhibits 8 stable and well distinguishable states and synaptic behaviors such as excitatory postsynaptic current, short-term memory, and long-term memory are successfully mimicked under illumination in the wavelength range of 480-800 nm. More importantly, an optical decoder model based on MOST is successfully fabricated, which is the first application of neuromorphic device in the field of neural machine translation, significantly simplifying the structure of traditional neural machine translation system. Moreover, as a multi-level synaptic device, MOST can further reduce the number of components and simplify the structure of the codec model under light illumination. This work first applies the neuromorphic device to neural machine translation, and proposes a multi-level synaptic transistor as the based cell of decoding module, which would lay the foundation for breaking the bottleneck of machine translation.

AB Machine translation deals with automatic translation from one natural language to another. Neural machine translation is a widely accepted technique of the corpus-based machine translation approach. However, an adequate amount of training data is required, and there is a need for the domain-wise parallel corpus to improve translational performance that shows translational coverages in various domains. In this work, a domain-specific parallel corpus is prepared that includes different domain coverages, namely, Agriculture, Government Office, Judiciary, Social Media, Tourism, COVID-19, Sports, and Literature domains for low-resource English-Assamese pair translation. Moreover, we have tackled data scarcity and word-order divergence problems via data augmentation and prior alignment concept. Also, we have contributed Assamese pretrained LM, Assamese word-embeddings by utilizing Assamese monolingual data, and a bilingual dictionary-based post-processing step to enhance transformer-based neural machine translation. We have achieved state-of-the-art results for both forward (English-to-Assamese) and backward (Assamese-to-English) directions of translation.

   Translation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB Large-scale parallel corpora are essential for training high-quality machine translation systems; however, such corpora are not freely available for many language translation pairs. Previously, training data has been augmented by pseudo-parallel corpora obtained by using machine translation models to translate monolingual corpora into the source language. However, in low-resource language pairs, in which only low-accurate machine translation systems can be used, translation quality degrades when a pseudo-parallel corpus is naively used. To improve machine translation performance with low-resource language pairs, we propose a method to effectively expand the training data via filtering the pseudo-parallel corpus using quality estimation based on sentence-level round-trip translation. For experiments with three language pairs that utilized small, medium, and large size parallel corpora, BLEU scores significantly improved for low-resource language pairs. Additionally, the effects of iterative bootstrapping on translation performance quality is investigated; resultingly, it is confirmed that bootstrapping can further improve the translation performance.

TI Machine Translation for Low-Resource English-Mizo Pair Encountering
   Tonal Words
SO COMPUTACION Y SISTEMAS
AB Machine translation is one of the most powerful natural language processing applications for preserving and upgrading low-resource language. Mizo language is considered as low-resource since there is limited availability of resources. Therefore, it is a challenging task for English-Mizo language pair translation. Moreover, Mizo is a tonal language, where a word can express different meanings depending on a variety of tones. There are four variations of tones, namely high, low, rising, and falling. A tone marker is used to represent each of the tones, which is added to the vowels to indicate tone variation. Addressing tonal words in machine translation for such a low-resource pair is another challenging issue. In this paper, the English-Mizo corpus is developed where parallel sentences having tonal words are incorporated. The different machine translation models are explored based on statistical machine translation and neural machine translation for the baseline systems. Furthermore, the proposed approach attempts to augment the train data by expanding parallel data having tonal words and achieves state-of-the-art results for both forward and backward translations encountering tonal words.

TI A critique of Statistical Machine Translation
SO LINGUISTICA ANTVERPIENSIA NEW SERIES-THEMES IN TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation (PB-SMT) is clearly the leading paradigm in the field today. Nevertheless-and this may come as some surprise to the PB-SMT community-most translators and, somewhat more surprisingly perhaps, many experienced MT protagonists find the basic model extremely difficult to understand. The main aim of this paper, therefore, is to discuss why this might be the case. Our basic thesis is that proponents of PB-SMT do not seek to address any community other than their own, for they do not feel any need to do so. We demonstrate that this was not always the case; on the contrary, when statistical models of translation were first presented, the language used to describe how such a model might work was very conciliatory, and inclusive. Over the next five years, things changed considerably; once SMT achieved dominance particularly over the rule-based paradigm, it had established a position where it did not need to bring along the rest of the MT community with it, and in our view, this has largely pertained to this day. Having discussed these issues, we discuss three additional issues: the role of automatic MT evaluation metrics when describing PB-SMT systems; the recent syntactic embellishments of PB-SMT, noting especially that most of these contributions have come from researchers who have prior experience in fields other than statistical models of translation; and the relationship between PB-SMT and other models of translation, suggesting that there are many gains to be had if the SMT community were to open up more to the other MT paradigms.

This paper studies the problem of machine translation in the field of electrical engineering and fuses the multi-layer vectors at the encoder side of the model. On this basis, the decoder unit of the translation model is improved, and a multi-attention mechanism translation model based on vector fusion is proposed, which improves the ability of the model to extract features and achieves a better translation effect on Chinese-English translation tasks. The experimental results show that the BLEU (bilingual evaluation understudy) value of the improved translation system in the field of electrical engineering has increased by 0.15-1.58 percentage points.

TI Not by chance. Russian aspect in rule-based machine translation
SO RUSSIAN LINGUISTICS
AB The aim of this paper is twofold: it illustrates the benefits of rule-based instead of statistical machine translation, and it provides a starting point for the machine translation of the Russian aspect into English. Rule-based machine translation is still promising, from both a computational and theoretical point of view, because by implementing rules on the computer theoretical assumptions concerning linguistic structures can be verified and improved. This will be shown using the example of the category of aspect, which is one of the main challenges for machine translation from Russian to English. A small corpus study on the translation of Russian sentences with verbs in the past tense (perfective and imperfective) by human translators shows that three-quarters of Russian verbs (both imperfective and perfective) are translated by English simple past forms. While this results from language internal markedness relations, the translation of the remaining 25 % requires an in-depth analysis of the various interpretations possible for the Russian aspect. We propose a semantic analysis based on which rules for the interpretation and translation of Russian aspect in a machine translation system can be derived. Their implementation in the machine translation system A-TAP is shown in this paper using two test cases as examples.

AB This paper examines machine bias in language technology. Machine bias can affect machine learning algorithms when language models trained on large corpora include biased human decisions or reflect historical or social inequities, e.g. regarding gender and race. The focus of the paper is on gender bias in machine translation and we discuss a study conducted on Icelandic translations in the translation systems Google Translate and Velthornyoing.is. The results show a pattern which corresponds to certain societal ideas about gender. For example it seems to depend on the meaning of adjectives referring to people whether they appear in the masculine or feminine form. Adjectives describing positive personality traits were more likely to appear in masculine gender whereas the negative ones frequently appear in feminine gender. However, the opposite applied to appearance related adjectives. These findings unequivocally demonstrate the importance of being vigilant towards technology so as not to maintain societal inequalities and outdated views - especially in today's digital world.

We propose an n-gram based translation model that can be used for listing-to-query translation. We then leverage the query forms translated from listings to improve language modeling. The translation model is trained in an unsupervised manner using a set of transcribed voice search queries. Experiments show that the translation approach yielded drastic perplexity reductions compared with a baseline language model where no translation is applied.

AB Recently, Machine Translation (MT) has become a quite popular technology in everyday use through Web services such as Google Translate. Although the different MT approaches provide good results, none of them exploits contextual information like Named Entity (NE) to help user comprehension.
   In this paper, we present NERITS, a machine translation mashup system using semantic annotation from Wikimeta and Linked Open Data (LOD) provided by DBpedia. The goal of the application is to propose a cross-lingual translation by providing detailed information extracted from DBpedia about persons, locations and organizations in the mother tongue of the user. This helps at scaling the traditional multilingual task of machine translation to cross-lingual applications.

AB Nowadays a typical Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model generates translations from left to right as a linear sequence, during which latent syntactic structures of the target sentences are not explicitly concerned. Inspired by the success of using syntactic knowledge of target language for improving statistical machine translation, in this paper we propose a novel Sequence-to-Dependency Neural Machine Translation (SD-NMT) method, in which the target word sequence and its corresponding dependency structure are jointly constructed and modeled, and this structure is used as context to facilitate word generations. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on Chinese-English and Japanese-English translation tasks.

We consider the existing translation evaluation metrics, methods, and algorithms for improving the quality of translation. The developed methods and algorithms for evaluation and improvement of translation quality are presented in the article. We also determined a set of conditions necessary for automatic search for the optimal variant of hybrid machine translation of a text at the grapheme level, including maximum, minimum, and average values of translation lengths, reverse translations, and edit distances between pairs of texts that have the same meaning. We also did a correlation analysis of the compliance of the results of evaluation of the quality of translations of scientific and technical texts with existing methods and the developed method based on reverse translation.

TI A Chaotic Neural Network Model for English Machine Translation Based on
   Big Data Analysis
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB In this paper, the chaotic neural network model of big data analysis is used to conduct in-depth analysis and research on the English translation. Firstly, under the guidance of the translation strategy of text type theory, the translation generated by the machine translation system is edited after translation, and then professionals specializing in computer and translation are invited to confirm the translation. After that, the errors in the translations generated by the machine translation system are classified based on the Double Quantum Filter-Muttahida Quami Movement (DQF-MQM) error type classification framework. Due to the characteristics of the source text as an informative academic text, long and difficult sentences, passive voice, and terminology translation are the main causes of machine translation errors. In view of the rigorous logic of the source text and the fixed language steps, this research proposes corresponding post-translation editing strategies for each type of error. It is suggested that translators should maintain the logic of the source text by converting implicit connections into explicit connections, maintain the academic accuracy of the source text by adding subjects and adjusting the word order to deal with the passive voice, and deal with semitechnical terms by appropriately selecting word meanings in postediting. The errors of machine translation in computer science and technology text abstracts are systematically categorized, and the corresponding post-translation editing strategies are proposed to provide reference suggestions for translators in this field, to improve the quality of machine translation in this field.

The result is an improved phrase-based multi-system MT system that allows improves the quality of the MT output compared to the baseline while taking much more time to produce the final output. The proposed approach shows improvement up to +3.34 points in BLEU score compared to the baselines and up to +3.61 BLEU compared to related research.

AB The creation of machine translation technologies is currently an objective reality. Information technologies that already exist today that can be used to optimize translation are quite diverse. At this stage of computer-assisted translation (CAT) development, the issues of integrating artificial intelligence and translation activities (digital translation) and the use of neural machine translation (NMT) are relevant. Both technologies are quite effective, although they do not rule out the existence of certain difficulties in their use. So, for example, for a neural network, the difficulties are the translation of rare words, phraseological units, etc.
   Machine translation is a topic in which modern neural network algorithms have indeed achieved impressive successes. Thanks to advances in text generation, in the construction of vector representations of sentences that consider shades of meaning, as well as the use of the attention mechanism, modern machine translation tools often produce results that are almost indistinguishable from human ones. This paper describes the experiment carried out by the author to confirm the conclusions obtained from the results of his research.

AB How to effectively adapt neural machine translation (NMT) models according to emerging cases without retraining? Despite the great success of neural machine translation, updating the deployed models online remains a challenge. Existing non-parametric approaches that retrieve similar examples from a database to guide the translation process are promising but are prone to overfit the retrieved examples. However, non-parametric methods are prone to overfit the retrieved examples. In this work, we propose to learn Kernel-Smoothed Translation with Example Retrieval (KSTER), an effective approach to adapt neural machine translation models online. Experiments on domain adaptation and multi-domain machine translation datasets show that even without expensive retraining, KSTER is able to achieve improvement of 1.1 to 1.5 BLEU scores over the best existing online adaptation methods. The code and trained models are released at https://github.com/jiangqn/KSTER.

AB We propose a hybrid technique on handling the utterance distluency for Indonesian-English machine translation. The handling is done as the preprocessing in the machine translation system. In the preprocessing, we classify utterance distluency using a combination of statistical based technique and rule based technique. We used 4 types of distluency such as filler (for filled pause and discourse marker), rough copy, noncopy, and stutter. For the statistical based, we employ lexical features and CRF algorithm. In the experiment on the distluency classification, we compared the statistical based only method and the hybrid method. The experimental result has shown that using a hybrid method achieved higher performance than only the statistical based method. The distluency classification result is employed in the machine translation and enhance the BLEU score of Indonesian-English machine translation.

The sense similarity scores are computed by using the vector space model. We then apply the algorithms to statistical machine translation by computing the sense similarity between the source and target side of translation rule pairs. Similarity scores are used as additional features of the translation model to improve translation performance. Significant improvements are obtained over a state-of-the-art hierarchical phrase-based machine translation system.

TI Rough set machine translation using deep structure and transfer learning
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
AB Machine translation is one of the parts of language processing within linguistic computing for automatic translation from one language to another. The paper introduces one of the most critical areas of soft computing and natural language processing, i.e. machine translation technique that is based on deep model structure of rough sets with capability to transfer learning. A deep rough set learning is developed to support machine translation to recognize and translate tens of thousands of words/sentences automatically. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt aiming to use rough sets in machine translation rather than Arabic language translation. A deep information table is learned by assigning the morphemes-similar objects with similar learning complexities into same class and it can identify the inter-related learning tasks automatically. To account for the differences among source-languages domains, we proposed a partial transfer learning scheme in which only part of source information is transferred. The experiments have demonstrated that the proposed model can achieve competitive results and significantly outperformed other methods for translation on both accuracy rates and the efficiency for machine translation.

TI Analysing terminology translation errors in statistical and neural
   machine translation
SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB Terminology translation plays a critical role in domain-specific machine translation (MT). Phrase-based statistical MT (PB-SMT) has been the dominant approach to MT for the past 30 years, both in academia and industry. Neural MT (NMT), an end-to-end learning approach to MT, is steadily taking the place of PB-SMT. In this paper, we conduct comparative qualitative evaluation and comprehensive error analysis on terminology translation in PB-SMT and NMT in two translation directions: English-to-Hindi and Hindi-to-English. To the best of our knowledge, there is no gold standard available for evaluating terminology translation quality in MT. For this reason we select an evaluation test set from a legal domain corpus and create a gold standard for evaluating terminology translation in MT. We also propose an error typology taking the terminology translation errors in MT into consideration. We translate sentences of the test set with our MT systems and terminology translations are manually classified as per the error typology. We evaluate the MT system's performance on terminology translation, and demonstrate our findings, unraveling strengths, weaknesses, and similarities of PB-SMT and NMT in the area of term translation.

According to the BLEU score metrics, the described approach allows to increase the quality of machine translation on average by 0.1 and reduce postprocessing time due to the identification of idioms and words with context-dependent meanings by translation. The experiment data base of the study was built upon online available pairs of texts that cover the events of FIFA World Cup 2018 and well-known idioms.

TI Slavic languages in phrase-based statistical machine translation: a
   survey
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW
AB The demand for translations is increasing at a rate far beyond the capacity of professional translators. It is too difficult, time consuming and expensive to translate everything from scratch in each language. Machine translation offers a solution, as it provides translation automatically. Until recently, statistical machine translation has proved to be one of the most successful approaches. However, a new approach to machine translation based on neural networks has emerged with promising results. The present paper concerns phrase-based statistical machine translation, an area that has been extensively studied in the literature. The translation system consists of many components built on the premise of probabilities. Each component is described separately. Although high quality translation systems have been developed for certain language pairs, there is still a large number of languages that cause many translation errors. Languages with a rich morphology pose an especially difficult challenge for research. We address one group of morphologically rich languages: Slavic languages, which constitute a relatively homogeneous family of languages characterized by rich, inflectional morphology. The present paper offers a comprehensive survey of approaches to coping with Slavic languages in different aspects of statistical machine translation. We observe that the interest of the community in research of more difficult languages is increasing and we believe that the translation quality of those languages will reach the level of practical use in the near future.

TI Machine Translation using Semantic Web Technologies: A Survey
SO JOURNAL OF WEB SEMANTICS
AB A large number of machine translation approaches have recently been developed to facilitate the fluid migration of content across languages. However, the literature suggests that many obstacles must still be dealt with to achieve better automatic translations. One of these obstacles is lexical and syntactic ambiguity. A promising way of overcoming this problem is using Semantic Web technologies. This article presents the results of a systematic review of machine translation approaches that rely on Semantic Web technologies for translating texts. Overall, our survey suggests that while Semantic Web technologies can enhance the quality of machine translation outputs for various problems, the combination of both is still in its infancy.

AB Machine translation for patent texts is a worldwide concern and more than 25% of the sentences in patent texts are comparative sentences. So the research on identification and transformation of comparative sentences in patent texts is very significant and can contribute to the patent Chinese-English machine translation. On the issue of identification of comparative sentences, there are some studies basically using statistical methods, but almost no study applies the rule-based method and no study uses the results of identification for Chinese-English machine translation. In this paper, based on HNC (Hierarchical Network of Concepts) theory, we applied the method based on rules to study the identification and transformation of comparative sentences in patent texts. Experiment shows us that the method can improve the performance of patent machine translation effectually.

AB In this paper we apply the round-tripping algorithm to Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) for making effective use of monolingual data to tackle the training data scarcity. In this approach, the outbound-trip (forward) and inbound-trip (backward) translation tasks make a closed loop, and produce informative feedback to train the translation models. Based on this produced feedback we iteratively update the forward and backward translation models. The experimental results show that translation quality is improved for Persiaw <--> Spanish translation task.

TI The death of the translator in machine translation A bilingual poetry
   project
SO TARGET-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB This paper explores the notion of the death of the Translator, inspired by Barthes' formulation of the death of the Author. It argues that the death of the Translator is caused by a loss of human agency in translation and is therefore most clearly exemplified in machine translation. Based on an avant-garde bilingual poetry project by a Taiwanese poet, the paper demonstrates that machine translation can produce unexpected new meanings through unpredictable routes of semantic and syntactic divergences from the source text. The poet's use of transparency as physical medium and of machine translation as mediator raises the following questions: does translation actually allow us to 'read through' a source text? If so, to what extent is such translation 'transparent'? How should we even come to terms with the concept of 'transparency' with respect to the meaning of a literary text in translation? The paper argues that in the bilingual project in question, machine translation plays the crucial function of bringing the reader's attention back to the target language by way of delaying/blocking comprehension, hence rendering the corporeality of the target language 'transparent'.

AB This paper intends to illustrate the didactic potential of Python-based Jupyter notebooks in teaching translation technology, machine translation in particular, to translation students. It discusses the basic makeup of Jupyter notebooks and shows how these notebooks can be set up for students who have had little to no prior exposure to the Python programming language. Then, the paper discusses the general didactic benefits of Jupyter notebooks for both students and lecturers in a translation studies context. It shows how students can interact with these notebooks, which translation technological and translation-oriented natural language processing (NLP) concepts can be taught using them and to what extent interaction with these notebooks can help students understand, in a very general way, some basic principles of (NLP-oriented) Python programming. Finally, the paper presents the results of a pilot study on the use of Jupyter notebooks in a machine translation course in an MA programme in specialised translation.

   translation styles
SO BABEL-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE LA TRADUCTION-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF
   TRANSLATION
AB The rapid development of neural machine translation systems and the emergence of the e-book have broadened the scope of text types that can be translated by machines. At the early stage of the machine's infiltration into the translation field, target texts were mainly technical texts such as patents, instruction manuals, etc. Literary texts have been considered as the last bastion of human translation because the machine translation (MT) has produced word-for-word translation, unsuitable for literary texts with distinct stylistic elements. However, it turns out that the field of literary translation was not immune to the rise of MT. Style is one of the critical elements in literary texts, but it has been dismissed in the existing MT post-editing guidelines. Therefore, this research attempts to provide methodological ideas about how to come up with a machine translation post-editing guideline (MTPE) for style improvement especially for language pairs with divergent syntax and semantics like English and Korean. First, the linguistic and cultural differences in writing styles are sorted out based on previous research. Second, the different ways in which human translators address writing style are investigated. Third, the strategies that human translators employ in their translations are applied to machine translation post-editing to demonstrate how the strategies can be incorporated into English-Korean MTPE to improve style. This preliminary research would lay the groundwork for refining post-editing style guidelines and for accumulating manually post-edited data for style improvement, which would be conducive to building and customizing automatic post-editing systems.

AB Machine translation between closely related languages is easier than between language pairs that are not related with each other. Having many parts of their grammars and vocabularies in common reduces the amount of effort needed to develop a translation system between related languages. A translation system that makes a morphological analysis supported by simpler translation rules and context dependent bilingual dictionaries may suffice most of the time. Usually a semantic analysis may not be needed. This paper presents a machine translation system from Turkish to Crimean Tatar that uses finite state techniques for the translation process. By developing a machine translation system between Turkish and Crimean Tatar, we propose a sample model for translation between close pairs of languages. The system we developed takes a Turkish sentence, analyses all the words morphologically, translates the grammatical and context dependent structures, translates the root words and finally morphologically generates the Crimean Tatar text. Most of the time, at least one of the outputs is a true translation of the input sentence.

TI Improved Unsupervised Neural Machine Translation with Semantically
   Weighted Back Translation for Morphologically Rich and Low Resource
   Languages
SO NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS
AB The effective method to utilize monolingual data and enhance the performance of neural machine translation models is back-translation. Iteratively conducting back-translation can further improve the performance of the translation model. In back-translation where, pseudo sentence pairs are generated to train the translation systems with a reconstruction loss, but all the pseudo sentence pairs are not of good quality, which can severely impact the performance of neural machine translation systems. This paper proposes an approach to unsupervised learning for neural machine translation with weighted back translation as part of the training process, as it provides more weight to good pseudo-parallel sentence pairs. The weight is calculated as the round-trip semantic similarity score for each pseudo-parallel sentence. We overcome the limitation of earlier lexical metric-based approaches, especially in the case of morphologically rich languages. Experimental results show an improvement of up to around 0.7% BLEU score over the baseline paper for morphologically rich language (English-Hindi, English-Tamil, and English-Telugu) and 0.3% BLEU score for low resource Hindi-Kangri language.

TI What to expect from Neural Machine Translation: a practical in-class
   translation evaluation exercise
SO INTERPRETER AND TRANSLATOR TRAINER
AB Machine translation is currently undergoing a paradigm shift from statistical to neural network models. Neural machine translation (NMT) is difficult to conceptualise for translation students, especially without context. This article describes a short in-class evaluation exercise to compare statistical and neural MT, including details of student results and follow-on discussions. As part of this exercise, students carry out evaluations of two types of MT output using three translation quality assurance (TQA) metrics: adequacy, post-editing productivity, and a simple error taxonomy. In this way, the exercise introduces NMT, TQA, and post-editing. In our module, a more detailed explanation of NMT followed the evaluation.
   The rise of NMT has been accompanied by a good deal of media hyperbole about neural networks and machine learning, some of which has suggested that several professions, including translation, may be under threat. This evaluation exercise is intended to empower the students, and help them understand the strengths and weaknesses of this new technology. Students' findings using several language pairs mirror those from published research, such as improved fluency and word order in NMT output, with some unpredictable problems of omission and mistranslation.

TI Research on Uyghur-Chinese Neural Machine Translation Based on the
   Transformer at Multistrategy Segmentation Granularity
SO MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB In recent years, machine translation based on neural networks has become the mainstream method in the field of machine translation, but there are still challenges of insufficient parallel corpus and sparse data in the field of low resource translation. Existing machine translation models are usually trained on word-granularity segmentation datasets. However, different segmentation granularities contain different grammatical and semantic features and information. Only considering word granularity will restrict the efficient training of neural machine translation systems. Aiming at the problem of data sparseness caused by the lack of Uyghur-Chinese parallel corpus and complex Uyghur morphology, this paper proposes a multistrategy segmentation granular training method for syllables, marked syllable, words, and syllable word fusion and targets traditional recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks; the disadvantage of the network is to build a Transformer Uyghur-Chinese Neural Machine Translation model based entirely on the multihead self-attention mechanism. In CCMT2019, dimension results on Uyghur-Chinese bilingual datasets show that the effect of multiple translation granularity training method is significantly better than the rest of granularity segmentation translation systems, while the Transformer model can obtain higher BLEU value than Uyghur-Chinese translation model based on Self-Attention-RNN.

This essay will synthesize systematic research on the role of machine translation conducted in the field of educational linguistics. After describing approaches developed that promote the integration of machine translation into language learning environments, the essay will briefly outline lingering concerns associated with the integration of MT tools into educational settings. We will propose future R&D priorities that can generate products based on existing technologies that have the potential to support language learners more optimally compared to existing machine translation tools. We conclude that an acknowledgment of the difficulties of MT tools to handle socio-culturally complex source text would pave the way for the development of MT-based pedagogical tools.

AB From many years, machine translation and computational linguistic research community has given immense attention towards the development of machine translation techniques. In order to fulfill the goal of machine translation "translation without losing meaning", a lot of translation methods have been proposed. All of these translation methods differ in their theories and implementation strategies. Although some basic rules of translation are same but many of them vary with the selection of language pair. While concerning with the scientific text, every science domain has thousands of terminologies. Translation of these terminologies according to the domain boosts the performance of translation. Translation of scientific text is ignored in the literature, as it needs more effort and expertise of both domain and language are required. In this research, we have proposed an effective scientific text translator for English to Urdu to cope with the challenge of scientific text translation. This method tags and translate the terms according to the domain. We have introduced a term tagger for tagging terms. The system can work for any domain but for experimental purpose we have selected the domain of computer science. System is evaluated on self-generated corpus of computer science. It is also compared with the existing translators to demonstrate the dominance of proposed translator as compared to the competitor. The comparative results of proposed approach and existing are shown in the form of tables.

This paper aims to examine the primary factors influencing the work of human translation combined with translation technology tools. Therefore, the paper provides an overview of the translation and language industries and insights into translation industry standards, quality concerns and the most frequently used tools, as they are aspects that influence and condition the translator's work today. The final and main section in this work emphasizes an increasingly common trend in translation: a human-assisted machine translation model based on the post-edition of the output from machine translation systems. By analyzing market studies, surveys and papers on the aforementioned aspects, this article confirms that the role of human translators in technology-driven translation processes will be as central in the future as it is today.

AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) attracts an intensification of research efforts in recent years. The claim that the quality of machine translation is matching human translator requires extraordinary evidences. It is almost certain that machine translation so far cannot replace or exceed human translator, but what is the gap between NMT and professional translator? We truly investigate the quality difference between the well-known Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) and professional translators at the document level. We build an evaluation model based on the discourse cohesion theory to compare the usage of grammatical and semantical devices in Chinese-to-English translations including reference, substitution, ellipsis, conjunction and lexical cohesion. The evaluation results show that there is a significant gap between NMT and professional translator in document translations. In a comprehensive point of view, for the professional translator, translation is a kind of arts; while for the computers, it is still a kind of technologies.

TI Source sentence simplification for statistical machine translation
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB Long sentences with complex syntax and long-distance dependencies pose difficulties for machine translation systems. Short sentences, on the other hand, are usually easier to translate. We study the potential of addressing this mismatch using text simplification: given a simplified version of the full input sentence, can we use it in addition to the full input to improve translation? We show that the spaces of original and simplified translations can be effectively combined using translation lattices and compare two decoding approaches to process both inputs at different levels of integration. We demonstrate on source-annotated portions of WMT test sets and on top of strong baseline systems combining hierarchical and neural translation for two language pairs that source simplification can help to improve translation quality.

TI On the Use of Mouse Actions at the Character Level
SO INFORMATION
AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has improved performance in several tasks up to human parity. However, many companies still use Computer-Assisted Translation (CAT) tools to achieve perfect translation, as well as other tools. Among these tools, we find Interactive-Predictive Neural Machine Translation (IPNMT) systems, whose main feature is facilitating machine-human interactions. In the most conventional systems, the human user fixes a translation error by typing the correct word, sending this feedback to the machine which generates a new translation that satisfies it. In this article, we remove the necessity of typing to correct translations by using the bandit feedback obtained from the cursor position when the user performs a Mouse Action (MA). Our system generates a new translation that fixes the error using only the error position. The user can perform multiple MAs at the same position if the error is not fixed, each of which increases the correction probability. One of the main objectives in the IPNMT field is reducing the required human effort, in order to optimize the translation time. With the proposed technique, an 84% reduction in the number of keystrokes performed can be achieved, while still generating perfect translations. For this reason, we recommend the use of this technique in IPNMT systems.

AB A translation process, as a critical part of a machine translation, can be put simply as a process of decoding the meaning of the source text and re-encoding the meaning into the target language. Unfortunately, most of the translation process requires complex operations and in-depth knowledge of the languages in order to give a good quality translation. This study proposes a better approach, which does not require indepth knowledge of the linguistic properties of the languages, but it produces a good quality translation. This statistical machine translation uses parallel corpus and statistical machine learning for English and Bahasa Indonesia. This study also evaluated 28 different parameters in IRSTLM language modeling and proposes a sequence evaluation mechanism based on a maximum evaluation of each parameter in producing a good quality translation based on NIST and BLEU. The pruning process, user interface, and the personalization of translation have a very important role in implementing of this machine translation. The result is quite promising. It shows that pruning process increases of the translation process time. The particular sequence value parameter in translation process, it also has a better performance than the other method using in-depth linguistic knowledge approaches. All these processes, including the process of parsing from a stand-alone mode to an online mode, are also discussed in detail.

TI Cross-lingual text similarity exploiting neural machine translation
   models
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE
AB This article studies cross-lingual text similarity using neural machine translation models. A straightforward approach based on machine translation is to use translated text so as to make the problem monolingual. Another possible approach is to use intermediate states of machine translation models as recently proposed in the related work, which could avoid propagation of translation errors. We aim at improving both approaches independently and then combine the two types of information, that is, translations and intermediate states, in a learning-to-rank framework to compute cross-lingual text similarity. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalisability of our approach, we conduct empirical experiments on English-Japanese and English-Hindi translation corpora for a cross-lingual sentence retrieval task. It is demonstrated that our approach using translations and intermediate states outperforms other neural network-based approaches and is even comparable with a strong baseline based on a state-of-the-art machine translation system.

AB Translator's Workbench PIVOT/JE (translation from Japanese to English) and PIVOT/EJ (translation from English to Japanese) are translation assisting systems developed to reduce translation costs. Introduction of PIVOT into a LAN environment, which enables a group of people working at one time to share dictionaries and other resources, is reported to be cost effective.   Some of the unique features of PIVOT are the following: (1)It has adopted the pivot method of translation, which assumes interlingua, a universal semantic representation.   (2)It supports pre-edit by detecting expressions that are difficult for the machine to translate, and providing functions to help paraphrase them.     In this paper, the fundamentals of Machine Translation (MT) are introduced. They include the system configuration, the translation mechanism, and an example of the MT-based translation process. Also, utilization of the MT service via a network is discussed.

TI MACHINE TRANSLATION AND POETRY. THE CASE OF ENGLISH AND PORTUGUESE
SO ILHA DO DESTERRO-A JOURNAL OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE LITERATURES IN ENGLISH
   AND CULTURAL STUDIES
AB This article sets out to analyse the translations into Portuguese of three poems written I English, "A Letter is a Joy of Earth" by Emily Dickinson, "To a Stranger" by Walt Whitman and "Sandra" by Charles Bukowski. Three translations by three human translators, Geir Campos, Pedro Gonzaga and Jorge de Sena, are compared to the translations made by Google Translate in order to evaluate machine translation quality This research shows that machine translations are less "ludicrous" than some would think and are in fact quite acceptable. In the cases investigated, machine translations are sometimes as acceptable as the ones made by the professional translators, and they could even help them to make mistakes through a lack of attention or by ignoring all the possibilities in the case of polysemous words. The Google translations are obviously plainer and there are a number of mistakes in them of the kind one expects: wrong concordances, wrong interpretations of polysemous words, wrong interpretation of gendered words. However, overall the results are far more satisfying than forecast. Google Translate, or similar programmes, may help translators with different, albeit sound alternatives. Additionally, machine translations provide a useful tool to analyse the idiosyncrasies of translators.

AB Automated machine translation software and services have become widely available and increasingly popular. Due to the complexity and flexibility of natural languages, automated testing and quality assessment of this type of software is extremely challenging, especially in the absence of a human oracle or a reference translation. Furthermore, even if a reference translation is available, some major evaluation metrics, such as BLEU, are not reliable on short sentences, the type of sentence now prevailing on the Internet. To alleviate these problems, we have been using a metamorphic testing technique to test machine translation services in a fully automatic way without the involvement of any human assessor or reference translation. This article reports on our progress, and presents some interesting preliminary experimental results that reveal quality issues of English-to-Chinese translations in two mainstream machine translation services: Google Translate and Microsoft Translator. These preliminary results demonstrate the usefulness and potential of metamorphic testing for applications in the natural language processing domain.

Within this research we apply state of the art statistical machine translation techniques to the West-Slavic languages group. We do West-Slavic languages classification and choose Polish as a representative candidate for our research. The experiments are conducted on written and spoken texts, which characteristics are defined as well. The machine translation systems are trained within West-Slavic group as well as into English. Translation systems and data sets are analyzed, prepared and adapted for the needs of West-Slavic-* translation. To evaluate the effects of different preparations on translation results, we conducted experiments and used the BLEU, NIST and TER metrics. By defining proper translation parameters to morphologically rich languages we improve the translation quality and draw the conclusions.

TI The Machine Translation of Literature: Implications for Translation
   Pedagogy
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN LEARNING
AB The recent years have witnessed an increasing importance of machine translation systems due to the prolific production on online texts in different disciplines and furthermore, the inability of traditional translation methods in addressing translation needs all over the world. It is even argued that training on translation tools should be integrated into translation pedagogies and ultimately, courses should be provided for students and professionals. In spite of the effectiveness of translation tools and systems in providing solutions in relation to different disciplines and text genres, the usability and reliability of such systems in terms of literary texts, however, is still highly controversial. Many critics and educators still underestimate the usefulness of the machine translation systems in literature, which could be partially attributed to the unique nature of the language of the literary texts. The issue has its pedagogical implications to translation instruction due to the needs to integrate emerging technologies in teaching and learning practices. For proper use of translation technologies in educational contexts, these need to be well evaluated. For this purpose, this study evaluates the usefulness of applying machine translation systems to literature with the purpose of identifying the challenges that may have negative impacts on the reliability of machine translation systems. In order to do this this, two translation systems are selected, namely, Google Translate and Q Translate. By way of illustration, the study is based on a corpus of two English short stories. The study is based on two prose fiction texts. The first is J. K. Rowling's novel Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. The second is Edgar Allan Poe's short story The Black Cat. Automatic translations generated by the two machine translation systems were compared to human made Arabic translations with the purpose of identifying the problems within these translations. Results indicate that different lexical, structural, and pragmatic errors are encountered by users which negatively impact the reliability of these translations. Educators and translation instructors need to reflect on the challenges of machine translation systems in relation to literature. Software developers need also to address the problems faced by users and students in the translation from and into the Arabic language.

AB In allusion to the syntactic differences between Chinese and Naxi language, the thesis presents a tree-to-tree method of Chinese-Naxi machine translation based on subtree alignment. In this method, we define a subtree alignment model, providing its inference probability, and solve the alignment missing problem of Chinese-Naxi alignment by updating nodes (insert or delete). And then we train the subtree alignment model by EM algorithm, merging subtree alignment to the translation model. Finally we extract the template of Chinese-Naxi translation, adopting the extraction algorithm based on matrix, and implement the Chinese-Naxi machine translation. Result of the contrast experiment shows that, compared to the Chinese-Naxi machine translation method based on tree-to-tree translation, the translation accuracy increased after importing subtree alignment.

TI Optimization of English Machine Translation by Deep Neural Network under

SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB To improve the function of machine translation to adapt to global language translation, the work takes deep neural network (DNN) as the basic theory, carries out transfer learning and neural network translation modeling, and optimizes the word alignment function in machine translation performance. First, the work implements a deep learning translation network model for English translation. On this basis, the neural machine translation model is designed under transfer learning. The random shielding method is introduced to implement the language training model, and the machine translation is slightly adjusted as the goal of transfer learning, thereby improving the semantic understanding ability in translation performance. Meanwhile, the work design introduces the method of word alignment optimization and optimizes the performance of word alignment in the transformer system by using word corpus. The experimental results show that the proposed method reduces the average alignment error rate by 8.1%, 24.4%, and 22.1% in EnRo (English-Roman), EnGe (English-German), and EnFr (English-French), respectively, compared with the previous algorithms. Compared with the designed optimization method, the word alignment error rate is lower than that of traditional methods. The modeling and optimization method is feasible, which can effectively solve the problems of insufficient information utilization, large parameter scale, and difficult storage in the process of machine translation. Additionally, it provides a feasible idea and direction for the optimization and improvement in neural machine translation (NMT) system.

TI A Novel Beam Search to Improve Neural Machine Translation for
   English-Chinese
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is an end-to-end learning approach for automated translation, overcoming the weaknesses of conventional phrase-based translation systems. Although NMT based systems have gained their popularity in commercial translation applications, there is still plenty of room for improvement. Being the most popular search algorithm in NMT, beam search is vital to the translation result. However, traditional beam search can produce duplicate or missing translation due to its target sequence selection strategy. Aiming to alleviate this problem, this paper proposed neural machine translation improvements based on a novel beam search evaluation function. And we use reinforcement learning to train a translation evaluation system to select better candidate words for generating translations. In the experiments, we conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our methods. CASIA corpus and the 1,000,000 pairs of bilingual corpora of NiuTrans are used in our experiments. The experiment results prove that the proposed methods can effectively improve the English to Chinese translation quality.

We consider a variety of machine learning techniques, including state-of-the-art structured prediction methods. Techniques are compared and evaluated on a Chinese-English corpus, a language pair known for the high reordering characteristics which cannot be adequately captured with current models. In the reordering classification task, the method significantly outperforms the baseline against which it was tested, and further, when integrated as a component of the state-of-the-art machine translation system, MOSES, it achieves improvement in translation results.

In view of the complex and changeable English forms, the large difference between Chinese and English word order, and insufficient Chinese-English parallel corpus resources, this paper uses deep learning to complete the conversion between Chinese and English. The research focus of this paper is how to use language pairs with rich parallel corpus resources to improve the performance of Chinese-English neural machine translation, that is, to use multi-task learning to train neural machine translation models. Moreover, this research proposes a low-resource neural machine translation method based on weight sharing, which uses the weight-sharing method to improve the performance of Chinese-English low-resource neural machine translation. In addition, this study designs a control experiment to analyze the effectiveness of this study model. The research results show that the model proposed in this paper has a certain effect.

Machine translation can be broken into seven main steps namely- token generation, analyzing morphology, lexeme, tagging Part of Speech, chunking, parsing, and disambiguation in words. Morphological analysis plays a major role when translating Indian languages to develop accurate parts of speech taggers and word sense. The paper presents various machine translation methods used by different researchers for Indian languages along with their performance and drawbacks. Further, the paper concentrates on parts of speech (POS) tagging in Marathi dialect using various methods such as rule-based tagging, unigram, bigram, and more. After careful study, it is concluded that for machine translation, parts of speech tagging is a major step. Also, for the Marathi language, the Hidden Markov Model gives the best results for parts of speech tagging with an accuracy of 93% which can be further improved according to the dataset.

AB In this paper we discuss a user-centered method for qualitative comparison of machine translation systems based on rankings of system output. System ranking requires no reference transcript, which can be expensive to generate and difficult to define for spoken language input. Ranking can be performed by monolingual users with no training in machine translation evaluation. We present results of experiments ranking four Arabic-to-English and three Mandarin-to-English machine translation systems processing spoken language transcripts with word error rates of 20-30%.

AB Word - to - phrase machine translation (WPMT) is a model for lexical gap solving. Generally, lexical gap is an absent of word in a particular language. In a word-to-phrase model, words in source language could be replaced by target language phrases. This approach is very helpful for English- Vietnamese rule-based machine translation. The phrase replacement changes target sentence to unpredictable structure. This work develops three algorithms for WPMT: The insert algorithm applies phrase replacement, pruning algorithm simplifies target structure and moving algorithm keeps correct order of components in Vietnamese sentence.

SO MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Machine translation quality estimation is an important task in natural language processing. Unlike traditional automatic machine translation evaluation methods, the quality of machine translation is evaluated by the translation quality estimation method without using manual reference translation. In view of the fact that the feature extraction of current sentence-level machine translation quality estimation relies heavily on linguistic analysis, which leads to insufficient generalization ability and restricts the performance of subsequent support vector regression algorithm, it is proposed to extract the features of sentence vectors by using contextual word prediction model and matrix decomposition model in deep learning, and combine them with the features of recurrent neural network language model to improve the correlation between automatic estimation of translation quality and manual evaluation. The experimental results on WMT15 and WMT16 translation quality estimation subtask data sets show that the performance statistics of the method of extracting sentence vector features by adopting context word prediction model are consistently superior to that of the traditional Quest method and continuous space language model sentence vector feature extraction method. It reveals that the proposed feature extraction method not only requires no linguistic analysis, but also significantly improves the effect of translation quality estimation.

TI Neural and statistical machine translation: perception and productivity
SO TRADUMATICA-TRADUCCIO I TECNOLOGIES DE LA INFORMACIO I LA COMUNICACIO
AB The machine translation field has changed completely due to the many advances seen in neural machine translation (NMT) engines, especially in comparison with the results that were obtained with statistical machine translation (SMT) engines. So, it is necessary to review not only how MT is used but also how it is perceived by the end users, the translators. The main objective of this study is to determine the perception and productivity of a group of translators using SMT and NMT systems in terms of time and edit distance. Via the TAUS Dynamic Quality platform, ten professional translators first evaluated raw machine translation segments from two different texts- a user guide and a marketing text- proposed by the Microsoft Translation Engine (SMT) and Google Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Six of the ten translators subsequently post-edited two productivity tests to determine time and edit distance. The results show that translators perceive the NMT system as more productive because, according to their perception, it would take less time to post-edit and would mean fewer editions. However, when comparing these results with those obtained in productivity tests, although the edit distance was shorter when using the SMT engine than with the NTM, the post-editing time is much longer for the neural engine.

TI Context-Aware Neural Machine Translation for Korean Honorific
   Expressions
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Neural machine translation (NMT) is one of the text generation tasks which has achieved significant improvement with the rise of deep neural networks. However, language-specific problems such as handling the translation of honorifics received little attention. In this paper, we propose a context-aware NMT to promote translation improvements of Korean honorifics. By exploiting the information such as the relationship between speakers from the surrounding sentences, our proposed model effectively manages the use of honorific expressions. Specifically, we utilize a novel encoder architecture that can represent the contextual information of the given input sentences. Furthermore, a context-aware post-editing (CAPE) technique is adopted to refine a set of inconsistent sentence-level honorific translations. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, honorific-labeled test data is required. Thus, we also design a heuristic that labels Korean sentences to distinguish between honorific and non-honorific styles. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms sentence-level NMT baselines both in overall translation quality and honorific translations.

AB This paper presents the syntactic and semantic method for English-Korean Machine Translation (MT) using ontology for Web-based MT system. We first build word class ontology from the English corpus and calculate the weight of relation between words in the same or different ontologies by counting the frequency of co-occurrence. With our constructed ontologies, we introduce the MT system model including the syntactic and semantic translation module. Each module translates the source language in different way. The syntactic translation module transforms the structure of English into Korean structure. The semantic translation module extracts an exact meaning of a word using ontologies. Through the both translation modules the source language is naturally translated into a target language.

AB Syntax has been shown a helpful clue in various natural language processing tasks including previous statistical machine translation and recurrent neural network based machine translation. However, since the state-of-the-art neural machine translation (NMT) has to be built on the Transformer based encoder, few attempts are found on such a syntax enhancement. Thus in this paper, we explore effective ways to introduce syntax into Transformer for better machine translation. We empirically compare two ways, positional encoding and input embedding, to exploit syntactic clues from dependency tree over source sentence. Our proposed methods have a merit keeping the architecture of Transformer unchanged, thus the efficiency of Transformer can be kept. The experimental results on IWSLT' 14 German-to-English and WMT14 English-to-German show that our method can yield advanced results over strong Transformer baselines.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Machine translation is one of the pioneer applications of natural language processing and artificial intelligence. Automatic evaluation of the translation performance of the machine translators is one of the most challenging tasks, as manual evaluation of large volumes of document translations is infeasible in practice. Thus, to facilitate the evaluation of translation performance automatically, several metrics have been introduced and utilised widely. Although these translation performance evaluation metrics cannot match the efficiency level of human evaluation, they are popularly employed in automatic evaluation of translation quality of texts across multifarious application domains. This article discusses three such widely used evaluation metrics - BLEU, METEOR, and TER, with relevant details by demonstrating step by step calculations. The main novelty of this article lies in the consideration of several example translations to present and clarify the calculation process of these three of the most popular evaluation metrics for measuring the performance or quality of machine translation. Moreover, the article presents a comparative analysis among these three metrics using two different datasets to reveal their similarities and distinctions in terms of behaviour.

Since English happens to be the dominant language in terms of content, and more than 90 percent of Indian speakers do not use English, a translation from the latter to the former is essential. This paper presents an initial attempt at creating a statistical English-Maithili Machine Translation (EMMT) system and a study of Machine Translation (MT) divergences and errors caused due to divergence.

AB When people communicate in their native languages using machine translation, they face various problems in constructing common ground. This study investigates the difficulties of constructing common ground when multiparty groups (consisting of more than two language communities) communicate using machine translation. We compose triads whose members come from three different language communities-China, Korea, and Japan-and compare their referential communication under two conditions: in their shared second language (English) and in their native languages using machine translation. Consequently, our study suggests the importance of not only grounding between speaker and addressee but also grounding between addressees in constructing effective machine-translation-mediated communication. Furthermore, to successfully build common ground between addressees, it seems important for them to be able to monitor what is going on between a speaker and other addressees.

AB In this paper, we investigate the problem of learning a machine translation model that can simultaneously translate sentences from one source language to multiple target languages. Our solution is inspired by the recently proposed neural machine translation model which generalizes machine translation as a sequence learning problem. We extend the neural machine translation to a multi-task learning framework which shares source language representation and separates the modeling of different target language translation. Our framework can be applied to situations where either large amounts of parallel data or limited parallel data is available. Experiments show that our multi-task learning model is able to achieve significantly higher translation quality over individually learned model in both situations on the data sets publicly available.

TI Assembling translations from multi-engine machine translation outputs
SO APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
AB In this paper, we present a hybrid architecture for developing a system combination model that works in three layers to achieve better translated outputs. In the first layer, we have various machine translation models (i.e. Neural Machine Translation (NMT), Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), etc.). In the second layer, the outputs of these models are combined to leverage the advantages of both the systems (i.e SMT and NMT systems) by using the statistical approach and neural-based approach. But each approach has some advantages and limitations. So, instead of selecting an individual combined system's output as the final one, we apply these outputs in the final layer to produce the target output by assigning appropriate preferences to SMT based and neural-based combinations. Though there are some techniques for system combination but no such approach exists which uses preferences from various system combination models (statistical and neural) for the purpose of better assembling. Empirical results show improved performance in the terms of translation accuracy. Our experiments on two benchmark datasets of English-Hindi and Hindi-English pairs show that the proposed model performs significantly better than the participating models. Apparently, the efficacy of proposed model is significantly better than the state-of-the art machine translation combination systems (6.10 and 4.69 BLEU points for English-to-Hindi, and Hindi-to-English, respectively).

All knowledge sources are treated as feature functions, which depend on the source language sentence, the target language sentence and possible hidden variables. This approach allows a baseline machine translation system to be extended easily by adding new feature functions. We show that a baseline statistical machine translation system is significantly improved using this approach.

In order to make full use of parallel sentences, we proposed dual knowledge distillation and bidirectional neural machine translation, leveraging one side information to boost the performance of another side. Our approach which only takes advantage of parallel corpora is supplementary to semisupervised technology e.g. back-translation.

AB Research in machine translation (MT) is developing at a rapid pace. However, most work in the community has focused on languages where large amounts of digital resources are available. In this study, we benchmark state of the art statistical and neural machine translation systems on two African languages which do not have large amounts of resources: Somali and Swahili. These languages are of social importance and serve as test-beds for developing technologies that perform reasonably well despite the low-resource constraint. Our findings suggest that statistical machine translation (SMT) and neural machine translation (NMT) can perform similarly in low-resource scenarios, but neural systems require more careful tuning to match performance. We also investigate how to exploit additional data, such as bilingual text harvested from the web, or user dictionaries; we find that NMT can significantly improve in performance with the use of these additional data. Finally, we survey the landscape of machine translation resources for the languages of Africa and provide some suggestions for promising future research directions.

AB Machine translation for low-resource languages faces a scientific problem of cross-language semantic paraphrasing in a lack of structured language resource. The exploration of this problem has important theoretical and application value and is also a challenging research hotspot at present. We address the specific low-resource machine translation issue from Indonesian to Chinese, propose a language resource extension method based on cognate parallel corpus, and train a modified neural machine translation (NMT) model by mixing parallel corpus from cognate language. This modified model achieved 20.30 BLEU4 score in the experiment of Indonesian-Chinese machine translation. The manual analysis after simple random sampling of experimental results finds that the effect of the modified NMT is comparable to that of the current Google translation. The experimental results prove that the cognate parallel corpus can improve the low-resource language NMT effectively, which mainly depends on the morphological similarity and semantic equivalence between the cognate languages.

AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a new technique for machine translation that has led to remarkable improvements compared to rule-based and statistical machine translation (SMT) techniques, by overcoming many of the weaknesses in the conventional techniques. We study and apply NMT techniques to create a system with multiple models which we then apply for six Indian language pairs. We compare the performances of our NMT models with our system using automatic evaluation metrics such as UNK Count, METEOR, F-Measure, and BLEU. We find that NMT techniques are very effective for machine translations of Indian language pairs. We then demonstrate that we can achieve good accuracy even using a shallow network; on comparing the performance of Google Translate on our test dataset, our best model outperformed Google Translate by a margin of 17 BLEU points on Urdu-Hindi, 29 BLEU points on Punjabi-Hindi, and 30 BLEU points on Gujarati-Hindi translations.

TI A Neural Machine Translation Model for Arabic Dialects That Utilizes
   Multitask Learning (MTL)
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB In this research article, we study the problem of employing a neural machine translation model to translate Arabic dialects to Modern Standard Arabic. The proposed solution of the neural machine translation model is prompted by the recurrent neural network-based encoder-decoder neural machine translation model that has been proposed recently, which generalizes machine translation as sequence learning problems. We propose the development of a multitask learning (MTL) model which shares one decoder among language pairs, and every source language has a separate encoder. The proposed model can be applied to limited volumes of data as well as extensive amounts of data. Experiments carried out have shown that the proposed MTL model can ensure a higher quality of translation when compared to the individually learned model.

AB The generation of synthetic parallel corpora through the automatic translation of a monolingual text, a process known as back-translation, is a technique used to augment the amount of parallel data available for training Machine Translation systems and is known to improve translation quality and thus mitigate the lack of data for under-resourced language pairs. It is assumed that, when training on synthetic parallel data, the original monolingual data should be used at the target side and its translation at the source side, an assumption to be assessed. The contributions of this paper are twofold. We investigate the viability of using synthetic data to improve Neural Machine Translation for Portuguese-Chinese, an under-resourced pair of languages for which back-translation has yet to demonstrate its suitability. Besides, we seek to fill another gap in the literature by experimenting with synthetic data not only at the source side but also, alternatively, at the target side. While demonstrating that, when appropriately applied, back-translation can enhance Portuguese-Chinese Neural Machine Translation, the results reported in this paper also confirm the current assumption that using the original monolingual data at the source side outperforms using them at the target side.

AB Machine translation of human languages (for example, Japanese, English, Spanish) was one of the earliest goals of computer science research, and it remains an elusive one. Like many Al tasks, translation requires an immense amount of knowledge about language and the world. Recent approaches to machine translation frequently make use of text-based learning algorithms to fully or partially automate the acquisition of knowledge. This article illustrates these approaches.

   Translation
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
AB The quality of machine translation has increased remarkably over the past years, to the degree that it was found to be indistinguishable from professional human translation in a number of empirical investigations. We reassess Hassan et al.'s 2018 investigation into Chinese to English news translation, showing that the finding of human-machine parity was owed to weaknesses in the evaluation design-which is currently considered best practice in the field. We show that the professional human translations contained significantly fewer errors, and that perceived quality in human evaluation depends on the choice of raters, the availability of linguistic context, and the creation of reference translations. Our results call for revisiting current best practices to assess strong machine translation systems in general and human-machine parity in particular, for which we offer a set of recommendations based on our empirical findings.

   A software tool has been made to detect the edit distance between an orginal, raw machine translated text and its post-edited version. After detecting the edit operations (insertion, deletion, substitution and move) the editions have been (and will be further) analyzed to attempt to scale these editions according to frequency and gravity, so that later these results can be used for a tool for semi- or completely automatic post-editing.

AB Interactive Hybrid Strategies Machine Translation (IHSMT) system has just been designed to solve the translation problems. It forms a nice interdependent cooperation relation between human and machine by interaction. The system achieves hybrid strategy translation by synthesizing the rule-based reasoning and case-based reasoning, and therefore overcomes the demerits of single strategy. This paper has done some work on teaming mechanism of this system and proposes a teaming model of human-machine tracking and memorizing (HMTM). This model can store the information of human-machine interaction into memory base as case of machine teaming, and then gradually accumulate knowledge to improve the intelligence of MT system.

SO REVISTA DE LLENGUA I DRET-JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE AND LAW
AB Limited research has addressed the use of machine translation (MT) with legal texts, while recent data-driven MT approaches have improved quality. The present study reports on the results of an experiment involving 26 translators who post-edited and translated legal texts from English to Spanish. The results show that post-editing led to quality and time gains. The quality gains were statistically significant. Quality was determined using standardized scoring criteria from a professional association, and the time taken to complete the tasks was logged using Translog-II. Participants completed questionnaires before and after the experiment to gather data about demographic variables, previous experience, perceptions of MT post-editing and their reflections on the experiment. There was general agreement among the participants that the machine translation output was beneficial, particularly at the terminological and phraseological levels. However, participant variables related to years of experience or translation credentials did not reveal a demonstrable impact on quality and time.

AB Arabic is a Semitic language that arouses great interest in the field of machine translation. Given the large differences between morphology and grammar of Arabic and English, a statistical approach based on parallel corpus is privileged in the machine translation area. The statistical machine translation system's (SMT) quality is highly related to the preprocessing and post-processing steps of the English- Arabic parallel corpus used in the training phase. We present in this study a new alignment approach based on parallel corpus to involve some morphosyntactic information (stem, lemma and POS tags) for each word in this corpus. To evaluate our approach, we used the phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBSMT) system and then we tested it on the English-Arabic United Nations (UN) parallel corpus. The results obtained in the tests we carried out showed that this approach contributed to a significant improvement of the word alignment quality and consequently increase the BLEU score value of the translation.

SO APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
AB In statistical machine translation (SMT), re-ranking of huge amount of randomly generated translation hypotheses is one of the essential components in determining the quality of translation result. In this work, a novel re-ranking modelling framework called cascaded re-ranking modelling (CRM) is proposed by cascading a classification model and a regression model. The proposed CRM effectively and efficiently selects the good but rare hypotheses in order to alleviate simultaneously the issues of translation quality and computational cost. CRM can be partnered with any classifier such as support vector machines (SVM) and extreme learning machine (ELM). Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, experimental results show that CRM partnered with ELM (CRM-ELM) can raise at most 11.6% of translation quality over the popular benchmark Chinese-English corpus (IWSLT 2014) and French-English parallel corpus (WMT 2015) with extremely fast training time for huge corpus.

AB When writing formal articles many English writers often use long sentences with few punctuation marks. Since long sentences bring difficulty to machine translation systems, many researchers try to split them using punctuation marks before translation. But dealing with sentences with few punctuation marks is still intractable. In this paper we use a log linear model to insert commas into proper positions to split long sentence, trying to shorten the length of sub-sentence and benefit to machine translation. Experiment results show that our method can reasonably segment long sentences, and improve the quality of machine translation.

AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a new approach to machine translation that has made great progress in recent years. However, recent studies show that NMT generally produces fluent but inadequate translations (Tu et al. 2016b; 2016a; He et al. 2016; Tu et al. 2017). This is in contrast to conventional Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), which usually yields adequate but non-fluent translations. It is natural, therefore, to leverage the advantages of both models for better translations, and in this work we propose to incorporate SMT model into NMT framework. More specifically, at each decoding step, SMT offers additional recommendations of generated words based on the decoding information from NMT (e.g., the generated partial translation and attention history). Then we employ an auxiliary classifier to score the SMT recommendations and a gating function to combine the SMT recommendations with NMT generations, both of which are jointly trained within the NMT architecture in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on Chinese-English translation show that the proposed approach achieves significant and consistent improvements over state-of-the-art NMT and SMT systems on multiple NIST test sets.

AB Machine Translation (MT) is very useful in supporting multicultural communication. Existing Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) which requires high quality and quantity of corpora and Rule-Based Machine Translation (RBMT) which requires bilingual dictionaries, morphological, syntax, and semantic analyzer are scarce for low-resource languages. Due to the lack of language resources, it is difficult to create MT from high-resource languages to low-resource languages like Indonesian ethnic languages. Nevertheless, Indonesian ethnic languages' characteristics motivate us to introduce a Pivot-Based Hybrid Machine Translation (PHMT) by combining SMT and RBMT with Indonesian as a pivot which we further utilize in a multilingual communication support system. We evaluate PHMT translation quality with fluency and adequacy as metrics and then evaluate usability of the system. Despite the medium average translation quality (3.05 fluency score and 3.06 adequacy score), the 3.71 average mean scores of the usability evaluation indicates that the system is useful to support multilingual collaboration.

AB Dropped pronoun (DP) is a common problem in dialogue machine translation, in which pronouns are frequently dropped in the source sentence and thus are missing in its translation. In response to this problem, we propose a novel approach to improve the translation of DPs for dialogue machine translation. Firstly, we build a training data for DP generation, in which the DPs are automatically added according to the alignment information from a parallel corpus. Then we model the DP generation problem as a sequence labelling task, and develop a generation model based on recurrent neural networks and language models. Finally, we apply the DP generator to machine translation task by completing the source sentences with the missing pronouns. Experimental results show that our approach achieves a significant improvement of 1.7 BLEU points by recalling possible DPs in the source sentences.

TI Multilingual Communication via Best-Balanced Machine Translation
SO NEW GENERATION COMPUTING
AB It is known that creative ideas are often generated by correspondents from different cultures, but it remains true that distance still matters due to the language barrier. To enhance multilingual communication, this paper proposes the model of best-balanced machine translation. Our model is based on the quality of messages among participants (assumed to have different levels of language skill) and takes not only machine translation quality but also users' language skill into account. We provide a method to select languages to be used with machine translators, and a way of creating the best-balanced communication environment. Many studies have addressed machine translation with the goal of helping the non-native speaker to understand what was said. Our approach is totally differently, since we focus on helping the non-native speaker by enhancing the opportunity to join in the conversation. We conduct an experiment and find that this model allows machine translation technologies to benefit multilingual communication while making best use of the participants' different language skills. The proposed model addresses the talkativeness of the participants. It also improves communication by reducing serious machine translation errors and the number of conversation breakdowns.

SO ACTA LINGUISTICA ACADEMICA
AB In the scope of this research, we aim to give an overview of the currently existing solutions for machine translation and we assess their performance on the English-Hungarian language pair. Hungarian is considered to be a challenging language for machine translation because it has a highly different gram-matical structure and word ordering compared to English. We probed various machine translation systems from both academic and industrial applications. One key highlight of our work is that our models (Marian NMT, BART) performed significantly better than the solutions offered by most of the market -leader multinational companies. Finally, we fine-tuned different pre-finetuned models (mT5, mBART, M2M100) for English-Hungarian translation, which achieved state-of-the-art results in our test corpora.

AB In recent years, multimodal machine translation has become one of the hot research topics. In this paper, a machine translation model based on self-attention mechanism is extended for multimodal machine translation. In the model, an Image-text attention layer is added in the end of encoder layer to capture the relevant semantic information between image and text words. With this layer of attention, the model can capture the different weights between the words that is relevant to the image or appear in the image, and get a better text representation that fuses these weights, so that it can be better used for decoding of the model. Experiments are carried out on the original English-German sentence pairs of the multimodal machine translation dataset, Multi30k, and the Indonesian-Chinese sentence pairs which is manually annotated by human. The results show that our model performs better than the text-only transformer-based machine translation model and is comparable to most of the existing work, proves the effectiveness of our model.

TI EXPLICITATION IN NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION
SO ACROSS LANGUAGES AND CULTURES
AB This paper is concerned with the following question: to what extent does neural machine translation (NMT) - a relatively new approach to machine translation (MT), which can draw on richer contextual information than previous MT architectures - perform explicitation shifts in translation and how are these shifts realised in linguistic terms? In order to answer this question, the paper attempts to identify instances of explicitation in the machine-translated version of a research report on carbon dioxide capture and storage. The machine-translated text was created using the publicly available generic NMT system DeepL. The human translation of the research report was analysed in a prior research project for instances of explicitation and implicitation (Kruger 2015). After a brief quantitative discussion of the frequency and distribution of explicitation shifts identified in the Deep!, output as compared to the shifts identified in the human translation of the research report, the paper analyses in detail several examples in which Deept, performed explicitation shifts of various kinds. The quantitative and qualitative analyses are intended to yield a tentative picture of the capacity of state-of-the art neural machine translation systems to perform explicitation shifts in translation. As explicitation is understood in this article as an indicator of translational text-context interaction, the explicitation performance of NMT can - to some extent - be taken to be indicative of the "contextual awareness" of this new MT architecture.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WAVELETS MULTIRESOLUTION AND INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB With the development of natural language processing and neural machine translation, the neural machine translation method of end-to-end (E2E) neural network model has gradually become the focus of research because of its high translation accuracy and strong semantics of translation. However, there are still problems such as limited vocabulary and low translation loyalty, etc. in this paper, the discriminant method and the Conditional Random Field (CRF) model were used to segment and label the stem and affixes of Mongolian in the preprocessing stage of Mongolian-Chinese bilingual corpus. Aiming at the low translation loyalty problem, a decoding model combining Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) was constructed. The target language decoding was performed by using the GRU. A global attention model was used to obtain the bilingual word alignment information in the process of bilingual word alignment processing. Finally, the quality of the translation was evaluated by Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) values and Perplexity (PPL) values. The improved model yields a BLEU value of 25.13 and a PPL value of -38.1. The experimental results show that the E2E Mongolian-Chinese neural machine translation model was improved in terms of translation quality and semantic confusion compared with traditional statistical methods and machine translation models based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).

TI Assessing the impact of real-time machine translation on multilingual
   meetings in global software projects
SO EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
AB Communication in global software development is hindered by language differences in countries with a lack of English speaking professionals. Machine translation is a technology that uses software to translate from one natural language to another. The progress of machine translation systems has been steady in the last decade. As for now, machine translation technology is particularly appealing because it might be used, in the form of cross-language chat services, in countries that are entering into global software projects. However, despite the recent progress of the technology, we still lack a thorough understanding of how real-time machine translation affects communication. In this paper, we present a set of empirical studies with the goal of assessing to what extent real-time machine translation can be used in distributed, multilingual requirements meetings instead of English. Results suggest that, despite far from 100 % accurate, real-time machine translation is not disruptive of the conversation flow and, therefore, is accepted with favor by participants. However, stronger effects can be expected to emerge when language barriers are more critical. Our findings add to the evidence about the recent advances of machine translation technology and provide some guidance to global software engineering practitioners in regarding the losses and gains of using English as a lingua franca in multilingual group communication, as in the case of computer-mediated requirements meetings.

AB Most Indian languages lack sufficient parallel data for Machine Translation (MT) training. In this study, we build English-to-Indian language Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems using the state-of-the-art transformer architecture. In addition, we investigate the utility of back-translation and its effect on system performance. Our experimental evaluation reveals that the back-translation method helps to improve the BLEU scores for both English-to-Hindi and English-to-Bengali NMT systems. We also observe that back-translation is more useful in improving the quality of weaker baseline MT systems. In addition, we perform a manual evaluation of the translation outputs and observe that the BLEU metric cannot always analyse the MT quality as well as humans. Our analysis shows that MT outputs for the English-Bengali pair are actually better than that evaluated by BLEU metric.

AB In this article, the authors deal with the machine translation of written English text to sign language. They study the existing systems and issues in order to propose an implantation of a statistical machine translation from written English text to American Sign Language (English/ASL) taking care of several features of sign language. The work proposes a novel approach to build artificial corpus using grammatical dependencies rules owing to the lack of resources for sign language. The parallel corpus was the input of the statistical machine translation, which was used for creating statistical memory translation based on IBM alignment algorithms. These algorithms were enhanced and optimized by integrating the Jaro-Winkler distances in order to decrease training process. Subsequently, based on the constructed translation memory, a decoder was implemented for translating English text to the ASL using a novel proposed transcription system based on gloss annotation. The results were evaluated using the BLEU evaluation metric.

It analyses two translation scenarios: (1) when translating broad domain data from a morphologically rich language into a morphologically rich language or English (and vice versa), and (2) when translating narrow domain data and there are limited amounts of training data available for training machine translation systems. The paper reports on experiments for English (Germanic), Estonian (Finno-Ugric), Latvian (Baltic), and Russian (Slavic) languages. The scenarios are evaluated using automatic and manual - system comparative and error analysis-based - evaluation methods. The paper also analyses the aspects where neural systems are superior to statistical (phrase-based) systems and vice versa.

AB There are many meaningless modal particles and dittographes in natural spoken language, furthermore ASR (automatic speech recognition) often has some recognition errors and the ASR results have no punctuations. And thus the translation would be rather poor if the ASR results are directly translated by MT (machine translation). Therefore, it is necessary to transform the abnormal ASR results into normative texts to fit machine translation. In this paper, a pretreatment approach which based on conditional random field model was introduced to delete the meaningless modal particles and dittographes, correct the recognition errors, and punctuated the ASR results before machine translation. Experiments show that the MT BLEU of 0.2497 is obtained, that improved by 18.4% over the MT baseline without pretreatment.

Non-availability of lexical resources, spelling variations in the source language text, source text ambiguous words, named entity recognition and collocations are the major challenges faced while developing this syetm. The key activities involved during translation process are preprocessing, translation engine and post processing. Lookup algorithms, pattern matching algorithms etc formed the basis for solving these issues. The system accuracy has been evaluated using intelligibility test, accuracy test and BLEU score. The hybrid syatem is found to perform better than the constituent systems.

AB Multilingual knowledge distillation is proposed for multilingual sentence embedding alignment. In this paper, it is found out that multilingual knowledge distillation could implicitly achieve cross-lingual word embedding alignment, which is critically important for reference-free machine translation evaluation (where source texts are directly compared with system translations). Then with the framework of BERTScore, we propose a metric BERTScore-MKD for reference-free machine translation evaluation. From the experimental results on the into-English language pairs of WMT17-19, the reference-free metric BERTScore-MKD is very competitive (not only best mean scores, but also better than BLEU on WMT17-18) when the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics that we know are chosen for comparison. Moreover, the results on WMT19 demonstrate that BERTScore-MKD is also suitable for reference-based machine translation evaluation (where reference texts are used to be compared with system translations).

TI STATISTICAL VERSUS NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION - A CASE STUDY FOR A
   MEDIUM SIZE DOMAIN-SPECIFIC BILINGUAL CORPUS
SO POZNAN STUDIES IN CONTEMPORARY LINGUISTICS
AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has recently achieved promising results for a number of translation pairs. Although the method requires larger volumes of data and more computational power than Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), it is believed to become dominant in near future. In this paper we evaluate SMT and NMT models learned on a domain-specific English-Polish corpus of a moderate size (1,200,000 segments). The experiment shows that both solutions significantly outperform a general-domain online translator. The SMT model achieves a slightly better BLEU score than the NMT model. On the other hand, the process of decoding is noticeably faster in NMT. Human evaluation carried out on a sizeable sample of translations (2,000 pairs) reveals the superiority of the NMT approach, particularly in the aspect of output fluency.

AB This report presents the results of an Estonian governmental project, which aimed to create open-source machine translation systems for Estonian. The project's goal included six translation directions translating between Estonian and English, German and Russian, and five text domains - general domain, spoken language, legal, military and crisis texts. The project results include 1) openly distributed parallel and monolingual corpora for the relevant languages, 2) open-source neural machine translation systems trained on them, and 3) new public evaluation benchmarks. The automatic evaluation shows that the resulting systems are highly competitive and match or surpass the performance of other available online machine translation systems. We present the recipe for training such systems and other details and discuss interesting findings made in the process. A live translation demo of the resulting systems (also open-sourced) is available online.

AB With the development and progress of Information Technology, the translation between different languages has become particularly important. Statistical Machine Translation may be able to predict a relatively accurate target word with statistical analysis method, but it cannot get a much better translation as it couldn't fully understand the semantic context information of source language words. In order to solve this problem, the model of Mongolian-Chinese Machine Translation System could be constructed based on GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) neural network structure and the usage of global attention mechanism to obtain bilingual alignment information. In the process of constructing a dictionary, the bilingual words are annotated to further improve the alignment probability. The research result shows that the BLEU value is certainly promoted and improved compared with previous benchmark research and traditional statistical machine translation method.

TI Machine Learning Based Taxonomy and Analysis of English Learners'
   Translation Errors
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-ASSISTED LANGUAGE LEARNING AND

AB This study extracts the comments from a large scale of Chinese EFL learners' translation corpus to study the taxonomy of translation errors. Two unsupervised machine learning approaches are used to obtain the computational evidences of translation error taxonomy. After manually revision, ten types of English to Chinese (E2C) and eight types Chinese to English (C2E) translation errors are finally confirmed. There probably exists three categories of top-level errors according to the hierarchical clustering results. In addition, three supervised learning methods are applied to automatically recognize the types of errors, among which the highest performance reaches F1 = 0.85 on E2C and F1 = 0.90 on C2E translation. Further comparison to the intuitive or theoretical studies on translation taxonomy shows some phenomenon accompanied by language skill improvement of Chinese learners. Analysis on translation problems based on machine learning provides the objective insight and understanding on the students' translations.

TI English-Mizo Machine Translation using neural and statistical approaches
SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
AB Machine translation helps resolve language incomprehensibility issues and eases interaction among people from varying linguistic backgrounds. Although corpus-based approaches (statistical and neural) offer reasonable translation accuracy for large-sized corpus, robustness of such approaches lie in their ability to adapt to low-resource languages, which confront unavailability of large-sized corpus. In this paper, prediction aptness of two approaches has been meticulously explored in the context of Mizo, a low-resource Indian language. Translations predicted by the two approaches have been comparatively and adequately analyzed on a number of grounds to infer their strengths and weaknesses, particularly in low-resource scenarios.

The integrated architecture of MTS with TM is outlined. Several examples of language dependent TM tools and translation process are given. To further speedup the translation process, we port MTS on a computing cluster that uses the Hadoop framework and carry out distributed execution. The computational experiments demonstrate that substantial speedups could be obtained by using the Hadoop framework.

   Translation: A Survey
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB This paper surveys several state-of-the-art reordering techniques employed in Statistical Machine Translation systems. Reordering is understood as the word-order redistribution of the translated words. In original SMT systems, this different order is only modeled within the limits of translation units. Relying only in the reordering provided by translation units may not be good enough in most language pairs, which might require longer reorderings. Therefore, additional techniques may be deployed to face the reordering challenge. The Statistical Machine Translation community has been very active recently in developing reordering techniques. This paper gives a brief survey and classification of several well-known reordering approaches.

SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
AB Machine translation (MT) is an important challenge in the fields of Computational Linguistics. In this study, we conducted neural machine translation (NMT) experiments on two different architectures. First, Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture along with a variation that utilizes attention mechanism is performed on translation task. Second, an architecture that is fully based on the self-attention mechanism, namely Transformer, is employed to perform a comprehensive comparison. Besides, the contribution of employing Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and Gumbel Softmax distributions are examined for both architectures. The experiments are conducted on two different datasets: TED Talks that is one of the popular benchmark datasets for NMT especially among morphologically rich languages like Turkish and WMT18 News dataset that is provided by The Third Conference on Machine Translation (WMT) for shared tasks on various aspects of machine translation. The evaluation of Turkish-to-English translations' results demonstrate that the Transformer model with combination of BPE and Gumbel Softmax achieved 22.4 BLEU score on TED Talks and 38.7 BLUE score on WMT18 News dataset. The empirical results support that using Gumbel Softmax distribution improves the quality of translations for both architectures.

AB Research on machine translation has a long history and many methods and techniques have been proposed and developed. However, low quality of translation is still a major problem and many related problems remain unresolved. Super Function based machine translation was proposed to perform translation without going through syntactic and semantic analysis as many machine translation systems usually do. In such way, the import of the errors caused by the syntactic and semantic analysis could be avoided and the readability of the translation is also guaranteed. We continue to extend the Super Function for the Chinese Japanese machine translation. the Super Function is divided into the Super Function for sentences and Super Function for phrases. The existing scope and definition of the variable for Super Function is also expanded. The base noun phrases and base verbal phrases are detected and considered when building the Super Function. The head noun in base noun phrase is treated as variable but the determinative modifiers in base noun phrases are treated as modificatory variables, meanwhile the determinative modifiers in base verb phrases are treated as modificatory variables to build the Super Function. The revised Levenshtein Distance algorithm is proposed for evaluate and find the matching Super Functions in database for input sentences and the determinative modifiers. The proposed extended Super Function keeps the advantages of the Super Function but has less number of Super Functions for Chinese Japanese machine translation. From the experiment results, the extended Super Function is not only effective but also feasible and with considerable precision for Chinese Japanese machine translation. The extended Super Function can even translate long sentences with complex structure for which the completely matching Super Functions can not be found for translation.

AB This paper describes neural machine translation between orthographically and morphologically divergent languages. Amharic has a rich morphology; it uses the syllabic Ethiopic script. We used a new transliteration technique for Amharic to facilitate vocabulary sharing. To tackle the highly inflectional morphology and to make an open vocabulary translation, we used subwords. Furthermore, the research was conducted on low-data conditions. We used the transformer-based neural machine translation architecture by tuning the hyperparameters for low-data conditions. In the automatic evaluation of the strong baseline, word-based, and subword-based models trained on a public benchmark dataset, the best subword-based models outperform the baseline models by approximately six up to seven BLEU.

AB Many of the texts posted on Twitter are broken sentences, and the translated sentences may not be accurate. An inaccurate translation may spoil the meaning of the original text and induce miscommunication between the poster and the reader who uses the machine translation. Since many sentences tweeted on Twitter contain emotional expressions, this study uses sentiment analysis to calculate and compare the sentiment scores of the original and translated sentences to investigate the change in sentiment before and after machine translation. As a result of using dictionaries to classify tweets before and after translation, it was found that the classification of positive sentences tended to be more likely the same before and after translation. In addition, the results of the sentiment analysis of "joy", "like", "relief" and "excitement" by machine learning showed that the sentiment of "joy" was particularly increased when translated from Japanese into English.

Google Translate and Matecat are tools with large but general translation memories. The translation memory of Thot was trained and tuned with various configurations of a Dutch translation of parts of SNOMED CT, a medical dictionary and parts of the UMLS Metathesaurus. The configuration with the highest BLEU score, representing closeness to human translation, was selected. Similarity was determined between Thot translations and those by Google and Matecat. The validity of translations was assessed through random samples. Google and Matecat translated similarly in 85.4% of the cases and generally better than Thot. Whereas the quality of translations was considered acceptable, machine translations alone are yet insufficient.

AB In order to further improve the application of machine translation model in Japanese translation, analytic analysis method is adopted to optimize the original machine translation model. The improved machine translation model is used to analyze and describe Japanese translation. Finally, the optimized machine translation model is used to analyze Japanese multicontext. The relevant indexes and parameters were extracted and verified, and finally the model was verified by relevant experiments. The results show that the vector variation graph with different parameters can be divided into slow decline stage, stable change stage, and fast decline stage according to the increase of iteration number and the influence of corresponding change trend. In addition, it can be seen from the value of PE curve that the influence of parameter pe is the least, while the influence of corresponding re parameter is the greatest. The multicontext index of Japanese has the greatest influence on Japanese fluency and the least influence on Japanese keywords, and the trend of influence is parabolic. The application curve of the optimized machine translation model to Japanese in multiple contexts shows that different parameters have different effects on Japanese, which should be represented by the positive parameter V. Finally, the accuracy of the model is verified by experimental data. The above research can provide support for the application of machine learning in different fields and also provide research ideas for the multicontext translation of Japanese.

AB Current English-Korean machine translation system cannot provide practical translation quality mainly due to the difficulties in long sentence parsing. Long sentences generally include commas, resulting in lots of different possible sentence structures. It is very difficult to accurately parse the long sentences that have commas. The roles of the commas in constructing sentences have to be identified and then the syntactic analysis should be performed according to the roles of the commas for accurate parsing of the long sentences. This paper presents the analysis results of the comma usages and the comma processing methods for each comma usage. And it also proposes the comma usage classification method using machine learning technique. In experiment, some improved translation results, by identifying comma usage and processing the commas, are also presented.

AB With the continuous development of the network information age, how to effectively use modern means to eliminate language barriers between people has become a common problem facing all mankind. Translation is a powerful means to overcome language barriers. However, due to its high cost and slow translation speed, traditional manual translation methods can not meet the needs of the translation market, and machine translation emerges as the times require. Machine Translation (MT) is the process of transforming one natural language into another by computer. Although machine translation is simple and convenient, its accuracy still needs to be improved. At present, it can only be used as an auxiliary means of manual translation. For this reason, computeraided translation (CAT), that is, computer-aided translation, has attracted people's attention and favor.

TI EFFICIENCY OF MACHINE TRANSLATION IN URBAN DISCOURSE

AB This article aims to analyze the use of Yandex.Translate, an online machine translation system, in translating urban discourse texts on the web. The authors use integrative linguistic-and-pragmatic approach to assess machine translation quality in a global digital setting. The aim is to show the efficiency of a state-of-the-art machine translation system and to investigate its usefulness in practical application. The authors perform a detailed analysis of the Paris city website content, which is automatically translated from French into Russian with Yandex.Translate. The data selection is justified by the absence of official foreign versions of this website, which points to the need of machine translation engines integrated in a web browser. Less than 20% of the analysed machine-translated texts demonstrate high language quality, whereas 60% can be referred to as acceptable - the text preserves the meaning of the source but contains some errors and inaccuracies in the target language. About 20% of the machine-translated text contains blunders, which violate Russian language norms. It causes source text contents distortion and communication failures. In the end, a classification of the system errors is presented. It is also concluded that machine translation would substitute middle-skilled human translators in the future. However, the use of such systems will enforce standardisation and simplification of the target language.

AB This article investigates perceptions of technology-mediated translations of literary texts by two groups: translation students and professional literary translators. The participants post-edited an excerpt from a classic Dickens novel into Turkish using a machine translation (MT) system of their choice. The analysis of the post-edited texts, participants' answers to survey questions, and interviews with professional translators suggest that MT is currently a long way from being an essential part of any literary translation practice for the English-Turkish language pair. Translators' interactions with MT and negative attitudes toward it may change in a positive direction as MT improves and translation practice evolves.

SO JOURNAL OF SPECIALISED TRANSLATION
AB The potential benefits of integrating machine translation into human translation workflows are now widely recognised. In many sectors of the translation industry, translators' throughput is improved with the use of machine translation as a tool in the translating process. Post-editing of machine translation is also a service in its own right, with specific guidelines and, more recently, an international standard. We introduce this special issue by providing a brief overview of post-editing as a practice, service and research topic. Contributions to the issue are then presented. The issue moves from a magnified perspective of translators' work to important aspects of translation products, translators' attitudes and translator training. It has four themes: the post-editing process; reception of post-edited products; attitudes and perceptions; and competence, training and education.

AB Improving the quality of Machine Translation (MT) systems is an important task not only for researchers but it is a substantial need for translating companies to create translations in a quicker and cheaper way. Combining the outputs of more than one machine translation systems is a common technique to get better translation quality because the strengths of the different systems could be utilized. The main question is to find the best method for the combination. In this paper, we used the Quality Estimation (QE) technique to combine a phrase-based and a hierarchical-based machine translation systems. The composite system was tested on several language combinations. The QE module was used to compare the outputs of the different MT systems and gave the best one as the result translation of the composite system. The composite system gained better translation quality than the separated systems.

SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW
AB In this paper, we present a new sign language machine translation approach based on regression method. The aim of this work is to improve the translation quality and accuracy of existing regularized regression methods. Our approach represents a methodological foundation for small-scale corpus domains such as the Sign Language Machine Translation field. Our method is based on the Elastic net regularization using linear combination of the L1 and L2 penalties of the lasso and ridge methods. We show that using both the de-bruijn graph with the Latent Semantic Analysis technique in the decoding process improves the translation results. The system is experimented on American Sign Language parallel corpora containing 300 sentences and assessed by BLEU, METEOR, NIST and F1-MESURE machine translation evaluation metrics. We obtained good experimental results compared to classical phrase based approach i.e MOSES framework. Also our approach improved the translation results compared to LASSO and RIDGE regression approaches.

Parallel datasets are mainly collected three different ways; i) translating Arabic texts into Turkish by professional translators, ii) exploiting the web for open-source Arabic-Turkish parallel texts, iii) using back-translation. We performed preliminary experiments for Arabicto-Turkish machine translation with neural (Marian) machine translation tools with a novel morphologically motivated vocabulary reduction method.

AB The approach based on translation pieces extracted from the translation memory (TM) knowledge is appealing for neural machine translation (NMT), owning to its efficiency in memory consumption and computation. However, the incapable of capturing sufficient contextual translation knowledge leading to a limited translation performance. This paper proposes a simple and effective structure to address this issue. The main idea is to employ the word chain and position chain knowledge from a TM as additional rewards to guide the decoding process of the neural machine translation. Experiments on six translation tasks show that the proposed Double Chain Graph yields consistent gains while achieving greater efficiency to the counterpart of translation pieces.

SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
AB In recent years, with the development of Internet and intelligent technology, Japanese translation teaching has gradually explored a new teaching mode. Under the guidance of natural language processing and intelligent machine translation, machine translation based on statistical model has gradually become one of the primary auxiliary tools in Japanese translation teaching. In order to solve the problems of small scale, slow speed and incomplete field in the traditional parallel corpus machine translation, this paper constructs a Japanese translation teaching corpus based on the bilingual non parallel data model, and uses this corpus to train Japanese translation teaching machine translation model Moses to get better auxiliary effect. In the process of construction, for non parallel corpus, we use the translation retrieval framework based on word graph representation to extract parallel sentence pairs from the corpus, and then build a translation retrieval model based on Bilingual non parallel data. The experimental results of training Moses translation model with Japanese translation corpus show that the bilingual nonparallel data model constructed in this paper has good translation retrieval performance. Compared with the existing algorithm, the Bleu value extracted in the parallel sentence pair is increased by 2.58. In addition, the retrieval method based on the structure of translation option words graph proposed in this paper is time efficient and has better performance and efficiency in assisting Japanese translation teaching.

TI Revisiting Back-Translation for Low-Resource Machine Translation Between

SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Back-translation (BT) has been widely used and become one of standard techniques for data augmentation in Neural Machine Translation (NMT), BT has proven to be beneficial for improving the performance of translation effectively, especially for low-resource scenarios. While most previous works related to BT mainly focus on European languages with high relatedness, few of them study less-related languages in other areas around the world. In this paper, we choose the language pair with less relatedness in Asia: Chinese and Vietnamese, to investigate the impacts of BT on extremely low-resource machine translation between them. We first discuss the similarities and differences between the two languages, then evaluate and compare the effects of different sizes of back-translated data on NMT and Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) models for Chinese-Vietnamese and Vietnamese-Chinese, with both character-based and word-based settings, and conduct further analysis on the translation outputs from several aspects. Some conclusions from previous works are partially confirmed and we also draw some new findings and conclusions, which are beneficial to understand BT further and deeper for translation between less-related low-resource languages.

   Human Translation
SO LENGUA Y HABLA
AB This paper studies different possibilities for translating sports metaphors in fictional TV series. The study focuses on `The TV-Corpus' and a corpus compiled by the author in previous works on Internet TV series. The analysis focuses on the translation of this type of expression carried out by humans, on the one hand, and machines, on the other. I compare the translations of these systems with some human translations provided in the translated subtitles broadcast in the corresponding series from Netflix, Amazon Prime, and others. The analysis aims to study the metaphorical dimension of the expression and compare the results obtained by the different translations performed by the MT systems and by a human translator. Finally, I discuss the scope and limits of MT systems to achieve adequate and accurate translations of metaphors and idiomatic expressions compared with the possibilities of human translation. The analysis results show that metaphorical and idiomatic expressions remain a blind spot of machine translation. Hence, a quality translation depends on the human factor, either through post-editing or direct human translation.

AB Machine translation has witnessed many advances in recent years and has become ever more accessible. However, no matter how good an automated translation is, a proficient human translator does a better job. In this project, we attempt to identify areas of machine translation that need addressing by analyzing texts from three different disciplines translated using 'Google translate' from English into Arabic. We then suggest where and when human intervention is necessary as well as further automated functions to be incorporated in an improved proposed model to be developed based on the findings of this study. Human intervention can be required in instances when machine translation fails to detect the context, and automated functions include determining the discipline of the text using keywords and titles and connecting the text to more specialized dictionaries.

The data was collected as part of the EU APE-QUEST project and comprises crawled content from EU websites with translation from English into three European languages: Dutch, French and Portuguese. Altogether, the data consists of around 31K tuples including a source sentence, the respective machine translation by a neural machine translation system, a post-edited version of such translation by a professional translator, and - where available - the original reference translation crawled from parallel language websites. We describe the data collection process, provide an analysis of the resulting post-edits and benchmark the data using state-of-the-art quality estimation and automatic post-editing models. One interesting by-product of our post-editing analysis suggests that neural systems built with publicly available general domain data can provide high-quality translations, even though comparison to human references suggests that this quality is quite low. This makes our dataset a suitable candidate to test evaluation metrics. The data is freely available as an ELRC-SHARE resource.

Data were obtained from 60 trainee translators concerning the perceived and objective difficulties of post-editing and human translation tasks and the participants' performance. It was found that (1) the difficulty of the NMT post-editing task, compared to human translation, was significantly influenced by both NMT quality and ST complexity; the difficulty of the post-editing task was significantly lower than that of the human translation task only in the case of high-quality NMT paired with complex ST, while the results were mixed for other interactions between NMT quality and ST complexity levels; (2) no strong correlations were found between the participants' perceived difficulty and the measurements of objective difficulty and task performance for both post-editing and human translation tasks. Practical and research implications were discussed.

The best translation, of course, is the sentence that has the highest probability. A large sample of human translated text (parallel corpus) is examined by the SMT algorithms for automatic learning of translation parameters. SMT has undergone tremendous development in last two decades. A large number of tools has been developed for SMT and put to work on different language pairs with fair accuracy. This paper will give brief introduction to Statistical Machine Translation; tools available for developing Statistical Machine Translation systems based on Statistical approach and their comparative study. This paper will help researcher in finding the information about SMT tools at one place.

AB As a kind of computer aided translation method, Interactive Machine Translation technology reduced manual translation repetitive and mechanical operation through a variety of methods, so as to get the translation efficiency, and played an important role in the practical application of the translation work. In this paper, we regarded the behavior of users' frequently searching for words in the translation process as the research object, and transformed the behavior to the translation selection problem under the current translation. The paper presented a prediction model, which is a comprehensive utilization of alignment model, translation model and language model of the searching words behavior. It achieved a highly accurate prediction of searching words behavior, and reduced the switching of mouse and keyboard operations in the users' translation process.

AB Traditional automatic machine translation (MT) evaluation methods adopt the idea that calculates the similarity between machine translation output and human reference translations. However, in terms of the needs of many users, it is a key research issues to propose an evaluation method without references. As described in this paper, we propose a novel automatic MT evaluation method without human reference translations. Firstly, calculate average n-grams probability of source sentence with source language models, and similarly, calculate average n-grams probability of machine-translated sentence with target language models, finally, use the relative error of two average n-grams probabilities to mark machine-translated sentence. The experimental results show that our method can achieve high correlations with a few automatic MT evaluation metrics. The main contribution of this paper is that users can get MT evaluation reliability in the absence of reference translations, which greatly improving the utility of MT evaluation metrics.

TI A ranking method for example based machine translation results by
   learning from user feedback
SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE
AB Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT) is a corpus based approach to Machine Translation (MT), that utilizes the translation by analogy concept. In our EBMT system, translation templates are extracted automatically from bilingual aligned corpora by substituting the similarities and differences in pairs of translation examples with variables. In the earlier versions of the discussed system, the translation results were solely ranked using confidence factors of the translation templates. In this study, we introduce an improved ranking mechanism that dynamically learns from user feedback. When a user, such as a professional human translator, submits his evaluation of the generated translation results, the system learns "context-dependent co-occurrence rules" from this feedback. The newly learned rules are later consulted, while ranking the results of the subsequent translations. Through successive translation-evaluation cycles, we expect that the output of the ranking mechanism complies better with user expectations, listing the more preferred results in higher ranks. We also present the evaluation of our ranking method which uses the precision values at top results and the BLEU metric.

TI The neural machine translation models for the low-resource
   Kazakh-English language pair
SO PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB The development of the machine translation field was driven by people's need to communicate with each other globally by automatically translating words, sentences, and texts from one language into another. The neural machine translation approach has become one of the most significant in recent years. This approach requires large parallel corpora not available for low-resource languages, such as the Kazakh language, which makes it difficult to achieve the high performance of the neural machine translation models. This article explores the existing methods for dealing with low-resource languages by artificially increasing the size of the corpora and improving the performance of the Kazakh-English machine translation models. These methods are called forward translation, backward translation, and transfer learning. Then the Sequence-to-Sequence (recurrent neural network and bidirectional recurrent neural network) and Transformer neural machine translation architectures with their features and specifications are concerned for conducting experiments in training models on parallel corpora. The experimental part focuses on building translation models for the high-quality translation of formal social, political, and scientific texts with the synthetic parallel sentences from existing monolingual data in the Kazakh language using the forward translation approach and combining them with the parallel corpora parsed from the official government websites. The total corpora of 380,000 parallel Kazakh-English sentences are trained on the recurrent neural network, bidirectional recurrent neural network, and Transformer models of the OpenNMT framework. The quality of the trained model is evaluated with the BLEU, WER, and TER metrics. Moreover, the sample translations were also analyzed. The RNN and BRNN models showed a more precise translation than the Transformer model. The Byte-Pair Encoding tokenization technique showed better metrics scores and translation than the word tokenization technique. The Bidirectional recurrent neural network with the Byte-Pair Encoding technique showed the best performance with 0.49 BLEU, 0.51 WER, and 0.45 TER.

The contribution to this formalism is by developing a hybrid of direct and rule-based translation model which is suitable for translating a source language text with its parser into target language text with no grammar formalism and corpus yet. This model can theoretically handle one-to-one, many-to-one, and many-to-many word(s) translations.

AB Phrase-based machine translation assumes that all words are at the same distance and translates them using feature functions that approximate the probability at different levels. On the other hand, neural machine translation infers a word embedding and translates these word vectors using a neural model. At the moment, both approaches co-exist and are being intensively investigated.
   This paper to the best of our knowledge is the first work that both compares and combines these two systems by: using the phrase-based output to solve unknown words in the neural machine translation output; using the neural alignment in the phrase-based system; comparing how the popular strategy of pre-reordering affects both systems; and combining both translation outputs. Improvements are achieved in Catalan-to-Spanish and German-to-English.

AB Machine translation (MT) is the automatic translation of the source language to its target language by a computer system. In the current paper, we propose an approach of using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) over traditional statistical MT (SMT). We compare the performance of the phrase table of SMT to the performance of the proposed RNN and in turn improve the quality of the MT output. This work has been done as a part of the shared task problem provided by the MTIL2017. We have constructed the traditional MT model using Moses toolkit and have additionally enriched the language model using external data sets. Thereafter, we have ranked the phrase tables using an RNN encoder-decoder module created originally as a part of the GroundHog project of LISA lab.

AB Machine translation means automatic translation which is performed using computer software. There are several approaches to machine translation, some of them need extensive linguistic knowledge while others require enormous statistical calculations. This paper presents a hybrid method, integrating corpus based approach and statistical approach for translating Bengali sentences into English with the help of N-gram language model. The corpus based method finds the corresponding target language translation of sentence fragments, selecting the best match text from the bilingual corpus to acquire knowledge while the N-gram model rearranges the sentence constituents to get an accurate translation without employing external linguistic rules. A variety of Bengali sentences, including various structures and verb tenses are considered to translate through the new system. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated in terms of adequacy, fluency, WER, and BLEU score. The assessment scores are compared with other conventional approaches as well as with Google Translate, a well-known free machine translation service by Google. It has been found that experimental results of the work provide higher scores over Google Translate and other methods with less computational cost.

TI Unsupervised English Intelligent Machine Translation in Wireless Network
   Environment
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB Researchers suggest unsupervised English machine translation to address the absence of parallel corpus in English translation. Unsupervised pretraining techniques, denoising autoencoders, back translation, and shared latent representation mechanisms are used to simulate the translation task using just monolingual corpora. This paper uses pseudo-parallel data to construct unsupervised neural machine translation (NMT) and dissimilar language pair analysis. This paper firstly analyzes the low performance of unsupervised translation on dissimilar language pairs from three aspects: bilingual word embedding quality, shared words, and word order. And artificial shared word replacement and preordering strategies are proposed to increase the shared words between dissimilar language pairs and reduce the difference in their syntactic structure, thereby improving the translation performance on dissimilar language pairs. The denoising autoencoder and shared latent representation mechanism in unsupervised English machine translation are only required in the early stage of training, and learning the shared latent representation limits the further improvement of performance in different directions. While training the denoising autoencoder by repeatedly altering the training data slows down the convergence of the model, this is especially true for divergent languages. This paper presents an unsupervised NMT model based on pseudo-parallel data to address this issue. It trains two standard supervised neural machine translation models using the pseudo-parallel corpus generated by the unsupervised neural machine translation system, which enhances translation performance and speeds convergence. Finally, the English intelligent translation model is deployed in the wireless network server, and users can access it through the wireless network.

AB The translation divergence is a challenging problem in the area of machine translation. Language divergence arises when lexically and syntactically similar sentences of the source language do not translate into sentences that are similar in lexical and syntactic structure in the target language. A detailed study of divergence issues in machine translation is required for their proper classification and detection. Though a number of Machine Translation developers have given attention to this problem, it is difficult to derive general strategies which can be used for any language pair. In this paper, we discuss the translation pattern between English to Marathi and Marathi to English of various constructions to identify the structural and syntactic divergences in English- Marathi language pair.

AB Automatic machine translation plays an important role in reducing language barriers between people speaking different languages. Deep neural networks (DNN) have attained major success in diverse research fields such as computer vision, information retrieval, language modelling, and recently machine translation. Neural sequence-to-sequence networks have accomplished noteworthy progress for machine translation. Inspired by the success achieved by residual connections in different applications, in this work, we introduce a novel NMT model that adopts residual connections to achieve better performing automatic translation. Evaluation of the proposed model has shown an improvement in translation accuracy by 0.3 BLEU compared to the original model, using an ensemble of 5 LSTMs. Regarding training time complexity, the proposed model saves about 33% of the time needed by the original model to train datasets of short sentences. Deeper neural networks of the proposed model have shown a good performance in dealing with the vanishing/exploding problems. All experiments have been performed over NVIDIA Tesla V100 32G Passive GPU and using the WMT14 English-German translation task.

AB Triangular machine translation is a special case of low-resource machine translation where the language pair of interest has limited parallel data, but both languages have abundant parallel data with a pivot language. Naturally, the key to triangular machine translation is the successful exploitation of such auxiliary data. In this work, we propose a transfer-learning-based approach that utilizes all types of auxiliary data. As we train auxiliary source-pivot and pivot-target translation models, we initialize some parameters of the pivot side with a pre-trained language model and freeze them to encourage both translation models to work in the same pivot language space, so that they can be smoothly transferred to the source-target translation model. Experiments show that our approach can outperform previous ones.

TI Design and Application of Chinese English Machine Translation Model
   Based on Improved Bidirectional Neural Network Fusion Attention
   Mechanism
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
AB In order to improve the effect of Chinese-English machine translation, this paper combines attention mechanism and neural network algorithm and applies it to Chinese-English machine learning translation. Moreover, this paper uses Gaussian distribution instead of chi-square distribution to analyze the approximate error introduced by the Chinese and English speech energy detection method. In addition, this paper studies the overall and specific approximation errors by establishing the normalized mean square error function and the absolute error function, respectively. Finally, this paper proposes a new model for machine translation based on logarithmic position representation and self-attention mechanism. Through the experimental research, it can be seen that the Chinese-English machine translation model integrating attention mechanism and bidirectional neural network proposed in this paper has a good practical translation effect.

TI Improving Neural Machine Translation Model with Deep Encoding
   Information
SO COGNITIVE COMPUTATION
AB Availability of very high computational power along with the development of deep neural network (DNN) technology has enabled rapid progress of machine translation technology. The powerful representation ability of the deep neural network also enables the neural machine translation technology (NMT) to exploit the available large-scale bilingual parallel corpus as well as the computing power to provide a highly effective translation model. Nevertheless, the existing neural machine translation models only utilize the top layer encoder information, whereas the information available in deeper encoding layers is often ignored. This significantly constrains the performance of the translation model. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel neural machine translation model which can fully exploit the deep encoding information. The core idea is to use different ways of aggregating the information from different encoding layers. We further design three different aggregation strategies including parallel layer, multi-layer, and dynamic layer encoding information aggregations. Three translation models are correspondingly trained and compared with the baseline transformer model for the Chinese-to-English translation task. The experimental results indicate that the BLEU-4 score of the proposed model has been increased by 0.89 compared with that of the benchmark model. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB The lack of Chinese-Vietnamese parallel corpus has resulted in poor translation of Chinese-Vietnamese neural machine translation. In order to solve this problem, we propose a phrase-based Chinese-Vietnamese pseudo-parallel sentence pair generation method. This method expands the corpus of Chinese-Vietnamese neural machine translation and improves the performance of Chinese-Vietnamese neural machine translation. Firstly, based on the small-scale Chinese-Vietnamese parallel corpus, the method selects the phrase module according to the phrase syntactic structure information. Then this method combines word alignment information with replacement rules. Finally, the method achieves the expansion of Chinese-Vietnamese pseudo-parallel corpus. Experiments show that this method can effectively generate Chinese-Vietnamese pseudo-parallel sentence pairs and improve the performance of Chinese-Vietnamese neural machine translation.

AB Neural machine translation (NMT) systems have recently obtained state-of-the-art in many machine translation systems between popular language pairs because of the availability of data. For low-resourced language pairs, there are few researches in this field due to the lack of bilingual data. In this paper, we attempt to build the first NMT systems for a low-resourced language pair: Japanese-Vietnamese. We have also shown significant improvements when combining advanced methods to reduce the adverse impacts of data sparsity and improve the quality of NMT systems. In addition, we proposed a variant of Byte-Pair Encoding algorithm to perform effective word segmentation for Vietnamese texts and alleviate the rare-word problem that persists in NMT systems.

AB The paper focuses on English-to-Russian translations of patent applications on the website of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). A comparative analysis of patent applications is performed by using translations made with the help of the WIPO Translate tool and human translators within the framework of the synergetic translation space concept encompassing the domains of the author's intensions, text content and composition, energy, translator, recipient, and the translation acceptability notion. The translation erratology aspects were considered from the point of view of the semantic, referential, and syntactic ambiguity within the domains of content-composition and energy space. In the domain of the author, the intention to convey some technical information is revealed, while its rendering in the content-composition and energy domains depends on whether the translation is made by a person or a machine. Genre- and composition-related specifics have been rendered in both cases while machine translation errors have been proven to result from the semantic, referential, or syntactic ambiguity, and this is when the translated output is generally considered unacceptable by the recipient. The results obtained can be used for editing machine translations of patent documentation, assessing the quality of technical documentation translation that is referred to other specific genre conventions.

We use Rule Based Machine Translation (RBMT) and Knowledge Based Machine Translation (KBMT) techniques. Since it's a bilingual translation system both English to Tamil and Tamil to English translation are possible. The simple sentences are translated using the rules in RBMT. The complex sentences are split/ converted into simple sentences using KBMT and translated using RBMT and then processed to get text in target language. It is restricted to the domain Weather Report and can be expanded to other domains in future.

TI Exploiting Translation Model for Parallel Corpus Mining
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Parallel corpus mining (PCM) is beneficial for many corpus-based natural language processing tasks, e.g., machine translation and bilingual dictionary induction, especially in low-resource languages and domains. It relies heavily on cross-lingual representations to model the interdependencies between different languages and determine whether sentences are parallel or not. In this paper, we take the first step towards exploiting the multilingual Transformer translation model to produce expressive sentence representations for PCM. Since the traditional Transformer lacks an immediate sentence representation, we pool the output representation of the encoder as the sentence representation, which is further optimized as a part of the training flow of the translation model. Experiments conducted on the BUCC PCM task show that the proposed method improves mining performance over the existing methods with the assistance of the pre-trained multilingual BERT. To further test the usability of the proposed method, we mine parallel sentences from public resources and find that the mined sentences can indeed enhance low-resource machine translation.

AB Machine Translation systems are fast replacing human translators to aid us in translation between any pair of natural languages. Conversational sentences form the fundamental structure of a natural language. These sentences help in understanding the basic conversations in a language and hence improving translation of these sentences is considered more essential to improve the quality of a good translation systems in various real-life applications. This paper focuses on machine translation for travel conversations between any pair of languages namely, English, Hindi, and Tamil, with minimal intervention of linguistics. The translation system is trained using various text corpus sizes (1K, 5K, 13K sentences) of conversational and complex sentences for comparison. To improve the performance of a machine translation system a language identification system coupled with post-editing approach that applies n-best translation list analysis and language models are used. An improvement of translation performance by 3-5% in bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) score is observed without incorporating linguistic information.

AB Mongolian-Chinese statistical machine translation (SMT) system has its limitation because of the significant syntax differences, complex Mongolian morphology and scarce resource of parallel corpus. Template-based machine translation (TBMT) can produce high accuracy and good syntax structure translations with a relative small corpus. Therefore, SMT systems can combine with TBMT system to get better translations. We built a Mongolian-Chinese TBMT system including a template extraction model and a template translation model. We proposed a novel method of aligning and abstracting static words from bilingual parallel examples to extracts templates automatically. We also proposed a method to filter out low quality TBMT translations to enhance the combined systems. Moreover, we applied lemmatization and latinization to address the problem data sparsity and fuzzy match. Experimentally, the translation of TBMT outperformed the baselines of phrase-based SMT system and hierarchical phrase-based SMT system. The combined system of the TBMT and the SMT systems also performed better than the baselines. Besides, the coverage can satisfy the combined systems.

Proper integration of speech-to-text (STT) and machine translation (MT) requires special attention to issues such as sentence boundary detection, punctuation, STT accuracy, tokenization, conversion of spoken numbers and dates to written form, optimization of MT decoding weights, and scoring. We discuss these issues, and show that a carefully tuned STT/MT integration can lead to significant translation accuracy improvements compared to simply feeding the regular STT output to a text MT system.

TI Machine translation of English speech: Comparison of multiple algorithms
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB In order to improve the efficiency of the English translation, machine translation is gradually and widely used. This study briefly introduces the neural network algorithm for speech recognition. Long short-term memory (LSTM), instead of traditional recurrent neural network (RNN), was used as the encoding algorithm for the encoder, and RNN as the decoding algorithm for the decoder. Then, simulation experiments were carried out on the machine translation algorithm, and it was compared with two other machine translation algorithms. The results showed that the back-propagation (BP) neural network had a lower word error rate and spent less recognition time than artificial recognition in recognizing the speech; the LSTM-RNN algorithm had a lower word error rate than BP-RNN and RNN-RNN algorithms in recognizing the test samples. In the actual speech translation test, as the length of speech increased, the LSTM-RNN algorithm had the least changes in the translation score and word error rate, and it had the highest translation score and the lowest word error rate under the same speech length.

TI Translating science fiction in a CAT tool: machine translation and

SO TRANSLATION & INTERPRETING-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSLATION AND
   INTERPRETING
AB There is increasing interest in machine assistance for literary translation, but research on how computer-assisted translation (CAT) tools and machine translation (MT) combine in the translation of literature is still incipient, especially for non-European languages. This article presents two exploratory studies where English-to-Chinese translators used neural MT to translate science fiction short stories in Trados Studio. One of the studies compares post-editing with a 'no MT' condition. The other examines two ways of presenting the texts on screen for post -editing, namely by segmenting them into paragraphs or into sentences. We collected the data with the Qualititivity plugin for Trados Studio and describe a method for analysing data collected with this plugin through the translation process research database of the Center for Research in Translation and Translation Technology (CRITT). While post-editing required less technical effort, we did not find MT to be appreciably timesaving. Paragraph segmentation was associated with less post -editing effort on average, though with high translator variability. We discuss the results in the light of broader concepts, such as status-quo bias, and call for more research on the different ways in which MT may assist literary translation, including its use for comparison purposes or, as mentioned by a participant, for 'inspiration'.

TI Identifying the Machine Translation Error Types with the Greatest Impact
   on Post-editing Effort
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB Translation Environment Tools make translators' work easier by providing them with term lists, translation memories and machine translation output. Ideally, such tools automatically predict whether it is more effortful to post-edit than to translate from scratch, and determine whether or not to provide translators with machine translation output. Current machine translation quality estimation systems heavily rely on automatic metrics, even though they do not accurately capture actual post-editing effort. In addition, these systems do not take translator experience into account, even though novices' translation processes are different from those of professional translators. In this paper, we report on the impact of machine translation errors on various types of post-editing effort indicators, for professional translators as well as student translators. We compare the impact of MT quality on a product effort indicator (HTER) with that on various process effort indicators. The translation and post-editing process of student translators and professional translators was logged with a combination of keystroke logging and eye-tracking, and the MT output was analyzed with a fine-grained translation quality assessment approach. We find that most post-editing effort indicators (product as well as process) are influenced by machine translation quality, but that different error types affect different post-editing effort indicators, confirming that a more fine-grained MT quality analysis is needed to correctly estimate actual post-editing effort. Coherence, meaning shifts, and structural issues are shown to be good indicators of post-editing effort. The additional impact of experience on these interactions between MT quality and post-editing effort is smaller than expected.

AB As the mainstream approach in the field of machine translation, neural machine translation (NMT) has achieved great improvements on many rich-source languages, but performance of NMT for low-resource languages ae not very good yet. This paper uses data enhancement technology to construct Mongolian-Chinese pseudo parallel corpus, so as to improve the translation ability of Mongolian-Chinese translation model. Experiments show that the above methods can improve the translation ability of the translation model. Finally, a translation model trained with large-scale pseudo parallel corpus and integrated with soft context data enhancement technology is obtained, and its BLEU value is 39.3.

AB Cross-language retrieval systems use queries in one natural language to guide retrieval of documents that might be written in another. Acquisition and representation of translation knowledge plays a central role in this process. This paper explores the utility of two sources of translation knowledge for cross-language retrieval. We have implemented six query translation techniques that use bilingual term lists and one based on direct use of the translation output from an existing machine translation system; these are compared with a document translation technique that uses output from the existing machine translation system. Average precision measures on a TREC collection suggest that arbitrarily selecting a single dictionary translation is typically no less effective than using every translation in the dictionary, that query translation using a machine translation system can achieve somewhat better effectiveness than simpler techniques, and that document translation mag result in further improvements in retrieval effectiveness under some conditions.

TI Does Machine Translation Affect International Trade? Evidence from a
   Large Digital Platform
SO MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is surpassing human performance in a growing number of domains. However, there is limited evidence of its economic effects. Using data from a digital platform, we study a key application of AI: machine translation. We find that the introduction of a new machine translation system has significantly increased international trade on this platform, increasing exports by 10.9%. Furthermore, heterogeneous treatment effects are consistent with a substantial reduction in translation costs. Our results provide causal evidence that language barriers significantly hinder trade and that AI has already begun to improve economic efficiency in at least one domain.

It employs Universal Networking Language (UNL) as a common formal framework to encode the specific grammar features for both languages by employing the semantic networks. The implementation presents a developed lexical database in UNL framework by using a specific combination of grammar knowledge (mostly inflectional morphological rules) as well as semantic knowledge (lexical relations and definitions) in order to maintain the translation equivalency in processing both languages for machine translation purposes.

TI Towards achieving a delicate blending between rule-based translator and
   neural machine translator
SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
AB Popular translators such as Google, Bing, etc., perform quite well when translating among the popular languages such as English, French, etc.; however, they make elementary mistakes when translating the low-resource languages such as Bengali, Arabic, etc. Google uses Neural Machine Translation (NMT) approach to build its multilingual translation system. Prior to NMT, Google used Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) approach. However, these approaches solely depend on the availability of a large parallel corpus of the translating language pairs. As a result, a good number of widely spoken languages such as Bengali, remain little explored in the research arena of artificial intelligence. Hence, the goal of this study is to explore improvized translation from Bengali to English. To do so, we study both the rule-based translator and the corpus-based machine translators (NMT and SMT) in isolation, and in combination with different approaches of blending between them. More specifically, first, we adopt popular corpus-based machine translators (NMT and SMT) and a rule-based machine translator for Bengali to English translation. Next, we integrate the rule-based translator with each of the corpus-based machine translators separately using different approaches. Besides, we perform rigorous experimentation over different datasets to report the best performance score for Bengali to English translation till today by revealing a comparison among the different approaches in terms of translation performance. Finally, we discuss how our different blending approaches can be re-used for other low-resource languages.

AB We have constructed a translation system to use easily even for beginners. In order to translate Japanese into Braille, we programmed in Python and C language using MeCab, a morphological analysis engine. However, there are many exceptions in Braille grammar, and the programming has become complicated. In recent years, researches on the machine translation using a neural network are thriving, so we carried out braille translation using the technology of neural machine translation (NMT) this time. Tensorflow was used as a library of neural network. We also incorporated a transform which was a translation component in the open source library Tensor2Tensor. We used 100,000 words of Japanese as teacher data. By using NMT, the morphological engine and the complicated programming become unnecessary. Also, MNT can translate without worrying about the complex Braille grammar. Then, just by entering Japanese sentence, the Braille codes are output. There are many advantages. We describe the braille translation using NMT.

TI Lexical Diversity in Statistical and Neural Machine Translation
SO INFORMATION
AB Neural machine translation systems have revolutionized translation processes in terms of quantity and speed in recent years, and they have even been claimed to achieve human parity. However, the quality of their output has also raised serious doubts and concerns, such as loss in lexical variation, evidence of "machine translationese", and its effect on post-editing, which results in "post-editese". In this study, we analyze the outputs of three English to Slovenian machine translation systems in terms of lexical diversity in three different genres. Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, we analyze one statistical and two neural systems, and we compare them to a human reference translation. Our quantitative analyses based on lexical diversity metrics show diverging results; however, translation systems, particularly neural ones, mostly exhibit larger lexical diversity than their human counterparts. Nevertheless, a qualitative method shows that these quantitative results are not always a reliable tool to assess true lexical diversity and that a lot of lexical "creativity", especially by neural translation systems, is often unreliable, inconsistent, and misguided.

AB The 'domestication norm' has been frequently identified as a feature of news translation. However, a paradigm shift in translational behaviour in news production might be underway, coinciding in time with the democratisation of free machine translation services. An analysis of a corpus of science-journalism articles published in a 'hyperlocal' Spanish medium, including reactions from readers, will confirm this hypothesis. Exploring the effects and implications of the adoption of (scarcely) post-edited machine translation procedures in the production of digital news will offer grounds for delineating alternatives to the 'mechanistic' translation practices that are on the rise in contemporary journalism.

We show that author's gender has a powerful, clear signal in originals texts, but this signal is obfuscated in human and machine translation. We then propose simple domain-adaptation techniques that help retain the original gender traits in the translation, without harming the quality of the translation, thereby creating more personalized machine translation systems.

SO INFORMATICA-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATICS
AB To align different ontologies, it is necessary to find effective ways to achieve interoperability of information in the context of the Semantic Web. The development of accurate and reliable techniques to automatically perform this task, it is becoming more and more crucial as overlap between ontologies grows proportionally. In order to solve the problem that traditional machine translation cannot meet the needs of users because of the slow translation speed. According to the characteristics of Ontology's domain knowledge concept system, deep neural network learning model based machine translation method is proposed. Through the experimental design, we examine the translation time and BLEU score and other indicators. After junior translators use the tools, the translation time is reduced by 34.0% and the BLEU score increases by 7.59; after the senior translators use the tools, the translation time is reduced by 11.3%, and the BLEU score is increased by 1.67. Analysis of the experimental results shows that the essence of this method is to complement translation skills, so it is more effective for junior translators who are not good enough in translation skills. The machine translation method based on deep neural network learning can significantly improve the quality and efficiency of translation.

TI Design of Intelligent Recognition English Translation Model Based on
   Deep Learning
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS
AB Nowadays, the intercommunication and translation of global languages has become an indispensable condition for friendly communication among human beings around the world. The advancement of computer technology developed the machine translation from academic research to industrial applications. Additionally, a new and popular branch of machine learning is deep learning which has achieved excellent results in research fields such as natural language processing. This paper improved the performance of machine translation based on deep learning network and studied the intelligent recognition of English-Chinese machine translation models. This research mainly focused on solving out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem of machine translation on unregistered words and rare words. Moreover, it combined stemming technology and data compression algorithm Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and proposed a different subword-based word sequence segmentation method. Using this method, the English text is segmented into word sequences composed of subword units, and, at the same time, the Chinese text is segmented into character sequences composed of Chinese characters using unigram. Secondly, the current research also prevented the decoder from experiencing incomplete translation. Furthermore, it adopted a deep-attention mechanism that can improve the decoder's ability to obtain context information. Inspired by the traditional attention calculation process, this work uses a two-layer calculation structure in the improved attention to focus on the connection between the context vectors at different moments of the decoder. Based on the neural machine translation model Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT), this paper conducted experimental analysis on the above improved methods on three different scale datasets. Experimental results verified that the improved method can solve OOV problem and improve accuracy of model translation.

TI Assessing Human Post-Editing Efforts to Compare the Performance of Three
   Machine Translation Engines for English to Russian Translation of
   Cochrane Plain Language Health Information: Results of a Randomised
   Comparison
SO INFORMATICS-BASEL
AB Cochrane produces independent research to improve healthcare decisions. It translates its research summaries into different languages to enable wider access, relying largely on volunteers. Machine translation (MT) could facilitate efficiency in Cochrane's low-resource environment. We compared three off-the-shelf machine translation engines (MTEs)-DeepL, Google Translate and Microsoft Translator-for Russian translations of Cochrane plain language summaries (PLSs) by assessing the quantitative human post-editing effort within an established translation workflow and quality assurance process. 30 PLSs each were pre-translated with one of the three MTEs. Ten volunteer translators post-edited nine randomly assigned PLSs each-three per MTE-in their usual translation system, Memsource. Two editors performed a second editing step. Memsource's Machine Translation Quality Estimation (MTQE) feature provided an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered estimate of how much editing would be required for each PLS, and the analysis feature calculated the amount of human editing after each editing step. Google Translate performed the best with highest average quality estimates for its initial MT output, and the lowest amount of human post-editing. DeepL performed slightly worse, and Microsoft Translator worst. Future developments in MT research and the associated industry may change our results.

TI SWOT Analysis of the Inclusion of Machine Translation and PostEditing in
   the Master's Degrees Offered in the EMT Network
SO JOURNAL OF SPECIALISED TRANSLATION
AB Machine translation has traditionally been linked to the translator's technological skills. However, the imperatives of the market have fostered the figure of the post-editor, understood not as an expert in machine translation systems, but as a professional in charge of revising and modifying the text proposed by the machine. This fact forces trainers to introduce these contents during the degree and to offer a greater specialisation during postgraduate studies. For this reason, in the present paper, taking into account the role that post-editing and machine translation are playing in the industry, the different Master's degrees in the European Master's in Translation (EMT) network are analysed in order to examine whether these contents are included in their syllabuses and with what degree of specialization. For that purpose, the information about the different subjects and modules offered in the EMT Master's degrees was collected and explored using the technique of content analysis. Taking this data as a starting point, a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis will be presented in order to identify internal and external factors that could be influencing the teaching of post-editing and machine translation in the EMT network.

TI An Overview of the Shared Task on Machine Translation in Indian
   Languages (MTIL) - 2017
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB In recent years, the multilingual content over the internet has grown exponentially together with the evolution of the internet. The usage of multilingual content is excluded from the regional language users because of the language barrier. So, machine translation between languages is the only possible solution to make these contents available for regional language users. Machine translation is the process of translating a text from one language to another. The machine translation system has been investigated well already in English and other European languages. However, it is still a nascent stage for Indian languages. This paper presents an overview of the Machine Translation in Indian Languages shared task conducted on September 7-8, 2017, at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, India. This machine translation shared task in Indian languages is mainly focused on the development of English-Tamil, English-Hindi, English-Malayalam and English-Punjabi language pairs. This shared task aims at the following objectives: (a) to examine the state-of-the-art machine translation systems when translating from English to Indian languages; (b) to investigate the challenges faced in translating between English to Indian languages; (c) to create an open-source parallel corpus for Indian languages, which is lacking. Evaluating machine translation output is another challenging task especially for Indian languages. In this shared task, we have evaluated the participant's outputs with the help of human annotators. As far as we know, this is the first shared task which depends completely on the human evaluation.

TI Improving the Translation Environment for Professional Translators
SO INFORMATICS-BASEL
AB When using computer-aided translation systems in a typical, professional translation workflow, there are several stages at which there is room for improvement. The SCATE (Smart Computer-Aided Translation Environment) project investigated several of these aspects, both from a human-computer interaction point of view, as well as from a purely technological side. This paper describes the SCATE research with respect to improved fuzzy matching, parallel treebanks, the integration of translation memories with machine translation, quality estimation, terminology extraction from comparable texts, the use of speech recognition in the translation process, and human computer interaction and interface design for the professional translation environment. For each of these topics, we describe the experiments we performed and the conclusions drawn, providing an overview of the highlights of the entire SCATE project.

TI An optimized cognitive-assisted machine translation approach for natural
   language processing
SO COMPUTING
AB Currently, computer-aided machine translation (MT) processes play a significant role in natural language processing used to translate a specified language into another language like English to Spanish, Latin to French. During the translation process, and particularly during phrase composition, MT systems may exhibit several issues, including failure to produce high quality translations, increased time consumption, diminished linguistic precision and complexity. This research introduces an optimized cognitive assisted statistical MT process that is intended to reduce these difficulties. This process uses a supervised machine learning technique (OCSMT-SMT) for natural language processing that is intended to translate phrases with a higher degree of precision than other Support Vector Machine, Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbor MT techniques. The method introduced here uses semantic operations to examine the collected messages that are processed in network and obtained results have been stored in the memory to get the exact translation which helps to learn phrase semantics using MT. The OCSMT-SMT approach enables smarter, faster decision making regarding phrase translations, which greatly reduces translation time. The efficiency of this approach is evaluated using the bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) and Better Evaluation as Ranking (BEER) metrics for English language phrase datasets in English language. This ensures the high precision while performing the MT process.

TI Word Re-Segmentation in Chinese-Vietnamese Machine Translation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB In isolated languages, such as Chinese and Vietnamese, words are not separated by spaces, and a word may be formed by one or more syllables. Therefore, word segmentation (WS) is usually the first process that is implemented in the machine translation process. WS in the source and target languages is based on different training corpora, and WS approaches may not be the same. Therefore, the WS that results in these two languages are not often homologous, and thus word alignment results in many 1-n and n-1 alignment pairs in statisticalmachine translation, which degrades the performance ofmachine translation. In this article, we will adjust the WS for both Chinese and Vietnamese in particular and for isolated language pairs in general andmake the word boundary of the two languages more symmetric in order to strengthen 1-1 alignments and enhance machine translation performance. We have tested this method on the Computational Linguistics Center's corpus, which consists of 35,623 sentence pairs. The experimental results show that our method has significantly improved the performance of machine translation compared to the baseline translation system, WS translation system, and anchor language-based WS translation systems.

TI Universals in machine translation? A corpus-based study of
   Chinese-English translations by WeChat Translate
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CORPUS LINGUISTICS
AB By examining and comparing the linguistic patterns in a self-built corpus of Chinese-English translations produced by WeChat Translate, the latest online machine translation app from the most popular social media platform (WeChat) in China, this study explores such questions as whether or not and to what extent simplification and normalization (hypothesized Translation Universals) exhibit themselves in these translations. The results show that, whereas simplification cannot be substantiated, the tendency of normalization to occur in the WeChat translations can be confirmed. The research finds that these results are caused by the operating mechanism of machine translation (MT) systems. Certain salient words tend to prime WeChat's MT system to repetitively resort to typical language patterns, which leads to a significant overuse of lexical chunks. It is hoped that the present study can shed new light on the development of MT systems and encourage more corpus-based product-oriented research on MT.

We investigated the use of machine translation (MT) plus human post-editing (PE) to produce Chinese translations of public health materials. We collected 60 documents that had been manually translated from English to traditional Chinese. The English versions were translated to Chinese using MT and assessed for errors and time required to correct via PE. Results suggest poor initial translation may explain the lack of quality translations despite PE.

AB Neural machine translation (NMT) has obtained significant performance improvement over the recent years. However, NMT models still face various challenges including fragility and lack of style flexibility. Moreover, current methods for instance-level constraints are limited in that they are either constraint-specific or model-specific. To this end, we propose prompt-driven neural machine translation to incorporate prompts for enhancing translation control and enriching flexibility. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both prompt responding and translation quality. Through human evaluation, we further show the flexibility of prompt control and the efficiency in human-in-the-loop translation.

A detailed study of divergence issues in machine translation is required for their proper classification and detection. The language divergences between English and Sanskrit can be considered as representing the divergences between SVO and SOV classes of languages. This topic needs exploration to identify different sources of translation divergence between English and Sanskrit. This paper discusses translation patterns between English and Sanskrit to identifying the potential topics of translation divergences. We take Dorr's (1993, 1994) classification of translation divergence as the base to examine the different types of translation divergence in English and Sanskrit. The work in this paper is the only one to our knowledge that describes translation divergence in the framework of computational linguistics in English and Sanskrit.

AB Machine translation is able to support cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) applications given the availability of high-quality translation resources. This study explores the effectiveness of machine translation for the domain of earthquake engineering within the bounds of Chinese-to-English CLIR applications. The writers first defined and then applied a set of procedures to generate Chinese-to-English translation resources for the selected domain. The generated resources are unique and different from general dictionaries or corpora because they address the Chinese segmentation process and are especially oriented for information retrieval (IR) applications. To test the quality of the resources, the writers converted a test collection of documents from Chinese into English through machine translation and conducted trial retrieval runs on the translated documents using different retrieval models. For comparison purposes, the same retrieval runs were also tested on the expert-written English translations. The results suggest that IR-based machine translation was able to yield results comparable to that of human translation and the generated resources had the potential to enable greater sharing of earthquake engineering information across languages while reducing manual translation efforts.

Machine translation models were prepared on WMT 2017 English-German and English-Turkish datasets, for all translation directions, and the evaluation includes reference metric results as well as a targeted analysis of case preservation accuracy. Inline casing, where case information is marked along lowercased words in the training data, proved to be the optimal approach overall in these experiments.

SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
AB In the process of globalization, machine translation has undergone a long period of evolution and development. Although the development level of machine translation has been greatly improved, the quality of machine translation is still not very high, and it is difficult to meet the needs of users. Artificial intelligence is the science that studies the laws of human intelligent activity. The application of artificial intelligence technology in the English depression and depression, combined with the Internet and intelligent knowledge base, can develop English translation systems to solve the problem of English translation to a certain extent. Based on the above background, the research content of this article is a neural network-based artificial intelligence technology English translation system based on the intelligent knowledge base. This article is mainly based on the existing English-Chinese machine translation to find a more favorable method for English long sentence translation. By improving part-of-speech tagging and rules, the rules can match more sentence patterns to improve the quality of existing machine translations. This paper proposes an improved hybrid recommendation algorithm, and through experimental simulation, the results show that the accuracy of the algorithm is not very high. The highest is 35.64%. The possible reason may be that the k value is selected during k-means text clustering, or the N value recommended by TopN is not selected properly, but the hybrid recommendation is still better than ordinary collaborative filtering.

TI Incorporating Statistical Machine Translation Word Knowledge Into Neural
   Machine Translation
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Neural machine translation (NMT) has gained more and more attention in recent years, mainly due to its simplicity yet state-of-the-art performance. However, previous research has shown that NMT suffers from several limitations: source coverage guidance, translation of rare words, and the limited vocabulary, while statistical machine translation (SMT) has complementary properties that correspond well to these limitations. It is straightforward to improve the translation performance by combining the advantages of two kinds of models. This paper proposes a general framework for incorporating the SMT word knowledge into NMT to alleviate above word-level limitations. In our framework, the NMT decoder makes more accurate word prediction by referring to the SMT word recommendations in both training and testing phases. Specifically, the SMT model offers informative word recommendations based on the NMT decoding information. Then, we use the SMT word predictions as prior knowledge to adjust the NMT word generation probability, which unitizes a neural network based classifier to digest the discrete word knowledge. In this paper, we use two model variants to implement the framework, one with a gating mechanism and the other with a direct competition mechanism. Experimental results on Chinese-to-English and English-to-German translation tasks show that the proposed framework can take advantage of the SMT word knowledge and consistently achieve significant improvements over NMT and SMT baseline systems.

AB Automatic translation allows people around the globe to communicate with one another. However, state-of-the art machine translation is still unable to capture fine-grained meaning. This paper introduces the idea of using Web image selections in text-to-text translation, specifically for lacunae, which are words that do not have a translation in another language. We asked human professional translators to rank Google translate translations of lacunae in German and Dutch. We then compared that ranking with a ranking based on color histograms of Web image data of the words. We found there is viable potential in the idea of using images to address lacunae in the field of machine translation. We publicly release a dataset and our code for others to explore this potential. Finally, we provide an outlook on research directions that would allow this idea to be used in practice.

TI Dual-level interactive multimodal-mixup encoder for multi-modal neural
   machine translation
SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE
AB Multi-modal neural machine translation (MNMT), which mainly focuses on the use of image information to guide text translation. Recent MNMT approaches have been shown that incorporating visual features into textual translation framework is helpful to improve machine translation. However, visual features always contain textual unrelated information, but the noisy visual feature fusion problem is rarely considered for traditional MNMT methods. How to extract the useful visual features to enhance textual machine translation is the key point need to be considered for MNMT. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-level Interactive Multimodal-Mixup Encoder (DLMulMix) based on multimodal-mixup for MNMT, which can extract the useful visual features to enhance textual-level machine translation. We first employ the Textual-visual Gating to extract text related visual features, which we believe that regional features are crucial for MNMT. Then visual grid features are employed in order to establish the image context of the effective regional features. Moreover, an effective visual-textual multimodal-mixup is adopted to align textual features and visual features into multi-modal common space to improve textual-level machine translation. We evaluate our proposed method on the Multi30K dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the previous efforts for both EN-DE and EN-FR tasks regarding BLEU and METEOR scores.

SO TEXTO LIVRE-LINGUAGEM E TECNOLOGIA
AB Despite fast development of machine translation, the output quality is less than acceptable in certain language pairs. The aim of this paper is to determine the types of errors in machine translation output that cause comprehension problems to potential readers. The study is based on a reading task experiment using eye tracking and a retrospective survey as a complementary method to add more value to the research as eye tracking as a method is considered to be problematic and challenging (O'BRIEN, 2009; ALVES et al., 2009). The cognitive evaluation approach is used in an eye tracking experiment to determine the complexity of the errors in the English-Lithuanian language pair from easiest to hardest as seen by the readers of a machine-translated text. The tested parameters - gaze time and fixation count - demonstrate that a different amount of cognitive effort is required to process different types of errors in machine-translated texts. The current work aims at contributing to other research in the Translation Studies field by providing the analysis of error assessment of machine translation output.

TI Multimodality information fusion for automated machine translation
SO INFORMATION FUSION
AB Machine translation is a popular automation approach for translating texts between different languages. Although traditionally it has a strong focus on natural language, images can potentially provide an additional source of information in machine translation. However, there are presently two challenges: (i) the lack of an effective fusion method to handle the triangular-mapping function between image, text, and semantic knowledge; and (ii) the accessibility of large-scale parallel corpus to train a model for generating accurate machine translations. To address these challenges, this work proposes an effective multimodality information fusion method for automated machine translation based on semi-supervised learning. The method fuses multimodality information, texts and images to deliver automated machine translation. Specifically, our objective fuses multimodalities with alignment in a multimodal attention network, which advances the method through the power of mapping text and image features to their semantic information with accuracy. Moreover, a semi-supervised learning method is utilized for its capability in using a small number of parallel corpus for supervised training on the basis of unsupervised training. Conducted on the Multi30k dataset, the experimental results shows the promising performance of our proposed fusion method compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems have been shown to perform impressively on many language pairs compared to Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). However, these systems are data-intensive, which is problematic for the majority of language pairs, and especially for low-resource languages. In this work, we address this issue in the case of certain Arabic dialects, those variants of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) that are spelling non-standard, morphologically rich, and yet resource-poor variants. Here, we have experimented with several multitasking learning strategies to take advantage of the relationships between these dialects. Despite the simplicity of this idea, empirical results show that several multitasking learning strategies are capable of achieving remarkable performance compared to statistical machine translation. For instance, we obtained the BLUE scores for the Algerian. Modern-Standard-Arabic and the Moroccan. Palestinian of 35.06 and 27.55, respectively, while the scores obtained with a statistical method are 15.1 and 18.91 respectively. We show that on 42 machine translation experiments, and despite the use of a small corpus, multitasking learning achieves better performance than statistical machine translation in 88% of cases.

AB Neural machine translation (NMT) has achieved great success. However, collecting large-scale parallel data for training is costly and laborious. Recently, unsupervised neural machine translation has attracted more and more attention, due to its demand for monolingual corpus only, which is common and easy to obtain, and its great potentials for the low-resource or even zero-resource machine translation. In this work, we propose a general framework called Polygon-Net, which leverages multi auxiliary languages for jointly boosting unsupervised neural machine translation models. Specifically, we design a novel loss function for multi-language unsupervised neural machine translation. In addition, different from the literature that just updating one or two models individually, Polygon-Net enables multiple unsupervised models in the framework to update in turn and enhance each other for the first time. In this way, multiple unsupervised translation models are associated with each other for training to achieve better performance. Experiments on the benchmark datasets including UN Corpus and WMT show that our approach significantly improves over the two-language based methods, and achieves better performance with more languages introduced to the framework.

TI Quantum neural network based machine translator for English to Hindi
SO APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
AB This paper presents the machine translation system for English to Hindi which is based on the concept of machine learning of semantically correct corpus. The machine learning process is based on quantum neural network (QNN), which is a novel approach to recognize and learn the corpus pattern in a realistic way. It presents the structure of the system, machine translation system and the performance results. System performs the task of translation using its knowledge gained during learning by inputting pair of sentences from source to target language i.e. English and Hindi. Like a person, the system also acquires the necessary knowledge required for translation in implicit form by inputting pair of sentences. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been analyzed by using 4600 sentences of news items from various newspapers and from Brown Cuprous. During simulations and evaluation, BLEU score achieved 0.9814 accuracy, NIST score achieved 7.3521, ROUGE-L score achieved 0.9887, METEOR score achieved 0.7254 and human based evaluation achieved 98.261%. The proposed system achieved significantly higher accuracy than AnglaMT, Anuvadaksh, Bing and Google Translation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The data consists of English sources - texts from news and reviews - and their translations into Russian and Croatian, as well as of the subcorpus containing translations of the review texts into Finnish. All target languages represent mid-resourced and less or mid-investigated ones. The corpus will be valuable for studying variation in translation as it allows a direct comparison between human translations of the same source texts. The corpus will also be a valuable resource for evaluating machine translation systems. We believe that this resource will facilitate understanding and improvement of the quality issues in both human and machine translation. In the paper, we describe how the data was collected, provide information on translator groups and summarise the differences between the human translations at hand based on our preliminary results with shallow features.

AB In statistical machine translation systems, it is a common practice to use one set of weighting parameters in scoring the candidate translations from a source language to a target language. In this paper, we challenge the assumption that only one set of weights is sufficient to pick the best candidate translation for all source language sentences. We propose a new technique that generates a different set of weights for each input sentence. Our technique outperforms the popular tuning algorithm MERT on different datasets using different language pairs.

AB The popularization of ubiquitous computing equipment and the development of network communication technology have greatly improved the productivity of human language information. The quality of large-scale language information is a key factor affecting the effectiveness of deep learning algorithms. How to filter low quality corpus from large-scale corpus that is unstructured, non-standardized, and even contains fallacies, to obtain high quality corpus has become a research issue of great application value. We focus on the specific filtering issue of bilingual parallel corpus, re-examine the manual filtering process, and propose an ensemble machine translation filtering idea. From the perspective of translation direction, we design and implement a single-engine-based ensemble machine translation filtering framework and algorithm, and from the translation system perspective, we design and implement a multi-engine-based framework and algorithm respectively. Experimental results show that the single-engine-based algorithm can integrate the advantages of different machine translation directions, and the multi-engine-based one can integrate the advantages of different machine translation systems. Using the straightforward methods of Levenshtein string morphological similarity and linear weighted ensemble can implement efficient industrial-grade corpus filtering.

TI Characteristics recognition and soft multimedia system for Japanese
   machine translation and edge-driven hardware implementations
SO SOFT COMPUTING
AB With the development of recent economic globalization, international exchanges and cooperation are increasingly frequent and in-depth. In this process, there is a serious obstacle, that is, language differences. Therefore, the development of high-quality and practical machine translation system is of great significance. Japan has a close relationship with China, so it is necessary to acquire and process Japanese information. Japanese translation is the basis of Japanese information processing, which plays an important role in cross language information retrieval, machine translation, information extraction and other practical applications. In recent years, machine translation has made remarkable progress, but there is still much room for improvement in the quality of translation. Multimedia assisted instruction is an important application of computer technology. Therefore, this paper realizes the feature recognition and hardware structure of Japanese machine translation; for the efficient implementation of the model, the edge-driven model is combined. The proposed model is implemented through the edge devices and the performance of the model is validated through the testing. The recognition accuracy is much higher than the traditional models and the robustness is higher.

TI A Maximum-Entropy Segmentation Model for Statistical Machine Translation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Segmentation is of great importance to statistical machine translation. It splits a source sentence into sequences of translatable segments. We propose a maximum-entropy segmentation model to capture desirable phrasal and hierarchical segmentations for statistical machine translation. We present an approach to automatically learning the beginning and ending boundaries of cohesive segments from word-aligned bilingual data without using any additional resources. The learned boundaries are then used to define cohesive segments in both phrasal and hierarchical segmentations. We integrate the segmentation model into phrasal statistical machine translation (SMT) and conduct experiments on the newswire and broadcast news domain to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed segmentation model on a large-scale training data. Our experimental results show that the maximum-entropy segmentation model significantly improves translation quality in terms of BLEU. We further validate that 1) the proposed segmentation model significantly outperforms syntactic constraints which are used in previous work to constrain segmentations; and 2) it is necessary to capture hierarchical segmentations besides phrasal segmentations.

AB Chinese phonologic features play an important role not only in the sentence pronunciation but also in the construction of a native Chinese sentence. To improve the machine translation performance, in this paper we propose a novel phonology-aware neural machine translation (PA-NMT) model where Chinese phonologic features are leveraged for translation tasks with Chinese as the target. A separate recurrent neural network (RNN) is constructed in NMT framework to exploit Chinese phonologic features to help facilitate the generation of more native Chinese expressions. We conduct experiments on two translation tasks: English-to-Chinese and Japanese-to-Chinese tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on these two tasks.

AB There has been a good deal of research on machine speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) in Japan, and this article presents these and our own recent research on automatic simultaneous speech translation. The S2ST system is basically composed of three modules: large vocabulary continuous automatic speech recognition (ASR), machine text-to-text translation (MT) and textto-speech synthesis (TTS). All these modules need to be multilingual in nature and thus require multilingual speech and corpora for training models. S2ST performance is drastically improved by deep learning and large training corpora, but many issues still still remain such as simultaneity, paralinguistics, context and situation dependency, intention and cultural dependency. This article presents current on-going research and discusses issues with a view to next-generation speech-tospeech translation.

AB While recent advances in deep learning led to significant improvements in machine translation, neural machine translation is often still not able to continuously adapt to the environment. For humans, as well as for machine translation, bilingual dictionaries are a promising knowledge source to continuously integrate new knowledge. However, their exploitation poses several challenges: The system needs to be able to perform one-shot learning as well as model the morphology of source and target language.
   In this work, we proposed an evaluation framework to assess the ability of neural machine translation to continuously learn new phrases. We integrate one-shot learning methods for neural machine translation with different word representations and show that it is important to address both in order to successfully make use of bilingual dictionaries. By addressing both challenges we are able to improve the ability to translate new, rare words and phrases from 30% to up to 70%. The correct lemma is even generated by more than 90%.

AB Statistical machine translation (SMT) system requires homogeneous training data in order to get domain-sensitive terminology translations. If the data is multi-domain mixed, it is difficult for SMT system to learn translation probability of context-sensitive terminology. However, terminology translation is important for SMT. The previous work mainly focuses on integrating terminology into machine translation systems and heavily relies on domain terminology resources. In this paper, we propose a back translation based method to identify terminology translation errors from SMT outputs and automatically suggest a better translation. Our approach is simple with no external resources and can be applied to any type of SMT system. We use three metrics: tree-edit distance, sentence semantic similarity and language model perplexity to measure the quality of back translation. Experimental results illustrate that our method improves performance on both weak and strong SMT systems, yielding a precision of 0.48% and 1.51% respectively.

TI An error analysis for image-based multi-modal neural machine translation
SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB In this article, we conduct an extensive quantitative error analysis of different multi-modal neural machine translation (MNMT) models which integrate visual features into different parts of both the encoder and the decoder. We investigate the scenario where models are trained on an in-domain training data set of parallel sentence pairs with images. We analyse two different types of MNMT models, that use global and local image features: the latter encode an image globally, i.e. there is one feature vector representing an entire image, whereas the former encode spatial information, i.e. there are multiple feature vectors, each encoding different portions of the image. We conduct an error analysis of translations generated by different MNMT models as well as text-only baselines, where we study how multi-modal models compare when translating both visual and non-visual terms. In general, we find that the additional multi-modal signals consistently improve translations, even more so when using simpler MNMT models that use global visual features. We also find that not only translations of terms with a strong visual connotation are improved, but almost all kinds of errors decreased when using multi-modal models.

AB We present a different perspective on the machine translation problem that relies upon continuous-space probabilistic models for words and phrases. Within this perspective we propose a method called Tied-Mixture Machine Translation (TMMT) that uses a trainable parametric model employing Gaussian mixture probability density functions to represent word- and phrase pairs. In the new perspective, machine translation is treated in the same way as acoustic modeling in speech recognition. This new treatment carries several potential advantages that may improve state-of-the-art machine translation systems, including better generalization to unseen events; adaptation to new domains, languages, genres, and speakers via methods such as Maximum-Likelihood Linear Regression (MLLR); and improved discrimination through discriminative training methods such as Maximum Mutual Information Estimation (MMIE). Our goal in this paper, however, is to introduce the new approach and demonstrate its viability, leaving investigation of some of the potential advantages to future work. To this end, we report some preliminary experiments demonstrating the viability of the proposed method.

AB The article considers the issues related to the semantic, grammatical, stylistic and technical difficulties currently present in machine translation and compares its four main approaches: Rule-based (RBMT), Corpora-based (CBMT), Neural (NMT), and Hybrid ( HMT). It also examines some "open systems", which allow the correction or augmentation of content by the users themselves ("crowdsourced translation"). The authors of the article, native speakers presenting different countries (Russia, Greece, Malaysia, Japan and Serbia), tested the translation quality of the most representative phrases from the English, Russian, Greek, Malay and Japanese languages by using different machine translation systems: PROMT ( RBMT), Yandex. Translate (HMT) and Google Translate (NMT). The test results presented by the authors show low "comprehension level" of semantic, linguistic and pragmatic contexts of translated texts, mistranslations of rare and culture-specific words, unnecessary translation of proper names, as well as a low rate of idiomatic phrase and metaphor recognition. It is argued that the development of machine translation requires incorporation of literal, conceptual, and contentand-contextual forms of meaning processing into text translation expansion of metaphor corpora and contextological dictionaries, and implementation of different types and styles of translation, which take into account gender peculiarities, specific dialects and idiolects of users. The problem of untranslatability (`linguistic relativity') of the concepts, unique to a particular culture, has been reviewed from the perspective of machine translation. It has also been shown, that the translation of booming Internet slang, where national languages merge with English, is almost impossible without human correction.

TI How MT errors correlate with postediting effort: a new ranking of error
   types
SO ASIA PACIFIC TRANSLATION AND INTERCULTURAL STUDIES
AB As a result of the rapid development of translation technologies such as machine translation (MT), the global translation industry has inevitably entered a stage of intensive human-machine interaction. A clear manifestation of this is the industrial shift from the traditional workflow of translating from scratch to a new paradigm in which translations are produced by postediting, i.e., translating by fixing the errors in machine-translated texts). Recently, this shift has been expedited by the advent of neural machine translation, a new MT approach that delivers higher output quality in various domains and language pairs. However, although the core of postediting is the identification and correction of the errors generated by MT systems, more research is still in need on how MT errors correlate with postediting effort (the human effort demanded to postedit a machine-translated text). This paper reports on a preliminary study that examines the correlation between translation error types and cognitive postediting effort using empirical data on participants' pauses in the postediting process. It is found that cognitive effort expended on an error is positively correlated with the stretch of text in which the error is embedded.

AB Deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved great success in several research areas like information retrieval, image processing, and speech recognition. In the field of machine translation, neural machine translation (NMT) has been able to overcome the statistical machine translation (SMT), which has been the dominant technology for a long-term span of time. The recent machine translation approach, which consists of two sub networks named an encoder and a decoder, has gained state-of-the-art performance on different benchmarks and for several language pairs. The increasing interest of researchers in NMT is due to its simplicity compared to SMT which consists of several components tuned separately. This paper describes the evolution of NMT. The different attention mechanism architectures are discussed and the purpose of each. The paper also presents some toolkits that are developed specifically for research and production of NMT systems. The superiority of NMT over SMT is discussed, as well as the problems facing NMT.

AB Training neural machine translation models requires large amount of diverse training corpora. It poses a challenge for collecting sufficient data. In addition, labeling monolingual corpus demands professional knowledge in certain domain. Building collaboration between different institutes produces other problems such as legality of data exchange and commercial data leakage.
   In this paper, we proposed a federated neural machine translation model FedNMT to train a robust machine translation system without sharing raw data from participants. By applying FedNMT, neural machine translation (NMT) systems can be ameliorated from the corpus held by different contributors without directly exposing them to one another. This approach preserves the user privacy by utilizing the federated learning framework, encryption techniques. In the federated learning paradigms, a global model is distributed to user clients, and a central server is built to aggregate the learning parameters and update the gradients. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our model in comparison with the data-centralized model.

AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is currently the most promising approach for machine translation. The attention mechanism is a successful technique in modern Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially in tasks like machine translation. The recently proposed network architecture of the Transformer is based entirely on attention mechanisms and achieves a new state of the art results in neural machine translation, outperforming other sequence-to-sequence models. Although it is successful in a resource-rich setting, its applicability for low-resource language pairs is still debatable. Additionally when the language pair is morphologically rich and also when the corpora is multidomain, the lack of a large parallel corpus becomes a significant barrier. In this study, we explore different NMT algorithms - Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer based NMT, to translate the Tamil to Sinhala language pair. Where we clearly see transformer outperforms LSTM by 2.43 BLEU score for Tamil to Sinhala direction. And this work provides a preliminary comparison of statistical machine translation (SMT) and Neural Machine Translation (NMT) for Tamil to Sinhala in the open domain context.

TI The explanatory power of descriptive translation studies in the machine
   translation era
SO PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATION THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB Machine translation (MT) accounts for the largest, and increasingly growing, proportion of translated text produced today, yet the most influential theoretical frameworks developed in translation studies had preceded the contemporary MT era by decades. The question arises as to whether these theories are well-equipped to capture the makeup of today's corpus-based MT. The current article examines and compares the explanatory power of different theoretical frameworks with regard to MT processes and phenomena. The article discusses the incongruences between corpus-based MT algorithms and major paradigms of (human) translation such as natural equivalence, Skopos theory, and poststructuralist approaches. The article then argues that Descriptive Translation Studies (DTS), in its classic formulation introduced and advanced by Gideon Toury, is the theoretical approach that best corresponds to, and is the most useful framework for conceptualizing, the features of corpus-based MT - and, consequently, of an overwhelming proportion of the translation produced today for multilingual communication and understanding.

TI A human evaluation of English-Slovak machine translation
SO PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATION THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB The paper aims to obtain an error profile for machine translation (MT) from English into Slovak. We present an adjusted framework for MT evaluation, which is based on Vanko's categorical framework, but reflects machine translation peculiarities of synthetic and/or inflectional languages. Based on the framework, we analyse the errors generated by Google Translate and identify the most frequent categories of errors occurring in machine translation when translating newspaper articles from English into Slovak. While we have seen research on widely-spoken languages, such as English or other major official EU languages, little is known about Slovak, which is also an official EU language. This paper provides the first human MT evaluation study of English-Slovak machine translation using professional translators for a more detailed depiction of translation quality. Our research has revealed that the highest numbers of errors occurred in the sphere of lexical semantics, as well as in syntactic-semantic correlativeness, both being closely related. Additionally, based on the results of the Cochran Q test, we show how individual MT errors located in the examined categories differ in co-incidence and in how they impact translation quality.

TI Named Entity Correction in Neural Machine Translation Using the
   Attention Alignment Map
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Featured Application machine translation; information retrieval; text-to-speech. Neural machine translation (NMT) methods based on various artificial neural network models have shown remarkable performance in diverse tasks and have become mainstream for machine translation currently. Despite the recent successes of NMT applications, a predefined vocabulary is still required, meaning that it cannot cope with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) or rarely occurring words. In this paper, we propose a postprocessing method for correcting machine translation outputs using a named entity recognition (NER) model to overcome the problem of OOV words in NMT tasks. We use attention alignment mapping (AAM) between the named entities of input and output sentences, and mistranslated named entities are corrected using word look-up tables. The proposed method corrects named entities only, so it does not require retraining of existing NMT models. We carried out translation experiments on a Chinese-to-Korean translation task for Korean historical documents, and the evaluation results demonstrated that the proposed method improved the bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) score by 3.70 from the baseline.

AB Neural machine translation has recently achieved promising results with the big scale corpus. But there is little research on the small scale corpus, such as Mongolian. Mongolian belongs to the agglutinative language while Chinese is a pictograph. It is necessary to do some pre-processing for both Mongolian and Chinese before training the machine translation. In this paper, we successfully build an attention-based neural machine translation to do the CWMT2009 Mongolian to Chinese translation task. We also use four different approaches, respectively, to do the pre-processing for both Mongolian and Chinese, including segmenting Chinese into character, separating the Mongolian stem from the suffixes, addressing the case suffix and converting Mongolian into Latin. We carry out a lot of experiments to evaluate the approaches. We achieve the best BLEU with the score of 29.56. It is 1.82 points in BLEU score higher than the baseline which is trained with the original Mongolian and the general word segmentation of Chinese.

AB Language is the main carrier of communication between cultures, but the translation between languages has become the biggest problem of people's communication. Machine translation is a process that uses computer to transform a natural language into another natural language. The automatic evaluation of machine translation is an important research content in machine translation technology. It can discover defects in translation system and promote its development. It has achieved rich fruits, and various evaluation methods emerge endlessly after several decades of development of the automatic evaluation method. In this paper, three kinds of representative evaluation methods are introduced and their respective advantages and disadvantages are analyzed. In addition, we describe the evaluation technique based on reference. It plays an important role in improving the performance of automatic evaluation methods although the coverage expansion of reference is not the main method. Finally, we summarize the development trends of automatic evaluation metric based on extended reference and related issues that need to be further addressed.

TI Interactive cross-language document selection
SO INFORMATION RETRIEVAL
AB The problem of finding documents written in a language that the searcher cannot read is perhaps the most challenging application of cross-language information retrieval technology. In interactive applications, that task involves at least two steps: ( 1) the machine locates promising documents in a collection that is larger than the searcher could scan, and ( 2) the searcher recognizes documents relevant to their intended use from among those nominated by the machine. This article presents the results of experiments designed to explore three techniques for supporting interactive relevance assessment: (1) full machine translation, (2) rapid term-by-term translation, and ( 3) focused phrase translation. Machine translation was found to better support this task than term-by-term translation, and focused phrase translation further improved recall without an adverse effect on precision. The article concludes with an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the evaluation framework used in this study and some remarks on implications of these results for future evaluation campaigns.

AB Parliament Hansard is one of the most precious texts made available to the public. In Malaysia, the parliament Hansard records the debate and discussions in Malay language. Topic modelling, sentiment analysis, relation extractions, trend prediction or temporal analyses are frequently applied on parliament Hansard to discover interesting patterns. However, most of the matured tools for such processing tasks work on English text. As such, before the Malaysian parliament Hansard can be further processed, it is essential to translate the Malay text into English. Several machine translation approaches have been surveyed in this paper. From the literature review, neural machine translation, particularly the Transformer Model has been proven to provide promising results in translating different languages. In this paper, we present our implementation of neural machine translation for Malay to English text. The experimental design shows that with a good set of parallel corpus and minimal fine-tuning, neural MT can achieve as high as 35.42 in BLEU score.

The problem of confidence measure can be seen as a process of testing: we want to decide whether the most probable sequence of words provided by the machine translation system is correct or not. In the following we describe several original word-level confidence measures for machine translation, based on mutual information, n-gram language model and lexical features language model. We evaluate how well they perform individually or together, and show that using a combination of confidence measures based on mutual information yields a classification error rate as low as 25.1% with an F-measure of 0.708.

AB Most of the neural machine translation methods are devoted to using syntactic information at one end of the Encoder-Decoder framework. They didn't use syntactic information at both ends, so that the syntactic information cannot be fully utilized to improve the translation effect. There are still errors due to insufficient grammar information. In order to solve this problem and make full use of syntactic information, we proposed a new tree-to-tree neural machine translation model. Syntax tree is added to the encoder as priori knowledge, and the bidirectional tree is used to obtain the information of the syntax tree, thereby generating a high-quality representation. At the same time, syntax structure is also added to the decoder to guide sentence generation. The experiment was carried out on Chinese-English language pairs, which proved to improve the effect of the neural machine translation.

TI Multi-way, multilingual neural machine translation
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB We propose multi-way, multilingual neural machine translation. The proposed approach enables a single neural translation model to translate between multiple languages, with a number of parameters that grows only linearly with the number of languages. This is made possible by having a single attention mechanism that is shared across all language pairs. We train the proposed multi-way, multilingual model on ten language pairs from WMT'15 simultaneously and observe clear performance improvements over models trained on only one language pair. We empirically evaluate the proposed model on low-resource language translation tasks. In particular, we observe that the proposed multilingual model outperforms strong conventional statistical machine translation systems on Turkish-English and Uzbek-English by incorporating the resources of other language pairs.

In parlicular, we represent the entire translation model with a single WFST that is statically optimized, in contrast to previous work that represents the translation model as multiple WFST's that must be composed on the fly. We describe a new search algorithm that conveniently and efficiently combines multiple knowledge sources during decoding. The proposed approach is particularly suitable for converged realtime speech translation on scalable computing devices. We were able to develop a SMT system that can translate more than 3000 words/second while still retaining excellent accuracy.

TI Research on Neural Network Machine Translation Model Based on Entity
   Tagging Improvement
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB Machine translation, as an efficient tool, can achieve equivalent conversion between different languages while preserving the original semantics. At present, machine translation models based on deep neural networks have become a hot research topic in the fields of natural language processing and image processing. However, the randomness of neural networks leads to the existing neural network machine translation models unable to effectively reflect the linguistic dependencies and having unsatisfactory results when dealing with long sentence sequences. To solve these two problems, a new neural network machine translation model with entity tagging improvement is proposed. First, for the low-frequency word translation problem, UNK entity tags replacement is used to compensate for the weakness of the randomness of neural networks and the encoding/decoding strategy of entity tagging is improved. Then, on the basis of the LSTM translation model, an attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically adjust the degree of influence of the context at the source language end on the target language sequence to improve the feature learning ability of the translation model in processing long sentences. The analysis of the experimental results shows that the translation evaluation index BLEU of the proposed translation model is significantly improved compared with various translation models, which verifies its effectiveness.

TI Adding Visual Information to Improve Multimodal Machine Translation for
   Low-Resource Language
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB Machine translation makes it easy for people to communicate across languages. Multimodal machine translation is also one of the important directions of research in machine translation, which uses feature information such as images and audio to assist translation models in obtaining higher quality target languages. However, in the vast majority of current research work has been conducted on the basis of commonly used corpora such as English, French, German, less research has been done on low-resource languages, and this has left the translation of low-resource languages relatively behind. This paper selects the English-Hindi and English-Hausa corpus, researched on low-resource language translation. The different models we use for image feature information extraction are fusion of image features with text information in the text encoding process of translation, using image features to provide additional information, and assisting the translation model for translation. Compared with text-only machine translation, the experimental results show that our method improves 3 BLEU in the English-Hindi dataset and improves 0.47 BLEU in the English-Hausa dataset. In addition, we also analyze the effect of image feature information extracted by different feature extraction models on the translation results. Different models pay different attention to each region of the image, and ResNet model is able to extract more feature information compared to VGG model, which is more effective for translation.

TI Research on Translation Style in Machine Learning Based on Linguistic
   Quantitative Characteristics Perception
SO SENSORS AND MATERIALS
AB Research on the metrological characteristics of linguistic quantitative characteristics (LQCs) based on corpus and metrological linguistic methods has gained wide attention in artificial and online machine translations. Although a support vector machine (SVM) is one of the most widely used machine learning (ML) algorithms in the field of text analysis, its application in the study of translation style is rare. This study compares the translation styles of Pride and Prejudice with ML using different linguistic measurement features. Firstly, the language measurement features of three translations are obtained with the information gain algorithm. Specifically, the corpus can be achieved through human-machine interaction (HCI), i.e., computers can look, hear, touch, smell, taste, and speak using sensors such as cameras and mathematical algorithms. Then a text classifier, i.e., an SVM, is constructed on the basis of these features to automatically classify the translated texts of the three translations. Finally, the validity of the classifier is verified by the tenfold cross-validation method. It is proved that the SVM algorithm has high classification accuracy and a strong predictive function, which is helpful for judging or predicting the translation or translator's style. Compared with the traditional method, this classification method based on an SVM saves time and effort, the process can be repeated, and the result is accurate and reliable.

This study aimed at measuring the level of intelligibility and accuracy of real-time chat messages translated instantly by translation bots embedded in GoogleTalk. The data consisted of chat scripts of a total of 12 sessions conducted between three pairs formed each of a native English- and Russian-speaker. The participants also answered a questionnaire about their chat experiences. The results suggest that even without any knowledge of the language of the other party, participants were able to conduct conversations on various topics without encountering any serious communication breakdown.

TI Improving Neural Machine Translation with AMR Semantic Graphs
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB The Seq2Seq model and its variants (ConvSeq2Seq and Transformer) emerge as a promising novel solution to the machine translation problem. However, these models only focus on exploiting knowledge from bilingual sentences without paying much attention to utilizing external linguistic knowledge sources such as semantic representations. Not only do semantic representations can help preserve meaning but they also minimize the data sparsity problem. However, to date, semantic information remains rarely integrated into machine translation models. In this study, we examine the effect of abstract meaning representation (AMR) semantic graphs in different machine translation models. Experimental results on the IWSLT15 English-Vietnamese dataset have proven the efficiency of the proposed model, expanding the use of external language knowledge sources to significantly improve the performance of machine translation models, especially in the application of low-resource language pairs.

AB Neural machine translation (NMT) has been bringing exciting news in the field of machine translation since its emergence. However, because NMT only employs single neural networks to convert natural languages, it suffers from two drawbacks in terms of reducing translation time: NMT is more sensitive to sentence length than statistical machine translation and the end-to-end implementation process fails to make explicit use of linguistic knowledge to improve translation performance. The network model performance of various deep learning machine translation tasks was constructed and compared in English-Chinese bilingual direction, and the defects of each network were solved by using an attention mechanism. The problems of gradient disappearance and gradient explosion are easy to occur in the recurrent neural network in the long-distance sequence. The short and long-term memory networks cannot reflect the information weight problems in long-distance sequences. In this study, through the comparison of examples, it is concluded that the introduction of an attention mechanism can improve the attention of context information in the process of model generation of the target language sequence, thus translating restore degree and fluency higher. This study proposes a neural machine translation method based on the divide-and-conquer strategy. Based on the idea of divide-and-conquer, this method identifies and extracts the longest noun phrase in a sentence and retains special identifiers or core words to form a sentence frame with the rest of the sentence. This method of translating the longest noun phrase and sentence frame separately by the neural machine translation system, and then recombining the translation, alleviates the poor performance of neural machine translation in long sentences. Experimental results show that the BLEU score of translation obtained by the proposed method has improved by 0.89 compared with the baseline method.

AB Video-guided machine translation, as one type of multimodal machine translations, aims to engage video contents as auxiliary information to address the word sense ambiguity problem in machine translation. Previous studies only use features from pretrained action detection models as motion representations of the video to solve the verb sense ambiguity, leaving the noun sense ambiguity a problem. To address this problem, we propose a video-guided machine translation system by using both spatial and motion representations in videos. For spatial features, we propose a hierarchical attention network to model the spatial information from object-level to video-level. Experiments on the VATEX dataset show that our system achieves 35:86 BLEU-4 score, which is 0:51 score higher than the single model of the SOTA method.

AB One of the key obstacles in automatic evaluation of machine translation systems is the reliance on a few (typically just one) human-made reference translations to which the system output is compared. We propose a method of capturing millions of possible translations and implement a tool for translators to specify them using a compact representation. We evaluate this new type of reference set by edit distance and correlation to human judgements of translation quality.

AB While machine translation has traditionally relied on large amounts of parallel corpora, a recent research line has managed to train both Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems using monolingual corpora only. In this paper, we identify and address several deficiencies of existing unsupervised SMT approaches by exploiting subword information, developing a theoretically well founded unsupervised tuning method, and incorporating a joint refinement procedure. Moreover, we use our improved SMT system to initialize a dual NMT model, which is further fine-tuned through on-the-fly back-translation. Together, we obtain large improvements over the previous state-of-the-art in unsupervised machine translation. For instance, we get 22.5 BLEU points in English-to-German WMT 2014, 5.5 points more than the previous best unsupervised system, and 0.5 points more than the (supervised) shared task winner back in 2014.

AB This paper describes CAiRE's submission to the unsupervised machine translation track of the WMT' 19 news shared task from German to Czech. We leverage a phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBSMT) model and a pre-trained language model to combine word-level neural machine translation (NMT) and subword-level NMT models without using any parallel data. We propose to solve the morphological richness problem of languages by training byte-pair encoding (BPE) embeddings for German and Czech separately, and they are aligned using MUSE (Conneau et al., 2018). To ensure the fluency and consistency of translations, a rescoring mechanism is proposed that reuses the pre-trained language model to select the translation candidates generated through beam search. Moreover, a series of pre-processing and post-processing approaches are applied to improve the quality of final translations.

AB Idiom translation is a challenging problem in machine translation because the meaning of idioms is non-compositional, and a literal (word-by-word) translation is likely to be wrong. In this paper, we focus on evaluating the quality of idiom translation of MT systems. We introduce a new evaluation method based on an idiom-specific blacklist of literal translations, based on the insight that the occurrence of any blacklisted words in the translation output indicates a likely translation error. We introduce a dataset, CIBB (Chinese Idioms Blacklists Bank), and perform an evaluation of a state-of-the-art Chinese -> English neural MT system. Our evaluation confirms that a sizable number of idioms in our test set are mistranslated (46.1%), that literal translation error is a common error type, and that our blacklist method is effective at identifying literal translation errors.

AB Processing of multi-word expressions (MWEs) is well known 'pain in the neck' of human language technology researchers. The problem of MWE treatment affects almost any natural language processing task, including different levels of text analysis and automated translation. It is extremely complicated task for machine translation (MT), as it includes identification, alignment and translation. Many on-line machine translation systems translate MWEs as phrases, not as one complex unit. In this paper several experiments are presented where possible ways how statistical MT system could learn translations are investigated. Although there is no significant improvement achieved in automatic evaluation, manual inspection of translations revealed some improvement in fluency and adequacy of translations.

This system is implemented as a subsystem of Myanmar to English translation system and based on statistical approach by using Myanmar-English Bilingual corpus. It also uses two types of information: language model and translation model. The source language model is based on N-gram method to extract phrases from segmented Myanmar sentences and the translation model is based on syntactic structure, morphology of Myanmar language and Bayes rule to reformulate the translation probability. Experimental results showed that the proposed system gets a BLEU-score improvement of more than 22.08% in comparison with baseline SMT system.

AB India is a country of many languages, diverse regional languages are spoken in different states of India but not all the Indians are the multilingual person. There are a total of 10 prominent scripts and 18 legitimate languages. Many Indians, rural people i.e. distant villagers to be exact, can neither write nor read and can't even understand English, thus employing an effective linguistic interpreter is needed. Machine translation systems, that converts the text of any language to another language, will improve the educated public of Indian without any linguistic barricade. Odia is spoken by most of the people in Odisha & outskirts of Odisha and English, being the official language of India we propose a machine translating system from English to Odia. In this paper, many methodologies of Machine Translation is also defined.

AB With the increasing communication between countries, machine translation has become an important way of communication between ethnic groups in different language systems. In order to further improve the coverage mechanism and vocabulary translation quality of the machine translation model of neural network, this paper will study the machine translation English lexical analysis system based on simple recurrent neural network. In order to improve the effect of word alignment, marking and attention mechanism are introduced into the English lexical analysis model. The experimental results show that the tagging of named entity words in the system can reduce the problem of unregistered words. Combined with the attention mechanism, it can significantly improve the effect of word alignment and label recall. It not only improves the controllability of translation but also has a positive impact on the quality of translation and its application effect in specific scenes. The evaluation of translation quality indicators shows that the system can effectively improve the accuracy and quality of Chinese-English translation.

AB Considerable research has been conducted to obtain translations that reflect contextual information in documents and simultaneous interpretations. Most of the existing studies use concatenation data which merge previous and current sentences for training translation models. Although this corpus improves the performance of the model, ignoring the contextual correlation between the sentences can disturb translation performance. In this study, we introduce a simple and effective method to capture the contextual correlation of the sentence at the document level of the current sentence, thereby learning an effective contextual representation. In addition, the proposed model structure is applied to a separate residual connection network to minimize the loss of the beneficial influence of incorporating the context. The experimental results show that our methods improve the translation performance in comparison with the state-of-the-art baseline of the Transformer in various translation tasks and two benchmark machine translation tasks.

AB The overreliance on large parallel corpora significantly limits the applicability of machine translation systems to the majority of language pairs. Back-translation has been dominantly used in previous approaches for unsupervised neural machine translation, where pseudo sentence pairs are generated to train the models with a reconstruction loss. However, the pseudo sentences are usually of low quality as translation errors accumulate during training. To avoid this fundamental issue, we propose an alternative but more effective approach, extract-edit, to extract and then edit real sentences from the target monolingual corpora. Furthermore, we introduce a comparative translation loss to evaluate the translated target sentences and thus train the unsupervised translation systems. Experiments show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the previous state-of-the-art unsupervised machine translation systems across two benchmarks (English-French and English-German) and two low-resource language pairs (English-Romanian and English-Russian) by more than 2 (up to 3:63) BLEU points.

AB Automatic evaluation of machine translation plays an important role in improving the performance of machine translation systems. In this paper, we firstly introduce three traditional methods of automatic evaluation, including BLEU, NIST and WER. All these methods are based on surface layer information of translations like vocabularies, so we do some studies on the evaluation method using the information of sentence structure. Because the Hierarchical Network of Concepts (HNC) theory thinks that sentence category and format transformations are two most important links in machine translation, we do some researches about sentence category and format transformations, and get the sentence structure information which is composed of sentence category information and format information of every sentence in the bilingual (Chinese and English) translation corpora. Then, considering the traditional methods above, we propose the method of automatic evaluation based on the information of sentence structure and have proved it effective by experiment.

AB Despite the acknowledged importance of translation technology in translation studies programmes and the current ascendancy of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), there has been little reflection to date on how SMT can or should be integrated into the translation studies curriculum. In a companion paper we set out a rationale for including a holistic SMT syllabus in the translation curriculum. In this paper, we show how the priorities and aspirations articulated in that source can be operationalised in the translation technology classroom and lab. We draw on our experience of designing and evaluating an SMT syllabus for a cohort of postgraduate student translators at Dublin City University in 2012. In particular, we report on data derived from a mixed-methods approach that aims to capture the students' view of the syllabus and their self-assessment of their own learning. Using the construct of self-efficacy, we show significant increases in students' knowledge of and confidence in using machine translation in general and SMT in particular, after completion of teaching units in SMT. We report on additional insights gleaned from student assignments, and conclude with ideas for future refinements of the syllabus.

SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB The improvement of machine translation (MT) for languages such as Thai requires access to knowledge reported in past and current research. With the distinctive features of several Asian languages as exhibited by Thai, and the recent change in focus of MT to a neural network-based approach, researchers require knowledge of understanding of these languages to aid further research. The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of the significant research in Thai-English MT that is both a valuable reference for current researchers in the field, as well as being suitable for the non-expert. We include details of the relevant language characteristics and extensive coverage of the important contributions to MT in Thailand. Although the application of neural networks to translation (called 'neural machine translation' (NMT)) is rapidly evolving and not widely reported in academic work involving Thai translation, it has shown potential for languages that require segmentation or have few resources and is therefore of special interest. Translation techniques are in many cases not directly applicable to many Asian languages because of their linguistic features and versatile writing systems, but NMT is already in widespread use in industry for the translation of Asian languages including Thai. Given this relevant success and potential for Thai translation, the aim is to integrate this important area into current literature on Thai-English MT, and to encourage interest and support advancement.

SO OPEN LINGUISTICS
AB Machine translation (MT) has made significant strides and has reached accuracy levels that often make the post-editing (PE) of MT output a viable alternative to manual translation. However, despite professional translators increasingly considering PE as a valid stage in their translation workflow, little has been done to investigate MT output for the purpose of informing training in PE. Against this background, the present project focuses on the handling of tense and aspect configurations in the English translation of Arabic sentences using current neural machine translation (NMT) systems. Using a dataset of representative Arabic sentences, the output of five NMT engines was assessed against reference translations. The investigation reveals regressing accuracy levels when comparing morphological, structural, and contextual tenses. These findings are believed to represent valuable information that contributes to a more informed training in the PE of Arabic-into-English NMT output.

AB In this paper we present ParaMT, a bilingual/multilingual paraphraser to be applied in machine translation. We select paraphrases of support verb constructions and use the NooJ linguistic environment to formalize and generate translation equivalences through the use of dictionary and local grammars with syntactic and semantic content. Our research shows that linguistic paraphrasal knowledge constitutes a key element in conversion of source language into controlled language text that presents more successful translation results.

AB In this paper we illustrate problems encountered together with proposed solutions when machine translation has to deal with languages with different family origins. The languages chosen are Classical Arabic, Mandarin Chinese and French. The machine translation architectures used are an adapted transfer methodology, and a "global" methodology in seven steps, which is new. What is common between the problems encountered is semantics. If one wishes to have machine translation of high quality there are two issues that must be resolved The first of these is the semantic aspect of the linguistic units and the second is that the translation calculus has to be adapted to the languages to be processed.

In-domain and out-of-domain translations from Croatian into English have been obtained from Google Translate, our own statistical machine translation system LegTran, and from a professional translator. These translations have been evaluated by six different automatic metrics. The gains obtained from increasing the number of reference translations have been explored and measured. System level correlation between automatic evaluation metrics is given and the significance of the results is discussed. Bootstrapping, approximate randomization and the sign test have been used for confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.

TI Empirical Analysis of Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation
   System for English to Hindi Language
SO VIETNAM JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Hindi is the national language of India. However, most of the Government records, resolutions, news, etc. are documented in English which remote villagers may not understand. This fact motivates to develop an automatic language translation system from English to Hindi. Machine translation is the process of translating a text in one natural language into another natural language using computer system. Grammatical structure of Hindi language is very much complex than English language. The structural difference between English and Hindi language makes it difficult to achieve good quality translation results. In this paper, phrase-based statistical machine translation approach (PBSMT) is used for translation. Translation, reordering and language model are main working components of a PBSMT system. This paper evaluates the impact of various combinations of these PBSMT system parameters on automated English to Hindi language translation quality. Freely available n-gram-based BLEU metric and TER metric are used for evaluating the results.

AB This paper aims to present the Lao-Thai machine translation (MT). In order to develop the system based on statistical model, the language model was constructed. Due to Lao is a non-segmented language, the input text in Lao language was segmented into sequence of words using syllable longest matching. These segmented words were used to look for Thai corresponding words from the Lao-Thai dictionary and generate all possible translation sentences. Finally, the system selected the most probability of translation using the language model. The translation accuracy of the proposed system was 88.64%. The result shown that, this system outperforms the translation by Google Translate.

AB Hierarchical phrase-based machine translation [1] (Hiero) is a prominent approach for Statistical Machine Translation usually comparable to or better than conventional phrase-based systems. But Hiero typically uses the CKY decoding algorithm which requires the entire input sentence before decoding begins, as it produces the translation in a bottom-up fashion. Left-to-right (LR) decoding [2] is a promising decoding algorithm for Hiero that produces the output translation in left to right order. In this paper we focus on simultaneous translation using the Hiero translation framework. In simultaneous translation, translations are generated incrementally as source language speech input is processed. We propose a novel approach for incremental translation by integrating segmentation and decoding in LR-Hiero. We compare two incremental decoding algorithms for LR-Hiero and present translation quality scores (BLEU) and the latency of generating translations for both decoders on audio lectures from the TED collection.

This article considers the neural machine translation of the Kazakh language on the basis of synthetic corpora. The Kazakh language belongs to the Turkic languages, which are characterised by rich morphology. Neural machine translation of natural languages requires large training data. The article will show the model for the creation of synthetic corpora, namely the generation of sentences based on complete suffixes for the Kazakh language. The novelty of this approach of the synthetic corpora generation for the Kazakh language is the generation of sentences on the basis of the complete system of suffixes of the Kazakh language. By using generated synthetic corpora we are improving the translation quality in neural machine translation of Kazakh-English and Kazakh-Russian pairs.<bold> </bold>

TI A Hierarchical Clustering Approach to Fuzzy Semantic Representation of
   Rare Words in Neural Machine Translation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS
AB Rare words are usually replaced with a single token in the current encoder-decoder style of neural machine translation, challenging the translation modeling by an obscured context. In this article, we propose to build a fuzzy semantic representation (FSR) method for rare words through a hierarchical clustering method to group rare words together, and integrate it into the encoder-decoder framework. This hierarchical structure can compensate for the semantic information in both source and target sides, and providing fuzzy context information to capture the semantic of rare words. The introduced FSR can also alleviate the data sparseness, which is the bottleneck in dealing with rare words in neural machine translation. In particular, our method is easily extended to the transformer-based neural machine translation model and learns the FSRs of all in-vocabulary words to enhance the sentence representations in addition to rare words. Our experiments on Chinese-to-English translation tasks confirm a significant improvement in the translation quality brought by the proposed method.

TI Machine translation, ethics and the literary translator's voice
SO TRANSLATION SPACES
AB Recent work in translation studies has established the literary translator's voice as an ethical concern, but there has been little empirical research so far into how the translator's voice is affected in workflows involving machine translation. In this article, we investigate how the use of neural machine translation influences the textual voice (Alvstad et al. 2017) of renowned translator from English into German, Hans-Christian Oeser. Based on an experiment in which Oeser post-edits an excerpt from a novel he had previously translated, we show how his textual voice is somewhat diminished in his post-edited work compared to its stronger manifestation in his translation work. At the same time Oeser's contextual voice (ibid.) remains strong in his comments on the text he produces in post-editing mode. The article is offered as a methodological intervention and represents an initial attempt to design studies in literary machine translation that put the focus on human translators, allowing their voices to be heard more clearly than has previously been the case.

TI Automated and Human Interaction in Written Discourse: A Contrastive
   Parallel Corpus-based Investigation of Metadiscourse Features in
   Machine-Human Translations
SO SAGE OPEN
AB The rise of the internet has generated a need for fast online translations, which human translators cannot meet. Statistical tools such as Google and Baidu Translate provide automatic translation from one written language to another. This study reports the descriptive comparison of the machine-translation (MT) with human translation (HT), considering the metadiscoursal interactional features. The study uses a parallel corpus consisting of 79 texts translated from Chinese to English by professional human translators and machine translations (Baidu translate & Google translate) and a comparable reference corpus of non-translated English text. The statistical analysis revealed no statistically significant difference between Baidu and Google translate regarding all types of metadiscoursal indicators. However, the findings of this study demonstrate significant disparities in the interactional characteristics of various HT and MT groups. Compared to the metadiscourse features in non-translated English political texts, human translators were found to outperform machine translations in the use of attitude markers. In contrast, the distribution of directives in machine-translated texts is more native-like. In addition, MT and HT have utilized a significantly smaller number of hedges, self-mention, and readers than non-translated texts. Our results indicate that the MT systems, though still calling for further improvement, have shown tremendous growth potential and may complement human translators.

TI Reassessing the proper place of man and machine in translation: a
   pre-translation scenario
SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB Traditionally, human-machine interaction to reach an improved machine translation (MT) output takes place ex-post and consists of correcting this output. In this work, we investigate other modes of intervention in the MT process. We propose a Pre-Edition protocol that involves: (a) the detection of MT translation difficulties; (b) the resolution of those difficulties by a human translator, who provides their translations (pre-translation); and (c) the integration of the obtained information prior to the automatic translation. This approach can meet individual interaction preferences of certain translators and can be particularly useful for production environments, where more control over output quality is needed. Early resolution of translation difficulties can prevent downstream errors, thus improving the final translation quality "for free". We show that translation difficulty can be reliably predicted for English for various source units. We demonstrate that the pre-translation information can be successfully exploited by an MT system and that the indirect effects are genuine, accounting for around 16% of the total improvement. We also provide a study of the human effort involved in the resolution process.

TI Multimodal machine translation through visuals and speech
SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB Multimodal machine translation involves drawing information from more than one modality, based on the assumption that the additional modalities will contain useful alternative views of the input data. The most prominent tasks in this area are spoken language translation, image-guided translation, and video-guided translation, which exploit audio and visual modalities, respectively. These tasks are distinguished from their monolingual counterparts of speech recognition, image captioning, and video captioning by the requirement of models to generate outputs in a different language. This survey reviews the major data resources for these tasks, the evaluation campaigns concentrated around them, the state of the art in end-to-end and pipeline approaches, and also the challenges in performance evaluation. The paper concludes with a discussion of directions for future research in these areas: the need for more expansive and challenging datasets, for targeted evaluations of model performance, and for multimodality in both the input and output space.

AB Humans learn language speaking and translation with the help of common knowledge of the external world, while standard machine translation depends only on parallel corpora. Therefore, zero-resource translation has been proposed to explore a way to make models learn to translate without any parallel corpora but with external knowledge. Current models in the field usually combine an image encoder with a textual decoder, which leads to extra efforts to make use of the original model in machine translation. On the other hand, Transformers have achieved great progress in neural language processing while they are rarely utilized in the field of zero-resource translation with image pivot. In this paper, we investigate how to use visual information as an auxiliary hint for a Transformer-based system in a zero-resource translation scenario. Our model achieves state-of-the-art BLEU scores in the field of zero-resource machine translation with image pivot.

AB Machine translation is one of the most popular areas in natural language processing. WMT is a conference to assess the level of machine translation capabilities of organizations around the world, which is the evaluation activity we participated in. In this review we participated in a two-way translation track from Russian to English and English to Russian. We used official training data, 38 million parallel corpora, and 10 million monolingual corpora. The overall framework we use is the Transformer(Vaswani et al., 2017) neural machine translation model, supplemented by data filtering, post-processing, reordering and other related processing methods. The BLEU(Papineni et al., 2002) value of our final translation result from Russian to English is 38.7, ranking 5th, while from English to Russian is 27.8, ranking 10th.

TI 'Time is money' and the value of translation
SO TRANSLATION SPACES
AB This article uses a multi-faceted approach to discuss the relation between time, money and different perspectives that help define the value of professional translation. It challenges the narratives created by the translation industry on post-editing as a revision of pre-translated content, confronting them with the detailed description of the task in industry standards and with the reality of translators' work. The article also addresses the different roles that time plays as an instrument of analysis and evaluation of translation, and as a fundamental factor in the definition of labour relations in the translation market. The main claim of the article is that translation is increasingly specialised high-value work, requiring translators that are able to make complex and efficient decisions, especially when they are expected to work under time restrictions, with the support of content that has been previously processed by machine translation.

TI Crowdsourced Monolingual Translation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-HUMAN INTERACTION
AB An enormous potential exists for solving certain classes of computational problems through rich collaboration among crowds of humans supported by computers. Solutions to these problems used to involve human professionals, who are expensive to hire or difficult to find. Despite significant advances, fully automatic systems still have much room for improvement. Recent research has involved recruiting large crowds of skilled humans ("crowdsourcing"), but crowdsourcing solutions are still restricted by the availability of those skilled human participants. With translation, for example, professional translators incur a high cost and are not always available; machine translation systems have been greatly improved recently but still can only provide passable translation; and crowdsourced translation is limited by the availability of bilingual humans.
   This article describes crowdsourced monolingual translation, where monolingual translation is translation performed by monolingual people. Crowdsourced monolingual translation is a collaborative form of translation performed by two crowds of people who speak the source or the target language, respectively, with machine translation as the mediating device.
   This article describes a general protocol to handle crowdsourced monolingual translation and analyzes three systems that implemented the protocol. These systems were studied in various settings and were found to supply significant improvement in quality over both machine translation and monolingual editing of machine translation output ("postediting").

AB Location and language have now less impact as barriers for the expansion and the spread of information around the world. Machine translators achieve such a tedious task of translation among languages in quick and reliable manners. However, if compared with human translation, issues related to semantic meanings may always arise. Different machine translators may differ in their effectiveness, and they can be evaluated either by humans or through the use of automatic methods. In this study, we attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of two popular Machine Translation (MT) systems (Google Translate and Babylon machine translation systems) to translate sentences from English to Arabic, where an automatic evaluation method called Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) is used. Our preliminary tests indicated that Google Translate system is more effective in translating English sentences into Arabic in comparison with the Babylon MT system.

AB With the development of electronic personal health records, more patients are gaining access to their own medical records. However, comprehension of medical record content remains difficult for many patients. Because each record is unique, it is also prohibitively costly to employ human translators to solve this problem. In this study, we investigated whether multilingual machine translation could help make medical record content more comprehensible to patients who lack proficiency in the language of the records. We used a popular general-purpose machine translation tool called Babel Fish to translate 213 medical record sentences from English into Spanish, Chinese, Russian and Korean. We evaluated the comprehensibility and accuracy of the translation. The text characteristics of the incorrectly translated sentences were also analyzed. In each language, the majority of the translations were incomprehensible (76% to 92%) and/or incorrect (77% to 89%). The main causes of the translation are vocabulary difficulty and syntactical complexity. A general-purpose machine translation tool like the Babel Fish is not adequate for the translation of medical records; however, a machine translation tool can potentially be improved significantly, if it is trained to target certain narrow domains in medicine.

By sampling from the translation target, we can solve the problem that ordinary training data does not have a restricted vocabulary. With the further help of constrained decoding in the inference phase, we achieved better results than the baseline, confirming the effectiveness of our solution. In addition, we also tried the vanilla and sparse Transformer as the backbone network of the model, as well as model ensembling, which further improved the final translation performance.

AB We introduce the task of isochrony-aware machine translation which aims at generating translations suitable for dubbing. Dubbing of a spoken sentence requires transferring the content as well as the speech-pause structure of the source into the target language to achieve audiovisual coherence. Practically, this implies correctly projecting pauses from the source to the target and ensuring that target speech segments have roughly the same duration of the corresponding source speech segments. In this work, we propose implicit and explicit modeling approaches to integrate isochrony information into neural machine translation. Experiments on English-German/French language pairs with automatic metrics show that the simplest of the considered approaches works best. Results are confirmed by human evaluations of translations and dubbed videos.

AB Language barriers in day to day communication are common in all countries. In Sri Lanka we have a rising need for translation for Sinhala and Tamil to reduce language barriers and the statistical machine translation approach is more suitable for the concerned languages. Statistical machine translation method is one of the most promising and efficient method to perform machine translation for Sri Lankan languages likes Sinhala and Tamil. Statistical approach is more suitable for structurally dissimilar pairs of languages and efficient solution for large text translation. Sinhala and Tamil have a similarity in grammar and statistical approach will help to obtain more accurate results. We have developed a Real-time bi-directional translation system for both Tamil to Sinhala and Sinhala to Tamil for this research. We have used the Sri Lankan parliament corpus to train the language model. We have critically evaluated the both systems with parameter optimizations and have obtained the most accurate and efficient system. We have also utilized the scoring techniques like BLEU [2, 8] & NIST [2] for the system evaluation and we have integrated the MERT technique to tune the decoder.

We approach the task as translation of noisy speech to clean speech. We simplify our translation framework such that it does not require fertility and alignment models. We tested our model on the Switchboard disfluency-annotated corpus. Using an optimized decoder that is developed for phrase-based translation at IBM, we are able to detect repeats, repairs and filled pauses for more than a thousand sentences in less than a second with encouraging results.

TI Terminology Translation in Low-Resource Scenarios
SO INFORMATION
AB Term translation quality in machine translation (MT), which is usually measured by domain experts, is a time-consuming and expensive task. In fact, this is unimaginable in an industrial setting where customised MT systems often need to be updated for many reasons (e.g., availability of new training data, leading MT techniques). To the best of our knowledge, as of yet, there is no publicly-available solution to evaluate terminology translation in MT automatically. Hence, there is a genuine need to have a faster and less-expensive solution to this problem, which could help end-users to identify term translation problems in MT instantly. This study presents a faster and less expensive strategy for evaluating terminology translation in MT. High correlations of our evaluation results with human judgements demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. The paper also introduces a classification framework, TermCat, that can automatically classify term translation-related errors and expose specific problems in relation to terminology translation in MT. We carried out our experiments with a low resource language pair, English-Hindi, and found that our classifier, whose accuracy varies across the translation directions, error classes, the morphological nature of the languages, and MT models, generally performs competently in the terminology translation classification task.

AB There has been relatively little attention to incorporating linguistic prior to neural machine translation. Much of the previous work was further constrained to considering linguistic prior on the source side. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model, called NMT+RNNG, that learns to parse and translate by combining the recurrent neural network grammar into the attention-based neural machine translation. Our approach encourages the neural machine translation model to incorporate linguistic prior during training, and lets it translate on its own afterward. Extensive experiments with four language pairs show the effectiveness of the proposed NMT+RNNG.

TI Statistical Machine Translation Enhancements through Linguistic Levels:
   A Survey
SO ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS
AB Machine translation can be considered a highly interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary field because it is approached from the point of view of human translators, engineers, computer scientists, mathematicians, and linguists. One of the most popular approaches is the Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) approach, which tries to cover translation in a holistic manner by learning from parallel corpus aligned at the sentence level. However, with this basic approach, there are some issues at each written linguistic level (i.e., orthographic, morphological, lexical, syntactic and semantic) that remain unsolved. Research in SMT has continuously been focused on solving the different linguistic levels challenges. This article represents a survey of how the SMT has been enhanced to perform translation correctly at all linguistic levels.

TI Creativity in translation Machine translation as a constraint for
   literary texts
SO TRANSLATION SPACES
AB This article presents the results of a study involving the translation of a short story by Kurt Vonnegut from English to Catalan and Dutch using three modalities: machine-translation (MT), post-editing (PE) and translation without aid (HT). Our aim is to explore creativity, understood to involve novelty and acceptability, from a quantitative perspective. The results show that HT has the highest creativity score, followed by PE, and lastly, MT, and this is unanimous from all reviewers. A neural MT system trained on literary data does not currently have the necessary capabilities for a creative translation; it renders literal solutions to translation problems. More importantly, using MT to post-edit raw output constrains the creativity of translators, resulting in a poorer translation often not fit for publication, according to experts.

AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has drawn much attention due to its promising translation performance in recent years. However, the under-translation and over-translation problem still remain a big challenge. Through error analysis, we find that under-translation is much more prevalent than over-translation and the source words that need to be reordered during translation are more likely to be ignored. To address the under-translation problem, we explore the pre-ordering approach for NMT. Specifically, we pre-order the source sentences to approximate the target language word order. We then combine the pre-ordering model with position embedding to enhance the monotone translation. Finally, we augment our model with the coverage mechanism to tackle the over-translation problem. Experimental results on Chinese-to-English translation have shown that our method can significantly improve the translation quality by up to 2.43 BLEU points. Furthermore, the detailed analysis demonstrates that our approach can substantially reduce the number of under-translation cases by 30:4% (compared to 17:4% using the coverage model).

AB Inflections in Telugu plays a crucial role in maintaining the meaning of the sentence unchanged though the word order is changed. This is possible since inflections are the internal part of the word. Inflecting nouns and pronouns is customary in Telugu. Main attention is given to inflected pronoun translation in this paper. Various categories of inflections and the ways of translation of pronouns are discussed in detail. For analysis, identification and translation of pronoun inflections, a Morphological Analysis System (MAS) that can perform forward and reverse morphology is developed for Machine Translation (MT) (Telugu (Source Language-SL) to Sanskrit (Target Language-TL)).

TI Transfer and Triangulation Pivot Translation Approaches for Burmese
   Dialects
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Parallel corpora for the languages of Myanmar (Beik, Burmese, Rakhine) are extremely scarce but a necessary requirement for machine translation R & D. Previous studies have proved that pivoting leads to better translation quality if the bridge language is closely related to the source and target language pair. The baseline study is conducted based on the three major approaches of machine translation; Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST), Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation (PBSMT) and Deep Recurrent Neural Network (Deep-RNN). Based on the baseline results, this paper mainly investigated the pivot language technique for PBSMT with Burmese dialects. We employed two different pivot translation methods: transfer (sentence level) and triangulation (phrase level). We present the experimental results on Dawei-Beik, Beik-Dawei translations and Beik-Rakhine, Rakhine-Beik translation via Burmese. Both the transfer and triangulation approaches outperformed the baseline (direct translation), specifically for the Rakhine-Beik language pair. Moreover, the results of the average BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU), Character n-gram F-score (chrF), and Word Error Rate (WER) scores of the 10-fold cross-validation experiments proved that the triangulation pivot has significantly better acceleration than the transfer pivot. We plan to release the parallel corpora of Burmese dialects and present several avenues for further research.

AB One of difficulties in Chinese-English machine translation is that the grammatical meaning expressed by morphology or syntax in target translations is usually determined by Chinese function words or word order. In order to address this issue, we develop classifiers to automatically detect usages of common Chinese function words based on Chinese Function usage Knowledge Base (CFKB) and initially propose a function word usage embedding model to incorporate detection results into neural machine translation (NMT). Experiments on the NIST Chinese-English translation task demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain significant improvements on the quality of both translation and word alignment over the NMT baseline.

AB Machine translation (MT) has been the milestone of language understanding, ultimately seeking to provide high quality translation between pairs of languages, which is the genesis of natural language processing (NLP). Hybrid machine translation (HMT) is integrates the core of existing methods, including rule-based MT, statistical-based MT, and example-based MT, which makes up the deficiencies of individual MT method. This paper discusses the typical couplings of translation methods, and pointed out the advantages and deficiencies. Besides these combinations, architecture expansion approaches for system optimization are introduced. This paper also reviews the technologies employed for system evaluation.

AB Quality estimation (QE) for machine translation is the task of evaluating the translation system quality without reference translations. By using the existing translation quality estimation methods, researchers mostly focus on how to extract better features but ignore the translation oriented interaction. In this paper, we propose a QE model for machine translation that integrates multi-granularity interaction on the word and sentence level. On sthe word level, each word of the target language sentence interacts with each word of the source language sentence and yields the similarity, and the L-infinity and entropy of the similarity distribution are employed as the word-level interaction score. On the sentence level, the similarity between the source and the target language translation is calculated to indicate the overall translation quality. Finally, we combine the word-level features and the sentence-level features with different weights. We perform thorough experiments with detailed studies and analyses on the English-German dataset in the WMT19 sentence-level QE task, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

TI Exploring Diverse Features for Statistical Machine Translation Model
   Pruning
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB In phrase-based and hierarchical phrase-based statistical machine translation systems, translation performance depends heavily on the size and quality of the translation table. To meet the requirements of making a real-time response, some research has been performed to filter the translation table. However, most existing methods are always based on one or two constraints that act as hard rules, such as not allowing phrase-pairs with low translation probabilities. These approaches sometimes make constraints rigid because they consider only a single factor instead of composite factors. Based on the considerations above, in this paper, we propose a machine learning-based framework that integrates multiple features for translation model pruning. Experimental results show that our framework is effective by pruning 80% of the phrase-pairs and 70% of the hierarchical rules, while retaining the quality of the translation models when using the BLEU evaluation metric. Our study further shows that our method can select the most useful phrase-pairs and rules, including those that are low in frequency but still very useful.

SO REVISTA DE LLENGUA I DRET-JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE AND LAW
AB The court translation sector is showing considerable growth in demand due to the increasing number of proceedings involving people who do not speak the language used by the authorities, and particularly across the European Union (EU) since the passing of recent legislation that has enshrined the right to translation of essential documents in criminal proceedings (Brannan, 2017). For the translation of legal texts, machine translation (MT) is not viewed with optimism due to its disregard for the purpose and recipient of the translation (e.g., Wiesmann, 2019; Roiss, 2021), despite its potential for saving time and the benefits it offers at the terminological and phraseological levels (Killman, 2014) or at the level of syntax (e.g., Heiss & Soffritti, 2018; Mileto, 2019; Wrede et al., 2020). The aim of this article is to discuss whether translators can benefit from MT when engaging in the challenging yet highly in-demand activity of court translation. This article assesses the quality of English translations of a Spanish remand order produced by three different neural machine translation (NMT) systems (DeepL, eTranslation, and Google Translate), using TAUS evaluation guidelines.

AB Pre-training has proven to be effective in unsupervised machine translation due to its ability to model deep context information in cross-lingual scenarios. However, the cross-lingual information obtained from shared BPE spaces is inexplicit and limited. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-lingual pre-training method for unsupervised machine translation by incorporating explicit cross-lingual training signals. Specifically, we first calculate cross-lingual n-gram embeddings and infer an n-gram translation table from them. With those n-gram translation pairs, we propose a new pre-training model called Cross-lingual Masked Language Model (CMLM), which randomly chooses source n-grams in the input text stream and predicts their translation candidates at each time step. Experiments show that our method can incorporate beneficial cross-lingual information into pre-trained models. Taking pre-trained CMLM models as the encoder and decoder, we significantly improve the performance of unsupervised machine translation.

TI Automatic Recognition Method of Machine English Translation Errors Based
   on Multisignal Feature Fusion
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB The current automatic recognition method of machine English translation errors has poor semantic analysis ability, resulting in low accuracy of recognition results. Therefore, this paper designs an automatic recognition method for machine English translation errors based on multifeature fusion. Manually classify and summarize the real error sentence pairs, falsify a large amount of data by means of data enhancement, enhance the effect and robustness of the machine translation error detection model, and add the source text to translation length ratio information and the translation language model PPL into the model input. The score feature information can further improve the classification accuracy of the error detection model. Based on this error detection scheme, the detection results can be used for subsequent error correction and can also be used for error prompts to provide translation user experience; it can also be used for evaluation indicators of machine translation effects. The experimental results show that the word posterior probability features calculated by different methods have a significant impact on the classification error rate, and adding source word features based on the combination of word posterior probability and linguistic features can significantly reduce the classification error rate, to improve the translation error detection ability.

In the Machine Translation (MT) research community, however, it is a common practice to perform quality assessment using a reference translation instead of the source text. In this paper we show that this practice has a serious issue - annotators are strongly biased by the reference translation provided, and this can have a negative impact on the assessment of MT quality.

TI Social groups in machine translation post-editing A SCOT analysis
SO TRANSLATION SPACES
AB We analysed focus group interview data collected from 22 project managers (PMs) working in Japan, covering their experiences of machine translation post-editing (MTPE). A Social Construction of Technology analysis of how PMs describe different social groups in translation enabled us to examine the meanings those groups attach to MTPE, the intricate and complex power structures which exist between them, and the negotiations that take place in their day-to-day operations. The examination discovered that MTPE is still in a fluid and controversial state due to the difficulty of meeting all groups' interests, which may lead to MTPE's disappearance as a business model and the eventual dominance of conventional human translation and raw MT. We conclude that establishing ethical and sustainable translation workflows for all social groups will be vital for MTPE's survival, which will require careful consideration of the complexity of these social groups and negotiations between them.

TI Post-editing neural machine translation versus translation memory
   segments
SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB The use of neural machine translation (NMT) in a professional scenario implies a number of challenges despite growing evidence that, in language combinations such as English to Spanish, NMT output quality has already outperformed statistical machine translation in terms of automatic metric scores. This article presents the result of an empirical test that aims to shed light on the differences between NMT post-editing and translation with the aid of a translation memory (TM). The results show that NMT post-editing involves less editing than TM segments, but this editing appears to take more time, with the consequence that NMT post-editing does not seem to improve productivity as may have been expected. This might be due to the fact that NMT segments show a higher variability in terms of quality and time invested in post-editing than TM segments that are more similar' on average. Finally, results show that translators who perceive that NMT boosts their productivity actually performed faster than those who perceive that NMT slows them down.

AB State-of-the-art Machine Translation (MT) systems are still far from being perfect. An alternative is the so-called Interactive Machine Translation (IMT). In this paper, we present some novel methods to improve the statistical phrase-based IMT. We utilize dynamic distortion limitation to balance the requirements of long distance reordering and decoding speed. And we introduce the difference function to the translation hypothesis extension as a heuristic function, to make the final translation candidates as diverse as possible. We also use the user validated prefix to direct the word selection of suffix based on a word co-occurrence model. All these methods aim at optimizing the first N-best candidate translations and look forward to reducing the cognitive burden of the users. The experiential results show the effectiveness of our methods.

AB In recent years, the study of machine translation has made great progress. However there are still many things to do for machine translation to reach the semantic level. In this paper, case grammar's features that could well describe the semantic relationships in sentences were concluded. 23 thousand annotation errors that occurred in treebank construction were analyzed. 13 typical problems were summarized and the corresponding revolutions were proposed. The application of case grammar may contribute a new way of thinking for machine translation.

Normally, a certified translation of a legal judgment takes several months to complete. The authors attempted to shorten this time significantly using a unique statistical machine translation system which has attracted the attention of the federal courts in Canada for its accuracy and speed. This paper also describes the results of a human evaluation of the output of the system in the context of a pilot project in collaboration with the federal courts of Canada.

AB Pre-trained transformer-based models, such as BERT, have shown excellent performance in most natural language processing benchmark tests, but we still lack a good understanding of the linguistic knowledge of BERT in Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Our work uses syntactic probes and Quality Estimation (QE) models to analyze the performance of BERT's syntactic dependencies and their impact on machine translation quality, exploring what kind of syntactic dependencies are difficult for NMT engines based on BERT. While our probing experiments confirm that pre-trained BERT "knows" about syntactic dependencies, its ability to recognize them often decreases after fine-tuning for NMT tasks. We also detect a relationship between syntactic dependencies in three languages and the quality of their translations, which shows which specific syntactic dependencies are likely to be a significant cause of low-quality translations.

AB Pattern-Based Machine Translation is one of the machine translation methods which performs syntactic analysis and structure transfer at the same time using bilingual patterns. PBMT is used to expand the length of patterns up to sentence-length in order to reduce ambiguities in translation, but it brought out the problem of rapidly increased patterns. We propose a model which shortens the length of patterns to phrase-length and reduces ambiguities in translation by using two-level translation pattern selection method. In the first level, the proper translation patterns are selected by using a hybrid method of exact example matching and semantic constraint by thesaurus. In the second level, the most natural translation pattern for the verb phrase is selected among the selected translation pattern categories by using statistic information of the target language. By using this proposed model, we could shorten the length of patterns without raising the ambiguities in translation.

AB Information technology has penetrated into all aspects of human life. Nowadays, with the rapid development of science and technology, information technology has gradually become the cornerstone of the development of other technologies. The Internet of Things is an important part of the new generation of information technology. Language is the medium of communication between people. Driven by economic globalization and the development of the Internet, information is growing rapidly, and there are more and more exchanges and exchanges between countries. The emergence of high-efficiency and high-economic machine translation solves these difficulties, and the interactive English translation system is the current research hotspot, which is intended to improve the output translation quality of the English translation system. The main work of this paper is to analyze the existing interactive machine translation technology, especially the interactive machine translation based on a phrase model, using the Internet of Things as a knowledge source. According to the characteristics of segment analysis and human-computer interaction mechanism, from the network, a wealth of information are available from open sources. In this paper, on the basis of the segment analysis, the human-machine cooperation translation strategy of human-machine cooperation with complementary human-machine advantages was discussed, and the system designed was verified. It is proved that the system has high performance in improving the accuracy and recall rate of machine English translation. Compared with the existing English translation system, the accuracy has improved by more than 20% in the case of fewer iterations, and in the case of 90 iterations, the accuracy can improve by 100%.

We tested Google Perspective API first on comments from non-English Wikipedia talk pages in five languages, and then on their English translation (generated with Google's Cloud Translate API). In addition to giving baselines on the current performance of Perspective in five languages, this allows for comparison on how machine-translation alters the classification. We show that the level of disagreement between pre- and post-translation classification is heavily dependent on the language used. The comments come from a Kaggle dataset and we filter them to ensure monolingual comments with simple punctuation. Results show above 84% of the French, Italian and Spanish comments received the same class pre- and post-translation, while Portuguese and Russian performed the worst of the five languages tested, with F-scores below 0.6.

AB Neural Machine Translation recently has become the state-of-the-art approach in Machine Translation. One of the more advanced techniques concerning this approach, the attention model, tends to not use alignments from past translation steps and selects the context word purely using the devised attention score. Unfortunately, this sometimes leads to repetition and omission of important words in translations. To solve this problem, we propose a simple approach using coverage techniques that can be used in conjunction with a diverse number of attention models. Our experiments show that our improved technique increases the quality of translation on both English Vietnamese and Japanese - Vietnamese language pairings.

AB Sequence-to-sequence learning naturally has two directions. How to effectively utilize supervision signals from both directions? Existing approaches either require two separate models, or a multitask-learned model but with inferior performance. In this paper, we propose REDER (REversible Duplex TransformER), a parameterefficient model and apply it to machine translation. Either end of REDER can simultaneously input and output a distinct language. Thus REDER enables reversible machine translation by simply flipping the input and output ends. Experiments verify that REDER achieves the first success of reversible machine translation, which helps outperform its multitask-trained baselines up to 1.3 BLEU.

AB Document-level neural machine translation (DocNMT) has yielded attractive improvements. In this article, we systematically analyze the discourse phenomena in Chinese-to-English translation, and focus on the most obvious ones, namely lexical translation consistency. To alleviate the lexical inconsistency, we propose an effective approach that is aware of the words which need to be translated consistently and constrains themodel to produce more consistent translations. Specifically, we first introduce a global context extractor to extract the document context and consistency context, respectively. Then, the two types of global context are integrated into a encoder enhancer and a decoder enhancer to improve the lexical translation consistency. We create a test set to evaluate the lexical consistency automatically. Experiments demonstrate that our approach can significantly alleviate the lexical translation inconsistency. In addition, our approach can also substantially improve the translation quality compared to sentence-level Transformer.

AB Due to the rapid development of deep neural networks, in recent years, machine translation software has been widely adopted in people's daily lives, such as communicating with foreigners or understanding political news from the neighbouring countries. However, machine translation software could return incorrect translations because of the complexity of the underlying network. To address this problem, we introduce a novel methodology called PaInv for validating machine translation software. Our key insight is that sentences of different meanings should not have the same translation (i.e., pathological invariance). Specifically, PaInv generates syntactically similar but semantically different sentences by replacing one word in the sentence and filter out unsuitable sentences based on both syntactic and semantic information. We have applied PaInv to Google Translate using 200 English sentences as input with three language settings: English -> Hindi, English -> Chinese, and English -> German. PaInv can accurately find 331 pathological invariants in total, revealing more than 100 translation errors.

AB This study explores the post-editing process when working within the newly introduced neural machine translation (NMT) paradigm. To this end, an experiment was carried out to examine the differences between post-editing Google neural machine translation (GNMT) and from-scratch translation of English domain-specific and general language texts to Chinese. We analysed translation process and translation product data from 30 first-year postgraduate translation students. The analysis is based on keystroke logging, screen recording, questionnaires, retrospective protocols and target-text quality evaluations. The three main findings were: 1) post-editing GNMT was only significantly faster than from-scratch translation for domain-specific texts, but it significantly reduced the participants' cognitive effort for both text types; 2) post-editing GNMT generated translations of equivalent fluency and accuracy as those generated by from-scratch translations; 3) the student translators generally showed a positive attitude towards post-editing, but they also pointed to various challenges in the post-editing process. These were mainly due to the influence of their previous translation training, lack of experience in post-editing and the ambiguous wording of the post-editing guidelines.

AB Video-guided machine translation aims to translate a source language description into a target language using the video information as additional spatio-temporal context. Existing methods focus on making full use of videos as auxiliary material, while ignoring the semantic consistency and reducibility between the source language and the target language. In addition, the visual concept is helpful for improving the alignment and translation of different languages but is rarely considered. Toward this end, we contribute a novel solution to thoroughly investigate the video-guided machine translation issue via dual-level back-translation. Specifically, we first exploit a sentence-level back-translation to obtain the coarse-grained semantics. Thereafter, a video concept-level back-translation module is proposed to explore the fine-grained semantic consistency and reducibility. Lastly, a multi-pattern joint learning approach is utilized to boost the translation performance. By experimenting on two real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our proposed solution. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB For translation between language pairs which is lack of bilingual data, pivot-based SMT uses a pivot language as a "bridge" to generate source-target translation, inducing from source-pivot and pivot-target translation. However, due to the missing of the context information, the reordering model was hard to obtain with the conventional methods. In this paper, we present a context-extended phrase reordering model for pivot-based statistical machine translation by extending the context information in source, pivot and target language. Experimental results show that our method leads to significant improvements over the baseline system on European Parliament data.

Following a series of earlier presidency translators, the German version exhibits important extensions and improvements. The German EUC PT is the first to integrate systems from commercial vendors, public services, and a research center, using a mix of custom and generic translation engines, and to introduce a new webpage translation widget. A further important feature is the close collaboration with human translators from the German ministries, who were provided with computer-assisted translation tool plugins integrating machine translation services into their daily work environments. Uptake by the public reflects a huge interest in the service, showing the need for breaking language barriers.

AB With the rapid development of intelligent technology, IELTS translation education has gradually explored a brand-new education model. In order to solve the problems of small scale, slow speed and incomplete domain of the traditional bilingual parallel corpus machine translation, we construct an IELTS translation education corpus based on bilingual non-parallel data model, which can be used to train Moses, an IELTS translation education machine translation model, for better aids of translation education. In the process of construction, parallel sentence pairs are extracted from non-parallel corpus by using the translation retrieval framework represented by word graph, and a translation retrieval model based on bilingual non-parallel data is constructed. The experimental results of training Moses translation model with elementary IELTS translation corpus show that the bilingual non-parallel data model constructed in this paper has good translation retrieval performance. Compared with existing algorithms, the BLEU value extracted from parallel sentence pairs is increased by 2.58. Therefore, the proposed algorithm and corpus will do favor for the machine translation of IELTS. In addition, the retrieval method based on the structure of translation option word graph proposed in this paper is time-efficient and has better performance and efficiency in assisting IELTS translation education.

AB Finding optimal translation is not an easy task as it requires in-depth knowledge of the language to re-encode the meaning into the target language. This paper explores the translation process of a statistical machine translation system from English to Bahasa Indonesia by considering four weight variables i.e. translation model, language model, distortion (reordering) and for word penalty. This translation approach does not require in-depth knowledge of the linguistic properties of the languages. The well-behaved aligned parallel corpus as the training data for the machine translation is used to increase the BLEU and NIST scores in getting better quality translations. One way to enhance the corpus is by increasing the number of words and/or sentences it contains. In this study, the better evaluation score is achieved when we alter the weights of some translation parameters. Our study shows that both the weights and well-behaved aligned parallel corpus play significant roles in improving the translation quality which presented by higher score of NIST and BLEU. Our results show that this approach has better performance than a popular Rule Based Machine Translation (RBMT) system.

AB Machine Translation is the process of translating one natural language into another using automated and computerized means. The proposed system is a rule based multilingual unidirectional translation system which translates English sentences into corresponding Malayalam and Hindi sentences. During translation it incorporates morphological and syntactic information present in the working pair of languages. And it also performs word sense disambiguation, semantic analysis and morphological processing of the generated target sentence. Machine learning based word sense disambiguation and First Order Predicate Logic(FOPL) based semantic checking are the two main features of this paper. The word arrangement in dictionary with POS tags and word sense is an other important factor that can contribute to the efficiency of the translation system. Hence the system can achieve 74% accuracy for both translation which includes all the tenses and different type of sentences in English.

AB The translation quality and parsing efficiency are often disappointed when Rule based Machine Translation systems deal with long sentences. Due to the complicated syntactic structure of the language, many ambiguous parse trees can be generated during the translation process, and it is not easy to select the most suitable parse tree for generating the correct translation. This paper presents an approach to parse and translate long sentences efficiently in application to Rule based Portuguese-Chinese Machine Translation. A systematic approach to break down the length of the sentences based on patterns, clauses, conjunctions, and punctuation is considered to improve the performance of the parsing analysis. On the other hand, Constraint Synchronous Grammar is used to model both source and target languages simultaneously at the parsing stage to further reduce ambiguities and the parsing efficiency.

AB We study the problem of online learning with human feedback in the human-in-the-loop machine translation, in which the human translators revise the machine-generated translations and then the corrected translations are used to improve the neural machine translation (NMT) system. However, previous methods require online model updating or additional translation memory networks to achieve high-quality performance, making them inflexible and inefficient in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel non-parametric online learning method without changing the model structure. This approach introduces two k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) modules: one module memorizes the human feedback, which is the correct sentences provided by human translators, while the other balances the usage of the history human feedback and original NMT models adaptively. Experiments conducted on EMEA and JRC-Acquis benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method obtains substantial improvements on translation accuracy and achieves better adaptation performance with less repeating human correction operations.

AB The limited availability of in-domain training data is a major issue in the training of application-specific neural machine translation models. Professional outsourcing of bilingual data collections is costly and often not feasible. In this paper we analyze the influence of using crowdsourcing as a scalable way to obtain translations of target in-domain data having in mind that the translations can be of a lower quality. We apply crowdsourcing with carefully designed quality controls to create parallel corpora for the educational domain by collecting translations of texts from MOOCs from English to eleven languages, which we then use to fine-tune neural machine translation models previously trained on general-domain data. The results from our research indicate that crowdsourced data collected with proper quality controls consistently yields performance gains over general-domain baseline systems, and systems fine-tuned with pre-existing in-domain corpora.

AB Translating in real-time, a.k.a. simultaneous translation, outputs translation words before the input sentence ends, which is a challenging problem for conventional machine translation methods. We propose a neural machine translation (NMT) framework for simultaneous translation in which an agent learns to make decisions on when to translate from the interaction with a pre-trained NMT environment. To trade off quality and delay, we extensively explore various targets for delay and design a method for beam-search applicable in the simultaneous MT setting. Experiments against state-of-the-art baselines on two language pairs demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework both quantitatively and qualitatively.

The current study investigated undergraduate students' Perspectives on CAT tools and Machine Translation (MT). More specifically, it investigates to what extent CAT tools improve productivity and translation quality. Finally, it also explores the other merits of using CAT tools. The present study used a qualitative analysis and semi-structured interviews to answer the research questions. The findings indicate that most of the students have a positive attitude toward using CAT tools. Furthermore, the findings show that lexical, syntactic, and special use of expressions as well as collocations and words that have cultural connotations were the most challenging that the students encountered when using MT. in addition. Improving productivity, enhancing quality, scalability, and connectivity are the four concepts mentioned by the subjects of the study as merits that made them use the CAT tool for translation other than using machine translation.

In our experiments, we observed that our proposed method does improve the Cantonese to Chinese and Chinese to Cantonese translation by 1.088 and 0.394 BLEU scores. We finally developed a web service based on our ideal approach to provide Cantonese to Chinese Translation and vice versa.

AB The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) project aims to provide a standardized vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities encountered in human disease. Each term in the HPO describes a phenotypic abnormality, such as atrial septal defect. The HPO is currently being developed using the medical literature, Orphanet, DECIPHER, and OMIM. One of the project goals is to translate HPOs into other languages. Unfortunately, this process takes a very long time and is expensive, especially that the FACIT translation methodology is preferable. In this research, we propose translation acceleration using machine translation system which we train. We prove that facilitating freely available machine translation engines and parallel textual resources makes it possible to greatly reduce translation costs and time requirements. Even that our resulting machine translation system performed not too well. Its BLEU score was equal to 26.17 which means that the translations were supposed to be understandable but they were far from publishable quality. This was anticipated as HPOs are very hard and specific, with a very problematic vocabulary that was hardly present in training data. Nonetheless, the translation quality was not as bad to be completely ignored. That is why the decision was made to ask a translation company for opinion. Summing up we successfully reduced money and time costs of the HPO translation process by the factor of 2 and 3 respectively. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Acquisition of English Corpus Machine Translation Based on Speech
   Recognition Technology
SO SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
AB In the present information age, with the rapid development of computer software and hardware technology and the mature manufacturing system of English-speaking enterprises, it is no longer impossible to use statistics for machine translation. The level and quality of machine translation are expected to meet human expectations. This explains the meaning and realization value of the acquisition of English corpus machine translation, introduces the basic principles of speech recognition technology, and combines the characteristics of the English language on the basis of the original Chinese speech recognition system, adopts the technical means of speech recognition, and leads to in-depth research. In the new era of machine translation acquisition of English corpus, we use the combination of LabVIEW and MATLAB to complete the collection, editing, feature extraction, and speech recognition of speech signals and use VQ pattern matching technology to realize the English recognition of a large number of short vocabulary and individuals. In the application part, we applied the classic LabVIEW technology to the speech recognition technology, which actually realized the idea of "software instead of hardware" and achieved better translation results. Experiments show that the accuracy rate of English machine translation can be as high as 94% when using speech recognition technology. According to the results, it takes about 0.2 seconds to complete machine translation for a 30-second speech, which is basically okay to achieve the effect of real-time translation.

TI Integration of Statistical Models for Dictation of Document Translations
   in a Machine-Aided Human Translation Task
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB This paper presents a model for machine-aided human translation (MAHT) that integrates source language text and target language acoustic information to produce the text translation of source language document. It is evaluated on a scenario where a human translator dictates a first draft target language translation of a source language document. Information obtained from the source language document, including translation probabilities derived from statistical machine translation (SMT) and named entity tags derived from named entity recognition (NER), is incorporated with acoustic phonetic information obtained from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. One advantage of the system combination used here is that words that are not included in the ASR vocabulary can be correctly decoded by the combined system. The MAHT model and system implementation is presented. It is shown that a relative decrease in word error rate of 29% can be obtained by this combined system relative to the baseline ASR performance on a French to English document translation task in the Hansard domain. In addition, it is shown that transcriptions obtained by using the combined system show a relative increase in NIST score of 34% compared to transcriptions obtained from the baseline ASR system.

It consists of a hierarchy for the elements of the sentences and a series of rules applied to them at transfer phase. We compare our results against some commercial machine translation systems. Our experiments show that our model outputs more accurate results, a necessary step to get a fairly good and natural translation.

TI Low-resource Neural Machine Translation: Methods and Trends
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) brings promising improvements in translation quality, but until recently, these models rely on large-scale parallel corpora. As such corpora only exist on a handful of language pairs, the translation performance is far from the desired effect in the majority of low-resource languages. Thus, developing low-resource language translation techniques is crucial and it has become a popular research field in neural machine translation. In this article, we make an overall review of existing deep learning techniques in low-resource NMT. We first show the research status as well as some widely used low-resource datasets. Then, we categorize the existing methods and show some representative works detailedly. Finally, we summarize the common characters among them and outline the future directions in this field.

TI Extreme Learning Machine for Huge Hypotheses Re-ranking in Statistical
   Machine Translation
SO COGNITIVE COMPUTATION
AB In statistical machine translation (SMT), a possibly infinite number of translation hypotheses can be decoded from a source sentence, among which re-ranking is applied to sort out the best translation result. Undoubtedly, re-ranking is an essential component of SMT for effective and efficient translation. A novel re-ranking method called Scaled Sorted Classification Re-ranking (SSCR) based on extreme learning machine (ELM) classification and minimum error rate training (MERT) is proposed. SSCR contains four steps: (1) the input features are normalized to the range of 0 to 1; (2) an ELM classification model is constructed for hypothesis ranking; (3) each translation hypothesis is ranked using the ELM classification model; and (4) the highest ranked subset of hypotheses are selected, in which the hypothesis with best predicted score based on MERT (system score) is returned as the final translation result. Compared with the baseline score (lower bound), SSCR with ELM classification can raise the translation quality up to 6.7% in IWSLT 2014 Chinese to English corpus. Compared with the state-of-the-art rank boosting, SSCR has a relatively 7.8% of improvement on BLEU in a larger WMT 2015 English-to-French corpus. Moreover, the training time of the proposed method is about 160 times faster than traditional regression-based re-ranking.

AB For natural translations, a human being does not express predicates that are inferable from the context in a target language. This paper proposes a method of machine translation which handles these predicates. First, to investigate how to translate them, we build a corpus in which predicate correspondences are annotated manually. Then, we observe the corpus, and find alignment patterns including these predicates. In our experimental results, the machine translation system using the patterns demonstrated the basic feasibility of our approach.

AB Natural languages that we use in daily conversation inevitably omit or insert various words. Incomplete sentences such as these may be grammatically correct, but they prevent machine translation systems from correctly interpreting such sentences as they assume meanings only from sentence-to-sentence context. This is largely due to the fact that context is a social product defined by the participants of a party, while translation machines literally translate the information provided by the speakers. The authors of this paper confirmed the effectiveness of syntactic constraint-lead approaches to Collaborative Fusion Machine Translation (CFMT) based on group Rorschach tests, in addition to semantic constraint-lead and syntactic constraint-lead machine translation processes.
   We believe the use of our pragmatic approach to distribute artificial intelligence will open a new frontier for CFMT.

AB Neural machine translation needs a very large volume of data to unfold its potential. Self-learning with back-translation became widely adopted to address this data scarceness bottleneck: a seed system is used to translate source monolingual sentences which are aligned with the output sentences to form a synthetic data set that, when used to retrain the system, improves its translation performance. In this paper we report on the profiling of the self-learning with back-translation aiming at clarifying whether adding more synthetic data always leads to an increase of performance. With the experiments undertaken, we gathered evidence indicating that more synthetic data is better only to some level, after which it is harmful as the translation quality decays.

AB Unlike technologically favored languages, under-resourced languages highly suffer from the lack of language resources for machine translation. In this paper, we present a new approach to overcome the problem of language resources that share significant amount of linguistic resource in the Ometo language family. The dataset for the experiment are collected from religious domain consisting of four Ometo (Wolaita, Gamo, Gofa, and Dawuro) languages paired with English sentence and automatically extracted from the web. The collected corpus were used for conducting neural machine translation experiments from Ometo to English. Among the experiments, the Wolaita, Dawuro and Gamo paired with English sentence combination for training and Gofa for testing gives highest BLEU score 4.5 than the other combinations while the Wolaita, Gamo, and Gofa with Dawuro testing provide the lowest result. The BLEU score of the machine translation system shows a promising result despite the language differences, the morphological richness, and complexity of the Ometo languages which has high impact on the performance of the Ometo-English machine translation. Further, we are now working towards developing a translation system that significantly reduces the effect of morphological richness and complexity of the Ometo languages through different linguistic processing.

TI Improving Arabic neural machine translation via n-best list re-ranking
SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB Even though the rise of the neural machine translation (NMT) paradigm has brought a great deal of improvement to the field of machine translation (MT), the current translation results are still not perfect. One of the main reasons for this imperfection is the decoding task complexity. Indeed, the problem of finding the one best translation from the space of all possible translations was and still is a challenging problem. One of the most successful ways to address it is via n-best list re-ranking which attempts to reorder the n-best decoder translations according to some defined features. In this paper, we propose a set of new re-ranking features that can be extracted directly from the parallel corpus without needing any external tools. The feature set that we propose takes into account lexical, syntactic, and even semantic aspects of the n-best list translations. We also present a method for feature weights optimization that uses a quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm. Our system has been evaluated on multiple English-to-Arabic and Arabic-to-English MT test sets, and the obtained re-ranking results yield noticeable improvements over the baseline NMT systems.

AB We propose a neural machine translation (NMT) approach that, instead of pursuing adequacy and fluency ("human-oriented" quality criteria), aims to generate translations that are best suited as input to a natural language processing component designed for a specific downstream task (a "machine-oriented" criterion). Towards this objective, we present a reinforcement learning technique based on a new candidate sampling strategy, which exploits the results obtained on the downstream task as weak feedback. Experiments in sentiment classification of Twitter data in German and Italian show that feeding an English classifier with machine-oriented translations significantly improves its performance. Classification results outperform those obtained with translations produced by general-purpose NMT models as well as by an approach based on reinforcement learning. Moreover, our results on both languages approximate the classification accuracy computed on gold standard English tweets.

TI Sentence Augmentation for Language Translation Using GPT-2

AB Data augmentation has recently become an important method for improving performance in deep learning. It is also a significant issue in machine translation, and various innovations such as back-translation and noising have been made. In particular, current state-of-the-art model architectures such as BERT-fused or efficient data generation using the GPT model provide good inspiration to improve the translation performance. In this study, we propose the generation of additional data for neural machine translation (NMT) using a sentence generator by GPT-2 that produces similar characteristics to the original. BERT-fused architecture and back-translation are employed for the translation architecture. In our experiments, the model produced BLEU scores of 27.50 for tatoebaEn-Ja, 30.14 for WMT14En-De, and 24.12 for WMT18En-Ch.

TI Approaching textual coherence of machine translation with complex
   network
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C
AB This study analyzes topological properties of complex networks of textual coherence, and investigates the textual coherence of machine translation by contrasting these properties in machine-translated texts with those in a human-translated text. The complex networks of textual coherence are built by drawing on the knowledge from Systemic Functional Linguistics, with Themes and Rhemes denoted as vertices and the semantic connections between them as edges. It is found that the coherence networks are small-world, assortatively mixed, scale-free with an exponential cut-off, and hub-dependent. The basic building blocks consist of fully-connected triads and fully-connected squares, with the latter playing a more significant role in the network construction. Compared with the complex network of human translation, the networks of machine translations have fewer vertices and edges, lower average degree, smaller network diameter, shorter average path length, larger cluster coefficient, bigger assortativeness coefficient and more types of motifs. Thus, we suggest that the machine-translated texts are sparsely, locally, unevenly and monotonously connected, which may account for why and how machine translation is weak in coherence. This study is the first effort ever to employ complex networks to explore textual coherence of machine translations. It may hopefully promote the cross-disciplinary interaction between linguistics, computer science and network science.

TI Recent advances of low-resource neural machine translation
SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB In recent years, neural network-based machine translation (MT) approaches have steadily superseded the statistical MT (SMT) methods, and represents the current state-of-the-art in MT research. Neural MT (NMT) is a data-driven end-to-end learning protocol whose training routine usually requires a large amount of parallel data in order to build a reasonable-quality MT system. This is particularly problematic for those language pairs that do not have enough parallel text for training. In order to counter the data sparsity problem of the NMT training, MT researchers have proposed various strategies, e.g. augmenting training data, exploiting training data from other languages, alternative learning strategies that use only monolingual data. This paper presents a survey on recent advances of NMT research from the perspective of low-resource scenarios.

By comparing the orders of translation units within long Chinese and English NPs, we developed a strategy on how to reorder the translation units according with the expression of English habit. By analyzing the features of translation units within a long Chinese NP, we built some formalized rules to recognize the boundaries of translation units using the boundary words to identify what to reorder. At last, we used a rule-based MT system to test our work, and the experimental results showed that our rule-based method and strategy were very efficient.

AB We propose to improve real-time communication between people who do not share a common language by foregrounding potential problems in machine translation. We developed a prototype chat tool that displays two parallel translations of each chat turn, with the thought that comparing the translations might both highlight problems and provide resources for resolving them. We conducted a user study to investigate how people use and like such an interface compared to a standard one-translation interface. On balance, users preferred two translations to one, using them to both notice differences and infer meaning from uncertain translations, with no increase in workload. This suggests that this interface may help improve cross-lingual communication in practical applications and lays the groundwork for a larger design space around systems that highlight possible errors to support communication.

AB This research was conducted to solve the out-of-vocabulary problem caused by Uyghur spelling errors in Uyghur-Chinese machine translation, so as to improve the quality of Uyghur-Chinese machine translation. This paper assesses three spelling correction methods based on machine translation: 1. Using a Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score; 2. Using a Chinese language model; 3. Using a bilingual language model. The best results were achieved in both the spelling correction task and the machine translation task by using the BLEU score for spelling correction. A maximum F1 score of 0.72 was reached for spelling correction, and the translation result increased the BLEU score by 1.97 points, relative to the baseline system. However, the method of using a BLEU score for spelling correction requires the support of a bilingual parallel corpus, which is a supervised method that can be used in corpus pre-processing. Unsupervised spelling correction can be performed by using either a Chinese language model or a bilingual language model. These two methods can be easily extended to other languages, such as Arabic.

AB The challenge of diverse machine translation is to ensure both diversity and quality, in which diversity desires the distinction between multiple hypotheses in the syntactic or word level, while quality requires hypotheses to be consistent with certain references. Existing work on diverse machine translation, most of which boosts translation diversity but compromises translation quality, either resorts to special search strategies to realize word-level diversity or trains several decoders simultaneously to enable possible syntactic multiplicity. In this work, we propose to improve the translation diversity without a severe drop in quality through constructing a novel translation memory based NMT and designing a global diverse beam search strategy. Specifically, the translation memory retrieved from target-size corpus act as experts to interact with standard NMT, which not only generates various hypotheses, but also enhances the quality to a great degree. Moreover, we exploit a novel diverse beam search to further avoid token reuse across different hypotheses and improve local diversity. Experiments on two benchmarks (JRCAcquis and WMT) demonstrate that our approaches achieve a compelling promotion both of translation quality and diversity compared with other diverse approaches.

TI Research on the LSTM Mongolian and Chinese machine translation based on
   morpheme encoding
SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
AB The neural machine translation model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) has become the mainstream in machine translation with its unique coding-decoding structure and semantic mining features. However, there are few studies on the Mongolian and Chinese neural machine translation combined with LSTM. This paper mainly studies the preprocessing of Mongolian and Chinese bilingual corpus and the construction of the LSTM model of Mongolian morpheme coding. In the corpus preprocessing stage, this paper presents a hybrid algorithm for the construction of word segmentation modules. The sequence that has not been annotated is treated semantically and labeled by a combination of gated recurrent unit and conditional random field. In order to learn more grammar and semantic knowledge from Mongolian corpus, in the model construction stage, this paper presents the LSTM neural network model based on morpheme coding to construct the encoder. This paper also constructs the LSTM neural network decoder to predict the Chinese decode. Experimental comparisons of sentences of different lengths according to the construction model show that the model has improved translation performance in dealing with long-term dependence problems.

AB The world is united socially and technologically with means of languages. Hence there is a big requirement for transfer of information from one language to another. Sanskrit is considered as an important language in the Indo-European family. A lot of work is still required to explore the potential of this language to open vistas in the computational linguistic domain. Currently, Sanskrit-Hindi translation system uses rule-based and statistical approaches. These approaches are not adequate for extending the system to generic and huge domains. In order to remove this problem, an efficient system is required to be developed which would cover various domains. Therefore, a hybrid system combining the best of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Rule-Based Machine Translation (RBMT) is developed and presented in this paper. The proposed hybrid model has a BLEU score of 61.2% which is higher than other existing systems i.e 41%. This approach uses deep learning feature to overcome drawbacks of the existing systems. Experimental results show that the proposed hybrid system using deep learning model has a high accuracy of 99%. It is also evaluated that it has less response time and more speed than existing systems.

AB `Although there is a requirement for English to Indian language translation, there are no proper and enough tools for the translators to use, because of the complexities involved in it. The research in developing Machine translation systems is going on but they are not yet to the stage of product or useful systems development. Major reason is the word level, phrase level and semantic level translation complexities involved because of the different cultures and use of the languages and non availability of good quality Translation Memories. Translation memories are widely used by translation industry because of their ease of use, ability to create glossaries, terminologies and phrasal dictionaries in a domain. It also helps maintain writing styles throughout the series of documents. Also, Human Machine Interface is better for human translators. On the other hand Machine Translation (MT) systems when tuned properly produce better translations for simpler sentences. Complex and compound sentences are difficult for MT to translate solely by machines. Post editing by human is required. This paper proposes integration of these two methods to get the respective advantages of both the systems providing better translation support systems for translators to work faster without compromising quality and help human translator to maintain proper writing styles intact. The concept was validated with a small experiment using a widely used TM tool (Wordfast) and English to Indian Language Rule Based Machine Translation system provided by IIT Kanpur.

SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
AB Aiming at the problems of low accuracy of English phrase part of speech recognition, poor English translation effect, and long translation time in the traditional English translation model, an English translation model based on intelligent recognition and deep learning is designed. An English phrase corpus was built, the phrase antecedent and postscript likelihood of the improved GLR algorithm by using the quaternion cluster were calculated, and the part of speech of the English phrase corpus was identified. According to the recognition results, the feature extraction algorithm is introduced to extract the best contextual features. On this basis, a neural machine translation model is constructed by integrating the traditional neural network in deep learning and combining the attention mechanism. It is used as a neural machine translation model for English translation. The simulation results show that the English translation model based on intelligent recognition and deep learning has high phrase recognition accuracy, good translation effect, and short translation time, which improves the quality of English translation.

TI Experimental research in automatic subtitling At the crossroads between
   machine translation and audiovisual translation
SO TRANSLATION SPACES
AB Recent developments in neural machine translation, and especially speech translation, are gradually but firmly entering the field of audiovisual translation (AVT). Automation in subtitling is extending from a machine translation (MT) component to fully automatic subtitling, which comprises MT, auto-spotting and automatic segmentation. The rise of this new paradigm renders MT-oriented experimental designs inadequate for the evaluation and investigation of automatic subtitling, since they fail to encompass the multimodal nature and technical requirements of subtitling. This paper highlights the methodological gaps to be addressed by multidisciplinary efforts in order to overcome these inadequacies and obtain metrics and methods that lead to rigorous experimental research in automatic subtitling. It presents a review of previous experimental designs in MT for subtitling, identifies their limitations for conducting research under the new paradigm and proposes a set of recommendations towards achieving replicability and reproducibility in experimental research at the crossroads between AVT and MT.

AB According to the typical characteristics of Vietnamese modifiers post positioned, a Chinese Vietnamese statistical machine translation method that fuses language post positioned characteristic function was proposed. In this method, firstly we analyzed the grammar differences between Chinese and Vietnamese, and extracted the difference of attribute position, adverbial position and qualifier order. Secondly we defined ordering block based on those difference, and added mapping method of ordering block to decoding algorithm in phrase based statistical machine translation model, then recorded N-best candidate translations and its score P produced by decoding. Thirdly reordered ordering block with language post positioned characteristic reordering algorithm and estimated score D by unconditional maximum likelihood probability distribution. Finally we chose the best translation based on score P and score D. We used lexicalized reordering model based phrase statistical machine translation as contrast experiment. The results of experiment show that our method effectively improves the quality of translation.

Machine translation technology is today available in the form of cross-language web services and can be embedded into multiuser and multilingual chats without disrupting the conversation flow. However, we still lack a thorough understanding of how real-time machine translation may affect communication in global software teams.
   In this paper, we present the replication of a controlled experiment that assesses the effect of real-time machine translation on multilingual teams while engaged in distributed requirements meetings. In particular, in this replication we specifically evaluate whether non-English speaking groups benefit from communicating in their own native languages when their English is not fluid enough for a fast-paced conversation.

AB This project aims to develop a Web-based, machine-aided translation tool called TRANMEMO to facilitate the translation of text documents from one language to another. TRANMEMO allows users to translate a particular text document via a Web browser. Users can edit and revise their translation by comparing the translated documents with the original document provided through the dual panel where two documents are synchronized. TRANMEMO supports the translation consistency by helping users to memorize translation patterns and providing fast search and replace functions where users can search for a word, a phrase or a sentence that they used to translate and replace it with replaceable pattern. The translation patterns are stored in a local database which acts as a personalized dictionary. This personalized dictionary can be used for the translation of other documents.

AB Machine Translation is a branch of research under Computational Linguistics that deals with the automatic/semi-automatic translation of a natural/human language into another. The language that is being translated is termed as Source Language(SL) and the language into which translation is done, is termed Target Language(TL). This paper presents an English to Indian Languages Machine Translation technique that is based on the rules of grammar, namely word declensions or inflections, and sentence formation rules of the target languages, i.e. Indian Languages. Declensions are variations or inflections of words in language and Indian languages are richly declensional or inflectional languages. This study is on generating Noun Declension -case markers for English to Indian languages in Declension Rule based Machine Translation. This paper also describes about the various approaches to machine translation along with their system architectures. The proposed Declension based RBMT is explained with its architecture and each of the modules and their functionalities are elaborated in detail. The input and output, to and from the system are also described with an example. The research works that are similar with the proposed system, such as ANUSAARAKA and ANGLABHARATI are also explored.

AB Word deletion (WD) errors can lead to poor comprehension of the meaning of source translated sentences in phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT), and have a critical impact on the adequacy of the translation results generated by SMT systems. In this paper, first we classify the word deletion into two categories, wanted and unwanted word deletions. For these two kinds of word deletions, we propose a maximum entropy based word deletion model to improve the translation quality in phrase-based SMT. Our proposed model are based on features automatically learned from a real-word bitext. In our experiments on Chinese-to-English news and web translation tasks, the results show that our approach is capable of generating more adequate translations compared with the baseline system, and our proposed word deletion model yields a +0.99 BLEU improvement and a -2.20 TER reduction on the NIST machine translation evaluation corpora.

We present detailed analysis of the accuracy of bilingual lexicon induction, and show how a discriminative model can be used to combine various signals of translation equivalence (like contextual similarity, temporal similarity, orthographic similarity and topic similarity). Our discriminative model produces higher accuracy translations than previous bilingual lexicon induction techniques. We reuse these signals of translation equivalence as features on a phrase-based SMT system. These monolingually estimated features enhance low resource SMT systems in addition to allowing end-to-end machine translation without parallel corpora.

   The phrase-based translation units are typically extracted using statistical criteria, and they are weighted using different models. These models are log-linearly combined in the decoding, which is in charge of choosing the most probable translation. Significant quality improvements have been produced from original phrase-based SMT systems. Among others, the main challenges are reordering, domain adaptation and evaluation.

AB While various neural machine translation (NMT) methods have integrated multiple prior knowledge to guide the translation, no research is available on combining with source-target bilingual translation template. In this paper, we firstly propose a maximal-length noun phrase template (MNP-Template), which constructs a novel translation template focusing on the constituency syntactic structure. Secondly, building on the multi-source transformer framework, we design a template-based machine translation (TBMT) model to integrate the syntactic knowledge of the retrieved target template similar to the ground-truth translation in the NMT decoder. Experiment results show the effectiveness of MNP-Template and TBMT on test subsets filtered by the fuzzy match score. Moreover, our method achieves significant improvement in out-of-domain test sets, which well-validated the university across diverse domains.

AB Current neural machine translation (NMT) usually extracts a fixed-length semantic representation for source sentence, and then depends on this representation to generate corresponding target translation. In this paper, we proposed a pivot-based semantic splicing model (PBSSM) to obtain a semantic representation including more translation information for source sentence, thus improving the translation performance of NMT. The spliced semantic representation is derived from source languages of trilingual parallel corpus by the pivot-based NMT. Besides, the proposed PBSSM only depends on one source language to generate its semantic representation during the encoding process. We integrated it into the NMT architecture. Experiments on the English-Japanese translation task show that our model achieves a substantial improvement by up to 22.9% (3.74 BLEU) over the baseline.

AB Latent alignment objectives such as CTC and AXE significantly improve non-autoregressive machine translation models. Can they improve autoregressive models as well? We explore the possibility of training autoregressive machine translation models with latent alignment objectives, and observe that, in practice, this approach results in degenerate models. We provide a theoretical explanation for these empirical results, and prove that latent alignment objectives are incompatible with teacher forcing.

AB In the typical speech translation system, the first-best speech recognizer hypothesis is segmented into sentence-like units which are then fed to the downstream machine translation component. The need for a sufficiently large context in this intermediate step and for the MT introduces delays which are undesirable in many application scenarios, such as real-time subtitling of foreign language broadcasts or simultaneous translation of speeches and lectures.
   In this paper, we propose a statistical machine translation decoder which processes a continuous input stream, such as that produced by a run-on speech recognizer. By decoupling decisions about the timing of translation output generation from any fixed input segmentation, this design can guarantee a maximum output lag for each input word while allowing for full word reordering within this time window.
   Experimental results show that this system achieves competitive translation performance with a minimum of translation-induced latency.

TI Multisensor Feature Fusion-Based Model for Business English Translation
SO SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
AB With the wide use of computers, machine translation has been gradually applied in many fields from natural language processing, such as industry, education, and so on. Due to the increasing demand for multilanguage translation, it is an urgent problem to effectively improve the quality of text translation. Driven by the upsurge of artificial intelligence, neural network technology is increasingly integrated into the field of machine translation, which gradually expands the traditional machine translation method into neural machine translation method. With the continuous improvement of deep learning technology, machine translation has gradually integrated these methods and strategies and achieved good results in multiple tasks, but there are still some short-comings. The most prominent problem is that, since word vector is the basis for the model to obtain semantic and grammatical information, the existing methods cannot obtain semantic and grammatical feature information, which greatly reduces the accuracy of English translation. Based on this, this paper proposed a method of splicing word vector with character- level and word-level encoding vector. The characterization of fusion of more word vector can effectively solve the word does not appear in the table, the word with some low frequency, can express meaning more complete information, performance directly affects the whole translation model, the results can be seen through the experiment, we put forward the characteristics of the fusion method and strategy, can effectively enhance the overall translation performance of the model.

TI Improving statistical machine translation using syntax-based
   learning-to-rank system
SO DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP IN THE HUMANITIES
AB Word reordering is one of the fundamental problems of machine translation. It is an important factor in the quality and efficiency of machine translations. Tackling the reordering problem can lead to significant improvements in translation quality. A new method is introduced with the objective of solving the reordering problem. It exploits sophisticated syntactic-based features for re-ranking the n-best translation candidates provided by a phrase-based statistical machine translation system. These sophisticated reordering features are based on an innovative structure named the phrasal dependency tree, which is inspired from target-side dependency relations among contiguous non-syntactic phrases. The features benefit from phrase dependencies, translation orientation, and distance. A translation candidate is modelled as a directed and weighted graph built from information provided by the reordering features and is re-scored by the proposed re-ranking system. This system markedly improves the outputs of the machine translation of two syntactically divergent language pairs. The performance is evaluated for Persian -> English and German -> English translation tasks using the WMT07 benchmark. The results report 0.566/0.95/0.011- and 0.75/0.97/0.024- point improvements in terms of BLEU/TER/LRSCORE metrics on Persian -> English and German -> English translation tasks, respectively. The superiority of the proposed system in terms of precision and recall measures is demonstrated as well.

AB This paper describes a systematic study of an approach to Farsi-Spanish low-resource Neural Machine Translation (NMT) that leverages monolingual data for joint learning of forward and backward translation models. As is standard for NMT systems, the training process begins using two pre-trained translation models that are iteratively updated by decreasing translation costs. In each iteration, either translation model is used to translate monolingual texts from one language to another, to generate synthetic datasets for the other translation model. Two new translation models are then learned from bilingual data along with the synthetic texts. The key distinguishing feature between our approach and standard NMT is an iterative learning process that improves the performance of both translation models, simultaneously producing a higher-quality synthetic training dataset upon each iteration. Our empirical results demonstrate that this approach outperforms baselines.

AB Translation of English documents into Hindi language is becoming an integral part for facilitating communication. The major population of India where 366 million people uses Hindi as primary language, for them providing information in Hindi is an important task the translation of English documents may be manually or automatically. When translation done manually the chances are rare for errors, but when we use any translation machines or engine the outputs received from these machines for Hindi have lots of grammatical mistakes or errors. One of the major issues observed is of tense.
   Thus, we propose solution to build a rule based tense synthesizer that would recognise the subject, verb and auxiliary verb, analyse the tense, then modify the verb and auxiliary verb according to the subject and put the sentence in the correct tense. This system could be integrated with Machine Translation engines to boost up the quality of Hindi translation.

AB Languages have inherent property of tree-based recursive arrangement of phrases and follow a syntactic grammar. Phrase Based Translation is considered state-of-the-art in the field of statistical machine translation, but does not take into account the above mentioned properties of languages. Hierarchical and Syntax based machine translations are aimed to model these properties of languages. English-Hindi language pair, belonging to two different language families needs conversion of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure of English to Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) structure of Hindi. This paper is aimed to perform comparative analysis of these models for this language pair which demands long distance movement of words or phrases.

The approach translates NE from Chinese to Uyghur by following three-step transformation, and it is dictionary-independent and highly efficient. The experiment shows very encouraging result, we achieved a precision rate of 90.5% for Chinese-Uyghur NE translation. Machine translation systems can use such a rule-base NE translation system as a component to handle phrase translation in order to improve overall translation quality. Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) systems could identify relevant documents based on translations of NE provided by such a sub-system.

The detector identifies potential homophone errors in a textual sentence and converts them into syllables to form a mixed sequence that is then fed into the syllable-aware NMT. Extensive experiments on Chinese -> English translation demonstrate that the proposed method not only significantly outperforms baselines on noisy test sets with homophone noise, but also achieves substantial improvements over them on clean texts.

AB Chinese sentences are translated into English sentences using example-based machine translation. The main process of example-based machine translation is divided into three phases. Firstly, find the most similar examples as the input sentence. Secondly, recombine the translation of the input sentence according to most similar example and bilingual dictionary. Thirdly produce the translation of the input sentence. The main resources are bilingual dictionary, thesaurus, the standard template system and bilingual sentence aligned corpora. The bilingual dictionary, thesaurus, and the standard template system are used to calculate the similarities between two words, two chunks, and two sentences. At the same time, bilingual dictionary and bilingual sentence aligned corpora are used to adjust and produce the translation. Future improvement is given.

AB With the development of deep neural networks, machine translation has achieved significant progress and integrated with people's daily lives to assist in various tasks. However, machine translators, which are essentially one kind of software, also suffer from software defects. Translation errors might cause misunderstanding or even lead to marketing blunders, and political crisis. Thus, almost all translation service providers have feedback channels of incorrect translations to collect training data and improve product performance. Inspired by the syntax structure analysis, we introduce the constituency invariance, which reflects the structural similarity between a simple sentence and sentences derived from it, to test machine translators. We implement it into an automated tool CIT to detect translation errors by checking the constituency invariance relation between the translation results. CIT adopts constituency parse trees to represent the syntactic structures of sentences and employs an efficient data augmentation method to derive multiple new sentences based on one sentence. To validate CIT, we experiment with three widely-used machine translators, i.e., Bing Microsoft Translator, Google Translate, and Youdao Translator. With 600 seed sentences as input, CIT detects 2212, 1910, and 1590 translation errors with around 77% precision. We have submitted detected errors to the development teams. Until we submit this paper, Google, Bing, and Youdao have fixed 15.4%, 32.0%, 14.3% of reported errors, respectively.

The migration process is often performed manually or semi-automatically, in which developers are required to manually define translation rules and API mappings. This paper presents semSMT, an automatic tool to migrate code written in Java to C#. semSMT utilizes statistical machine translation to automatically infer translation rules from existing migrated code, thus, requires no manual defining of rules.

In this study, 400 long sentences were randomly selected from NTCIR-9 patent corpus for testing the recognition and segmentation effects of regular match method and error-driven method, and the accuracy rate of the translation was compared on Baidu Online Translation Platform. The results demonstrated that the regular matching method was effective in recognizing and segmenting long sentences, nevertheless there were many defects; the error-driven method was more effective in recognizing and segmenting long sentences; the former increased by 4.8% of the BLEU value of the translated text on Baidu Online Translation Platform and the latter increased by 12.1%, which showed that the error-driven method was more effective in machine translation.

SO ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB The availability of data is the driving force behind most of the state-of-the-art techniques for machine translation tasks. Understandably, this availability of data motivates researchers to propose new techniques and claim about the superiority of their techniques over the existing ones by using suitable evaluation measures. However, the performance of underlying learning algorithms can be greatly influenced by the correctness and the consistency of the corpus. We present our investigations for the relevance of a publicly available python to pseudo-code parallel corpus for automated documentation task, and the studies performed using this corpus. We found that the corpus had many visible issues like overlapping of instances, inconsistency in translation styles, incompleteness, and misspelled words. We show that these discrepancies can significantly influence the performance of the learning algorithms to the extent that they could have caused previous studies to draw incorrect conclusions. We performed our experimental study using statistical machine translation and neural machine translation models. We have recorded a significant difference (similar to 10% on BLEU score) in the models' performance after removing the issues from the corpus.

AB Translation is one of the needs of global society for communicating thoughts and ideas of one country with other country. Translation is the process of interpretation of text meaning and subsequent production of equivalent text, also called as communicating same meaning (message) in another language. In this paper we gave detail information on how to convert source language text in to target language text using Transfer Based Approach for machine translation. Here we implemented English to Sanskrit machine translator using transfer based approach. English is global language used for business and communication but large amount of population in India is not using and understand the English. Sanskrit is ancient language of India most of the languages in India are derived from Sanskrit. Sanskrit can be act as an intermediate language for multilingual translation.

AB Machine Translation is a task to translate the text from a source language to a target language in an automatic manner. Here, we describe a system that translate the English language to Assamese language text which is based on Phrase based statistical translation technique. To overcome the translation problem related with highly open word class like Proper Noun or the Out Of Vocabulary words we develop a transliteration system which is also embedded with our translation system. We enhance the translation output by replacing words with their most appropriate synonymous word for that particular context with the help of Assamese Word-Net Synset. This Machine Translation system outcomes with a reasonable translation output when analyzed by linguist for Assamese language which is a less computationally aware language among the Indian languages.

TI Integration of speech recognition and machine translation: Speech
   recognition word lattice translation
SO SPEECH COMMUNICATION
AB An important issue in speech translation is to minimize the negative effect of speech recognition errors on machine translation. We propose a novel statistical machine translation decoding algorithm for speech translation to improve speech translation quality. The algorithm can translate the speech recognition word lattice, where more hypotheses are utilized to bypass the misrecognized single-best hypothesis. The decoding involves converting the recognition word lattice to a translation word graph by a graph-based search, followed by a fine rescoring by an A* search. We show that a speech recognition confidence measure implemented by posterior probability is effective to improve speech translation. The proposed techniques were tested in a Japanese-to-English speech translation task, in which we measured the translation results in terms of a number of automatic evaluation metrics. The experimental results demonstrate a consistent and significant improvement in speech translation achieved by the proposed techniques. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Mind the gap The nature of machine translation post-editing
SO BABEL-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE LA TRADUCTION-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF
   TRANSLATION
AB Has post-editing changed the nature of translation? Are these tasks two sides of the same coin? These are some of the questions that recent developments in machine translation have brought to translation studies. The quality of the texts rendered by the new neural engines is good enough to challenge the traditional role of the human translator. Some voices even question whether there might be any place left for translators if, in the near future, their role is finally superseded by that of the post-editor. This paper offers a comprehensive view of the many aspects of post-editing with a view to shedding some light on the nature of this task. I first explore how the progress in machine translation has turned post-editing into an essential activity. Then, I present a proposal for a categorization of research areas in post-editing within the framework of translation studies. The central discussion of this paper revolves around three key ideas: (1) the conceptualization of post-editing as more than a simple, fast and inexpensive task; (2) the framing of post-editing as a dynamic process; and (3) the claim that defining quality in machine translation post-editing is not as straightforward as it may seem. The ultimate goal of this paper is to lay the foundations for further discussion into what it is that post-editing means for translation studies.

TI Online adaptation strategies for statistical machine translation in
   post-editing scenarios
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION
AB One of the most promising approaches to machine translation consists in formulating the problem by means of a pattern recognition approach. By doing so, there are some tasks in which online adaptation is needed in order to adapt the system to changing scenarios. In the present work, we perform an exhaustive comparison of four online learning algorithms when combined with two adaptation strategies for the task of online adaptation in statistical machine translation. Two of these algorithms are already well-known in the pattern recognition community, such as the perceptron and passive-aggressive algorithms, but here they are thoroughly analyzed for their applicability in the statistical machine translation task. In addition, we also compare them with two novel methods, i.e., Bayesian predictive adaptation and discriminative ridge regression. In statistical machine translation, the most successful approach is based on a log-linear approximation to a posteriori distribution. According to experimental results, adapting the scaling factors of this log-linear combination of models using discriminative ridge regression or Bayesian predictive adaptation yields the best performance.

AB The sense in which a word is used determines the translation of the word. In this paper, we propose a sense-based translation model to integrate word senses into statistical machine translation. We build a broad-coverage sense tagger based on a nonparametric Bayesian topic model that automatically learns sense clusters for words in the source language. The proposed sense-based translation model enables the decoder to select appropriate translations for source words according to the inferred senses for these words using maximum entropy classifiers. Our method is significantly different from previous word sense disambiguation reformulated for machine translation in that the latter neglects word senses in nature. We test the effectiveness of the proposed sense-based translation model on a large-scale Chinese-to-English translation task. Results show that the proposed model substantially outperforms not only the baseline but also the previous reformulated word sense disambiguation.

Different from other works, the primary translation is handled by the NMT system, and the SMT system acts as a secondary system. Automatic evaluation results have shown that the hybrid method allows improving NMT translation quality by up to three BLEU points.

We also experimented with different degrees of linguistic analysis from the lexical level to a syntactic or semantic level, in order to generate a more precise alignment. We developed a contextual environment using the Self-Organizing Map, which can model a semantic agent (SOMAgent) that learns the correct meaning of a word used in context in order to deal with specific phenomena such as ambiguity, and to generate more precise alignments that can improve the first choice of the statistical machine translation system giving linguistic knowledge.

AB Voice Translator is speech to speech translation application for android mobile phone, which translates English speech to Hindi speech and vice versa. Voice Translator includes three modules, Voice Recognition, Machine Translation and Speech Synthesis. Voice Recognition module captures the voice or speech from the mobile user through speaker, identifies then converts the speech into text and then the text send to Machine Translation for further process. Machine Translation module does the process of translation i.e. this module consists of library for both language and when text is received by this module, it converts the text of one language to another as per user choice and thus it sends the translated text to last module. Speech Synthesis module acts as the text to speech translator i.e. when it gets the translated text. This module processes on translated text which converts it into speech and then makes it as user output. Thus, Voice Translation application works by integrating all these three modules and gives the user best output.

AB Statistical machine translation for low-resource language suffers from the lack of abundant training corpora. Several methods, such as the use of a pivot language, have been proposed as a bridge to translate from one language to another. However, errors will accumulate during the extensive translation pipelines. In this paper, we propose an approach to low-resource language translation by exploiting the pronunciation correlations between languages. We find that the pronunciation features can improve both Chinese-Vietnamese and Vietnamese-Chinese translation qualities. Experimental results show that our proposed model yields effective improvements, and the translation performance (bilingual evaluation understudy score) is improved by a maximum value of 1.03.

TI Enhanced Neural Machine Translation by Joint Decoding with Word and

SO MOBILE NETWORKS & APPLICATIONS
AB Machine translation has become an irreplaceable application in the use of mobile phones. However, the current mainstream neural machine translation models depend on continuously increasing the amount of parameters to achieve better performance, which is not applicable to the mobile phone. In this paper, we improve the performance of neural machine translation (NMT) with shallow syntax (e.g., POS tag) of target language, which has better accuracy and latency than deep syntax such as dependency parsing. In particular, our models take less parameters and runtime than other complex machine translation models, making mobile applications possible. In detail, we present three RNN-based NMT decoding models (independent decoder, gates shared decoder and fully shared decoder) to jointly predict target word and POS tag sequences. Experiments on Chinese-English and German-English translation tasks show that the fully shared decoder can acquire the best performance, which increases the BLEU score by 1.4 and 2.25 points respectively compared with the attention-based NMT model. In addition, we extend the idea to transformer-based models, and the experimental results also show that the BLEU score is further improved.

AB Neural machine translation, a recently proposed approach to machine translation based purely on neural networks, has shown promising results compared to the existing approaches such as phrase-based statistical machine translation. Despite its recent success, neural machine translation has its limitation in handling a larger vocabulary, as training complexity as well as decoding complexity increase proportionally to the number of target words. In this paper, we propose a method based on importance sampling that allows us to use a very large target vocabulary without increasing training complexity. We show that decoding can be efficiently done even with the model having a very large target vocabulary by selecting only a small subset of the whole target vocabulary. The models trained by the proposed approach are empirically found to match, and in some cases outperform, the baseline models with a small vocabulary as well as the LSTM-based neural machine translation models. Furthermore, when we use an ensemble of a few models with very large target vocabularies, we achieve performance comparable to the state of the art (measured by BLEU) on both the English -> German and English -> French translation tasks of WMT' 14.

In machine translation, WSD plays a vital role in improving the accuracy of the translation. The automated translation of question papers from English to Hindi is one such key area which requires suitable WSD techniques to resolve ambiguity in a question word. When machine translates question sentences, it faces ambiguity problem that results in ambiguous translation. Identification of question type is important for remove ambiguity in the question paper. In this paper besides discussing WSD its approaches, resources for translation. We have also discussed question classification word sense disambiguation.

We construct scb-mt-en-th-2020, an English-Thai machine translation dataset with over 1 million segment pairs, curated from various sources: news, Wikipedia articles, SMS messages, task-based dialogs, web-crawled data, government documents, and text artificially generated by a pretrained language model. We present the methods for gathering data, aligning texts, and removing preprocessing noise and translation errors automatically. We also train machine translation models based on this dataset to assess the quality of the corpus. Our models perform comparably to Google Translation API (as of May 2020) for Thai-English and outperform Google when the Open Parallel Corpus (OPUS) is included in the training data for both Thai-English and English-Thai translation. The dataset is available for public use under CC-BY-SA 4.0 License. The pre-trained models and source code to reproduce our work are available under Apache-2.0 License.

AB Machine translation has been a potential solution for addressing the language barrier. In line with this, we have developed English to Sinhala machine translation system that can be accessed through the Internet. The translation system runs on a web sever and can be accessed by an ordinary web client. The core of the translation system contains seven modules, namely, English Morphological analyzer, English parser, Translator, Sinhala Morphological generator, Sinhala parser, Transliteration module and three Lexicon Databases. This core system has already been tested and used on standalone machines. The current project has extended the core system with the use of Prolog Server Pages to provide online access thereby opening the service to a wider audience.

AB Although neural machine translation has achieved promising results, it suffers from slow translation speed. The direct consequence is that a trade-off has to be made between translation quality and speed, thus its performance can not come into full play. We apply cube pruning, a popular technique to speed up dynamic programming, into neural machine translation to speed up the translation. To construct the equivalence class, similar target hidden states are combined, leading to less RNN expansion operations on the target side and less softmax operations over the large target vocabulary. The experiments show that, at the same or even better translation quality, our method can translate faster compared with naive beam search by 3.3x on GPUs and 3.5x on CPUs.

AB Lexical ambiguity is one of the many challenging linguistic phenomena involved in translation, i.e., translating an ambiguous word with its correct sense. In this respect, previous work has shown that the translation quality of neural machine translation systems can be improved by explicitly modelling the senses of ambiguous words. Recently, several evaluation test sets have been proposed to measure the word sense disambiguation (WSD) capability of machine translation systems. However, to date, these evaluation test sets do not include any training data that would provide a fair setup measuring the sense distributions present within the training data itself. In this paper, we present an evaluation benchmark on WSD for machine translation for 10 language pairs, comprising training data with known sense distributions. Our approach for the construction of the benchmark builds upon the wide-coverage multilingual sense inventory of BabelNet, the multilingual neural parsing pipeline TurkuNLP, and the OPUS collection of translated texts from the web. The test suite is available at http://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/MuCoW.

AB Translated texts, in any language, have unique characteristics that set them apart from texts originally written in the same language. Translation studies is a research field that focuses on investigating these characteristics. Until recently, research in computational linguistics, and specifically in machine translation, has been entirely divorced from translation studies. The main goal of this tutorial is to introduce some of the findings of translation studies to researchers interested mainly in machine translation, and to demonstrate that awareness of these findings can result in better, more accurate machine translation systems (This chapter synthesizes material that has been previously published by the author and colleagues, in particular in Volansky et al. (2015); Rabinovich and Wintner (2015); Lembersky et al. (2011, 2012a, 2012b, 2013); and Twitto et al. (2015)).

TI Neural Machine Translation: A Review
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
AB The field of machine translation (MT), the automatic translation of written text from one natural language into another, has experienced a major paradigm shift in recent years. Statistical MT, which mainly relies on various count-based models and which used to dominate MT research for decades, has largely been superseded by neural machine translation (NMT), which tackles translation with a single neural network. In this work we will trace back the origins of modern NMT architectures to word and sentence embeddings and earlier examples of the encoder-decoder network family. We will conclude with a short survey of more recent trends in the field.

AB This paper is based on the work towards developing a machine translation system for Sanskrit to English. An interlingua based machine translation system in Paninian framework was developed in this work. As lexical functional grammar can handle semantic information along with syntactic analysis, the proposed system uses lexical functional grammar in different levels of analysis phase. In this system the given Sanskrit text is first converted to an intermediate notation called interlingua. This notation is then used for mapping to the target language, English, and generates the translated output. The proposed system works in the translation of simple and complex sentences in the given corpus. The karaka analysis system of Panini is used for the semantic analysis.

The Bayes decision rule for minimizing the number of string errors is widely used, but its justification is rarely questioned.
   We study the relationship between the Bayes decision rule, the underlying error measure, and word confidence measures for machine translation. The derived confidence measures are tested on the output of a state-of-the-art statistical machine translation system. Experimental comparison with existing confidence measures is presented on a translation task consisting of technical manuals.

AB This paper addresses a method for customizing an English-to-Korean machine translation system from general domain to patent domain. The customizing method consists of following steps: 1) linguistically studying about characteristics of patent documents, 2) extracting unknown words from large patent documents and constructing large bilingual terminology, 3) extracting and constructing the patent-specific translation patterns 4) customizing the translation engine modules of the existing general MT system according to linguistic study about characteristics of patent documents, and 5) evaluating the accuracy of translation modules and the translation quality. This research was performed under the auspices of the MIC (Ministry of Information and Communication) of Korean government during 2005-2006. The translation accuracy of the customized English-Korean patent translation system is 82.43% on the average in 5 patent fields (machinery, electronics, chemistry, medicine and computer) according to the evaluation of 7 professional human translators. In 2006, the patent MT system started an on-line patent MT service in IPAC (International Patent Assistance Center) under MOCIE (Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy) in Korea. In 2007, KIPO (Korean Intellectual Property Office) tries to launch an English-Korean patent MT service.

TI A Neural Approach to Source Dependence Based Context Model for
   Statistical Machine Translation
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB In statistical machine translation, translation prediction considers not only the aligned source word itself but also its source contextual information. Learning context representation is a promising method for improving translation results, particularly through neural networks. Most of the existing methods process context words sequentially and neglect source long-distance dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel neural approach to source dependence-based context representation for translation prediction. The proposed model is capable of not only encoding source long-distance dependencies but also capturing functional similarities to better predict translations (i.e., word form translations and ambiguous word translations). To verify our method, the proposed mode is incorporated into phrase-based and hierarchical phrase-based translation models, respectively. Experiments on large-scale Chinese-to-English and English-to-German translation tasks show that the proposed approach achieves significant improvement over the baseline systems and outperforms several existing context-enhanced methods.

AB With the intense use of neural networks in machine translation of NLP as the latest and most promising approach, neural machine translation (NMT), however, has a serious weakness in terms of corpus availability. This type of machine translation though has achieved a significantly remarkable results for the rich-resource language pairs but it has a challenging performance for the low-resource language pairs. Persian-Chinese is one of the low-resource language pairs that lacks a large scale freely available parallel dataset for training translation models. In this paper we illustrate the creation of bilingual Persian-Chinese corpus (PC-Corpus), which is the very first corpus for this language pair. Our work is significantly considerable for the future of machine translation on Persian-Chinese language pair.

TI Fast and optimal decoding for machine translation
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB A good decoding algorithm is critical to the success of any statistical machine translation system. The decoder's job is to find the translation that is most likely according to a set of previously learned parameters (and a formula for combining them). Since the space of possible translations is extremely large, typical decoding algorithms are only able to examine a portion of it, thus risking to miss good solutions. Unfortunately, examining more of the space leads to unacceptably slow decodings.
   In this paper, we compare the speed and output quality of a traditional stack-based decoding algorithm with two new decoders: a fast but non-optimal greedy decoder and a slow but optimal decoder that treats decoding as an integer-programming optimization problem.

AB A natural text for translation using machine contains several unknown words for which there are no entries in the dictionary. These words may be names, acronyms, abbreviations, terminology and foreign words. Also, some of the words may not be found in the dictionary due to its limited size. A machine translation system has to provide mechanism for handling such unknown lexical units. In this paper we describe the strategy adopted in our system for machine aided translation from Hindi to English. No attempt has been made to expand the vocabulary by deriving their meaning. Instead, a set of heuristics is used to identify the nature of the unknown word and generate appropriate form for translation. It is a common practice in India to mix the words of English in Hindi and vice-versa. However, the grammatical rules in construction of gender, number, verb-nominalization or forms, conform to that for the language (Hindi or English) used irrespective of their origin.

AB Neural machine translation (NMT) is often described as 'data hungry' as it typically requires large amounts of parallel data in order to build a good-quality machine translation (MT) system. However, most of the world's language-pairs are low-resource or extremely low-resource. This situation becomes even worse if a specialised domain is taken into consideration for translation. In this paper, we present a novel data augmentation method which makes use of bilingual word embeddings (BWEs) learned from monolingual corpora and bidirectional encoder representations from transformer (BERT) language models (LMs). We augment a parallel training corpus by introducing new words (i.e. out-of-vocabulary (OOV) items) and increasing the presence of rare words on both sides of the original parallel training corpus. Our experiments on the simulated low-resource German-English and French-English translation tasks show that the proposed data augmentation strategy can significantly improve state-of-the-art NMT systems and outperform the state-of-the-art data augmentation approach for low-resource NMT.

TI Language-related issues for NMT and PBMT for English-German and

SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB This work presents an extensive comparison of language-related problems for neural machine translation (NMT) and phrase-based machine translation (PBMT) for German-to-English, English-to-German and English-to-Serbian. The explored issues are related both to the characteristics of the languages as well as to the (machine) translation process and, although related, go beyond typical translation error classes. It is shown that the main advantage of the NMT approach consists of better generating verb forms, avoiding verb omissions, as well as better handling of English noun collocations and negation. It is also shown that the main obstacles for the NMT system are prepositions, translation of English (source) ambiguous words and generating English (target) continuous and perfect tenses. In addition, preliminary experiments show that a number of issues are complementary, i.e., not occurring in the same segments and/or in the same form. This means that a combination or hybridisation of the NMT and PBMT approaches is a promising direction for improving both types of systems.

AB Web crawling is an important way to collect a massive training corpus for building a high-quality machine translation system. However, a large amount of data collected comes from machine-translated texts rather than native speakers or professional translators, severely reducing the benefit of data scale. Traditional machine translation detection methods generally require human-crafted feature engineering and are difficult to distinguish the fine-grained semantic difference between real text and pseudo text from a modern neural machine translation system. To address this problem, we propose two semantic-aware models based on the deep neural network to automatically learn semantic features of text for monolingual scenarios and bilingual scenarios, respectively. Specifically, our models incorporate the global semantic from BERT and the local semantic from convolutional neural network together for monolingual detection and further explores the semantic consistency relationship for bilingual detection. The experimental results on the Chinese-English machine translation detection task show that our models achieve 83.12% F-1 in the monolingual detection and 85.53% F-1 in the bilingual detection respectively, which is better than the strong BERT baselines by 2.2-3.2%.

AB Current methods of neural machine translation output incorrect sentences together with sentences translated correctly. Consequently, users of neural machine translation algorithms do not have a way to check which outputted sentences have been translated correctly without employing an evaluation method. Therefore, we aim to define the confidence values in neural machine translation models. We suppose that setting a threshold to limit the confidence value would allow correctly translated sentences to exceed the threshold; thus, only clearly translated sentences would be outputted. Hence, users of such a translation tool can obtain a particular level of confidence in the translation correctness. We propose some indices; sentence log-likelihood, minimum variance, and average variance. After that, we calculated the correlation between each index and bilingual evaluation score (BLEU) to investigate the appropriateness of the defined confidence indices. As a result, sentence log-likelihood and average variance calculated by probability have a weak correlation with the BLEU score. Furthermore, when we set each index as the threshold value, we could obtain high quality translated sentences instead of outputting all translated sentences which include a wide range of quality sentences like previous work.

We also argue for the inclusion of added value services such as subtitling and localization. The course should be mandatory for all the graduate students studying a language. The content is influenced by the experiences gained from teaching a similar elective graduate-level course.

TI Knowledge enhanced zero-resource machine translation using
   image-pivoting
SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE
AB Zero resource machine translation usually means that there are no parallel corpora in the training of machine translation models, which can be solved with the help of extra information such as images. However, the ambiguity in the text, together with the irrelevant information in images, may cause the problem of translation errors of some key words. In order to alleviate the problem of image-text alignment deviation caused by word ambiguity, we introduce knowledge entities as an extra modality for the source language to enhance the representations of the source text to clarify its semantics. Specifically, we use additional multi-modal information including images and knowledge entities as an auxiliary hint for the source text in the Transformer-based zero-resource translation framework. We also solve the problem of the structural difference between the training and inference stages to handle the cases where there is no longer visual information in the inference stage. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art BLEU scores in the field of zero-resource machine translation with the image as the pivot.

AB Dubbing is a type of audiovisual translation where dialogues are translated and enacted so that they give the impression that the media is in the target language. It requires a careful alignment of dubbed recordings with the lip movements of performers in order to achieve visual coherence. In this paper, we deal with the specific problem of prosodic phrase synchronization within the framework of machine dubbing. Our methodology exploits the attention mechanism output in neural machine translation to find plausible phrasing for the translated dialogue lines and then uses them to condition their synthesis. Our initial work in this field records comparable speech rate ratio to professional dubbing translation, and improvement in terms of lip-syncing of long dialogue lines.

TI Post-editing neural machine translation versus phrase-based machine
   translation for English-Chinese
SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB This paper aims to shed light on the post-editing process of the recently-introduced neural machine translation (NMT) paradigm. Using simple and more complex texts, we first evaluate the output quality from English to Chinese phrase-based statistical (PBSMT) and NMT systems. Nine raters assess the MT quality in terms of fluency and accuracy and find that NMT produces higher-rated translations than PBSMT for both texts. Then we analyze the effort expended by 68 student translators during HT and when post-editing NMT and PBSMT output. Our measures of post-editing effort are all positively correlated for both NMT and PBSMT post-editing. Our findings suggest that although post-editing output from NMT is not always significantly faster than post-editing PBSMT, it significantly reduces the technical and cognitive effort. We also find that, in contrast to HT, post-editing effort is not necessarily correlated with source text complexity.

TI Future-Aware Knowledge Distillation for Neural Machine Translation
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Although future context is widely regarded useful for word prediction in machine translation, it is quite difficult in practice to incorporate it into neural machine translation. In this paper, we propose a future-aware knowledge distillation framework (FKD) to address this issue. In the FKD framework, we learn to distill future knowledge from a backward neural language model (teacher) to future-aware vectors (student) during the training phase. The future-aware vector for each word position is computed in a bridge network and optimized towards the corresponding hidden state in the backward neural language model via a knowledge distillation mechanism. We further propose an algorithm to jointly train the neural machine translation model, neural language model and knowledge distillation module end-to-end. The learned future-aware vectors are incorporated into the attention layer of the decoder to provide full-range context information during the decoding phase. Experiments on the NIST Chinese-English and WMT English-German translation tasks show that the proposed method significantly improves translation quality and word alignment.

AB Machine Translation (MT) refers to the use of a machine for performing translation task which converts text in one Natural Language (NL) into another Natural Language. Evaluation of MT is a difficult task because there may exist many perfect translations of a given source sentence. Human evaluation is holy grail for MT evaluation, but due to lack of time and money it is becoming impractical. In past years many automatic MT evaluation techniques have been developed, most of them are based on n-gram metric evaluation. However, such techniques do not fit well in case of language pairs, where there are structural differences in the languages involved in MT such as English-Hindi. In this paper authors are discussing certain issues due to which automatic MT evaluation using n-gram metric alone is inadequate in such cases and also proposing ways to handle these issues in evaluation of MT with examples from English-Hindi machine translation.

The findings are compared to the actual state of our dynamic translation system for web contents, named as Domain Translator.

AB There are common semantics shared across text and images Given a sentence in a source language, whether depicting the visual scene helps translation into a target language? Existing multimodal neural machine translation methods (MNMT) require triplets of bilingual sentence - image for training and tuples of source sentence - image for inference. In this paper, we propose ImagiT, a novel machine translation method via visual imagination. ImagiT first learns to generate visual representation from the source sentence, and then utilizes both source sentence and the "imagined representation" to produce a target translation. Unlike previous methods, it only needs the source sentence at the inference time. Experiments demonstrate that ImagiT benefits from visual imagination and significantly outperforms the text-only neural machine translation baselines. Further analysis reveals that the imagination process in ImagiT helps fill in missing information when performing the degradation strategy.

TI The alignment template approach to statistical machine translation
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB A phrase-based statistical machine translation approach-the alignment template approach-is described. This translation approach allows for general many-to-many relations between words. Thereby, the context of words is taken into account in the translation model, and local changes in word order from source to target language can be learned explicitly. The model is described using a log-linear modeling approach, which is a generalization of the often used source-channel approach. Thereby, the model is easier to extend than classical statistical machine translation systems. We describe in detail the process for learning phrasal translations, the feature functions used, and the search algorithm. The evaluation of this approach is performed on three different tasks. For the German-English speech Verbmobil task, we analyze the effect of various system components. On the French-English Canadian Hansards task, the alignment template system obtains significantly better results than a single-word-based translation model. In the Chinese-English 2002 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) machine translation evaluation it yields statistically significantly better NIST scores than all competing research and commercial translation systems.

This work presents a Bidirectional Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system of an extremely low resource language pair Mizo-English, built in a low resource setting. A total of 30800 sentences are collected from the English Bible dataset and manually translated to Mizo by a native linguistic expert to generate the English-Mizo parallel dataset. After subjecting to various pre-processing steps, the parallel dataset is used to build our MT system using MOSES tools. Our framework uses different tools, such as GIZA++ for creating the Translation Model (TM) and IRSTLM to determine the probability of the target model. The quality of our MT system is evaluated using two automatic evaluation metrics: BLEU and METEOR. Our MT systems are also manually evaluated using two parameters: adequacy and fluency.

TI Pause-Based Phrase Extraction and Effective OOV Handling for
   Low-Resource Machine Translation Systems
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB Machine translation is the core problem for several natural language processing research across the globe. However, building a translation system involving low-resource languages remains a challenge with respect to statistical machine translation (SMT). This work proposes and studies the effect of a phrase-induced hybrid machine translation system for translation from English to Tamil, under a low-resource setting. Unlike conventional hybrid MT systems, the free-word ordering feature of the target language Tamil is exploited to form a re-ordered target language model and to extend the parallel text corpus for training the SMT. In the current work, a novel rule-based phrase-extraction method, implemented using parts-of-speech (POS) and place-of-pause in both languages is proposed, which is used to pre-process the training corpus for developing the back-off phrase-induced SMT. Further, out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words are handled using speech-based transliteration and two-level thesaurus intersection techniques based on the POS tag of the OOV word. To ensure that the input with OOV words does not skip phrase-level translation in the hierarchical model, a phrase-level example-based machine translation approach is adopted to find the closest matching phrase and perform translation followed by OOV replacement. The proposed system results in a bilingual evaluation understudy score of 84.78 and a translation edit rate of 19.12. The performance of the system is compared in terms of adequacy and fluency, with existing translation systems for this specific language pair, and it is observed that the proposed system outperforms its counterparts.

Towards Chinese-English patent machine translation, this paper presents two methods using rich linguistic information to identify commas which separate sub-sentences and non-sub-sentences. The first method employs word knowledge base and formal rules to determine roles of commas, while the second one uses machine learning approaches. The experimental results show that overall F1 scores of rule-based method are higher than 93%, indicating the approach performs well in classifying commas. On the other hand, the classifiers show some differences. We also draw the conclusion that identifying commas is actually able to improve the quality of translation outputs.

AB When automatically translating between, related languages, one of the main sources of machine translation errors is the incorrect resolution of part-of-speech (PoS) ambiguities. Hidden Markov models (HMM) are the standard statistical approach to try to properly resolve such ambiguities. The usual training algorithms collect statistics from source-language texts in order to adjust the parameters of the HMM, but if the HMM is to be embedded in a machine translation system, target-language information may also prove valuable. We study how to use a target-language model (in addition to source-language texts) to improve the tagging and translation performance of a statistical PoS tagger of an otherwise rule-based, shallow-transfer machine translation engine, although other architectures may be considered as well. The method may also be used to customise the machine translation engine to a particular target language, text type, or subject, or to statistically "retune" it after introducing new transfer rules.

AB Machine Translation is an important part of Natural Language Processing. The model based on convolution neural network and attention mechanism (Fcnn model), which was proposed by Facebook in 2017, has been successful. We use this Fcnn model as the baseline model of this subject, and on the base of this model, we try to improve it by the combination of bytes pair encoding method, model ensemble method. In this issue, we use Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) as a criterion to measure the quality of translation. After testing, these methods can improve the translation quality of the model. Finally, the overall translation quality increased from 0.28 of the baseline Fcnn model to 0.32.

AB Based on the characteristics of Indonesian and Japanese language, we did several experiments on the additional process to an Indonesian-Japanese statistical machine translation (SMT). We proposed several additional processes such as employing the POS tag information, adding the size of monolingual target corpus, using Indonesian stemmer in Indonesian to Japanese translation, eliminating Japanese particle in Japanese to Indonesian translation, and the elimination of NE tag. The experimental result showed that compared to the baseline of adding no process to the default SMT engine (here, we use Moses), the highest BLEU score was achieved by the elimination of Japanese particle in Japanese to Indonesian translation.

AB The merit of phrase-based statistical machine translation is often reduced by the complexity to construct it. In this paper, we address some issues in phrase-based statistical machine translation, namely: the size of the phrase translation table, the use of underlying translation model probability and the length of the phrase unit. We present Level-Of-Detail (LOD) approach, an agglomerative approach for learning phrase-level alignment. Our experiments show that LOD approach significantly improves the performance of the word-based approach. LOD demonstrates a clear advantage that the phrase translation table grows only sub-linearly over the maximum phrase length, while having a performance comparable to those of other phrase-based approaches.

AB Multiword Expressions (MWEs) are a frequently occurring phenomenon found in all natural languages that is of great importance to linguistic theory, natural language processing applications, and machine translation systems. Neural Machine Translation (NMT) architectures do not handle these expressions well and previous studies have rarely addressed MWEs in this framework. In this work, we show that annotation and data augmentation, using external linguistic resources, can improve both translation of MWEs that occur in the source, and the generation of MWEs on the target, and increase performance by up to 5.09 BLEU points on MWE test sets. We also devise a MWE score to specifically assess the quality of MWE translation which agrees with human evaluation. We make available the MWEscore implementation - along with MWE-annotated training sets and corpus-based lists of MWEs - for reproduction and extension.

AB Hierarchical phrase-based machine translation model is a popular syntax model that makes use of the expressive power of Synchronous Context-Free Grammars (SCFG) to address the reordering problem in statistical machine translation. The model, however, generally suffers from a great amount of redundancy in the extracted translation rules. In this paper, we re-introduce the concept of rift into the rule extraction procedure to force the rules with reordering power to concentrate on where reordering has actually happened. Our approach brings a dramatic reduction in the training time and the number of the rules, with only minor sacrifice in translation quality.

AB Knowledge bases in machine translation (MT) systems have proved successful in some constrained domains, but have not scaled up for two reasons. One is that the building of knowledge base (KB) is painstakingly handcrafted from scratch, and the other is that the most KBs for machine translation (MT) lack supports from powerful theory system based on semantic understanding. This paper focuses on the building of semantic knowledge base (SKB) guided by the Concept of Hierarchical Network (HNC) theory which is suitable for machine translation. Besides bilingual general attributes, the semantic attributes at all levels are described in a word such as concept category, semantic representation, and sentence category and concept relation. By doing this, we try to solve the semantic mapping problems between Chinese and English at the level of word, chunk and sentence. The SKB has been used both in the analysis of the source language and target language translation process. The accuracy of translation system based on the SKB has increased considerably.

AB Machine Translation (MT) systems employed to translate queries for Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval typically produce a single translation with maximum translation quality. This, however, might not be optimal with respect to retrieval quality and other translation variants might lead to better retrieval results. In this paper, we explore a method using multiple translations produced by an MT system, which are reranked using a supervised machine-learning method trained to directly optimize retrieval quality. We experiment with various types of features and the results obtained on the medical-domain test collection from the CLEF eHealth Lab series show significant improvement of retrieval quality compared to a system using single translation provided by MT.

AB Machine translation has been applied to software engineering (SE) problems, e.g., software tagging, language migration, bug localization, auto program repair, etc. However, machine translation primarily supports only sequence-to-sequence transformations and falls short during the translation/transformation from a phrase or sequence in the input to a set in the output. An example of such a task is tagging the input text in a software library tutorial or a forum entry text with a set of API elements that are relevant to the input.
   In this work, we propose PHRASE2SET, a context-sensitive statistical machine translation model that learns to transform a phrase of a mixture of code and texts into a set of code or text tokens. We first design a token-to-token algorithm that computes the probabilities of mapping individual tokens from phrases to sets. We propose a Bayesian network-based statistical machine translation model that uses these probabilities to decide a translation process that maximizes the joint translation probability. To achieve that, we consider the context of the tokens in the source side and that in the target side via their relative co-occurrence frequencies. We evaluate PHRASE2SET in three SE applications: 1) tagging the fragments of texts in a tutorial with the relevant API elements, 2) tagging the StackOverflow entries with relevant API elements, 3) text-to-API translation. Our empirical results show that PHRASE2SET achieves high accuracy and outperforms the state-of-the-art models in all three applications. We also provide the lessons learned and other potential applications.

TI Telemedicine as a special case of machine translation
SO COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL IMAGING AND GRAPHICS
AB Machine translation is evolving quite rapidly in terms of quality. Nowadays, we have several machine translation systems available in the web, which provide reasonable translations. However, these systems are not perfect, and their quality may decrease in some specific domains. This paper examines the effects of different training methods when it comes to Polish-English Statistical Machine Translation system used for the medical data. Numerous elements of the EMEA parallel text corpora and not related OPUS Open Subtitles project were used as the ground for creation of phrase tables and different language models including the development, tuning and testing of these translation systems. The BLEU, NIST, METEOR, and TER metrics have been used in order to evaluate the results of various systems. Our experiments deal with the systems that include POS tagging, factored phrase models, hierarchical models, syntactic taggers, and other alignment methods. We also executed a deep analysis of Polish data as preparatory work before automatized data processing such as true casing or punctuation normalization phase. Normalized metrics was used to compare results. Scores lower than 15% mean that Machine Translation engine is unable to provide satisfying quality, scores greater than 30% mean that translations should be understandable without problems and scores over 50 reflect adequate translations. The average results of Polish to English translations scores for BLEU, NIST, METEOR, and TER were relatively high and ranged from 7058 to 8272. The lowest score was 6438. The average results ranges for English to Polish translations were little lower (6758-7897). The real-life implementations of presented high quality Machine Translation Systems are anticipated in general medical practice and telemedicine. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Our experiment in Hungarian-English machine translation is an attempt to develop prototypes of a syntax-driven machine translation system and to examine the effects of various preprocessing steps (POS-tagging, lemmatization and syntactic parsing) on system performance. The annotated monolingual texts needed for different language specific tasks were taken from the Szeged Treebank and the Penn Treebank. The parallel sentences were collected from the Hunglish Corpus. Each developed prototype runs fully automatically and new Hungarian-related functions are built in. The results are evaluated with BLEU score.

The qualitative corpus consists of 700K parallel sentences of which 535K sentences were created using multiple methods such as extract, align and review of Hindi-Telugu corpora, end-to-end human translation, iterative back-translation driven post-editing and around 165K parallel sentences were collected from available sources in the public domain. We present the comparative assessment of created parallel corpora for representativeness and diversity. The corpus has been pre-processed for machine translation, and we trained a neural machine translation system using it and report state-of-the-art baseline results on the developed development set over multiple domains and on available benchmarks. With this, we define a new task on Domain Machine Translation for low resource language pairs such as Hindi and Telugu. The developed corpus (535K) is freely available for non-commercial research and to the best of our knowledge, this is the well curated, largest, publicly available domain parallel corpus for Hindi-Telugu.

For adaptation, we use neural networks to solve analogies between sentences across languages. Oracle experiments allow to identify the best retrieval technique and to estimate the possibilities of such an approach.

TI English to Tamil machine translation system using universal networking
   language
SO SADHANA-ACADEMY PROCEEDINGS IN ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB This paper proposes English to Tamil machine translation system, using the universal networking language (UNL) as the intermediate representation. The UNL approach is a hybrid approach of the rule and knowledge-based approaches to machine translation. UNL is a declarative formal language, specifically designed to represent semantic data extracted from a natural language text. The input English sentence is converted to UNL (enconversion), which is then converted to a Tamil sentence (deconversion) by ensuring that the meaning of the input sentence is preserved. The representation of UNL was modified to suit the translation process. A new sentence formation algorithm was also proposed to rearrange the translated Tamil words to sentences. The translation system was evaluated using bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) score. A BLEU score of 0.581 was achieved, which is an indication that most of the information in the input sentence is retained in the translated sentence. The scores obtained using the UNL based approach were compared with existing approaches to translation, and it can be concluded that the UNL is a more suited approach to machine translation.

It consists of two phases, first, it generates a translation candidate for the input Chinese organization name by an example-based translation method; and secondly, it uses the web to amend this translation candidate so as to finish such tasks: translation candidate reordering, word selection revising, and adjustment of the use of function words. Experimental results show that our method outperforms competing traditional statistical translation method in the task of translating Chinese ONs.

AB A set of Context Sensitive Grammar (CSG) rules to translate Bangla imperative, optative and exclamatory sentences into English are introduced in this paper. In this paper, sentences are considered according to the function and purpose of the user rather than structure of the sentence. Three algorithms are implemented to complete major three steps of machine translation system (i.e., parsing, transfer and generation). The experimental results shows that the performance of the proposed machine translation framework is quite appeasement and efficiency is compared with Google Translator for some selected sentences which are quite satisfactory.

TI IoT-Based English Translation Teaching from the Perspective of
   Artificial Intelligence
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION
AB In recent years, with the development of artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a research hotspot in industry and academia. At the same time, as a derivative tool of artificial intelligence, machine translation based on the IoT is constantly being applied to English translation and its teaching. In teaching, helping students learn English translation has been the focus of machine translation in recent years. Compared with human translation, machine translation is more efficient and convenient. However, machine translation also has some problems. Compared with traditional human translation, it cannot meet the requirements of faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance of translation. In many fields, neural network translation is comparable to human translation. In the field of English translation teaching, neural network translation has broad prospects. With the gradual maturity of neural network translation, we should think about how to use neural network translation to make it a powerful English translation teaching tool instead of sticking to traditional teaching and cultivating students who are completely unable to compare it with neural network translation. Therefore, in the context of rapid AI iteration, college English translation teaching should also keep pace with the times. With the help of tools such as neural network translation, English translation talents who can skillfully use AI technology can be trained quickly and efficiently so that they can keep pace with the times and master the power of AI. The research in this paper provides important guidance for the application of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, especially for intelligent relaying.

AB The Interactive Machine Translation (IMT) systems produce translations combining the knowledge of professional translators with the generation speed of the Machine Translation (MT) models. Both interact with the finality of generating error-free translations. The main goal of research in the IMT field is to reduce the effort that the professional translators have to perform during the IMT session. There are very different techniques to reduce this effort, from changing the display used to perform the corrections to changing the feedback signal that the user sends to the MT model. This article propose a method to reduce the effort performed by applying Confidence Measures (CMs) that give us a score for each translation and only let the user translate those that obtained a low score. We have trained for Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models to approximate the scores from four of the most used metrics in MT: Bleu, Meteor, Chr-F, and Ter. We have simulated the user interaction with an Interactive-Predictive Neural Machine Translation (IPNMT) system to study the effort reduction that we can obtain while getting high-quality translations from the system. We have tested different thresholds values to consider that a translation has a low score, which gives us a transition between a convention IPNMT system where the system has to correct all the translations to an unsupervised MT system. The results showed that this method obtains very good translations - 70 points of Bleu - and reduces the human effort by 60%.

AB This paper presents two strong methods, CTC and Imputer, for non-autoregressive machine translation that model latent alignments with dynamic programming. We revisit CTC for machine translation and demonstrate that a simple CTC model can achieve state-of-the-art for single-step non-autoregressive machine translation, contrary to what prior work indicates. In addition, we adapt the Imputer model for non-autoregressive machine translation and demonstrate that Imputer with just 4 generation steps can match the performance of an autoregressive Transformer baseline. Our latent alignment models are simpler than many existing non-autoregressive translation baselines; for example, we do not require target length prediction or re-scoring with an autoregressive model. On the competitive WMT'14 En!De task, our CTC model achieves 25.7 BLEU with a single generation step, while Imputer achieves 27.5 BLEU with 2 generation steps, and 28.0 BLEU with 4 generation steps. This compares favourably to the autoregressive Transformer baseline at 27.8 BLEU.

AB One of the limitations of translation memory systems is that the smallest translation units currently accessible are aligned sentential pairs. We propose an example-based machine translation system which uses a 'phrasal lexicon' in addition to the aligned sentences in its database. These phrases are extracted from the Penn Treebank using the Marker Hypothesis as a constraint on segmentation. They are then translated by three on-line machine translation (MT) systems, and a number of linguistic resources are automatically constructed which are used in the translation of new input.
   We perform two experiments on testsets of sentences and noun phrases to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system. In so doing, we obtain insights into. the strengths and weaknesses of the selected on-line MT systems. Finally, like many example-based machine translation systems, our approach also suffers from the problem of 'boundary friction'. Where the quality of resulting translations is compromised as a result, we use a novel, post hoc validation procedure via the World Wide Web to correct imperfect translations prior to their being output to the user.

AB One of the main causes of errors in statistical machine translation are tire erroneous phrase pairs that can find their way into the phrase table. These phrases are the result of poor word-to-word alignments during the training of the translation model. These word alignment errors in turn cause errors during the phrase extraction phase, and these erroneous bilingual phrase pairs are then used during the decoding process and appear in the output of the machine translation system. Machine translation training data is never perfect, often bilingual sentence pairs are incorrectly aligned sentence-by-sentence, or these pairs are poor translations of each other due to human error Even when sentence pairs in the corpus are good translations of each other the translations may not be literal enough to admit to the sort of phrase-by-phrase translation necessary to make good training data for a phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) system. This is because such SMT systems operate on the assumption that source can be transformed into target simply by translating phrase-by-phrase with re-ordering. In the real world, many perfectly correct translations are not of this form, and these sentences even though correct translations, make poor training data for training the translation models of a phrase-based SMT system. This paper presents a technique in which preliminary machine translation systems are built with the sole purpose of indicating those sentence pairs in the training corpus that the systems are able to generate using their models, the hypothesis being that these sentence pairs are likely to make good training data for an SMT system of the same type. These sentences are then used to bootstrap a second SMT system, and those sentences identified as good training data are given additional weight during the training process for building the translation models. Using this technique we were able to improve the performance of a Japanese-to-English SMT system by 1.2-1.5 BLEU points on unseen evaluation data.

AB It has been shown that machine translation models usually generate poor translations for named entities that are infrequent in the training corpus. Earlier named entity translation methods mainly focus on phonetic transliteration, which ignores the sentence context for translation and is limited in domain and language coverage. To address this limitation, we propose DEEP, a DEnoising Entity Pre-training method that leverages large amounts of monolingual data and a knowledge base to improve named entity translation accuracy within sentences. Besides, we investigate a multi-task learning strategy that finetunes a pre-trained neural machine translation model on both entity-augmented monolingual data and parallel data to further improve entity translation. Experimental results on three language pairs demonstrate that DEEP results in significant improvements over strong denoising autoencoding baselines, with a gain of up to 1.3 BLEU and up to 9.2 entity accuracy points for English-Russian translation.(1)

TI New Light Shed on Chinese Word Segmentation in MT by a Language
   Investigation
SO META
AB The Chinese language, unlike some western languages, is written without a space between any two words, which presents itself as a unique problem in Machine Translation: how to segment words in Chinese? The current word-segmentation systems in Machine Translation are either linguistically-oriented or statistically-oriented. Both types, however, have some innate defects that cannot be overcome due to the pragmatically-oriented feature of the Chinese language. This research aims at addressing the problem of Chinese word segmentation of Machine Translation in light of a language investigation consisting of two surveys and eight interviews.

AB Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have been successfully applied for improved speech recognition and statistical machine translation (SMT) for N-best list re-ranking. In SMT, we investigate using bilingual word-aligned sentences to train a bilingual recurrent neural network model. We employ a bag-of-word representation of a source sentence as additional input features in model training. Experimental results show that our proposed approach performs consistently better than recurrent neural network language model trained only on target-side text in terms of machine translation performance. We also investigate other input representation of a source sentence based on latent semantic analysis.

AB Quality estimation could be a method for automatically indicating the standard of computational linguistics results without looking forward to human reference translations, i.e. determining how a machine translation system can produce good or bad translations without need human intervention. The main aim of this paper is to demonstrate the concept used to deal with the problem of estimating on a Hindi and English combined language pairs. To perform the proposed technique, we are using DL based quality estimation feature extraction and therefore, in this paper, we perform experiments on a set of multiple features along with the various Neural RNN models. The first part of implementing the recurrent neural networks generates the quality information about whether each word in translation is properly translated. The second part is that using the accuracy and loss of all the RNN models predicted is used to compare the quality of translation of each of the models. We apply these models on the English to Hindi taken from manythings.org website.

AB This paper reports the results of the first experiment dealing with the challenges of building a machine translation system for user-generated content involving a complex South Slavic language. We focus on translation of English impb user movie reviews into Serbian, in a low-resource scenario. We explore potentials and limits of (i) phrase-based and neural machine translation systems trained on out-of-domain clean parallel data from news articles (ii) creating additional synthetic in-domain parallel corpus by machine-translating the English impb corpus into Serbian. Our main findings are that morphology and syntax are better handled by the neural approach than by the phrase-based approach even in this low-resource mismatched domain scenario, however the situation is different for the lexical aspect, especially for person names. This finding also indicates that in general, machine translation of person names into Slavic languages (especially those which require/allow transcription) should be investigated more systematically.

AB Neither assigning similar priority to all phrases nor pruning out the incorrect phrases from the phrase table can improve the accuracy of machine translation. In this paper, we present a novel method for weight re-adjustment of phrase table in a statistical machine translation system. It learns the correct and incorrect phrases from bilingual corpora. Based on the syntactic phrase-level information, phrase table is updated with the weights estimated using probability distribution. Evaluation on English-Hindi technical domain corpora shows that our proposed method is more effective in producing better output in terms of BLEU, RIBES and NIST metrics. We shows that the proposed methods works well for other language pairs like Hindi-Konkani and Bengali-Hindi. Finally, we realised that this minor probabilistic change can improve the accuracy of the machine translation system a lot.

AB At recent time, the statistical based language model and neural based language model are still dominating the researches in the field of machine translation. The statistical based machine translation today is the fastest one but it has a weakness in term of accuracy. In contrast, the neural based network has higher accuracy but has a very slow computation process. In this research, a comparison between neural based network that adopts Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and statistical based network with n-gram model for two-way English-Indonesian Machine Translation (MT) is conducted. The perplexity value evaluation of both models show that the use of RNN obtains a more excellent result. Meanwhile, Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) and Rank-based Intuitive Bilingual Evaluation Score (RIBES) values increase by 1.1 and 1.6 higher than the results obtained using statistical based.

AB Both Japanese and Mongolian are agglutinative languages, and they have many syntactic similarities. Therefore, we can translate Japanese into Mongolian by replacing Japanese words with corresponding Mongolian words after morphological analysis of Japanese sentences. However, the main problems of Japanese-Mongolian machine translation are Japanese conjugative words processing and Mongolian pronunciation processing. For this, in this paper, based on the insistence that there is no conjugative derivational grammar in Japanese, we have made suffixes definition table which considers stem and suffix connection. According to this chart, it analyzes Japanese suffixes again. And from the view of natural language processing, it not only overviews Mongolian grammar, but also makes pronunciation processing. Then, it produces Mongolian words. Furthermore, it constructs the unique Japanese-Mongolian machine translation system. We have made the machine translation experiment on 187 sentences from 30 Japanese articles, and the correct probability is 80.2%.

TI QUES: A Quality Estimation System of Arabic to English Translation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB Estimating translation quality is a problem of growing importance as it has many potential applications. The quality of translation from Arabic to English is especially difficult to evaluate due to the languages being distant languages: different in syntax and low in lexical similarity. We propose a feature-based framework for estimating the quality of Arabic to English translations at the sentence level. The proposed method works without reference translations, considers both fluency and adequacy of translations, and does not imply assumptions on the source of translation (humans, machines, or post-edited machine translations); thus, making the solution applicable to increasingly more situations. This research solves the translation quality estimation problem by treating it as a supervised machine learning problem. The proposed model utilizes regression algorithms (SVR and Linear Regression) to predict quality scores of unseen translated texts at runtime. This is accomplished by training models on a labeled parallel corpus and mapping extracted features to the quality label. The prediction models succeeded in predicting fluency and adequacy of translations with a Mean Absolute Error of 0.84 and 1.02, respectively. Furthermore, we show that in a similar setting of our approach, fluency of an Arabic to English translated sentence on its own, is an appropriate indication of a translation's overall quality.

AB The translation sector is going under major changes that will undoubtedly be accentuated in the future owing to the development of automation and artificial intelligence, and more specifically, of machine translation. Technology also plays a crucial role in the translation process and has a significant impact on translation competence. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that university translation programmes incorporate new translation technology into their curriculums in order to ensure that students are made aware of their usefulness in order to fulfil industry employment needs. This piece of research strives at mapping how and what for translation students use MT, and what are their attitudes and perceptions towards its use. Findings of a qualitative analysis indicate that undergraduate students have a positive general attitude towards MT and its many advantages, whereas they show preoccupation when MT professional issues are addressed.

TI Investigating the post-editing effort associated with machine-translated
   metaphors: a process-driven analysis
SO JOURNAL OF SPECIALISED TRANSLATION
AB This paper reports on a study that analyses the impact of two different machine translation (MT) outputs on the cognitive effort required to post-edit machine-translated metaphors by means of eye tracking and think-aloud protocols. We hypothesise that the statistical MT output would have a positive effect on reducing cognitive effort. In order to test this hypothesis, a post-editing experiment was conducted with two different groups of participants. Each experimental group had two post-editing tasks using the language pair English into Brazilian Portuguese. On Task 1 (T1), participants were asked to post-edit a Google machine-translated output whereas on Task 2 (T2) the same participants were assigned to post-edit a Systran machine translated output. Data collection was conducted under the experimental paradigm of data triangulation in translation process research. Data analysis focuses on eye tracking data related to fixation duration and pupil dilation as well as think-aloud protocols. This analysis shows that the cognitive effort required to post-edit the pure statistical MT output might be lower in comparison to the hybrid output when conventional metaphors are machine translated.

AB Given the ever-increasing scale and diversity of medical literature widely published in English on the Internet, improving the performance of information retrieval by cross-language is an urgent research objective. Cross-language medical information retrieval (CLMIR) consists of providing a query in one language and searching medical document collections in one or more different languages. Our users of CLMIR are users who are able to read biomedical texts in English, but have difficulty formulating English queries. This paper proposes a French/English CLMIR system as a mixing model for supporting the retrieval of English medical documents. Methods fall into the category of query translation approach in which we use a hybrid machine translation that combines a pattern-based module with a rule-based translator and includes three steps from pre- to- post-translation. In parallel to this hybrid machine translation, we use multilingual UMLS Methasaurus as a complementary translator. The results show that using a mixing translation module outperforms machine translation-based method and thesaurus-based method used separately.

AB Translation of discourse relations is one of the recent efforts of incorporating discourse information to statistical machine translation (SMT). While existing works focus on disambiguation of ambiguous discourse connectives, or transformation of discourse trees, only explicit discourse relations are tackled. A greater challenge exists in machine translation of Chinese, since implicit discourse relations are abundant and occur both inside and outside a sentence. This thesis proposal describes ongoing work on bilingual discourse annotation and plans towards incorporating discourse relation knowledge to a Chinese-English SMT system with consideration of implicit discourse relations. The final goal is a discourse-unit-based translation model unbounded by the traditional assumption of sentence-to-sentence translation.

AB In recent years, a new approach of processing Chinese word segmentation (CWS) as a machine translation (MT) problem has emerged in CWS task research. However, directly applying the MT model to CWS task would introduce translation errors and result in poor word segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel method named Translation Correcting to solve this problem. Based on the differences between CWS and MT, Translation Correcting eliminates translation errors by utilizing the information of a sentence that needs to be segmented during the translation process. Consequently, the performance of word segmentation is considerably improved. Additionally, We get a new model called CWSTransformer, which is obtained by improving the MT model Transformer using Translation Correcting. The experiment compares the performances of CWSTransformer, Transformer and the previous translation-based CWS model on the benchmark datasets, PKU and MSR. The experimental results show that CWSTransformer outperforms Transformer and the previous translation-based CWS model.

AB Machine translation software has become heavily integrated into our daily lives due to the recent improvement in the performance of deep neural networks. However, machine translation software has been shown to regularly return erroneous translations, which can lead to harmful consequences such as economic loss and political conflicts. Additionally, due to the complexity of the underlying neural models, testing machine translation systems presents new challenges. To address this problem, we introduce a novel methodology called PatInv. The main intuition behind PatInv is that sentences with different meanings should not have the same translation. Under this general idea, we provide two realizations of PatInv that given an arbitrary sentence, generate syntactically similar but semantically different sentences by: (1) replacing one word in the sentence using a masked language model or (2) removing one word or phrase from the sentence based on its constituency structure. We then test whether the returned translations are the same for the original and modified sentences. We have applied PatInv to test Go ogle Translate and Bing Microsoft Translator using 200 English sentences. Two language settings are considered: English -> Hindi (En-Hi) and English -> Chinese (En-Zh). The results show that PatInv can accurately find 308 erroneous translations in Go ogle Translate and 223 erroneous translations in Bing Microsoft Translator, most of which cannot be found by the state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Without real bilingual corpus available, unsupervised Neural Machine Translation (NMT) typically requires pseudo parallel data generated with the back-translation method for the model training. However, due to weak supervision, the pseudo data inevitably contain noises and errors that will be accumulated and reinforced in the subsequent training process, leading to bad translation performance. To address this issue, we introduce phrase based Statistic Machine Translation (SMT) models which are robust to noisy data, as posterior regularizations to guide the training of unsupervised NMT models in the iterative back-translation process. Our method starts from SMT models built with pre-trained language models and word-level translation tables inferred from cross-lingual embeddings. Then SMT and NMT models are optimized jointly and boost each other incrementally in a unified EM framework. In this way, (1) the negative effect caused by errors in the iterative back-translation process can be alleviated timely by SMT filtering noises from its phrase tables; meanwhile, (2) NMT can compensate for the deficiency of fluency inherent in SMT. Experiments conducted on en-fr and en-de translation tasks show that our method outperforms the strong baseline and achieves new state-of-the-art unsupervised machine translation performance.

Machine Translation (MT) is one of the most innovative technologies to be deployed in the field of translation, but it is still too early to predict how it can support the creativity and productivity of professional translators in the future. Currently, MT is more widely used in (non-AV) text translation than in AVT. In this article, we discuss MT technology and demonstrate why its use in AVT scenarios is particularly challenging. We also present some potentially useful methods and tools for measuring MT quality that have been developed primarily for text translation. The ultimate objective is to bridge the gap between the tech-savvy AVT community, on the one hand, and researchers and developers in the field of high-quality MT, on the other.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN LEARNING
AB Stochastic finite automata have been applied to a variety of fields, machine translation is one of them. It can learn from data and build model automatically from training sets. Stochastic finite automata are well adapted for the constrained integration of pairs of sentences for language processing. In this paper, a novel machine translation method based on stochastic finite automata is proposed. The method formalized rational grammars by using stochastic finite automata. Through given pairs of source and target utterances, our proposed method will produce a series of conventional rules from which a stochastic rational grammar would be inferred, and the grammar is finally converted into a finite state automaton. The efficacy and accuracy of our proposed method is evaluated by a large number of English-Chinese and Chinese-English machine translation experiments.

AB This paper proposes the Prefix-Root-Postfix-Encoding (PRPE) algorithm, which performs close-to-morphological segmentation of words as part of text pre-processing in machine translation. PRPE is a cross-language algorithm requiring only minor tweaking to adapt it for any particular language, a property which makes it potentially useful for morphologically rich languages with no morphological analysers available. As a key part of the proposed algorithm we introduce the 'Root alignment' principle to extract potential sub-words from a corpus, as well as a special technique for constructing words from potential sub-words. In addition, we supplemented the algorithm with specific processing for named-entities based on transliteration. We conducted experiments with two different neural machine translation systems, training them on parallel corpora for English-Latvian and Latvian-English translation. Evaluation of translation quality showed improvements in BLEU scores when the data were pre-processed using the proposed algorithm, compared to a couple of baseline word segmentation algorithms. Although we were able to demonstrate improvements in both translation directions and for both NMT systems, they were relatively minor, and our experiments show that machine translation with inflected languages remains challenging, especially with translation direction towards a highly inflected language.

AB In interactive machine translation (MT), human translators correct errors in automatic translations in collaboration with the MT systems, and this is an effective way to improve productivity gain in translation. Phrase-based statistical MT (PB-SMT) has been the mainstream approach to MT for the past 30 years, both in academia and industry. Neural MT (NMT), an end-to-end learning approach to MT, represents the current state-of-the-art in MT research. The recent studies on interactive MT have indicated that NMT can significantly outperform PB-SMT.
   In this work, first we investigate the possibility of integrating lexical syntactic descriptions in the form of supertags into the state-of-the-art NMT model, Transformer. Then, we explore whether integration of supertags into Transformer could indeed reduce human efforts in translation in an interactive-predictive platform. From our investigation we found that our syntaxaware interactive NMT (INMT) framework significantly reduces simulated human efforts in the French-to-English and Hindi-to-English translation tasks, achieving a 2.65 point absolute corresponding to 5.65% relative improvement and a 6.55 point absolute corresponding to 19.1% relative improvement, respectively, in terms of word prediction accuracy (WPA) over the respective baselines.

TI Complex networks analysis of manual and machine translations
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C
AB Complex networks have been increasingly used in text analysis, including in connection with natural language processing tools, as important text features appear to be captured by the topology and dynamics of the networks. Following previous works that apply complex networks concepts to text quality measurement, summary evaluation, and author characterization, we now focus on machine translation (MT). In this paper we assess the possible representation of texts as complex networks to evaluate cross-linguistic issues inherent in manual and machine translation. We show that different quality translations generated by NIT tools can be distinguished from their manual counterparts by means of metrics such as in-(ID) and out-degrees (OD), clustering coefficient (CC), and shortest paths (SP). For instance, we demonstrate that the average OD in networks of automatic translations consistently exceeds the values obtained for manual ones, and that the CC values of source texts are not preserved for manual translations, but are for good automatic translations. This probably reflects the text rearrangements humans perform during manual translation. We envisage that such findings could lead to better NIT tools and automatic evaluation metrics.

AB Phrase-based translation models have shown clear advantages over word-based models, and weighted finite-state transducers (WFST's) provide a unified framework for integrating the various components of a speech-to-speech translation system, such as speech recognition and machine translation. This paper combines these two ideas by proposing a constrained phrase-based statistical machine translation system that we implement using WFST's. We evaluate the proposed model on a bidirectional Chinese-English translation task and show improvements over our previous system.

AB The present paper introduces a formalization language for sentences and text corpora that helps tackle the acute problem of formalizing semantic and structural matches of different language systems by direct machine translation. In the paper, a detailed look is taken at the elements of reference and situation-based analysis of the representations of surface and in-depth semantics of semantic contexts in the sphere of business communication relying on the meaning-text theory for automated formalization of language structures and their matches by machine translation. The study is aimed at working out an algorithm that will enhance the quality of machine translation excluding intermediary natural languages and post-editing of translated texts. A distinguishing feature of the suggested approach is structurization and formalization of language structures on the stage of text pre-processing. Such << input filter >> of information will enable decoding system create literate messages in compliance with lexical and grammatical distributive principles both in a foreign language and native language, and use them for proofreading of texts in a native language and building structures that can be further translated by existing machine translation systems with high quality.

AB Machine translation (MT) is increasingly becoming popular today as it reduces a great deal of efforts when it comes to the task of translation from one language to other. Not only is it time saving, but secure and cost-effective in the long run. A lot of work has been done in the field of MT lately. Various machine translation systems (MTS) have been developed for numerous languages. Sanskrit is one of the oldest languages in the world and is still in existence. There is loads of literary, scientific and mathematical work written in Sanskrit during ancient times. Despite of its important part in Indian culture and history, not much work has been done for translation to or from Sanskrit language. This proposed work is an effort to bridge the language gap between Sanskrit and Hindi, one of the most widely spoken languages of the world. The idea is to develop an MTS which will serve as a tool to perform two-way translation between Hindi and Sanskrit language. The system once developed can be used for learning and understanding the grammar and structure of both the involved languages.

AB Under the context of globalization, communications between countries and cultures are becoming increasingly frequent, which make it imperative to use some techniques to help translate. This paper is to explore the influence of computer-aided translation on translators, which is derived from the field of the computer-aided translation (CAT) and machine translation (MT). Followed by an introduction to the development of machine and computer-aided translation, it then depicts the technologies practicable to translators, which are trying to analyze the demand of designing the computer-aided translation so far in translation practice, and optimize the designation of computer-aided translation techniques, and analyze its operability in translation. The findings underline the advantages and disadvantages of MT and CAT tools, and the serviceability and future development of MT and CAT technologies. Finally, this thesis probes into the impact of these new technologies on translators in hope that more translators and translation researchers can learn to use such tools to improve their productivity.

We propose methods based on the mutual intelligibility of the two languages, taking advantage of their orthographic and phonological similarity, in the hope to improve over our baselines. The translation results are evaluated using BLEU. On this metric, none of our proposals could outperform the baselines on the final test set. The current setups are rather preliminary, and there are several potential improvements we can try in the future.

AB Machine translation is a process of translating one natural language to another without much human interaction. Evaluation of any Machine Translation System (MTS) is the most important factor in a machine learning environment. There are many techniques existing to determine and optimize the quality of output in any MTS. Earlier methods are based on human judgments. Even though human evaluation methods are very much reliable, they suffer due to some disadvantages such as high cost, more time consuming and also poor re-usability. Hence, automatic methods have been proposed to reduce time and cost. In this survey, we have discussed different metrics under the automatic evaluation techniques in order to evaluate the output quality of MTS. It is believed that machine learning system developers at large would get befitted by this survey.

SO BUSINESS AND POLITICS
AB This article specifies and explores the hypothesis that the diversity of human languages, right now a barrier to "interoperability" in communication and trade, will become significantly less of a barrier as machine translation technologies are deployed over the next several years. We argue that machine translation will become the 2020's analogy for ideas, to what container shipping did for goods trade in the second half of the twentieth century. But as with container shipping or railroads in the nineteenth century, this new boundary-cost and transaction-cost reducing technology does not reduce all boundary and transaction costs equally, and so creates new challenges for the distribution of ideas and thus for innovation and economic growth. How we develop, license, commercialize, and deploy machine translation will be a critical determinant of its impact on trade, political coalitions, diversity of thought and culture, and the distribution of wealth.

AB In the context of ontology alignment, linguistic analysis is a prominent solution, used by various proposed methodologies. When mapping ontologies that use the same language, the existent approaches have been shown to produce significant results, being able to handle complex descriptions of the enclosed concepts and properties. In order to expand the applied linguistic methods in a cross-language context, i.e. to align ontologies that use different languages, it is essential to automate the process of finding lexical correspondences, beyond simple term translation, between the entity descriptions provided by the involved ontologies. The present paper proposes a machine learning approach to obtain the optimal from a set of translation provided by different automated machine translation services, in order to use it as the basis for aligning ontology pairs that provide complex descriptions expressed in different languages.

TI Neural machine translation of clinical texts between long distance
   languages
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION
AB Objective: To analyze techniques for machine translation of electronic health records (EHRs) between long distance languages, using Basque and Spanish as a reference. We studied distinct configurations of neural machine translation systems and used different methods to overcome the lack of a bilingual corpus of clinical texts or health records in Basque and Spanish.
   Materials and Methods: We trained recurrent neural networks on an out-of-domain corpus with different hyperparameter values. Subsequently, we used the optimal configuration to evaluate machine translation of EHR templates between Basque and Spanish, using manual translations of the Basque templates into Spanish as a standard. We successively added to the training corpus clinical resources, including a Spanish-Basque dictionary derived from resources built for the machine translation of the Spanish edition of SNOMED CT into Basque, artificial sentences in Spanish and Basque derived from frequently occurring relationships in SNOMED CT, and Spanish monolingual EHRs. Apart from calculating bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) values, we tested the performance in the clinical domain by human evaluation.
   Results: We achieved slight improvements from our reference system by tuning some hyperparameters using an out-of-domain bilingual corpus, obtaining 10.67 BLEU points for Basque-to-Spanish clinical domain translation. The inclusion of clinical terminology in Spanish and Basque and the application of the back-translation technique on monolingual EHRs significantly improved the performance, obtaining 21.59 BLEU points. This was confirmed by the human evaluation performed by 2 clinicians, ranking our machine translations close to the human translations.
   Discussion: We showed that, even after optimizing the hyperparameters out-of-domain, the inclusion of available resources from the clinical domain and applied methods were beneficial for the described objective, managing to obtain adequate translations of EHR templates.
   Conclusion: We have developed a system which is able to properly translate health record templates from Basque to Spanish without making use of any bilingual corpus of clinical texts or health records.

AB Sampark is machine translation system providing translations among nine pairs of Indian languages. Machine translation system is a class of natural language processing applications that is far more complex and highly compute intensive in nature. As the load on the deployed system increases, optimization becomes a challenge. Caching is one of the available options to improve the performance of a software system with increasing load which exhibit the characteristics of locality of reference. Sampark MT system being a natural language processing application exhibits this characteristic.
   Memcached is a well-known, simple, in-memory caching solution that has been applied to improve the performance of several distributed web applications in the past. This paper describes how memcached has been applied to improve the performance of Sampark machine translation service which is deployed on a large cluster of machines. By applying distributed caching to MT system the performance of the system has improved upto 40%.

AB Text is the fundamental element in document classification in many natural language applications. Filipinos are fond of using social networking sites. With the rapid increase in the usage of social networking sites such as Twitter and blogs, there is also an increase in the use of casual language which often does not conform to the rules of spelling, structure and grammar of the specific language of the Filipinos, Tagalog. In this study, those shortened words or Non-Standard Words (NSW) were normalized in order to be easily understand by its readers. In this paper, we discussed the effectiveness of Dictionary Substitution Approach (DSA) and Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) on Tagalog Corpus. The way these machine translations treat the corpus are tackled. The final goal is to determine which machine translation is better. Results identified in this study that DSA and SMT both have advantages and disadvantages.

   translation
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB In this paper, we propose and evaluate a novel dynamic feature function for log-linear model combinations in phrase-based statistical machine translation. The feature function is inspired on the popularly known vector-space model which is typically used in information retrieval and text mining applications, and it aims at improving translation unit selection at decoding time by incorporating context information from the source language. Significant improvements on an English-Spanish experimental corpus are presented and discussed.

AB Extraction of a large number of Super-Function (SF) is the most important factor in realizing SF based machine translation. This paper presents a method for automatic extraction of SF from a Japanese-Enghsh bilingual corpus. The extraction process uses a bilingual dictionary to match Japanese and English nouns in each sentence pair. The experimental results using a Japanese-English bilingual corpus show that this method performs very well in automatically extracting SF for machine translation. In addition, we evaluate the extracted SF in SF based machine translation.

AB This paper presents a simple and robust consensus decoding approach for combining multiple Machine Translation (MT) system outputs. A consensus network is constructed from an N-best list by aligning the hypotheses against an alignment reference, where the alignment is based on minimising the translation edit rate (TER). The Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding technique is investigated for the selection of an appropriate alignment reference. Several alternative decoding strategies proposed to retain coherent phrases in the original translations. Experimental results are presented primarily based on three-way combination of Chinese-English translation outputs, and also presents results for six-way system combination. It is shown that worthwhile improvements in translation performance can be obtained using the methods discussed.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPEECH TECHNOLOGY
AB Machine language translation (MLT) has acquired a substantial quantity of investigation consideration in Europe and Asia, but works on African languages, especially the Yoruba language, are rare. There is, however, a communication barrier between the people who solely speak Yoruba and foreign visitors and places where the language is not being said or understood. There is a necessity to focus on the glitches of English to Yoruba machine translations to bridge the communication gap. This study, therefore, implemented the rule-based machine translation technique. The method used involved formulating 20 computational rules for the translation process. Offline Android-based English to Yoruba short message service application was developed using the Android Studio IDE and the some of the available inbuilt android plugins alongside a locally produced bilingual dictionary. This paper also examined translations done by the developed mobile app contrary to human translation to explore why machine translation systems still give faults in interpreting natural human language. A questionnaire was designed for the translations; they were distributed to one hundred individuals. Eighty-one participants gave their feedbacks. The responses were dispensed to statistical examination using SPSS. Discoveries showed that human translation handled best-concerning precision and eloquence, which are knowledgeable by the quality and the quantity of the computational rules formulated.

AB In recent years, there has been an increasing need for the restoration and translation of historical languages. In this study, we attempt to translate historical records in ancient Korean language based on neural machine translation (NMT). Inspired by priming, a cognitive science theory that two different stimuli influence each other, we propose novel priming ancient-Korean NMT (AKNMT) using bilingual subword embedding initialization with structural property awareness in the ancient documents. Finally, we obtain state-of-the-art results in the AKNMT task. To the best of our knowledge, we confirm the possibility of developing a human-centric model that incorporates the concepts of cognitive science and analyzes the result from the perspective of interference and cognitive dissonance theory for the first time.

We present a method to extract phrase pairs from a word-aligned bilingual corpus in which the alignments satisfy the ITG constraint, and we also extract the reordering information for the phrase pairs, which are used to build the re-ordering model. Through experiments, we show that this model obtains significant improvements over the baseline on a Chinese-English translation.

Duplicate effort can be saved on specifying state machines both in equational theories and rewrite theories, when we incorporate the theorem proving facilities of CafeOBJ with the model checking facilities of Maude. Experimental results show that efficiencies of the generated specifications by the proposed strategy are significantly improved, compared with those that are generated by three other existing translation strategies.

AB Name Entity Translation has become a challenge for the machine translators as it has become a cardinal part of Natural Language Processing Applications. Name Entity comprises of two subtasks i.e. they can either he translated or transliterated with the help of syllabification. This paper describes the translation and transliteration of name entities from English to Punjabi using statistical rule based approach. Various rules are constructed with the help of syllabification approach. We are transliterating the name entities by applying the syllabification algorithm. Name entities involved in our experiment are: Proper name, Location name, Organization name and miscellaneous. Transliteration of name entities is obtained with the help of Probability calculation. We have calculated N-Gram probabilities for all the syllables on the basis of relative frequency. For the purpose of probability calculation we have used a statistical machine translation toolkit MOSES.

The application of computational linguistics in parsing and translation helps bilingual system construct the special knowledge database used to revise and post-edit the strings. It is concluded that with the help of advanced bilingual dictionaries and domain-specific corpora, system can effectively analyze the lexical information and thematic relationship, parse the syntactic structure and translate the original sentence to the target one.

Existing research on indirect translation is almost exclusively limited to literary translation and focuses mainly on historical aspects. From a methodological perspective, textual analysis based on close reading is the main source of insight into indirect translation, while distant reading using computational approaches remains unexplored. In order to promote methodological innovation, this study gives a replicable demonstration of how to apply supervised machine learning to corpora of indirect translations. The study is based on comparable corpora of proceedings from the European Parliament. Open-access data is used to ensure the replicability of the proposed methodology. Based on the computational findings, the methodological caveats of this approach are discussed.

AB Non-autoregressive neural machine translation (NAT) generates each target word in parallel and has achieved promising inference acceleration. However, existing NAT models still have a big gap in translation quality compared to auto-regressive neural machine translation models due to the multimodality problem: the target words may come from multiple feasible translations. To address this problem, we propose a novel NAT framework ReorderNAT which explicitly models the reordering information to guide the decoding of NAT. Specially, ReorderNAT utilizes deterministic and non-deterministic decoding strategies that leverage reordering information as a proxy for the final translation to encourage the decoder to choose words belonging to the same translation. Experimental results on various widely-used datasets show that our proposed model achieves better performance compared to most existing NAT models, and even achieves comparable translation quality as autoregressive translation models with a significant speedup.

For each discourse phenomenon, we systematically collected examples where the translation of the second sentence depends on the first sentence. Compared with a previous study on test sets for English-to-French discourse translation (Bawden et al., 2018), we needed different approaches to make the data because Japanese has zero pronouns and represents different senses in different characters. We improved the translation accuracy using context-aware neural machine translation, and the improvement mainly reflects the betterment of the translation of zero pronouns.

A limited lexicon is used in this preliminary study in order to demonstrate a proof-of-concept. Grammatical categories are also restricted. Grammatical scope is further limited in tense, aspect and mood. Despite these reduced scopes, translation quality is evaluated and a first WER score for this Bantu language translation pair is presented.

But is GNMT a true "cure-all" for translation woes? How does it work in terms of translating between a pair of the most spoken world languages: Chinese and Spanish? Above all, how does it work with regard to the translation of metaphorical and metonymic expressions, since natural language is full of such kinds of expressions? In this article we will try to answer these questions. Through a small sampling of 37 metaphorical and metonymic expressions based on the noun "head", we will observe the correlation between a phrase's frequency of use and its corresponding quality of translation. Through the t-test, we were able to verify the hypothesis that the higher the frequency of use, the better the resulting.

AB Word deletion (WD) problems have a critical impact on the adequacy of translation and can lead to poor comprehension of lexical meaning in the translation result. This paper studies how the word deletion problem can be handled in statistical machine translation (SMT) in detail. We classify this problem into desired and undesired word deletion based on spurious and meaningful words. Consequently, we propose four effective models to handle undesired word deletion. To evaluate word deletion problems, we develop an automatic evaluation metric that highly correlates with human judgement. Translation systems are simultaneously tuned for the proposed evaluation metric and BLEU using minimum error rate training (MERT). The experimental results demonstrate that our methods achieve significant improvements in word deletion problems on Chinese-to-English translation tasks.

AB In spite of the recent advances in Machine Translation (MT) for spoken languages, translation between spoken and Sign Languages (SLs) or between Sign Languages remains a difficult problem. Here, we study how Neural Machine Translation (NMT) might overcome the communication barriers for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) community. Namely, we approach the Text2Gloss translation task in which spoken text segments are translated to lexical sign representations. In this context, we leverage transformer-based models via (1) injecting linguistic features that can guide the learning process towards better translations; and (2) applying a Transfer Learning strategy to reuse the knowledge of a pre-trained model. To this aim, different aggregation strategies are compared and evaluated under Transfer Learning and random weight initialization conditions. The results of this research reveal that linguistic features can successfully contribute to achieve more accurate models; meanwhile, the Transfer Learning procedure applied conducted to substantial performance increases.

AB This paper describes progress in a development of the human-human dialogue corpus for machine translation of spoken language. We have chosen a semantically annotated corpus of phone calls to a train timetable information center. The phone calls consist of inquiries regarding their train traveler plans. Corpus dialogue act tags incorporate abstract semantic meaning. We have enriched a part of the corpus with Sign Speech translation and we have proposed methods how to do automatic machine translation from Czech to Sign Speech using semantic annotation contained in the corpus.

TI A machine translation mechanism of Brazilian Portuguese to Libras with
   syntactic-semantic adequacy
SO NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING
AB Deaf people communicate naturally using visual-spatial languages, called sign languages (SL). Although SLs are recognized as a language in many countries, the problems faced by Deaf people for accessing information remain. As a result, they have difficulties exercising their citizenship and access information in SLs, which usually leads to linguistic and knowledge acquisition delays. Some scientific works have been developed to address these problems related to the machine translation of spoken languages to sign languages. However, the existing machine translation platforms have some limitations, especially in syntactic and lexical nature. Thus, this work aims to develop a mechanism for machine translation to Libras, the Brazilian Sign Language, with syntactic-semantic adequacy. It consists of an automatic translation component for Libras based on syntactic-semantic translation rules and a formal syntactic-semantic rule description language. As proof of concept of the proposed approach, we created a specific grammar for Libras translation exploring these aspects and integrating these elements into VLibras Suite, a service for machine translation of digital content in Brazilian Portuguese (BP) to Libras. We performed several tests using this modified version of VLibras to measure the level of comprehension of the output generated by the new translator mechanism. In the computational experiments, as well as in the actual tests with Deaf and hearing users, the proposed approach was able to improve the results of the current VLibras version.
