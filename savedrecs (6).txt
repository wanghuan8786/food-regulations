TI Ten ignored questions for stress psychology research
SO PSYCH JOURNAL
AB Stress psychology is an interesting and important interdisciplinary research field. In this perspective article, we briefly discuss 10 challenges related to the conceptual definition, research methodology, and translation in the field of stress that do not receive sufficient attention or are ignored entirely. Future research should attempt to integrate a comprehensive stress conceptual framework into a multidimensional comprehensive stress model, incorporating subjective and objective indicators as comprehensive measures. The popularity of machine learning, cognitive neuroscience, and gene epigenetics is a promising approach that brings innovation to the field of stress psychology. The development of wearable devices that precisely record physiological signals to assess stress responses in naturalistic situations, standardize real-life stressors, and measure baselines presents challenges to address in the future. Conducting large individualized and digital intervention studies could be crucial steps in enhancing the translation of research.

AB Lexical disambiguation is a major challenge for machine translation systems, especially if some senses of a word are trained less often than others. Identifying patterns of overgeneralization requires evaluation methods that are both reliable and scalable. We propose contrastive conditioning as a reference-free blackbox method for detecting disambiguation errors. Specifically, we score the quality of a translation by conditioning on variants of the source that provide contrastive disambiguation cues. After validating our method, we apply it in a case study to perform a targeted evaluation of sequence-level knowledge distillation. By probing word sense disambiguation and translation of gendered occupation names, we show that distillation-trained models tend to overgeneralize more than other models with a comparable BLEU score. Contrastive conditioning thus highlights a side effect of distillation that is not fully captured by standard evaluation metrics. Code and data to reproduce our findings are publicly available.(1)

AB Language model pre-training has achieved success in many natural language processing tasks. Existing methods for cross-lingual pre-training adopt Translation Language Model to predict masked words with the concatenation of the source sentence and its target equivalent. In this work, we introduce a novel cross-lingual pre-training method, called Alternating Language Modeling (ALM). It code-switches sentences of different languages rather than simple concatenation, hoping to capture the rich cross-lingual context of words and phrases. More specifically, we randomly substitute source phrases with target translations to create code-switched sentences. Then, we use these code-switched data to train ALM model to learn to predict words of different languages. We evaluate our pre-training ALM on the downstream tasks of machine translation and cross-lingual classification. Experiments show that ALM can outperform the previous pre-training methods on three benchmarks.(1)

AB Automatic Post-Editing (APE) aims to correct errors in the output of a given machine translation (MT) system. Although data-driven approaches have become prevalent also in the APE task as in many other NLP tasks, there has been a lack of qualified training data due to the high cost of manual construction. eSCAPE, a synthetic APE corpus, has been widely used to alleviate the data scarcity, but it might not address genuine APE corpora's characteristic that the post-edited sentence should be a minimally edited revision of the given MT output. Therefore, we propose two new methods of synthesizing additional MT outputs by adapting back-translation to the APE task, obtaining robust enlargements of the existing synthetic APE training dataset(1). Experimental results on the WMT English-German APE benchmarks demonstrate that our enlarged datasets are effective in improving APE performance.

AB In the field of Natural Language Processing, Universal Networking Language (UNL) has been used by various researchers as an interlingual approach for automated machine translation. The UNL system consists of two main components, namely, EnConverter used for converting the text from a source language to UNL and DeConverter used for converting from UNL to a target language. Currently, many projects are researching to apply UNL in different languages except Vietnamese. In this paper, we introduce the tools that are UNL's applications and how to reuse it's for the process of encoding a Vietnamese sentence into UNL expression and decoding an UNL expression into Vietnamese. The testing tools, we is done with about 1,000 Vietnamese sentence (with the help of about 4573 dictionary entries and 3161 rules) to compare the proportion of sentences was changed between the direct method and translation through intermediate language UNL.

Our prototype centers on the task of translating flight domain sentences from English to Chinese. The system presents English sentences as stimuli to elicit Chinese utterances from a user. It tracks a user's performance and rewards them with advancements in difficulty level. A user study was conducted involving 12 learners of Mandarin Chinese. Each participant played the game and answered survey questions. The system achieved 9.7% word error rate on 2834 non-native utterances collected in the user study. All Subjects thought the system was helpful at improving their Chinese, and most of them would play it again and recommend it to their Chinese-learning friends.

TI FROM REDUCTION MACHINES TO NARROWING MACHINES
SO LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Narrowing, the evaluation mechanism of functional logic languages, can be seen as a generalization of reduction, the evaluation mechanism of purely functional languages. The unidirectional pattern matching, which is used for parameter passing in functional languages, is simply replaced by the bidirectional unification known from logic programming languages. We show in this paper, how to extend a reduction machine, that has been designed for the evaluation of purely functional programs to a machine that performs narrowing. The necessary extensions concern the realization of unification and backtracking. The latter has to be incorporated to handle nondeterministic computations. It turns out that the resulting narrowing machine can also be seen as an extension of Warren's Prolog engine [Warren 83]. This extension enables a space efficient handling of nested expressions and embodies an optimized treatment of deterministic computations. As in Warren's machine the central component of the machine is a stack that contains environments, i.e. activation records of function calls, and choice points to keep track of possible alternative computations. It is ensured that choice points always contain the minimal amount of information that is necessary to restore a previous state on backtracking. A complete specification of the machine and of the translation of a sample language into abstract machine code is given. To test the feasibility of the new implementation technique a preliminary implementation has been developed in Miranda.

TI Translation-Invariant Kernels for Multivariable Approximation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
AB Suitability of shallow (one-hidden-layer) networks with translation-invariant kernel units for function approximation and classification tasks is investigated. It is shown that a critical property influencing the capabilities of kernel networks is how the Fourier transforms of kernels converge to zero. The Fourier transforms of kernels suitable for multivariable approximation can have negative values but must be almost everywhere nonzero. In contrast, the Fourier transforms of kernels suitable for maximal margin classification must be everywhere nonnegative but can have large sets where they are equal to zero (e.g., they can be compactly supported). The behavior of the Fourier transforms of multivariable kernels is analyzed using the Hankel transform. The general results are illustrated by examples of both univariable and multivariable kernels (such as Gaussian, Laplace, rectangle, sinc, and cut power kernels).

AB Adapter modules were recently introduced as an efficient alternative to fine-tuning in NLP. Adapter tuning consists in freezing pre-trained parameters of a model and injecting lightweight modules between layers, resulting in the addition of only a small number of task-specific trainable parameters. While adapter tuning was investigated for multilingual neural machine translation, this paper proposes a comprehensive analysis of adapters for multilingual speech translation (ST). Starting from different pre-trained models (a multilingual ST trained on parallel data or a multilingual BART (mBART) trained on non-parallel multilingual data), we show that adapters can be used to: (a) efficiently specialize ST to specific language pairs with a low extra cost in terms of parameters, and (b) transfer from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) task and an mBART pretrained model to a multilingual ST task. Experiments show that adapter tuning offer competitive results to full fine-tuning, while being much more parameter-efficient.

SO NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING
AB This paper focuses on an important step in the creation of a system of meaning representation and the development of semantically annotated parallel corpora, for use in applications such as machine translation, question answering, text summarization, and information retrieval. The work described below constitutes the first effort of any kind to annotate multiple translations of foreign-language texts with interlingual content. Three levels of representation are introduced: deep syntactic dependencies (IL0), intermediate semantic representations (IL1), and a normalized representation that unifies conversives, nonliteral language, and paraphrase (IL2). The resulting annotated, multilingually induced, parallel corpora will be useful as an empirical basis for a wide range of research, including the development and evaluation of interlingual NLP systems and paraphrase-extraction systems as well as a host of other research and development efforts in theoretical and applied linguistics, foreign language pedagogy, translation studies, and other related disciplines.

Proposed here is a conceptual design where the spherical joint which connects each leg to the end-effector is realized as a combination of revolute pairs; a locking system allows one to alternatively fix one of the revolute joints, giving the machine different 3-CPU kinematic configurations which correspond to different types of mobility. The first part of the paper demonstrates that the robot is able to perform different types of motion, specifically of pure translation and pure rotation; in the last part a sample design of the reconfigurable robot is proposed.

Strong characteristics of DWFT such as translation invariant signal representation and directional selectivity add additional support to fusion process. K-PCA exploits the low frequency features mainly attributed from infra-red image, while SVM, on the other hand, exploits detail regions.

AB Generating adversarial examples for Neural Machine Translation (NMT) with single Round-Trip Translation (RTT) has achieved promising results by releasing the meaning-preserving restriction. However, a potential pitfall for this approach is that we cannot decide whether the generated examples are adversarial to the target NMT model or the auxiliary backward one, as the reconstruction error through the RTT can be related to either. To remedy this problem, we propose a new criterion for NMT adversarial examples based on the Doubly Round-Trip Translation (DRTT). Specifically, apart from the source-target-source RTT, we also consider the target-source-target one, which is utilized to pick out the authentic adversarial examples for the target NMT model. Additionally, to enhance the robustness of the NMT model, we introduce the masked language models to construct bilingual adversarial pairs based on DRTT, which are used to train the NMT model directly. Extensive experiments on both the clean and noisy test sets (including the artificial and natural noise) show that our approach substantially improves the robustness of NMT models.

AB We present a recurrent encoder-decoder deep neural network architecture that directly translates speech in one language into text in another. The model does not explicitly transcribe the speech into text in the source language. nor does it require supervision from the ground truth source language transcription during training. We apply a slightly modified sequence-to-sequence with attention architecture that has previously been used for speech recognition and show that it can be repurposed for this more complex task, illustrating the power of attention-based models.
   A single model trained end-to-end obtains state-of-the-art performance on the Fisher Callhome Spanish-English speech translation task, outperforming a cascade of independently trained sequence-to-sequence speech recognition and machine translation models by 1.8 BLEU points on the Fisher test set. In addition, we find that making use of the training data in both languages by multi-task training sequence-to-sequence speech translation and recognition models with a shared encoder network can improve performance by a further 1.4 BLEU points.

AB Formal methods provide very powerful tools and techniques for the design and analysis of complex systems. Their practical application remains however limited, due to the widely accepted belief that formal methods require extensive expertise and a steep learning curve. Writing correct formal specifications in form of logical formulas is still considered to be a difficult and error prone task.
   In this paper we propose DeepSTL, a tool and technique for the translation of informal requirements, given as free English sentences, into Signal Temporal Logic (STL), a formal specification language for cyber-physical systems, used both by academia and advanced research labs in industry. A major challenge to devise such a translator is the lack of publicly available informal requirements and formal specifications. We propose a two-step workflow to address this challenge. We first design a grammar-based generation technique of synthetic data, where each output is a random STL formula and its associated set of possible English translations. In the second step, we use a state-of- the-art transformer-based neural translation technique, to train an accurate attentional translator of English to STL. The experimental results show high translation quality for patterns of English requirements that have been well trained, making this workflow promising to be extended for processing more complex translation tasks.

Previous work shows that the standard neural machine translation (NMT) model, trained on mixed-domain data, generally captures the general knowledge, but misses the domain-specific knowledge. In response to this problem, we augment NMT model with additional domain transformation networks to transform the general representations to domain-specific representations, which are subsequently fed to the NMT decoder. To guarantee the knowledge transformation, we also propose two complementary supervision signals by leveraging the power of knowledge distillation and adversarial learning. Experimental results on several language pairs, covering both balanced and unbalanced multi-domain translation, demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of the proposed approach. Encouragingly, the proposed unified model achieves comparable results with the fine-tuning approach that requires multiple models to preserve the particular knowledge. Further analyses reveal that the domain transformation networks successfully capture the domain-specific knowledge as expected.(1)

TI Translocation as continuous movement through the ribosome
SO RNA BIOLOGY
AB In each round of translation elongation, tRNAs and mRNA move within the ribosome by one codon at a time. tRNA-mRNA translocation is promoted by elongation factor G (EF-G) at the cost of GTP hydrolysis. The key questions for understanding translocation are how and when the tRNAs move and how EF-G coordinates motions of the ribosomal subunits with tRNA movement. Here we present 2 recent papers which describe the choreography of movements over the whole trajectory of translocation. We present the view that EF-G accelerates translocation by promoting the steps that lead to GTPase-dependent ribosome unlocking. EF-G facilitates the formation of the rotated state of the ribosome and uncouples the backward motions of the ribosomal subunits, forming an open conformation in which the tRNAs can rapidly move. Ribosome dynamics are important not only in translocation, but also in recoding events, such as frameshifting and bypassing, and mediate sensitivity to antibiotics.

AB As a new type of learning machine based on statistical learning theory, SVM has been extensively applied in some topics of machine learning. For many applications in the pattern recognition, the classifier is desirous to have. a higher sensitivity. Considering that the current methods for improving the sensitivity of SVM possess some deficiencies, we present a new method based on data optimization in this paper Its scheme is to control the sensitivity of SVM by optimizing the training data with other statistical model. Test results with the identification of translation initiation site of Eukaryotic gene show that data optimization based method can improve the sensitivity and overall prediction accuracy of SVM effectively, and composed with other method will get better effect.

SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF CELL AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, VOL 319
SE International Review of Cell and Molecular Biology
AB Accurate translation of the genetic code into functional polypeptides is key to cellular growth and proliferation. This essential process is carried out by the ribosome, a ribonucleoprotein complex of remarkable size and intricacy. Although the structure of the mature ribosome has provided insight into the mechanism of translation, our knowledge regarding the assembly, quality control, and intracellular targeting of this molecular machine is still emerging. Assembly of the eukaryotic ribosome begins in the nucleolus and requires more than 350 conserved assembly factors, which transiently associate with the preribosome at specific maturation stages. After accomplishing their tasks, early-acting assembly factors are released, preparing preribosomes for nuclear export. Export competent preribosomal subunits are transported through nuclear pore complexes into the cytoplasm, where they undergo final maturation steps, which are closely connected to quality control, before engaging in translation. In this chapter, we focus on the final events that commit correctly assembled ribosomal subunits for translation.

SE International Review of Neurobiology
AB Research in BMIs has grown rapidly in the last few years. However, little attention has been paid to the overall system behavior, most published work being focused on the signal classification (i.e., translation) stage. More recently an increasing amount of work has been centred around the feature selection stage that precedes translation. The emphasis in feature selection and translation has stemmed from the large number of researchers with a machine learning or pattern recognition background who have recently joined the field. While there is an important contribution to BMIs, two crucial elements have not been sufficiently explored: the selection of suitable mental tasks and feedback protocols. This review presents an overview of BMIs and its main elements, with a focus on why each stage is important for the overall performance of such systems.

AB In an mRNA sequence, the prediction of the exact codon where the process of translation starts (Translation Initiation Site - TIS) is a particularly important problem. So far it has been tackled by several researchers that apply various statistical and machine learning techniques, achieving high accuracy levels, often over 90%. In this paper we propose a mahine learning approach that can further improve the prediction accuracy. First, we provide a concise review of the literature in this field. Then we propose a novel feature set. We perform extensive experiments on a publicly available, real world dataset for various vertebrate organisms using a variety of novel features and classification setups. We evaluate our results and compare them with a reference study and show that our approach that involves new features and a combination of the Ribosome Scanning Model with a meta-classifier shows higher accuracy in most cases.

AB Multimodal sentiment analysis is an important research area that predicts speaker's sentiment tendency through features extracted from textual, visual and acoustic modalities. The central challenge is the fusion method of the multimodal information. A variety of fusion methods have been proposed, but few of them adopt end-to-end translation models to mine the subtle correlation between modalities. Enlightened by recent success of Transformer in the area of machine translation, we propose a new fusion method, TransModality, to address the task of multimodal sentiment analysis. We assume that translation between modalities contributes to a better joint representation of speaker's utterance. With Transformer, the learned features embody the information both from the source modality and the target modality. We validate our model on multiple multimodal datasets: CMU-MOSI, MELD, IEMOCAP. The experiments show that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

AB This paper proposes a novel method for Chinese-English transliteration based on multiple models by using weighted finite-state transducers (WFST). WFST provide a unified framework for integrating the various components of a speech-to-speech translation system, such as speech recognition and machine translation, motivated by their flexibility in integrating multiple sources of information and other interesting properties. We built a grapheme-based model, a phoneme-based model, an extended phoneme-based model and so on. Combining those models with unified framework of WFST, we can build a combining transliteration model for Chinese-English. The advantage of this method lies in that we can better account for such behavior by combining those information sources from different model to maximize the use of the data available. Our experiments show that the resulting system outperforms single-model systems with the model directly trained with Chinese-English name pairs for Chinese-English translation.

TI Modeling the intention to use machine translation for student

SO COMPUTERS & EDUCATION
AB Increasing use of MT in translation industry is leading to awareness of its utilization in translation education field. However, the academic literature fails to acknowledge what factors could contribute to students' intention to use MT, and consequent effects of using MT. The purpose of this study is to develop a comprehensive model in the context of MT adoption based upon Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The proposed model was empirically validated by using survey data from 109 student translators. The findings indicate that Perceived Usefulness has a stronger effect on Behavioral Intention to use MT and is significantly influenced by Experience. Furthermore, Experience is in turn influenced by Motivation which is affected by Perceived Ease of Use. The enhanced quasi-circular model not only reveals significant factors for MT adoption, but suggests positive effects of using MT. The findings provide significant theoretical and practical implications for translation researchers, teachers, and MT system developers.

AB The University of Queensland Binary Translator (UQBT) is a static binary translation framework that allows for the translation of binary, executable programs, from one architecture to another one. Using different specification files, the UQBT can be easily tailored for either a new source or target architecture. UQBT employs sophisticated analyses in order to abstract the binary code front the features of the source architecture.
   In static binary translation, it is not always possible to decode and translate all paths of a program statically, as instructions like computed jumps and indexed calls rely on runtime values. An interpreter is commonly used at runtime to translate such pieces of code, at the expense of runtime.
   In this paper we present a technique to statically recover the code of virtual method dispatchers, which enhances the abstraction front the binary code. We also show how the statically recovered information is then used by a dynamic environment to analyse virtual tables in order to increase the code coverage for the binary translator The technique has been tested on SPARC(R) and Pentium machines using binaries of different C++ compilers, and preliminary results are presented.

AB The lack of publicly available evaluation data for low-resource languages limits progress in Spoken Language Understanding (SLU). As key tasks like intent classification and slot filling require abundant training data, it is desirable to reuse existing data in high-resource languages to develop models for low-resource scenarios. We introduce xSID, a new benchmark for cross-lingual (x) Slot and Intent Detection in 13 languages from 6 language families, including a very low-resource dialect. To tackle the challenge, we propose a joint learning approach, with English SW training data and non-English auxiliary tasks from raw text, syntax and translation for transfer. We study two setups which differ by type and language coverage of the pre-trained embeddings. Our results show that jointly learning the main tasks with masked language modeling is effective for slots, while machine translation transfer works best for intent classification.(1)

AB The complete sharing of parameters for multilingual translation (1-1) has been the mainstream approach in current research. However, degraded performance due to the capacity bottleneck and low maintainability hinders its extensive adoption in industries. In this study, we revisit the multilingual neural machine translation model that only share modules among the same languages (M2) as a practical alternative to 1-1 to satisfy industrial requirements. Through comprehensive experiments, we identify the benefits of multi-way training and demonstrate that the M2 can enjoy these benefits without suffering from the capacity bottleneck. Furthermore, the interlingual space of the M2 allows convenient modification of the model. By leveraging trained modules, we find that incrementally added modules exhibit better performance than singly trained models. The zero-shot performance of the added modules is even comparable to supervised models. Our findings suggest that the M2 can be a competent candidate for multilingual translation in industries.

Specifically, we embed a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) into an encoder-decoder framework and generate character-level sequence representation as input. The dimension of input feature space can be significantly reduced as well as avoiding the need to handle unknown or rare words in sequences. In the language model, we improve the basic structure of a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) by adding an output gate, which is used for filtering out unimportant information involved in the attention scheme of the alignment model. Our proposed method was examined in a large-scale dataset on a task of English-to-Chinese translation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves a translation performance comparable, or close, to conventional word-based and phrase-based systems.

TI Regulated release of L13a from the 60S ribosomal subunit as a mechanism
   of transcript-specific translational control
SO CELL
AB Transcript-specific translational control is generally directed by binding of trans-acting proteins to structural elements in the untranslated region (UTR) of the target mRNA. Here, we elucidate a translational silencing mechanism involving regulated release of an integral ribosomal protein and subsequent binding to its target mRNA. Human ribosomal protein L13a was identified as a candidate interferon-Gamma-Activated Inhibitor of Translation (GAIT) of ceruloplasmin (Cp) mRNA by a genetic screen for Cp 3' -UTR binding proteins. In vitro activity of L13a was shown by inhibition of target mRNA translation by recombinant protein. In response to interferon-gamma in vivo, the entire cellular pool of L13a was phosphorylated and released from the 60S ribosomal subunit. Released L13a specifically bound the 3'-UTR GAIT element of Cp mRNA and silenced translation. We propose a model in which the ribosome functions not only as a protein synthesis machine, but also as a depot for regulatory proteins that modulate translation.

AB The present paper aims to analyse some difficult problems in man-machine dialogues and to draft solutions based on the idea of Dialogue Processing Memories. The idea behind the well known technique of translation memories is to economise effort by re-use of previously translated fragments. This could be adapted to other text processing domains, in particular to the field of man-machine dialogue. Simulation of correct human behaviour could be based on memorising the dialogue fragment or, more adequately, the results of its processing. The mechanism of extraction from the memory should be triggered by the same element which had earlier triggered the memorisation mechanism. Each case of making such use of Dialogue Processing Memory may be stored for possible future use with a memory refreshment/oblivion mechanism.

The model is trained to capture the domain specific features and used for detecting sentences, which are relevant to a specific domain, from a large general-domain corpus. The selected data are used for adapting the built language model and translation model to target domain. Experiments were conducted on an in-domain (IWSLT2014 Chinese-English TED Talk) and a general-domain corpus (UM-Corpus). We evaluated the proposed data selection model in both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations to investigate the selection successful rate (F-score) of pseudo data, as well as the translation quality (BLEU score) of adapting SMT systems. Empirical results reveal the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art selection approach.

TI LINERBOARD - THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLAR ANGLE PROFILE AND TWIST WARP
SO TAPPI JOURNAL
AB Hypothetical examples of fiber orientation profiles in linerboard rolls are used to illustrate how these profiles relate to the problem of twist warp in box plants. The key is the difference in fiber orientation between the singleface liner and the doubleface liner. Fiber orientation is measured by ultrasonic techniques. The angle the orientation makes with the machine direction fo the paper is called the polar angle. Translation is defined as the average polar angle across the linerboard profile. Delta translation (Delta T-r) is the difference in translation between the singleface liner and doubleface liner in a combined board structure. If Delta T-r is large, twist warp may occur. If Delta T-r is low and twist warp occurs, then is probably is not related to the paper but rather to a boxplant operating condition.

AB The gait pattern, as well as the walking process itself, can be an indicator of the overall health of patients. For this reason, it is very important to accurately, clearly and quickly determine the affiliation of the gait pattern (healthy or pathological) and take appropriate measures if necessary. As anterior cruciate ligament injuries are common and may be undetectable, this study presents a classification of gait using a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The test data were taken from a Gait LAB laboratory; anterior posterior translation and internal external rotation were used as significant parameters. The classifier performance was evaluated using a confusion matrix. These results showed that the SVM algorithm can be successfully used in tasks of this type of classification.

AB This paper presents a novel parallel kinematic structure with one translation and two rotations. The shape and size of its workspace as well as singularity of the structure have been calculated and analyzed, which shows that there are un-robust workspace and singular positions which has been verified by its experiment prototype. Thus, two structural optimized parallel structures were designed by using fixed strut length and variable strut length approaches, the kinematics and workspace and prototype experiment for one of the optimized structures are investigated, which shows a robust workspace and non existing of the singularity to greater extent. The optimized structures can be used in machine tools or coordinate measure machines.

AB Natural Language Inference, and specifically Contradiction Detection, is still an unexplored topic with respect to German text. In this paper, we apply Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) methods to learn contradiction-specific sentence embeddings. Our data set for evaluation is a machine-translated version of the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus. The results are compared to a baseline using unsupervised vectorization techniques, namely tf-idf and Flair, as well as state-of-the art transformer-based (MBERT) methods. We find that the end-to-end models outperform the models trained on unsupervised embeddings, which makes them the better choice in an empirical use case. The RNN methods also perform superior to MBERT on the translated data set.

TI Cybertrance Devices: Countercultures of the Cybernetic Man-Machine
SO SUB-STANCE
AB This article examines a collection of "cybertrance" devices, originating in the 1960s and 1970s. These devices are based on the reappropriation of instruments from the academic world in order to place users in modified states of consciousness. They draw on the heritage of American cybernetics, and its mechanical philosophy, in order to explore what is machine-like in man. Their goal is to create unprecedented forms of experience by coupling body and machine, disturbing one by the other. The analysis focuses on the trajectories of objects, the circulation between theoretical elements from cybernetics and their technological reinterpretation in countercultural circles. Four ranges of devices are examined: the immersive multimedia installations of psychedelic culture, the flicker and its physiological effects, biofeedback devices, and the digital translations, in the world of computing, of these first analogical devices.

SO SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB The implementation of a hierarchical, process-oriented programming language for simulation (HSL) is described.  It features a hybrid approach, involving the front end of a compiler and the back end of an interpreter.  An HSL program is dichotomous in structure.  Source statements from each part are translated into three-address code for an abstract machine, and the resulting code is then interpreted.  The algorithms and the supportive data structures that effect the translation and interpretation of HSL are detailed.  The host language for HSL is C++.  HSL is machine independent and can be ported to any machine on which the host language is available.  Its initial implementation was carried out on an NCR Tower.  More recently, it was transferred to an NCR PC916.

TI Blinded Clinical Evaluation for Dementia of Alzheimer's Type
   Classification Using FDG-PET: A Comparison Between Feature-Engineered
   and Non-Feature-Engineered Machine Learning Methods
SO JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
AB Background: Advanced machine learning methods can aid in the identification of dementia risk using neuroimaging-derived features including FDG-PET. However, to enable the translation of these methods and test their usefulness in clinical practice, it is crucial to conduct independent validation on real clinical samples, which has yet to be properly delineated in the current literature.
   Objective: In this paper, we present our efforts to enable such clinical translational through the evaluation and comparison of two machine-learning methods for discrimination between dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT) and Non-DAT controls.
   Methods: FDG-PET-based dementia scores were generated on an independent clinical sample whose clinical diagnosis was blinded to the algorithm designers. A feature-engineered approach (multi-kernel probability classifier) and a non-feature-engineered approach (3D convolutional neural network) were analyzed. Both classifiers were pre-trained on cognitively normal subjects as well as subjects with DAT. These two methods provided a probabilistic dementia score for this previously unseen clinical data. Performance of the algorithms were compared against ground-truth dementia rating assessed by experienced nuclear physicians.
   Results: Blinded clinical evaluation on both classifiers showed good separation between the cognitively normal subjects and the patients diagnosed with DAT. The non-feature-engineered dementia score showed higher sensitivity among subjects whose diagnosis was in agreement between the machine-learning models, while the feature-engineered approach showed higher specificity in non-consensus cases.
   Conclusion: In this study, we demonstrated blinded evaluation using data from an independent clinical sample for assessing the performance in DAT classification models in a clinical setting. Our results showed good generalizability for two machine-learning approaches, marking an important step for the translation of pre-trained machine-learning models into clinical practice.

TI A new compensation method for geometry errors of five-axis machine tools
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS & MANUFACTURE
AB The present study aims to establish a new compensation method for geometry errors of five-axis machine tools. In the kinematic coordinate translation of five-axis machine tools, the tool orientation is determined by the motion position of machine rotation axes, whereas the tool tip position is determined by both machine linear axes and rotation axes together. Furthermore, as a nonlinear relationship exists between the workpiece coordinates and the machine axes coordinates, errors in the workpiece coordinate system are not directly related to those of the machine axes coordinate system. Consequently, the present study develops a new compensation method, the decouple method, for geometry errors of five-axis machine tools. The method proposed is based on a model that considers the tool orientation error only related to motion of machine rotation axes, and it further calculates the error compensations for rotation axes and linear axes separately, in contrast to the conventional method of calculating them simultaneously, i.e. determines the compensation of machine rotation axes first, and then calculates the compensation associated with the machine linear axes. Finally, the compensation mechanism is applied in the postprocessor of a CAM system and the effectiveness of error compensation is evaluated in real machine cutting using compensated NC code. In comparison with previous methods, the present compensation method has attributes of being simple, straightforward and without any singularity point in the model. The results indicate that the accuracy of positioning was improved by a factor of 8-10. Hence, the new compensation mechanism proposed in this study can effectively compensate geometry errors of five-axis machine tools. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Enhanced efficiency and pulse-adjacency effects in high-repetition-rate
   laser machining
SO APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE & PROCESSING
AB We observed enhanced efficiency in the machining of copper using a high-repetition-rate (10 kHz) Q-switched Nd:YLF laser. A significant increase of machining efficiency (material removed per unit time) was observed when the speed of lateral translation of the thin copper sheet across the beam focus was decreased. We attribute this increased efficiency to effects caused by pulse adjacency (i.e. partial overlapping) of several pulses at a given point on the target surface. Several mechanisms which might be responsible for the effect are discussed. Similar results were observed in experiments on laser trepanning. The observed increases in ablation rates might lead to improvements in some industrial processes, e.g. laser drilling, cutting and marking.

AB In the last years, we have witnessed the increasing usage of machine learning technologies. In parallel, we have observed the raise of quantum computing, a paradigm for computing making use of quantum theory. Quantum computing can empower machine learning with theoretical properties allowing to overcome the limitations of classical computing. The translation of classical algorithms into their quantum counter-part is not trivial and hides many difficulties. We illustrate and implement alternatives for the quantum nearest neighbor classifier focusing on the challenges related to data preparation and their effect on the performance. We show that, with certain data preparation strategies, quantum algorithms are comparable with the classic version, yet allowing for a theoretical reduction of the complexity for distances calculation.

AB The transformer is a state-of-the-art neural translation model that uses attention to iteratively refine lexical representations with information drawn from the surrounding context. Lexical features are fed into the first layer and propagated through a deep network of hidden layers. We argue that the need to represent and propagate lexical features in each layer limits the model's capacity for learning and representing other information relevant to the task. To alleviate this bottleneck, we introduce gated shortcut connections between the embedding layer and each subsequent layer within the encoder and decoder. This enables the model to access relevant lexical content dynamically, without expending limited resources on storing it within intermediate states. We show that the proposed modification yields consistent improvements over a baseline transformer on standard WMT translation tasks in 5 translation directions (0.9 BLEU on average) and reduces the amount of lexical information passed along the hidden layers. We furthermore evaluate different ways to integrate lexical connections into the transformer architecture and present ablation experiments exploring the effect of proposed shortcuts on model behavior.(1)

AB Recent trends in SIMD architecture have tended toward longer vector lengths and more enhanced SIMD features have been introduced in the newer vector instruction sets. However, legacy or proprietary applications compiled with short-SIMD ISA cannot benefit from the long-SIMD architecture, which supports improved parallelism and enhanced vector primitives, and thus only achieve a small fraction of potential peak performance. This paper presents a dynamic binary translation technique that enables short-SIMD binaries to exploit the benefits of the new SIMD architecture by rewriting short-SIMD loop code. We propose a general approach that translates loops consisting of short-SIMD instructions to machine-independent IR, conducts SIMD loop transformation/optimization at this IR level, and finally translates to long-SIMD instructions. Two solutions are presented to enforce SIMD load/store alignment, one for the problem caused by the binary translator's internal translation condition and one general approach using loop peeling optimization. The benchmark results show that an average speedup of 1.45X is achieved for NEON to AVX2 loop transformation.

AB A state machine can be specified as either an equational theory or a rewrite theory in algebraic approaches. The former is used for theorem proving, and the latter for model checking. We have proposed an approach to transform a class of equational theories into rewrite theories in order to use them in the combination of the two verification techniques. This paper shows the correctness of the transformation with respect to its preservation of invariant properties. Invariant-preservation guarantees that a counterexample found by model checking a generated rewrite theory is also a counterexample of the same invariant in the original equational theory, which provides the theoretical support to the utilization of the transformation in combination of theorem proving and model checking.

Amongst other, use cases are sentiment analysis, speech recognition, classification, query answering and machine translation. In this research we investigate widely applied preprocessing methods, to improve the results of different Algorithms trained on a Fake News data set. As feature extraction methods we compared TF-IDF and Count-Vectorization. TF-IDF yielded slightly better results in terms of accuracy. We found that, as opposed to current research, stemming leads to a minor increase of false positive and false negative classifications, hence to a decrease in accuracy. Among the compared models, logistic regression and support vector machine yielded the best results.

Although many types of attacks are relatively simple to defend given commercially available detection software, the attacks are becoming more sophisticated. In more recent times, it is possible that a cyber attack might be initiated by a human or by an automated software attack or bot. One line of defense that has not been sufficiently explored is the advantage that might come to a defender if he or she has the ability to detect whether or not the attacker is human or machine-based. In this paper, we attempt to develop methods to allow a defender to try to determine the type of human or bot attack.

AB The ever increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) methods in biomedical sciences calls for closer inter-disciplinary collaborations that transfer the domain knowledge from life scientists to computer science researchers and vice-versa. We highlight two general areas where the use of AI-based solutions designed for clinical and laboratory settings has proven problematic. These are used to demonstrate common sources of translational challenges that often stem from the differences in data interpretation between the clinical and research view, and the unmatched expectations and requirements on the result quality metrics. We outline how explicit interpretable inference reporting might be used as a guide to overcome such translational challenges. We conclude with several recommendations for safer translation of machine learning solutions into real-world settings.

TI Exploiting Wikipedia and EuroWordNet to solve Cross-Lingual Question
   Answering
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB This paper describes a new advance in solving Cross-Lingual Question Answering (CL-QA) tasks. It is built on three main pillars: (i) the use of several multilingual knowledge resources to reference words between languages (the Inter Lingual Index (ILI) module of EuroWordNet and the multilingual knowledge encoded in Wikipedia); (ii) the consideration of more than only one translation per word in order to search candidate answers: and (iii) the analysis of the question in the original language without any translation process. This novel approach overcomes the errors caused by the common use of Machine Translation (MT) services by CL-QA systems. We also expose some studies and experiments that justify the importance of analyzing whether a Named Entity should be translated or not. Experimental results in bilingual scenarios show that our approach performs better than an MT based CL-QA approach achieving an average improvement of 36.7%. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB We provide several methods for sentence-alignment of texts with different complexity levels. Using the best of them, we sentence-align the Newsela corpora, thus providing large training materials for automatic text simplification (ATS) systems. We show that using this dataset, even the standard phrase-based statistical machine translation models for ATS can outperform the state-of-the-art ATS systems.

AB Automatic post-editing (APE) for machine translation (MT) aims to fix recurrent errors made by the MT decoder by learning from correction examples. In controlled evaluation scenarios, the representativeness of the training set with respect to the test data is a key factor to achieve good performance. Real-life scenarios, however, do not guarantee such favorable learning conditions. Ideally, to be integrated in a real professional translation workflow (e.g. to play a role in computer-assisted translation framework), APE tools should be flexible enough to cope with continuous streams of diverse data coming from different domains/genres. To cope with this problem, we propose an online APE framework that is: i) robust to data diversity (i.e. capable to learn and apply correction rules in the right contexts) and ii) able to evolve over time (by continuously extending and refining its knowledge). In a comparative evaluation, with English-German test data coming in random order from two different domains, we show the effectiveness of our approach, which outperforms a strong batch system and the state of the art in online APE.

AB The multilingualization of terminology is an essential step in the translation pipeline, to ensure the correct transfer of domain-specific concepts. Many institutions and language service providers construct and maintain multilingual terminologies, which constitute important assets. However, the curation of such multilingual resources requires significant human effort; though automatic multilingual term extraction methods have been proposed so far, they are of limited success as term translation cannot be satisfied by simply conveying meaning, but requires the terminologists and domain experts' knowledge to fit the term within the existing terminology. Here we propose a method to encode the structural properties of terms by aligning their embeddings using graph convolutional networks trained from separate languages. The results show that the structural information can augment the standard bilingual lexicon induction methods, and that taking into account the structural nature of terminologies allows our method to produce better results.

AB When mining parallel text from comparable corpora, we confront vast search space since parallel sentence or sub-sentential fragments can be scattered throughout the source and target corpus. To reduce the search space, most previous approaches have tried to use heuristics to mine comparable documents. However, these heuristics are only available in few cases. Instead, we go on a different direction and adopt the cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) framework to find translation candidates directly at sentence level from comparable corpus. What's more, for the sake of better retrieval result, two simple but effective query expansion methods are proposed. Experimental results show that using our query expansion methods can help to improve the recall significantly and obtain candidates of sentence pairs with high quality. Thus, our methods can help to make good preparation for extracting both parallel sentences and fragments subsequently.

AB Generative pre-trained transformers belong to the breakthroughs in Natural Language Processing (NLP), allowing Human-Robot Interactions (e.g. the creation of an open-domain chatbot). However, a substantial amount of research and available data are in English, causing low-resourced languages to be overlooked. This work addresses this problem for European Portuguese with two options: (i) Translation of the sentences before and after using the model fine-tuned on an English-based dataset, (ii) Translation of the English-based dataset to Portuguese and then fine-tune this model on it. We rely on the DialoGPT (dialogue generative pre-trained transformer), a tunable neural conversational answer generation model that learns the basic skills to conduct a dialogue. We use two sources of evaluation: (i) Metrics for text generation based on uncertainty (i.e. perplexity), and similarity between sentences (i.e. BLEU, METEOR and ROUGE) and (ii) Human-based evaluation of the sentences. The translation of sentences before and after of the modified DialoGPT model, using the Daily Dialogue dataset led to the best results.

TI Guiding automatic MT evaluation by means of linguistic features
SO DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP IN THE HUMANITIES
AB Machine translation (MT) has become increasingly important and popular in the past decade, leading to the development of MT evaluation metrics aiming at automatically assessing MT output. Most of these metrics use reference translations to compare systems output, therefore, they should not only detect MT errors but also be able to identify correct equivalent expressions so as not to penalize them when those are not displayed in the reference translations. With the aim of improving MT evaluation metrics a study has been carried out of a wide panorama of linguistic features and their implications. For that purpose a Spanish and an English corpora containing hypothesis and reference translations have been analysed from a linguistic point of view, so that common errors can be detected and positive equivalencies highlighted. This article focuses on this qualitative analysis describing the linguistic phenomena that should be considered when developing an automatic MT evaluation metric. The results of this analysis have been used to develop an automatic MT evaluation metric that takes into account different dimensions of language. A brief review of the metric and its evaluation are also provided.

TI Ancient poetry generation with an unsupervised method
SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
AB It is challenging to use unsupervised machine translation models to generate ancient poems. The current method has solved the problems of Under-translation and Over-translation caused by the huge length difference between the translated sentence pairs. However, the above method lacks guidance in generating intermediate vectors, and the denoising ability of the model is very poor. In this paper, we guide vector space distribution during training to improve the quality of the generated ancient poems and the convergence speed of the model. We also introduce the target language information while adding noise, which effectively avoids the recurrence of the Under-translation problem while improving the model's denoising ability. Experiment results on the VP dataset show that our model obtains state-of-the-art results with faster convergence speed. In addition to the BLEU scores, we also made a comparative analysis of ancient poetry sentences generated by different models. The analysis results show that the optimization method proposed in this paper is indeed helpful for generating high-quality ancient poems.

TI Fast compensation of spatial PDGE of five-axis machine tools based on
   error parameter optimization
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB The machine tool used in the actual production line cannot be processed with high accuracy for a long time due to insufficient rigidity and poor accuracy retention. Thus, the calibration cycle of the machine tool must be shortened to ensure that the machine tool remains in a high accuracy state. To avoid unnecessary effects on the working time of the machine tool, the calibration method needs to improve the efficiency on the premise of ensuring high accuracy. In this study, a fast compensation method of the spatial position-dependent geometric error (PDGE) of five-axis machine tools based on error parameter optimization is proposed. The actual physical meaning of the position-related error and the mathematical calculation results of the influence on the tool position and attitude are studied, the optimized error parameter comprehensive representation model is established. Then, the translation axis four-line space compensation (TFSC) method and the rotational axis double line space compensation (RDSC) method are proposed, and the integrated algorithm module of the CNC system is developed. Experiments on five-axis machine tools show that the optimal parameter model and the fast compensation method proposed in this research significantly improve the compensation accuracy and efficiency.

In this paper, a study of aerostatic bearings for the use in compact high-speed spindles for micro machining applications is introduced. The perturbation and the finite element method are used to determine the static and dynamic characteristics of the air bearings considering the translation and tilt motion of the rotor. These characteristics are then used to build a rotordynamic model of the entire spindle, provinding critical rotational speeds. With the help of the model a spindle was designed which could reach speeds up to 466,000 rpm at a high rotational accuracy. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Emulation of other or newer processor architectures is necessary for a wide variety of use cases, from ensuring compatibility to offering a vehicle for computer architecture research. This problem is usually approached using dynamic binary translation, where machine code is translated, on the fly, to the host architecture during program execution. Existing systems, like QEMU, usually focus on translation performance rather than the overall program execution, and extensions, like HQEMU, are limited by their underlying implementation. Conversely, performance-focused systems are typically used for binary instrumentation. E.g., DynamoRIO reuses original instructions where possible, while Instrew utilizes the LLVM compiler infrastructure, but only supports same-architecture code generation.
   In this short paper, we generalize Instrew to support different guest and host architectures by refactoring the lifter and by implementing target-independent optimizations to re-use host hardware features for emulated code. We demonstrate this flexibility by adding support for RISC-V as guest architecture and AArch64 as host architecture. Our performance results on SPEC CPU2017 show significant improvements compared to QEMU, HQEMU as well as the original Instrew.

AB In this note, we consider the state observer problem for a class of nonlinear systems which are usually encountered in the machine vision study. The formulation of the state observer is motivated by the sliding mode methods and adaptive control techniques. The proposed observer is applied to the identification problems of the motion parameters and space position of a moving object by using the perspective observation of a single point. It is clarified that the rotation parameters can be observed by using the observation of one camera, and the position and translation parameters cannot be observed by using one camera and must appeal to stereo vision. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is effective.

Though a number of statistical models for transliteration have already been proposed in the past few decades, we proposed some neural network based deep learning architectures for the transliteration of named entities. Our transliteration systems adapt two different neural machine translation (NMT) frameworks: recurrent neural network and convolutional sequence to sequence based NMT. It is shown that our method provides quite satisfactory results when it comes to multi lingual machine transliteration. Our submitted runs are an ensemble of different transliteration systems for all the language pairs.

Therefore, an efficient algorithm is designed to be robust and invariant to rotation, translation and scaling. The objective of this work is to find whether the object is coin or not if so denomination of the coin is found. The Fourier approximation of the coin image is used to reduce the variations on surface of coin such as light reflection effect. Then coins can be distinguished by feeding those features into a multi-layered BP neural network.

AB Language pre-training methods such as BERT have led to significant performance gains for a wide range of natural language processing tasks. This paper investigates the improvement in transformer model translation for low resource South African languages when pre-trained models are used in language translation. A South African low resource language multilingual BERT, dubbed SALR-mBERT is pre-trained from scratch using all nine of the low resource South African languages. SALR-mBERT performs better than mBERT and the transformer models for language corpora with approximately less than 600000 sentences. SALR-mBERT obtained the best results for Sesotho, Ndebele, Swati and Venda. SALR-mBERT outperforms multilingual BERT (mBERT) on language corpora with less than 600000 sentences by about 29% and also outperforms the transformer model by 50%. The transformer model translation obtained the best results compared to mBERT and the SALR-mBERT models for language corpora with more than 600000 sentences. The transformer obtained the best results followed by SALR-mBERT for Northern Sotho, Tsonga, Xhosa, Tswana and Zulu to English translations. The transformer model outperforms SALR-mBERT by 15% for Zulu which has the largest corpus size compared to other low resource South African languages. The main finding of this work is that the BERT type module is beneficial for machine translation if the corpus size is small and has less than approximately 600000 sentences, and further improvement can be gained when the BERT model is trained using languages of a similar nature like in the case of SALR-mBERT. However, transformer model translations outperform BERT model translations if the corpus size is greater than 600000 sentences.

TI Ribosome heterogeneity and specialization in development
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-RNA
AB Regulation of protein synthesis is a vital step in controlling gene expression, especially during development. Over the last 10 years, it has become clear that rather than being homogeneous machines responsible for mRNA translation, ribosomes are highly heterogeneous and can play an active part in translational regulation. These "specialized ribosomes" comprise of specific protein and/or rRNA components, which are required for the translation of particular mRNAs. However, while there is extensive evidence for ribosome heterogeneity, support for specialized functions is limited. Recent work in a variety of developmental model organisms has shed some light on the biological relevance of ribosome heterogeneity. Tissue-specific expression of ribosomal components along with phenotypic analysis of ribosomal gene mutations indicate that ribosome heterogeneity and potentially specialization are common in key development processes like embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, oogenesis, body patterning, and neurogenesis. Several examples of ribosome specialization have now been proposed but strong links between ribosome heterogeneity, translation of specific mRNAs by defined mechanisms, and role of these translation events remain elusive. Furthermore, several studies have indicated that heterogeneous ribosome populations are a product of tissue-specific expression rather than specialized function and that ribosomal protein phenotypes are the result of extra-ribosomal function or overall reduced ribosome levels. Many important questions still need to be addressed in order to determine the functional importance of ribosome heterogeneity to development and disease, which is likely to vary across systems. It will be essential to dissect these issues to fully understand diseases caused by disruptions to ribosomal composition, such as ribosomopathies.

AB It has become essential to have precise translations of texts from different parts of the world, but it is often difficult to fill the translation gaps as quickly as might be needed. Undoubtedly, there are multiple dictionaries that can help in this regard, and various online translators exist to help cross this lingual bridge in many cases, but even these resources can fall short of serving their true purpose. The translators can provide a very accurate meaning of given words in a phrase, but they often miss the true essence of the language. The research presented here describes a method that can help close this lingual gap by extending certain aspects of the alignment task for WMT16. It is possible to achieve this goal by utilizing different classifiers and algorithms and by use of advanced computation. We carried out various experiments that allowed us to extract parallel data at the sentence level. This data proved capable of improving overall machine translation quality.

AB With the rise and popular of artificial intelligence, the technology of conversation between human and machine get more and more attention. Using neural network model on the Encoder-Decoder framework has been wildly used in translation and human-machine conversation. This paper we propose a new hybrid neural network model (HNN) which consists of some essential neural network models (that is RNN, LSTM, and CNN). At the same time, according to the number of words that each sentence contains, we will get three sub-datasets from the original dataset. Then training and testing our models on different sub-datasets. Experimental results show that the best accuracy belongs to different hybrid models on different sub-datasets, which indicate the proposed approach can make use of each models advantages aim at different sub-dataset.

AB Innovative development of mining regions is undoubtedly determined by efficient specialists in mining engineering, ecology and natural resources management. Due to close integration and economic relations of Kemerovo Region, a leading mining region in Russia, with the adjacent states of Central Asia many young people from Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan have chosen Kemerovo Region universities to get higher education necessary to develop mining industry in their native countries. Taking higher education courses there they are to study English via Russian as an intermediate language, both languages being foreign to them. To assist themselves in studying the subject, international students from Central Asia use a "crossover" translation technique by means of machine translation at EFL lessons. The assessment of the technique has been carried out and some advice is given to both international students from Central Asia and teachers of EFL. Practical value of the "crossover" translation technique promotes training efficient specialists for mining industry capable to learn and apply advanced technologies for innovative development of Central Asia mining regions.

AB Shadow value tools use metadata to track properties of application data at the granularity of individual machine instructions. These tools provide effective means of monitoring and analyzing the runtime behavior of applications. However, the high runtime overhead stemming from fine-grained monitoring often limits the use of such tools. Furthermore, 64-bit architectures pose a new challenge to the building of efficient memory shadowing tools. Current tools are not able to efficiently monitor the full 64-bit address space due to limitations in their shadow metadata translation.
   This paper presents an efficient and scalable memory shadowing framework called Umbra. Employing a novel translation scheme, Umbra supports efficient mapping from application data to shadow metadata for both 32-bit and 64-bit applications. Umbra's translation scheme does not rely on any platform features and is not restricted to any specific shadow memory size. We also present several mapping optimizations and general dynamic instrumentation techniques that substantially reduce runtime overhead, and demonstrate their effectiveness on a real-world shadow value tool. We show that shadow memory translation overhead can be reduced to just 133% on average.

AB Lexical similarity based ontology mappings are useful to obtain semantic translations of database schemas across application domains. Incremental improvement of such mappings can be obtained from human inputs of ontology mapping. Manual mappings are labor intensive and need to be assisted by machine-generated mappings in a semi-automated approach. Heuristics based approaches allow multiple strategies to learn human expertise in concept mappings. Such learning improves the level of automation of the mapping process. We analyze heuristics based Bayesian learning of manual mappings to improve effectiveness of machine-generated mappings. Our results show that human based mappings contribute higher improvement in the machine-generated values of lexical similarity in comparison to those of structural similarity. The optimal weightage for structural similarity learning is inversely proportional to the complexity of given ontology graphs.

AB Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) is the process of translation of speech from one language to another. Traditional S2ST systems follow a cascaded approach, where three modules automatics speech recognition (ASR), machine translation (MT), and text-to-speech translation (TTS) are concatenated to obtain the final translated speech utterance. The cascaded nature of the system results in the propagation of errors from one module to another. This, in turn, leads to the degradation in the overall performance of the S2ST task. With the evolution of the deep learning approaches to speech processing, many attempts have been made to perform end-to-end and direct speech-to-speech translation (DS2ST). But most of these approaches rely on language transcripts in one way or the other. In this work, we aim to perform the DS2ST task without using language transcripts. In this direction we have performed three experiments: First, we have investigated the direct learning of mapping function from source to target language with the increase in the number of utterances. Second, we have analyzed how the learning function improves with an increase in the number of Bi-LSTM layers. Third, we have observed how the system behaves with the unknown speakers (not used during training) during inference. From the experiments, it has been observed that with the increase in the number of utterances and layers, the quality of translation improves. And also, with a speaker and text-dependent training of approximately 4.4 hrs of speech, the model can generate the target language utterance even for unknown speakers. Though the generated utterance quality is not that good, but intelligent to some extent to be perceived.

AB We have developed a system to translate and interpret printed documents (such as periodicals) using a commercially available mobile device (e. g., a mobile telephone) with an embedded camera. The system comprises an automatic layout analysis tool along with an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine and a translation engine. The translation engine combines Rule-Based Machine Translation (RBMT) software, a list of context-sensitive words/phrases, and an encyclopedia for a list of words. We implemented the proposed system on a Nokia N900 smartphone for translating newspaper articles from Spanish to English. Our tests show that the accuracy and speed of the system is mostly influenced by the accuracy and speed of the OCR method used. Our application requires 19.43 MB of memory and no more than 28 MB of dynamic memory. We show the ability to complete the process for roughly 410 words in as little as 65 seconds for high accuracy or 17 seconds for high speed, on average. The energy consumption in both cases is minimal.

AB Attention mechanism has been a key component in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) based sequence to sequence learning framework, which has been adopted in many text understanding tasks, such as neural machine translation and abstractive summarization. In these tasks, the attention mechanism models how important each part of the source sentence is to generate a target side word. To compute such importance scores, the attention mechanism summarizes the source side information in the encoder RNN hidden states (i.e., h(t)), and then builds a context vector for a target side word upon a subsequence representation of the source sentence, since h(t) actually summarizes the information of the subsequence containing the first t-th words in the source sentence. We in this paper, show that an additional attention mechanism called word attention, that builds itself upon word level representations, significantly enhances the performance of sequence to sequence learning. Our word attention can enrich the source side contextual representation by directly promoting the clean word level Information in each step. Furthermore, we propose to use contextual gates to dynamically combine the subsequence level and word level contextual information. Experimental results on abstractive summarization and neural machine translation show that word attention significantly improve over strong baselines. In particular, we achieve the state-of-the-art result on WMT' 14 English-French translation task with 12M training data.

   LINGVISTIKA-RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS
AB The paper presents analysis of errors in translation on the CAT platform Smartcat, which accumulates all tools for computer-assisted translation (CAT) including a machine translation (MT) system and translation memory (TM). The research is conducted on the material of the translation on Smartcat platform (a joint project of a tourist guide translation (35,000 words) from Hebrew to Russian, English, and French). The errors on the CAT platform disclose difficulties in mastering text semantic coherence and stylistic features. The influence of English as lingua franca appears in peculiar orthographic and punctuation errors in the target text in Russian. Peculiar errors in translation on the CAT platform reveal the necessity of advanced technological competence in translators. The peculiar errors uncover problems associated with a source text segmentation into sentences. The segmentation can trigger a translator to preserve the sentence boundaries and use a Russian complicated compound sentence that provoke punctuation errors. Difficulties of the anaphora resolution in distant semantically coherent segments are also associated with the source text segmentation and working window formatting. A joint project presupposes different translators to translate different files of the source document. To generate the coherence, contiguity and integrity of the whole document, the files have to be revised by a third-party editor to avoid conflict of interest. The editor-reviser is also responsible for improving the target text pragmatic and genre characteristics while applying top-down strategy to target text analysis. Thus, the translator's errors while applying CAT tools reveal the effect of bottom-up text processing alongside with cross-language interference.

TI Revealing determinants of translation efficiency via whole-gene codon
   randomization and machine learning
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB It has been known for decades that codon usage contributes to translation efficiency and hence to protein production levels. However, its role in protein synthesis is still only partly understood. This lack of understanding hampers the design of synthetic genes for efficient protein production. In this study, we generated a synonymous codon-randomized library of the complete coding sequence of red fluorescent protein. Protein production levels and the full coding sequences were determined for 1459 gene variants in Escherichia coli. Using different machine learning approaches, these data were used to reveal correlations between codon usage and protein production. Interestingly, protein production levels can be relatively accurately predicted (Pearson correlation of 0.762) by a Random Forest model that only relies on the sequence information of the first eight codons. In this region, close to the translation initiation site, mRNA secondary structure rather than Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) is the key determinant of protein production. This study clearly demonstrates the key role of codons at the start of the coding sequence. Furthermore, these results imply that commonly used CAI-based codon optimization of the full coding sequence is not a very effective strategy. One should rather focus on optimizing protein production via reducing mRNA secondary structure formation with the first few codons.

AB Pedestrians and vehicles tend to follow certain paths even in the case of no road or walkable path is prescribed. This fact makes topological representation of maps very important in navigation and localization applications. When infrastructure-based systems (e.g., GPS, Wi-Fi) are available, the problem is referred to as map-matching where the goal is to improve localization accuracy. On the other hand, localization becomes a problem in the lack of initialization for infrastructure-free systems (e.g., dead reckoning via odometry). For example, a pedestrian inertial navigation system (INS) can be used to generate drift-prone trajectories that would perfectly turn into graphs (consisting of nodes and edges) after heuristic corrections such as zero-velocity update (ZUPT), heuristic drift reduction (HDR) and motion direction aid by Earth's magnetic field. Most of the approaches use probabilistic generative methods to solve sub-graph traversal problem. This research adopts a neural network structure that is originally designed for language translation purposes and modifies it to achieve pedestrian localization on topological maps. Different feature combinations (angle vs. edge length) and number of traversed nodes are tested in the experiments. A minimum accuracy of 95% is achieved with all feature configurations while traversing only six nodes on the map.

TI A7'ta: Data on a monolingual Arabic parallel corpus for grammar checking
SO DATA IN BRIEF
AB Grammar error correction can be considered as a "translation" problem, such that an erroneous sentence is "translated" into a correct version of the sentence in the same language. This can be accomplished by employing techniques like Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) or Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Producing models for SMT or NMT for the goal of grammar correction requires monolingual parallel corpora of a certain language. This data article presents a monolingual parallel corpus of Arabic text called A7'ta (011. :0). It contains 470 erroneous sentences and their 470 error-free counterparts. This is an Arabic parallel corpus that can be used as a linguistic resource for Arabic natural language processing (NLP) mainly to train sequence-to sequence models for grammar checking. Sentences were manually collected from a book that has been prepared as a guide for correctly writing and using Arabic grammar and other linguistic features. Although there are a number of available Arabic corpora of errors and corrections [2] such as QALB [10] and Arabic Learner Corpus [11], the data we present in this article is an effort to increase the number of freely available Arabic corpora of errors and corrections by providing a detailed error specification and leveraging the work of language experts.

TI Deep learning for noise-tolerant RDFS reasoning
SO SEMANTIC WEB
AB Since the 2001 envisioning of the Semantic Web (SW) (Scientific American 284(5) (2001) 34-43), the main research focus in SW reasoning has been on the soundness and completeness of reasoners. While these reasoners assume the veracity of input data, the reality is that the Web of data is inherently noisy. Although there has been recent work on noise-tolerant reasoning, it has focused on type inference rather than full RDFS reasoning. Even though RDFS closure generation can be seen as a Knowledge Graph (KG) completion problem, the problem setting is different - making KG embedding techniques that were designed for link prediction not suitable for RDFS reasoning. This paper documents a novel approach that extends noise-tolerance in the SW to full RDFS reasoning. Our embedding technique - that is tailored for RDFS reasoning - consists of layering RDF graphs and encoding them in the form of 3D adjacency matrices where each layer layout forms a graph word. Each input graph and its entailments are then represented as sequences of graph words, and RDFS inference can be formulated as translation of these graph words sequences, achieved through neural machine translation. Our evaluation on LUBM1 synthetic dataset shows 97% validation accuracy and 87.76% on a subset of DBpedia while demonstrating a noise-tolerance unavailable with rule-based reasoners.

AB Automatic post-editing (APE) refers to a research field that aims to automatically correct errors included in the translation sentences derived by the machine translation system. This study has several limitations, considering the data acquisition, because there is no official dataset for most language pairs. Moreover, the amount of data is restricted even for language pairs in which official data has been released, such as WMT. To solve this problem and promote universal APE research regardless of APE data existence, this study proposes a method for automatically generating APE data based on a noising scheme from a parallel corpus. Particularly, we propose a human mimicking errors-based noising scheme that considers a practical correction process at the human level. We propose a precise inspection to attain high performance, and we derived the optimal noising schemes that show substantial effectiveness. Through these, we also demonstrate that depending on the type of noise, the noising scheme-based APE data generation may lead to inferior performance. In addition, we propose a dynamic noise injection strategy that enables the acquisition of a robust error correction capability and demonstrated its effectiveness by comparative analysis. This study enables obtaining a high performance APE model without human-generated data and can promote universal APE research for all language pairs targeting English.

TI Roto-translation equivariant convolutional networks: Application to
   histopathology image analysis
SO MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS
AB Rotation-invariance is a desired property of machine-learning models for medical image analysis and in particular for computational pathology applications. We propose a framework to encode the geometric structure of the special Euclidean motion group SE(2) in convolutional networks to yield translation and rotation equivariance via the introduction of SE(2)-group convolution layers. This structure enables models to learn feature representations with a discretized orientation dimension that guarantees that their outputs are invariant under a discrete set of rotations.
   Conventional approaches for rotation invariance rely mostly on data augmentation, but this does not guarantee the robustness of the output when the input is rotated. At that, trained conventional CNNs may require test-time rotation augmentation to reach their full capability.
   This study is focused on histopathology image analysis applications for which it is desirable that the arbitrary global orientation information of the imaged tissues is not captured by the machine learning models. The proposed framework is evaluated on three different histopathology image analysis tasks (mitosis detection, nuclei segmentation and tumor detection).

TI Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation via Pre-Trained StyleGAN2
   Network
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA
AB Image-to-Image (I2I) translation is an emerging topic in academia, and it also has been applied in real-world industry for tasks like image synthesis, super-resolution, and colorization. Traditional I2I translation methods usually train data in two or more domains together. This requires lots of computation resources. The results are of lower quality, and contain more artifacts. The training process could be unstable when the data in different domains are not balanced, and modal collapse is more likely to happen. In this paper, we propose a new I2I translation method that generates a new model in the target domain via a series of model transformations on a pre-trained StyleGAN2 model in the source domain. After that, we develop an inversion method to achieve the conversion between an image and its latent vector. By feeding the latent vector into the generated model, we can perform I2I translation between the source domain and target domain. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations were conducted to verify that the proposed method can achieve better performance in terms of image quality, diversity and semantic similarity to the input and reference images compared to state-of-the-art works.

TI Class-1 translation termination factors are functional analogs of
   aminoacyl-tRNAs
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Reviewed and discussed are the recent data demonstrating profound functional similarity between class-1 translation termination factors (RF1 and RF2 in prokaryotes, aRFl and eRFl in Archaea and eukaryotes, respectively) and aminoacyl-tRNA as regards their roles in the course of translation on the ribosome. The functional analogy of these two components of the cell protein-synthesizing machinery was suggested long ago; however, only now it has received ample experimental proof. This similarity implies that decoding of the genetic information by the ribosomal machine is performed likewise at all stages of translation, though tRNA plays the main role at initiation and elongation, while the protein is most important for termination. Earlier it was found that nucleic acids (ribozymes) can operate like the protein enzymes, and now we have got evidence for the reverse: a protein (translation termination factor) can act like a nucleic acid (tRNA). Thus one can speak of "exchange" of molecular functions between proteins and nucleic acids in specific cases when this provides a biological benefit. Therefore, the profound chemical difference between proteins and nucleic acids is not an insuperable barrier to their functional interchangeability in certain situations.

AB In the last two decades extensive research has been conducted addressing the design methodology of embedded systems and their verification. The initial behavioural specification of an embedded system goes through significant optimizing transformations, automated and also human-guided, before being mapped to an architecture. Establishing the validity of these transformations is crucial to ensure that the intended behaviour of a system has not been faultily altered during synthesis. State-of- the-art verification methods fail to cope with the complexity of the problem. So, we have devised some efficient translation validation methodologies to handle diverse code transformations; in the initial part of our work, we have worked with the Finite State Machine with Datapath (FSMD) model and its extension to validate various code motion techniques; in the latter part, we have designed an equivalence checking method around the Array Data-Dependence Graph (ADDG) model, which provides a more suitable framework to reason about index spaces of array variables, to verify loop transformations and arithmetic transformations in the presence of recurrences; we have also shown how to relate our path based equivalence checking mechanisms with that of bisimulation based verification techniques by deriving bisimulation relations from the outputs of our equivalence checkers.

TI Comparison and evaluation of back-translation algorithms for static
   single assignment forms
SO COMPUTER LANGUAGES SYSTEMS & STRUCTURES
AB The static single assignment form (SSA form) is a popular intermediate representation in compilers. In the SSA form, the definition of each variable textually appears only once in the program by using a hypothetical function called a phi-function. Because these functions are nonexecutable, it is necessary to delete the phi-functions and return the SSA form to the normal form before code generation. This conversion is called SSA back-translation.
   Two major algorithms exist for SSA back-translation. One by Briggs et al., the other by Sreedhar et al. To date, there has been almost no research that compares these SSA back-translation algorithms.
   In this paper, we clarify the merits and demerits of these algorithms. We also propose an improvement to Briggs' algorithm. We then compare the three methods through experiments using the SPEC benchmarks.
   Our experiments show that in most cases, Sreedhar's method is the more favorable. The efficiency of its object code is better than that from Briggs' method by a few percent in general, up to a maximum of 28%. The experiments have also clarified several characteristic features of these methods. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The emergence of dense, byte-addressable nonvolatile main memories (NVMMs) allows application developers to combine storage and memory into a single layer. With NVMMs, servers can equip terabytes of memory that survive power outages, and all of this persistent capacity can be managed through a specialized NVMM file system. NVMMs appear to mesh perfectly with another popular technology, remote direct memory access (RDMA). RDMA gives a client direct access to memory on a remote machine and mediates this access through a memory region abstraction that handles the necessary translations and permissions.
   NVMM and RDMA seem eminently compatible: by combining them, we should be able to build network-attached, byte-addressable, persistent storage. Unfortunately, however, the systems were not designed to work together. An NVMM-aware file system manages persistent memory as files, whereas RDMA uses a different abstraction - memory regions to organize remotely accessible memory. As a result, in practice, building RDMA-accessible NVMMs requires expensive translation layers resulting from this duplication of effort that spans permissions, naming, and address translation.
   This work introduces two changes to the existing RDMA protocol: file memory region (FileMR) and range-based address translation. These optimizations create an abstraction that combines memory regions and files: a client can directly access a file backed by NVMM file system through RDMA, addressing its contents via file offsets. By eliminating redundant translations, it minimizes the amount of translations done at the NIC, reduces the load on the NIC's translation cache and increases the hit rate by 3.8x - 340x and resulting in application performance improvement by 1.8x - 2.0x

AB Formally verifying functional and security properties of a large-scale production operating system is highly desirable. However, it is challenging as such OSes are often written in multiple source languages that have no formal semantics - a prerequisite for formal reasoning. To avoid expensive formalization of the semantics of multiple high-level source languages, we present a lightweight and rigorous verification toolchain that verifies OS code at the binary level, targeting ARM machines. To reason about ARM instructions, we first translate the ARM Specification Language that describes the semantics of the ARMv8 ISA into the PVS7 theorem prover and verify the translation. We leverage the radare2 reverse engineering tool to decode ARM binaries into PVS7 and verify the translation. Our translation verification methodology is a lightweight formal validation technique that generates large-scale instruction emulation test lemmas whose proof obligations are automatically discharged. To demonstrate our verification methodology, we apply the technique on two OSes: Google's Zircon and a subset of Linux. We extract a set of 370 functions from these OSes, translate them into PVS7, and verify the correctness of the translation by automatically discharging hundreds of thousands of proof obligations and tests. This took 27.5 person-months to develop.

AB When code is compiled, information is lost, including some of the structure of the original source code as well as local identifier names. Existing decompilers can reconstruct much of the original source code, but typically use meaningless placeholder variables for identifier names. Using variable names which are more natural in the given context can make the code much easier to interpret, despite the fact that variable names have no effect on the execution of the program. In theory, it is impossible to recover the original identifier names since that information has been lost. However, most code is natural: it is highly repetitive and predictable based on the context. In this paper we propose a technique that assigns variables meaningful names by taking advantage of this naturalness property. We consider decompiler output to be a noisy distortion of the original source code, where the original source code is transformed into the decompiler output. Using this noisy channel model, we apply standard statistical machine translation approaches to choose natural identifiers, combining a translation model trained on a parallel corpus with a language model trained on unmodified C code. We generate a large parallel corpus from 1.2 TB of C source code obtained from GitHub. Under the most conservative assumptions, our technique is still able to recover the original variable names up to 16.2% of the time, which represents a lower bound for performance.

AB End-to-end Speech Translation (ST) models have many potential advantages when compared to the cascade of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and text Machine Translation (MT) models, including lowered inference latency and the avoidance of error compounding. However, the quality of end-to-end ST is often limited by a paucity of training data, since it is difficult to collect large parallel corpora of speech and translated transcript pairs. Previous studies have proposed the use of pre-trained components and multi-task learning in order to benefit from weakly supervised training data, such as speech-to-transcript or text-to-foreign-text pairs. In this paper, we demonstrate that using pre-trained MT or text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis models to convert weakly supervised data into speech-to-translation pairs for ST training can be more effective than multi-task learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a high quality end-to-end ST model can be trained using only weakly supervised datasets, and that synthetic data sourced from unlabeled monolingual text or speech can be used to improve performance. Finally, we discuss methods for avoiding overfitting to synthetic speech with a quantitative ablation study.

AB Neural machine translation (NMT) has shown promising progress in recent years. However, for reducing the computational complexity, NMT typically needs to limit its vocabulary scale to a fixed or relatively acceptable size, which leads to the problem of rare word and out-of-vocabulary (OOV). In this paper, we present that the semantic concept information of word can help NMT learn better semantic representation of word and improve the translation accuracy. The key idea is to utilize the external semantic knowledge base WordNet to replace rare words and OOVs with their semantic concepts of WordNet synsets. More specifically, we propose two semantic similarity models to obtain the most similar concepts of rare words and OOVs. Experimental results on 4 translation tasks (We verify the effectiveness of our method on four translation tasks, including English-to- German, German-to-English, English-to-Chinese and Chinese-to-English.) show that our method outperforms the baseline RNNSearch by 2.38-2.88 BLEU points. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid method by combining BPE and our proposed method can also gain 0.39-0.97 BLEU points improvement over BPE. Experiments and analysis presented in this study also demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve translation quality of OOVs in NMT.

AB Cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) systems enable users to search and find their information needs from sources written in languages other than the user's native language. Generally, these systems assist users to overcome the language barrier problem. Although, several techniques are used to develop such systems, query translation method has absorbed much attention due to its performance. In this paper, the author suggested a new approach for English-Persian CLIR. To do this, Google Translate's API was adapted for CLIR system to translate the queries. Using TREC dataset, 50 queries were selected to evaluate the system. Both English queries and their Persian equivalents were searched in RICeST's English and Persian E-articles databases. As black box evaluation, the researcher utilized 11 point interpolated average precision metric to gain the average precision (AP) score for each query after which the mean average precision measure (MAP) scores for English and Persian queries were calculated. The MAP score for monolingual and cross-lingual systems were 0.421 and 0.382 respectively. As glass box evaluation, the machine translation system's performance was measured based on the BLEU automatic metric. According to the results of this study, 90% similarity in IR was observed between the CLIR and the monolingual systems. The new approach was ideally suited for English and Persian CLIR task.

TI Ribosomes: An Exciting Avenue in Stem Cell Research
SO STEM CELLS INTERNATIONAL
AB Stem cell research has focused on genomic studies. However, recent evidence has indicated the involvement of epigenetic regulation in determining the fate of stem cells. Ribosomes play a crucial role in epigenetic regulation, and thus, we focused on the role of ribosomes in stem cells. Majority of living organisms possess ribosomes that are involved in the translation of mRNA into proteins and promote cellular proliferation and differentiation. Ribosomes are stable molecular machines that play a role with changes in the levels of RNA during translation. Recent research suggests that specific ribosomes actively regulate gene expression in multiple cell types, such as stem cells. Stem cells have the potential for self-renewal and differentiation into multiple lineages and, thus, require high efficiency of translation. Ribosomes induce cellular transdifferentiation and reprogramming, and disrupted ribosome synthesis affects translation efficiency, thereby hindering stem cell function leading to cell death and differentiation. Stem cell function is regulated by ribosome-mediated control of stem cell-specific gene expression. In this review, we have presented a detailed discourse on the characteristics of ribosomes in stem cells. Understanding ribosome biology in stem cells will provide insights into the regulation of stem cell function and cellular reprogramming.

The aim of the article is the need to study and substantiate the importance of studying the essence of the concepts of "semiotics", "media text". The article gives a theoretical justification for the concept of media text in the field of mass communication, substantiates the semiotics of learning about signs and sign systems; semiotic characteristics of media texts translation are given. In the field of view of semiotics are various sign systems, features of translation of these signs in media texts, in particular: natural (spoken) and artificial (formal) languages, sentence systems of scientific theories, signaling systems in society and nature, states and many others. Artificial languages can also be considered as sign systems (including the "language" of scientific theory, "languages" of fine arts, cinema, theater, music), various types of visual sign systems (from road signs to painting), as well as any complex control systems considered from the standpoint of cybernetics: machines, devices and their circuits, living organisms, their subsystems (for example, central nervous system), industrial and social associations and society as a whole.

TI Local variable access behavior of a hardware-translation based Java
   virtual machine
SO JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
AB Hardware bytecode translation is a technique to improve the performance of the Java virtual machine JVM), especially on the portable devices for which the overhead of dynamic compilation is significant. However, since the translation is done on a single bytecode basis, a naive implementation of the JVM generates frequent memory accesses for local variables which can be not only a performance bottleneck but also an obstacle for instruction folding. A solution to this problem is to add a small register file to the data path of the microprocessor which is dedicated for storing local variables. However, the effectiveness of such a local variable register file depends on the size and the local variable access behavior of the applications.
   In this paper, we analyze the local variable access behavior of various Java applications. In particular, we will investigate the fraction of local variable accesses that are covered by the register file of a varying size. which determines the chip area overhead and the operation speed. We also evaluate the effectiveness of the sliding register window for parameter passing in context of JVM and on-the-fly optimization of local variable to register file mapping.
   With two types of exceptions, a 16-entry register file achieves coverages of up to 98%. The first type of exception is represented by the SAXON XSLT processor for which the effect of cold miss is significant. Adding the sliding window feature to the register file for parameter passing turns 6.2-13.3% of total accesses from miss to hit to the register file for the SAXON with XSLTMark. The second type of exception is represented by the FFT, which accesses more than 16 local variables for most of method invocations. In this case, on-the-fly Profiling is effective. The hit ratio of a 16-entry register file for the FFT is increased from 44% to 83% by an array of 8-bit counters. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

SO RECALL
AB This study investigates and compares the quality of Google-translated texts (GTTs) across writing genres (narrative, descriptive, expository, and persuasive) with EFL student-generated texts (SGTs), and explores students' attitudes toward Google Translate (GT) output. In a mixed-methods design with a computational approach to text analysis, this study utilizes multiple data sources, including 328 written texts, written reflections, four attitude questionnaires, focus group discussion, and individual interviews. Forty-one Arabic-speaking undergraduate students majoring in English language and translation at a Saudi university participated in this study. They engaged in eight computer-mediated writing sessions by responding to tasks using English, then responding to the same tasks using their first language (L1). Subsequently, they utilized GT to translate L1 texts into English and compared SGTs with GTTs. The findings show that GTTs have higher literacy levels and richer content in the persuasive and expository genres, and higher style levels in the narrative and descriptive genres. Moreover, the comparison between SGTs and GTTs reveals that GTTs have higher literacy levels, better style, and richer content in the descriptive, expository, and persuasive genres. Meanwhile, the students hold positive views on the general quality, grammatical accuracy, and provision of lexical alternatives in GTTs across genres. Pedagogical implications are discussed.

AB The aim of this study is to investigate how the language technologies of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Machine Translation (MT), and Text To Speech (TTS) synthesis affect users during an interlingual interaction. In this paper, we describe the prototype system used for the data collection, we give details of the collected data and report the results of a usability test run to assess how the users of the interlingual system evaluate the interactions in a collaborative map task. We use widely adopted usability evaluation measures: ease of use, effectiveness and users satisfaction, and look at both qualitative and quantitative measures. Results indicate that both users taking part in the dialogues (instructions giver and follower) found the system similarly satisfactory in terms of ease of learning, ease of use, and pleasantness, even if they were less satisfied with its effectiveness in supporting the task. Users employed different strategies in order to adapt to the shortcomings of the technology, such as hyper-articulation, and rewording of utterances in relation to error of the ASR. We also report the results of a comparison of the map task in two different settings-one that includes a constant video stream ("video-on") and one that does not ("no-video.") Surprisingly, users rated the no-video setting consistently better.

AB The Android operating system is now used in the majority of mobile devices. Each application in Android runs in an instance of the Dalvik virtual machine, which is a register-based virtual machine (VM). Most applications for Android are developed using Java, compiled to Java bytecode and then translated to DEX bytecode using the dx tool in the Android Software Development Kit. In this work, I aim to develop a type-based method for certifying non-interference properties of DEX bytecode, following a methodology that has been developed for Java bytecode certification by Barthe et al. To this end, I develop a formal operational semantics of the Dalvik VM, a type system for DEX bytecode, and prove the soundness of the type system with respect to a notion of non-interference. I then study the translation process from Java bytecode to DEX bytecode, as implemented in the dx tool in the Android SDK. I show that an abstracted version of the translation from Java bytecode to DEX bytecode preserves the non-interference property. More precisely, I show that if the Java bytecode is typable in Barthe et al's type system (which guarantees non-interference) then its translation is typable in our type system. This result opens up the possibility to leverage existing bytecode verifiers for Java to certify non-interference properties of Android bytecode.

AB On in-order processors, without dynamic instruction scheduling, program running times may be significantly reduced by compile-time instruction scheduling. We present here the first effective certified instruction scheduler that operates over superblocks (it may move instructions across branches), along with its performance evaluation. It is integrated within the CompCert C compiler, providing a complete machine-checked proof of semantic preservation from C to assembly.
   Our optimizer composes several passes designed by translation validation: program transformations are proposed by untrusted oracles, which are then validated by certified and scalable checkers. Our main checker is an architecture-independent simulation-test over superblocks modulo register liveness, which relies on hash-consed symbolic execution.

It has natural language processing applications in searching for matches in example-based translation systems, and retrieval from lexical databases containing entries of complex feature structures. For large randomly generated synthetic tree databases (some having tens of thousands of trees), and on databases constructed from Wall Street Journal treebank, it can retrieve for trees with a small error, in a matter of tenths of a second to about a second.

AB In this paper we explore the concept of "accessibility as a service" by proposing a cloud computing service to help deaf people to access digital contents. The proposed service automatically generates and embeds a sign language video track into multimedia contents. The service organizes the collaboration of sign language experts to dynamically adjust the system that runs on a cloud computing infrastructure. As a case study, we made an implementation of the service for providing support for the Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS) and some preliminary tests with Brazilian deaf users to evaluate the proposed solution.

TI Hierarchical design, laboratory prototype fabrication and machining
   tests of a novel 5-axis hybrid serial-parallel kinematic machine tool
SO ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING
AB Hybrid serial-parallel kinematic machine tool (HSPKMT) has been regarded as a promising solution for 5-axis machining in many industrial fields. A typical HSPKMT can be constructed by integrating a parallel functional module with a serial functional module. Following this way, the authors construct a novel 5-axis HSPKMT through the integration of an over constrained redundantly actuated parallel module with a stack-up serial gantry. The proposed HSPKMT can accomplish a 5-axis motion capacity with three translations and two rotations (3T2R). A hierarchical design method is proposed to facilitate the design issues of the 5-axis HSPKMT. According to the hierarchical method, a laboratory prototype is designed with a top-down strategy and then fabricated with a bottom-up strategy. An open-architecture computer numerical control (CNC) system is developed to drive the fabricated prototype. A kinematic analysis is carried out to reveal necessary kinematic properties of the proposed HSPKMT. The reachable workspace and task workspace are defined to graphically illustrate the machine's position-orientation capabilities. A workspace performance index is formulated to compare the proposed 5-axis HSPKMT with several 5-axis machine tools. Based the kinematic analysis, a 5-axis machining methodology is developed and further applied to the laboratory prototype to perform 5-axis machining tasks. The machining tests verify that the proposed novel HSPKMT possesses desirable 5-axis machining capability with the tolerance rang of +/- 0.05 mm. This also implies that the proposed hierarchical design method as well as the 5-axis machining methodology can be further applied to other types of HSPKMTs with minor modifications.

TI The ePortfolio: constructing learning in translation technology
SO INTERPRETER AND TRANSLATOR TRAINER
AB The use of ePortfolios in higher education has experienced a rise with multiple experiences reported in different areas where student-centred methodologies are key. While these are not new in translator training, ePortfolios are still underused in this area, even if they provide an excellent framework for constructivist methodologies. In this article, I explain how ePortfolios are used in a course on translation technology with a view to implementing a learner-centred scenario. This is a course I have been teaching for some years, which has experienced, over time, a movement from traditional transmissionist techniques, where the teacher is the possessor and distributor of knowledge' to a transformationist position, as I realised that, in order for the course to be effective, students needed some form of empowerment and a more active role in their learning process. This article discusses the advantages of using ePortfolios for the learning of translation technology. It presents an experience in implementing a learning scenario based on the ePortfolio - course competences, content, resources and assessment - as a proposal for instructors wishing to adopt a similar approach. The article will end with a discussion on how these teaching practices relate to the principles of socio-constructivism.

These documents are extremely challenging to recognize due to presence of noise, poor image capture quality, and variations in writing style, writing device, font, layout, genre, etc. Furthermore, no off-the-shelf machine translation (MT) engine is available to translate these documents into English. We present key innovations for dealing with these challenges for document preprocessing, text line segmentation, and text recognition. In addition, we describe our approach for adapting MT using a limited amount of in-domain training data that results in significant improvements in translating accuracy.

AB Network Address Translation (NAT) is a technology allowing a number of machines to share a single IP address. This presents a problem for network forensics since it is difficult to attribute observed traffic to specific hosts. We present a model and algorithm for disentangling observed traffic into discrete sources. Our model relies on correlation of a number of artifacts left over by the NAT gateway which allows identification of sources. The model works well for a small number of sources, as commonly found behind a home or small office NAT gateway. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Diversity in Machine Learning
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Machine learning methods have achieved good performance and been widely applied in various real-world applications. They can learn the model adaptively and be better fit for special requirements of different tasks. Generally, a good machine learning system is composed of plentiful training data, a good model training process, and an accurate inference. Many factors can affect the performance of the machine learning process, among which the diversity of the machine learning process is an important one. The diversity can help each procedure to guarantee a totally good machine learning: diversity of the training data ensures that the training data can provide more discriminative information for the model, diversity of the learned model (diversity in parameters of each model or diversity among different base models) makes each parameter/model capture unique or complement information and the diversity in inference can provide multiple choices each of which corresponds to a specific plausible local optimal result. Even though diversity plays an important role in the machine learning process, there is no systematical analysis of the diversification in the machine learning system. In this paper, we systematically summarize the methods to make data diversification, model diversification, and inference diversification in the machine learning process. In addition, the typical applications where the diversity technology improved the machine learning performance have been surveyed including the remote sensing imaging tasks, machine translation, camera relocalization, image segmentation, object detection, topic modeling, and others. Finally, we discuss some challenges of the diversity technology in machine learning and point out some directions in future work. Our analysis provides a deeper understanding of the diversity technology in machine learning tasks and hence can help design and learn more effective models for real-world applications.

SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION DISORDERS
AB Background: The emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in communication being heightened as one of the critical aspects in the implementation of interventions. Delays in the relaying of vital information by policymakers have the potential to be detrimental, especially for the hearing impaired. Objectives: This study aims to conduct a scoping review on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) for real-time speech-to-text to sign language translation and consequently propose an AI-based real-time translation solution for South African languages from speech-to-text to sign language.Methods: Electronic bibliographic databases including ScienceDirect, PubMed, Scopus, MEDLINE and ProQuest were searched to identify peer-reviewed publications published in English between 2019 and 2021 that provided evidence on AI-based real-time speech-to-text to sign language translation as a solution for the hearing impaired. This review was done as a precursor to the proposed real-time South African translator.Results: The review revealed a dearth of evidence on the adoption and/or maximisation of AI and machine learning (ML) as possible solutions for the hearing impaired. There is a clear lag in clinical utilisation and investigation of these technological advances, particularly in the African continent.Conclusion: Assistive technology that caters specifically for the South African community is essential to ensuring a two-way communication between individuals who can hear clearly and individuals with hearing impairments, thus the proposed solution presented in this article.

Our approach is evaluated in the context of log-bilinear language models, rendered suitably efficient for implementation inside a machine translation decoder by factoring the vocabulary. We perform both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations, presenting results on a range of languages which demonstrate that our model learns morphological representations that both perform well on word similarity tasks and lead to substantial reductions in perplexity. When used for translation into morphologically rich languages with large vocabularies, our models obtain improvements of up to 1.2 BLEU points relative to a baseline system using back-off n-gram models.

AB Translations 2.2013 is a digital device for the presentation of drawings, based on the interpretation and translation of others' drawings data.
   On this work it is proposed the experience of the perception of the duration of the act of drawing, as well as of other representations for its data, as a way to place the observer on the position of interpreter and creator of a mental copy of the drawing.
   The drawings being displayed have been previously produced using another device's module, constituted by a digital drawing machine and a person to make the drawing, that will record, on a text file, the data corresponding to every pixel's position and its quantity.
   Translations 2.2013 is a device that interprets and transforms these data in a copy drawing of its original and in graphs of the relation of each pixel's position and the duration of the drawing process.
   This drawing presentation has the duration of one day, happening pixel-by-pixel, in order to accentuate the act of drawing as a performative act inscribed in a duration. By turning the revelation of the drawing in an extremely slow process it becomes relevant the observer's perception as a subjective and creative action.

AB Automatic describing an image comprehends the representation from the scene elements to generate a concise natural language description. Few resources, particularly annotated datasets for the Portuguese language, discourage the development of new methods in languages other than English. Thus, we propose a new image captioning method for the Portuguese language. We provide an analysis empowered by an encoder-decoder model with an attention mechanism when employing a multimodal dataset translated into Portuguese. Our findings suggest that: 1) the original and translated datasets are pretty similar considering the measure achievements; 2) the translation approach includes some dirty sentence formulations that disturb our model for the Portuguese language.

A syntactic feature approach combined with a dictionary lookup is used as primary technique to perform word alignments. Other used methods take into account local word grouping or the nearest aligned neighbors approach to filter between many-to-many word alignments. Building an alignment system at the word level, one can use it in the creation of new resources, for example collections of parallel sequences of texts in the two languages based on which translation schemes could be learned.

AB Persistent memory's (PM) byte-addressability and high capacity will also make it emerging for virtualized environment. Modern virtual machine monitors virtualize PM using either I/O virtualization or memory virtualization. However, I/O virtualization will sacrifice PM's byte-addressability, and memory virtualization does not get the chance of PM image management. In this paper, we enhance QEMU's memory virtualization mechanism. The enhanced system can achieve both PM's byte-addressability inside virtual machines and PM image management outside the virtual machines. We also design pcow, a virtual machine image format for PM, which is compatible with our enhanced memory virtualization and supports storage virtualization features including thin-provision, base image and snapshot. Address translation is performed with the help of Extended Page Table (EPT), thus much faster than image formats implemented in I/O virtualization. We also optimize pcow considering PM's characteristics. The evaluation demonstrates that our scheme boosts the overall performance by up to 50x compared with qcow2, an image format implemented in I/O virtualization, and brings almost no performance overhead compared with the native memory virtualization.

AB There are great translation systems online. However, even though this technology is available for the majority of languages, it is not the case of Nahuatl [1]. For this reason, this paper outlines a master's degree thesis proposal which is aimed to use a Neural Network for Translation with an attention mechanism and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) like the one used by Google [2]. In addition, it seeks to implement an artificial Text To Speech (TTS) system trained with a Neural Network with a given dataset of Mel spectrograms in [3] from a person speaking in Nahuatl and it attempts to achieve a natural voice output as a spectrogram, then process it and obtain the sound desired. Finally, once trained, these models can be prepared for being used within mobile devices, and even taking advantage of the neural engine some of them are equipped with. In this way, this technology can reach more people and help to preserve and even spread the language. The early results showed how the limited resources of this language could cause a strong bias in the outputs and also how there could be some loss of information given the morphemes Nahuatl has, given its polysynthetic nature. This also highlights the way it can be tokenized, playing an important role in how the results turn out obtaining a BLEU score of 0.34 at best. Finally, this application and research can be an interesting framework of how a polysynthetic language can be manipulated to be used for fusional languages like Spanish or English. This research work was carried out at the "Tecnologico Nacional de Mexico" (TecNM), campus of the "Instituto Tecnologico de Apizaco" (ITA)

AB Typical ASR systems segment the input audio into utterances using purely acoustic information, which may not resemble the sentencelike units that are expected by conventional machine translation (MT) systems for Spoken Language Translation. In this work, we propose a model for correcting the acoustic segmentation of ASR models for low-resource languages to improve performance on down-stream tasks. We propose the use of subtitles as a proxy dataset for correcting ASR acoustic segmentation, creating synthetic acoustic utterances by modeling common error modes. We train a neural tagging model for correcting ASR acoustic segmentation and show that it improves downstream performance on MT and audio-document cross-language information retrieval (CLIR).

AB In this paper we advocate the use of bilingual corpora which are abundantly available for training sentence compression models. Our approach borrows much of its machinery from neural machine translation and leverages bilingual pivoting: compressions are obtained by translating a source string into a foreign language and then back-translating it into the source while controlling the translation length. Our model can be trained for any language as long as a bilingual corpus is available and performs arbitrary rewrites without access to compression specific data. We release1 MOSS, a new parallel Multilingual Compression dataset for English, German, and French which can be used to evaluate compression models across languages and genres.

AB Multimodal sentiment analysis is a core research area that studies speaker sentiment expressed from the language, visual, and acoustic modalities. The central challenge in multimodal learning involves inferring joint representations that can process and relate information from these modalities. However, existing work learns joint representations by requiring all modalities as input and as a result, the learned representations may be sensitive to noisy or missing modalities at test time. With the recent success of sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) models in machine translation, there is an opportunity to explore new ways of learning joint representations that may not require all input modalities at test time. In this paper, we propose a method to learn robust joint representations by translating between modalities. Our method is based on the key insight that translation from a source to a target modality provides a method of learning joint representations using only the source modality as input. We augment modality translations with a cycle consistency loss to ensure that our joint representations retain maximal information from all modalities. Once our translation model is trained with paired multimodal data, we only need data from the source modality at test time for final sentiment prediction. This ensures that our model remains robust from perturbations or missing information in the other modalities. We train our model with a coupled translation-prediction objective and it achieves new state-of-the-art results on multimodal sentiment analysis datasets: CMU-MOSI, ICT-MMMO, and YouTube. Additional experiments show that our model learns increasingly discriminative joint representations with more input modalities while maintaining robustness to missing or perturbed modalities.

The current goal is to improve the system for automatic synthesis to produce accurate synthesis of the Sign Speech. The synthesis system converts written text to an animation of an artificial human model (avatar). This includes translation of text to sign phrases and their conversion to the animation of the avatar. The animation is composed of movements and deformations of segments of hands, a head and also a face. The system has been evaluated by two initial perceptual tests. The perceptual tests indicate that the designed synthesis system is capable to produce the intelligible Sign Speech.

TI Optimizing NET compilers for improved Java performance
SO COMPUTER
AB Because they are interpreted, Java executables run slower than their compiled counterparts. The native executable translation (NET) compiler's objective is to optimize the translation of Java bytecode to native machine code so that it runs nearly as fast as native code generated directly from a source.
   The article presents some preliminary results for several large application programs and standard benchmarks. It compares the NET-compiled code performance with Sun's Java VM, Microsoft's Java just-in-time compiler, and equivalent C and C++ programs directly compiled. The results show that the optimizing NET compiler is capable of achieving better performance than the two other bytecode execution methods, in some cases achieving speeds comparable to directly compiled native code.

AB Reviews written by the users for a particular product or service play an influencing role for the customers to make an informative decision. Although online e-commerce portals have immensely impacted our lives, available contents predominantly are in English language-often limiting its widespread usage. There is an exponential growth in the number of e-commerce users who are not proficient in English. Hence, there is a necessity to make these services available in non-English languages, especially in a multilingual country like India. This can be achieved by an in-domain robust machine translation (MT) system. However, the reviews written by the users pose unique challenges to MT, such as misspelled words, ungrammatical constructions, presence of colloquial terms, lack of resources such as in-domain parallel corpus etc. We address the above challenges by presenting an English-Hindi review domain parallel corpus. We train an English-to-Hindi neural machine translation (NMT) system to translate the product reviews available on e-commerce websites. By training the Transformer based NMT model over the generated data, we achieve a score of 33.26 BLEU points for English-to-Hindi translation. In order to make our NMT model robust enough to handle the noisy tokens in the reviews, we integrate a character based language model to generate word vectors and map the noisy tokens with their correct forms. Experiments on four language pairs, viz. English-Hindi, English-German, English-French, and English-Czech show the BLUE scores of 35.09, 28.91, 34.68 and 14.52 which are the improvements of 1.61, 1.05, 1.63 and 1.94, respectively, over the baseline.

AB A dynamic binary translation system for a co-designed virtual machine is described and evaluated. The underlying hardware directly executes an accumulator-oriented instruction set that exposes instruction dependence chains (strands) to a distributed microarchitecture containing a simple instruction pipeline. To support conventional program binaries, a source instruction set (Alpha in our study) is dynamically translated to the target accumulator instruction set. The binary translator identifies chains of inter-instruction dependences and assigns them to dependence-carrying accumulators. Because the underlying superscalar microarchitecture is capable of dynamic instruction scheduling, the binary translation system does not perform aggressive optimizations or re-schedule code; this significantly reduces binary translation overhead.
   Detailed timing simulation of the dynamically translated code running on an accumulator-based distributed microarchitecture shows the overall system is capable of achieving similar performance to an ideal out-of-order superscalar processor, ignoring the significant clock frequency advantages that the accumulator-based hardware is likely to have. As part of the study, we evaluate an instruction set modification that simplifies precise trap implementation. This approach significantly reduces the number of instructions required for register state copying, thereby improving performance. We also observe that translation chaining methods can have substantial impact on the performance, and we evaluate a number of chaining methods.

TI Investigation on parallel auxiliary adjusting machine of spatial filter
   lens for a high-power laser facility
SO OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY
AB As a key part in high-power laser facility, the spatial filter is used to determine the optical axis of the entire laser system, which consists of two conjugate lenses at both ends and filter hole in the middle. The lenses usually require precise adjustment, and the adjustment mechanism is integrated to both ends of the filter currently. To this end, a novel parallel adjusting machine for the filter lenses was proposed as an auxiliary tool in the spatial filter process. The machine was designed to realize the five-dimensional adjustment functions of the filter lenses with X-Y-Z axial translation, pitch, and yaw motion. The first-order ghost point of the filter lens was used as the feedback reference for the parallel machine to adjust Z-position of the lens. A more comprehensive optimizationoriented framework was established to improve the sensitivity of the lens to the posture error and to optimize the positioning speed based on the steepest descent method (SDM). The experimental results verified the superiority of the proposed adjustment machine and feedback reference point.

   institutions: the case of the European Central Bank
SO PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATION THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB This study explores the translators' agency and translation norms in institutional translation, namely at the European Central Bank (E.C.B.), illustrated by metaphors translated from English into Romanian. Two methods are used in the study: (1) quantitative and qualitative analysis of a corpus of texts produced at the E.C.B. - around 2 million tokens each for the English and the Romanian language version sub-corpora and (2) ethnographic observation. The strategies employed for translating metaphorical expressions belonging to the conceptual metaphor THE ECONOMY IS A MACHINE are used to illustrate the choices translators make. The findings of the study show that the translators use a number of strategies, from retaining the metaphor and the metaphorical expression to completely demetaphorising the expressions. Their choices are influenced by internal requirements of the institution (e.g. using translation memory tools) as well as by the linguistic norms and language conventions of Romanian - the target language, the formal style of the documents, and the expectations of the target audience. Moreover, different expressions in English are translated using the same expression in Romanian, which shows that the Romanian economic vocabulary is still developing and this fact also influences translation choices.

TI IRESpy: an XGBoost model for prediction of internal ribosome entry sites
SO BMC BIOINFORMATICS
AB BackgroundInternal ribosome entry sites (IRES) are segments of mRNA found in untranslated regions that can recruit the ribosome and initiate translation independently of the 5 cap-dependent translation initiation mechanism. IRES usually function when 5 cap-dependent translation initiation has been blocked or repressed. They have been widely found to play important roles in viral infections and cellular processes. However, a limited number of confirmed IRES have been reported due to the requirement for highly labor intensive, slow, and low efficiency laboratory experiments. Bioinformatics tools have been developed, but there is no reliable online tool.ResultsThis paper systematically examines the features that can distinguish IRES from non-IRES sequences. Sequence features such as kmer words, structural features such as Q(MFE), and sequence/structure hybrid features are evaluated as possible discriminators. They are incorporated into an IRES classifier based on XGBoost. The XGBoost model performs better than previous classifiers, with higher accuracy and much shorter computational time. The number of features in the model has been greatly reduced, compared to previous predictors, by including global kmer and structural features. The contributions of model features are well explained by LIME and SHapley Additive exPlanations. The trained XGBoost model has been implemented as a bioinformatics tool for IRES prediction, IRESpy (https://irespy.shinyapps.io/IRESpy/), which has been applied to scan the human 5 ' UTR and find novel IRES segments.ConclusionsIRESpy is a fast, reliable, high-throughput IRES online prediction tool. It provides a publicly available tool for all IRES researchers, and can be used in other genomics applications such as gene annotation and analysis of differential gene expression.

TI A prototype Greek text to Greek Sign Language conversion system
SO BEHAVIOUR & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB In this article, a prototype Greek text to Greek Sign Language (GSL) conversion system is presented. The system is integrated into an educational platform that addresses the needs of teaching GSL grammar and was developed within the SYNENNOESE project (Efthimiou et al. 2004a. Developing an e-learning platform for the Greek sign language. In: K. Miesenberger, J. Klaus, and W. Zagler, eds. Computer helping people with special needs, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer-Verlag, vol. 3118, 1107-1113). The detailed implementation of the language-processing component of a Greek text to GSL conversion system is provided, focusing upon the inherent problems of knowledge elicitation of sign language (SL) grammar and its implementation within a parser framework. It is based on an SL dictionary (Efthimiou et al. 2004a) database of coded GSL knowledge. The proposed system has been designed and implemented after considering most state-of-the-art SL machine translation or Conversion systems, such as Vsigns (Papadogiorgaki et al. 2004. VSigns a virtual sign synthesis web tool. In: Proceedings of Sixth COST 276 Workshop on Information and Knowledge Management for Integrated Media Communication, May 2004, Thessaloniki, Greece), ZARDOZ (Veale et al. 1998. The challenges of cross-modal translation: English to sign language translation in the ZARDOZ system. Machine Translation, 13, 81-106) and SignSynth (Angus 2001. SignSynth: a sign language synthesis application using Web3D and Perl. In: Gesture and Sign Lanauage in Human-Computer Interaction. London, UK: International Gesture Workshop), and taking into account their advantages and disadvantages. The overall architecture is innovative since other existing systems either do not consider the GSL or they cannot be effectively applied on sentences but just on single words. The system is demonstrable on any conventional PC.

TI Skin tear classification using machine learning from digital RGB image
SO JOURNAL OF TISSUE VIABILITY
AB Aim: Skin tears are traumatic wounds characterised by separation of the skin layers. Severity evaluation is important in the management of skin tears. To support the assessment and management of skin tears, this study aimed to develop an algorithm to estimate a category of the Skin Tear Audit Research classification system (STAR classification) using digital images via machine learning. This was achieved by introducing shape features representing complicated shape of the skin tears. Methods: A skin tear image was separated into small segments, and features of each segment were estimated. The segments were then classified into different classes by machine learning algorithms, namely support vector machine and random forest. Their performance in classifying wound segments and STAR categories was eval-uated with 31 images using the leave-one-out cross validation. Results: Support vector machine showed an accuracy of 74% and 69% in classifying wound segments and STAR categories, respectively. The corresponding accuracy using random forest were 71% and 63%. Conclusion: Machine learning algorithms revealed capable of classifying categories of skin tears. This could offer the potential to aid nurses in their management of skin tears, even if they are not specialised in wound care.

TI Design and Analysis of English Intelligent Translation System Based on
   Internet of Things and Big Data Model
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB Today, we have entered an era of big data. Under the background of global economization, communication in all walks of life is becoming more and more frequent and cross-language communication is inevitable. Cross-language communication is difficult for many people. The online translation system can greatly reduce the communication barriers between people of different languages. As an efficient tool, the translation system can realize the translation of different languages under the conditions of retaining the original semantics equivalent conversion. The article adopts the Internet of Things technology and big data model to build an English intelligent translation system, which can realize intelligent translation between multiple languages and English. The research results of the article show the following: (1) For samples with high semantic feature values, the correlation coefficient and similarity coefficient will be higher. Therefore, it can be concluded that for different semantics, the similarity is generally positively correlated with its feature value and correlation coefficient. The translation speed of the system proposed in the article is the fastest among the three translation systems. When the number of sentences is 10,000, the translation speed of the translation system proposed in the article is 5.89 seconds, the translation speed of the network multilingual translation system is 6.74 seconds, and the translation speed of the traditional translation system is 10.53 seconds. (2) The translation accuracy of the big data intelligent translation model proposed in the article is the highest among the three models. The translation accuracy of simple sentences can reach 99%. The translation accuracy of general sentences is 98%, and the translation accuracy of complex sentences is 95%. The BLEU value of the method in this paper is basically the same as that of the RNN cyclic neural network translation model. When translating general sentences, the BLEU value of the method in this paper is slightly higher than that of the RNN cyclic neural network translation model; especially when translating complex sentences by machine, the BLEU value of the method in this paper is far higher than that of the RNN translation model. (3) The average response time will increase with the increase in the number of tests, and the success rate generally remains above 98%, close to 100%, indicating that the response time of the system operation is normal. The number of designed test cases for the data processing module is 90, the number of executed test cases is 90, and the execution rate can reach 100%. Normal operation means that in the process of operation, no fault occurs. In the system load test, the load of serial number 1 is normal, the average delay is 38 seconds, the average delay of serial number 2 is 48 seconds, the average delay of serial number 3 is 59 seconds, the average delay of serial number 4 is 62 seconds, and the average delay of serial number 5 is 47 seconds. The delay of data packets under all kinds of loads can meet the standard requirements.

To enhance the universal communication technology, we are trying to develop a large-scale information infrastructure which collects and stores diverse information including huge volumes of web pages from the networks. The one of most important key technologies to realize a large-scaled information infrastructure is a distributed in memory database system. In this paper, we introduced a large-scale information infrastructure, mainly explaining a distributed in-memory database system "okuyama" which is a key technology on our project. We examined the I/O performance of the in memory storage, which verified whether if "okuyama" meet requirements for the infrastructure. Furthermore we give a blueprint of cluster systems on which the infrastructure will be constructed.

TI Intersemiotic translation of contracts into digital environments
SO FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB An intersemiotic translation is any form of translation that involves at least two different semiotic codes; for example, the translation from words to images, to numerical code, or to non-verbal sounds. One of the most widespread examples of intersemiotic translation in the contemporary world is transposing natural language into machine language in digital environments. In this case, if the source text is a legal text, we encounter a particular type of intersemiotic translation, namely an intersemiotic legal translation in a digital environment. This paper will focus on the intersemiotic legal translation of contracts in digital environments, and is divided into two parts. In the first part (Section Ways of intersemiotically translating a contract using digital tools), we will analyze four possible uses of the intersemiotic translation of contracts in a digital context. In particular, we will highlight the technical characteristics of intersemiotic translation, its limitations, and its potential in different phases of contract management, namely the drafting of the document, the agreement, the archiving of the document, and the execution of contractual clauses. We will examine different digital tools that exploit intersemiotic translation, such as contract drafting tools and online platforms that allow for the conclusion of electronic contracts, document archiving in blockchains, and building smart contracts. When analyzing these uses of intersemiotic translation in the digital environment, we will highlight four types of output that can represent the product of intersemiotic translation in the digital environment: epistemic effects, legal effects, digital effects, and economic effects. In the second part (Section A tool for translating the contract intersemiotically), we will describe a hypothetical prototype that, in light of the four potential uses of intersemiotic translation, could represent a support tool to simplify the communication between professionals and clients through the drafting of legal documents with the aid of dynamic forms and, eventually, with the help of artificial intelligence (AI). Beyond facilitating the dialogue between legal professionals and their clients, we use interfaces to allow clients to create their own drafts of their documents and the lawyer to work on the drafts drawn up by the customer, correct them, and structure them in order to guarantee the validity of the document. The system can also be designed to archive legal documents and private deeds securely and entrust them to a professional by using blockchain technology and automating the execution of some contractual clauses via smart contract protocols.

TI A resource-light method for cross-lingual semantic textual similarity
SO KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS
AB Recognizing semantically similar sentences or paragraphs across languages is beneficial for many tasks, ranging from cross-lingual information retrieval and plagiarism detection to machine translation. Recently proposed methods for predicting cross-lingual semantic similarity of short texts, however, make use of tools and resources (e.g., machine translation systems, syntactic parsers or named entity recognition) that for many languages (or language pairs) do not exist. In contrast, we propose an unsupervised and a very resource-light approach for measuring semantic similarity between texts in different languages. To operate in the bilingual (or multilingual) space, we project continuous word vectors (i.e., word embeddings) from one language to the vector space of the other language via the linear translation model. We then align words according to the similarity of their vectors in the bilingual embedding space and investigate different unsupervised measures of semantic similarity exploiting bilingual embeddings and word alignments. Requiring only a limited-size set of word translation pairs between the languages, the proposed approach is applicable to virtually any pair of languages for which there exists a sufficiently large corpus, required to learn monolingual word embeddings. Experimental results on three different datasets for measuring semantic textual similarity show that our simple resource-light approach reaches performance close to that of supervised and resource-intensive methods, displaying stability across different language pairs. Furthermore, we evaluate the proposed method on two extrinsic tasks, namely extraction of parallel sentences from comparable corpora and cross-lingual plagiarism detection, and show that it yields performance comparable to those of complex resource-intensive state-of-the-art models for the respective tasks.

AB In this paper, with the help of knowledge base, we build and formulate a semantic space to connect the source and target languages, and apply it to the sequence-to-sequence framework to propose a Knowledge-Based Semantic Embedding (KBSE) method. In our KB SE method, the source sentence is firstly mapped into a knowledge based semantic space, and the target sentence is generated using a recurrent neural network with the internal meaning preserved. Experiments are conducted on two translation tasks, the electric business data and movie data, and the results show that our proposed method can achieve outstanding performance, compared with both the traditional SMT methods and the existing encoder-decoder models.

AB We present a novel translation model based on tree-to-string alignment template (TAT) which describes the alignment between a source parse tree and a target string. A TAT is capable of generating both terminals and non-terminals and performing reordering at both low and high levels. The model is linguistically syntax-based because TATs are extracted automatically from word-aligned, source side parsed parallel texts. To translate a source sentence, we first employ a parser to produce a source parse tree and then apply TATs to transform the tree into a target string. Our experiments show that the TAT-based model significantly outperforms Pharaoh, a state-of-the-art decoder for phrase-based models.

At the model level, we use teacher-student training with a variety of student sizes, tie embeddings and sometimes layers, use the Simpler Simple Recurrent Unit, and introduce head pruning. On GPUs, we used 16-bit floating-point tensor cores. On CPUs, we customized 8-bit quantization and multiple processes with affinity for the multicore setting. To reduce model size, we experimented with 4-bit log quantization but use floats at runtime. In the shared task, most of our submissions were Pareto optimal with respect the trade-off between time and quality.

AB Adaptive gradient-based optimizers such as Adagrad and Adam are crucial for achieving state-of-the-art performance in machine translation and language modeling. However, these methods maintain second-order statistics for each parameter, thus introducing significant memory overheads that restrict the size of the model being used as well as the number of examples in a mini-batch. We describe an effective and flexible adaptive optimization method with greatly reduced memory overhead. Our method retains the benefits of per-parameter adaptivity while allowing significantly larger models and batch sizes. We give convergence guarantees for our method, and demonstrate its effectiveness in training very large translation and language models with up to 2-fold speedups compared to the state-of-the-art.

CLIR deals with submitting queries in one language and retrieving documents in some other language other than query language. MLIR deals with submitting questions in one or more languages and retrieving documents in one or more diverse languages. With increasing globalized economy, the knack to find information in other languages is becoming a necessity. In short the paper tries to encapsulate the overall review of the research works in Indian and Foreign languages.

This task can be modeled as a classification problem between positive (TIS) and negative patterns. Here we have used Support Vector Machine working with data processed by the class balancing method called Smote (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). Smote was used because the average imbalance has a positive/negative pattern ratio of around 1:28 for the databases used in this work. As a result we have attained accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity values of 99% on average.

TI What can Android mobile app developers do about the energy consumption
   of machine learning?
SO EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
AB Machine learning is a popular method of learning functions from data to represent and to classify sensor inputs, multimedia, emails, and calendar events. Smartphone applications have been integrating more and more intelligence in the form of machine learning. Machine learning functionality now appears on most smartphones as voice recognition, spell checking, word disambiguation, face recognition, translation, spatial reasoning, and even natural language summarization. Excited app developers who want to use machine learning on mobile devices face one serious constraint that they did not face on desktop computers or cloud virtual machines: the end-user's mobile device has limited battery life, thus computationally intensive tasks can harm end users' phone availability by draining batteries of their stored energy. Currently, there are few guidelines for developers who want to employ machine learning on mobile devices yet are concerned about software energy consumption of their applications. In this paper, we combine empirical measurements of different machine learning algorithm implementations with complexity theory to provide concrete and theoretically grounded recommendations to developers who want to employ machine learning on smartphones. We conclude that some implementations of algorithms, such as J48, MLP, and SMO, do generally perform better than others in terms of energy consumption and accuracy, and that energy consumption is well-correlated to algorithmic complexity. However, to achieve optimal results a developer must consider their specific application as many factors dataset size, number of data attributes, whether the model will require updating, etc. affect which machine learning algorithm and implementation will provide the best results.

TI Current Applications of Machine Learning for Spinal Cord Tumors
SO LIFE-BASEL
AB Spinal cord tumors constitute a diverse group of rare neoplasms associated with significant mortality and morbidity that pose unique clinical and surgical challenges. Diagnostic accuracy and outcome prediction are critical for informed decision making and can promote personalized medicine and facilitate optimal patient management. Machine learning has the ability to analyze and combine vast amounts of data, allowing the identification of patterns and the establishment of clinical associations, which can ultimately enhance patient care. Although artificial intelligence techniques have been explored in other areas of spine surgery, such as spinal deformity surgery, precise machine learning models for spinal tumors are lagging behind. Current applications of machine learning in spinal cord tumors include algorithms that improve diagnostic precision by predicting genetic, molecular, and histopathological profiles. Furthermore, artificial intelligence-based systems can assist surgeons with preoperative planning and surgical resection, potentially reducing the risk of recurrence and consequently improving clinical outcomes. Machine learning algorithms promote personalized medicine by enabling prognostication and risk stratification based on accurate predictions of treatment response, survival, and postoperative complications. Despite their promising potential, machine learning models require extensive validation processes and quality assessments to ensure safe and effective translation to clinical practice.

SO IJISPM-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND PROJECT
   MANAGEMENT
AB There used to be a clear separation between tasks done by machines and tasks done by people. Applications of machine learning in speech recognition (e.g., Alexa and Siri), image recognition, automated translation, autonomous driving, and medical diagnosis, have blurred the classical divide between human tasks and machine tasks. Although current Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies outperform humans in many areas, tasks requiring common sense, contextual knowledge, creativity, adaptivity, and empathy are still best performed by humans. Hybrid Intelligence (HI) blends human intelligence and machine intelligence to combine the best of both worlds. Hence, current and future Business Process Management (BPM) initiatives need to consider HI and the changing boundaries between work done by people and work done by software robots. Consider, for example, the success of Robotic Process Automation (RPA), which demonstrates that gradually taking away repetitive tasks from workers is possible. In this viewpoint paper, we argue that process mining is a key technology to decide what to automate and what not. Moreover, using process mining, it is possible to systematically monitor and manage processes where work is distributed over human workers and software robots.

Our correcting algorithm is based on simple, viable n-gram model whose parameters can be obtained using the WWW search engine Google. Using much less features than those used in the early researches, we experimentally showed that our approach could perform the promising results with a precision of 86.2% on all classes of article errors.

We then look at how to better forecast the utility of MT in deployments so that feedback from the field is focused on aspects that can be fixed or enhanced rather than on overall failure or viability of the technology.

TI iTIS-PseTNC: A sequence-based predictor for identifying translation
   initiation site in human genes using pseudo trinucleotide composition
SO ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Translation is a key process for gene expression. Timely identification of the translation initiation site (TIS) is very important for conducting in-depth genome analysis. With the avalanche of genome sequences generated in the postgenomic age, it is highly desirable to develop automated methods for rapidly and effectively identifying TIS. Although some computational methods were proposed in this regard, none of them considered the global or long-range sequence-order effects of DNA, and hence their prediction quality was limited. To count this kind of effects, a new predictor, called "iTIS-PseTNC," was developed by incorporating the physicochemical properties into the pseudo trinucleotide composition, quite similar to the PseAAC (pseudo amino acid composition) approach widely used in computational proteomics. It was observed by the rigorous cross-validation test on the benchmark dataset that the overall success rate achieved by the new predictor in identifying TIS locations was over 97%. As a web server, iTIS-PseTNC is freely accessible at http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/server/iTIS-PseTNC. To maximize the convenience of the vast majority of experimental scientists, a step-by-step guide is provided on how to use the web server to obtain the desired results without the need to go through detailed mathematical equations, which are presented in this paper just for the integrity of the new prection method.

   Conditions
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION

AB This work presents an in-depth analysis of machine translations of morphologically-rich Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages under zero-resource conditions. It focuses on Zero-Shot Systems for these languages and leverages transfer-learning by exploiting target-side monolingual corpora and parallel translations from other languages. These systems are compared with direct translations using the BLEU and TER metrics. Further, Zero-Shot Systems are used as pre-trained models for fine-tuning with real human-generated data taken in different proportions that range from 100 sentences to the entire training set. Performances of the Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages are compared with a focus on their morphological complexity. The systems with a Dravidian source language performed much better and reached very near to the level of direct translations. This is observed likely due to morphological richness and complexity in the language, which in turn provided more room for transfer-learning in this case. A comparative analysis based on language families has been done. These systems were fine-tuned further, which in turn outperformed direct translations with just 500 parallel sentences for a Dravidian source language. However, systems with an Indo-Aryan source language showed similar performance after getting fine-tuned with 10,000 sentences.

AB In this paper, we present a novel approach to Machine Translation (MT) using syntactic Pattern Recognition (PR) methods. Our aim is to evaluate the possibility of using syntactic PR techniques in this mature field, and to identify any potential benefits that can be gleaned by such an approach. To make use of syntactic PR techniques, we propose a system that performs string-matching to pair English sentence structures to Japanese (The specific languages, namely English and Japanese, were chosen because their sentence structures are completely dissimilar. This, however, proves the point that such syntactic methods will be applicable for other pairs of languages too.) structures -as opposed to matching strings in and of themselves, and to thus facilitate translation between the languages. In order to process the sentence structures of either language as a string, we have created a representation that replaces the tokens of a sentence with their respective Part-of-Speech tags. Further, to perform the actual string-matching operation, we make use of the OptPR algorithm, a syntactic award-winning PR scheme that has been proven to achieve optimal accuracy, and that also attains the information theoretic bound. Through our experiments, we show that our implementation obtains superior results to that of a standard statistical MT system on our data set. Our results provide the additional guarantee of generating a known sentence structure in the target language. With further research, this system could be expanded to have a more complete coverage of the languages worked with. The incorporation of such PR techniques in MT, in general, and the OptPR algorithm, in particular, are both pioneering.

AB Supervised machine learning algorithms have been used extensively in different domains of machine learning like pattern recognition, data mining and machine translation. Similarly, there has been several attempts to apply the various supervised or unsupervised machine learning algorithms to the analysis of air traffic data. However, no attempts have been made to apply Gradient Boosted Decision Tree, one of the famous machine learning tools to analyse those air traffic data. This paper investigates the effectiveness of this successful paradigm in the air traffic delay prediction tasks. By combining this regression model based on the machine learning paradigm, an accurate and sturdy prediction model has been built which enables an elaborated analysis of the patterns in air traffic delays. Gradient Boosted Decision Tree has shown a great accuracy in modeling sequential data. With the help of this model, day-to-day sequences of the departure and arrival flight delays of an individual airport can be predicted efficiently. In this paper, the model has been implemented on the Passenger Flight on-time Performance data taken from U.S. Department of Transportation to predict the arrival and departure delays in flights. It shows better accuracy as compared to other methods.

TI Genetic Music System with Synthetic Biology
SO ARTIFICIAL LIFE
AB This article introduces GeMS, a system for music composition informed by synthetic biology. GeMS generates music with simulations of genetic processes, such as transcription, translation, and protein folding, with which biological systems render chains of amino acids from DNA strands. The system comprises the following components: theMiranda machine, therhythmator, and thepitch processor. The Miranda machine is an abstract Turing-machine-like processor, which manipulates a sequence of DNA symbols according to a set of programming instructions. This process generates a pool of new DNA strands, which are subsequently translated into rhythms. GeMS represents the musical equivalent of amino acids in terms of rhythms, referred to as rhythmic codons. This enables the rhythmator to convert DNA sequences into rhythmic sequences. The pitch processor generates pitches for such rhythmic sequences. It is inspired by the phenomenon of protein folding. The pitch processor considers orientation information of DNA instructions yielded by the Miranda machine in order to activate algorithms for generating pitches. A musical composition, entitledArtibiotics, for percussion ensemble and electronic instruments, is presented to demonstrate the system.

TI Discriminative restricted Boltzmann machine for invariant pattern
   recognition with linear transformations
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS
AB How to make a machine automatically achieve invariant pattern recognition like human brain is still very challenging in machine learning community. In this paper, we present a single hidden-layer network TIClassRBM for invariant pattern recognition by incorporating linear transformations into discriminative restricted Boltzmann machine. In our model, invariant feature extraction and pattern classification can be implemented simultaneously. The mapping from input features to class label is represented by two groups of weights: transformed weights that connect hidden units to data, and pooling weights that connect pooling units yielded by probabilistic max-pooling to class label. All weights play an important role in the invariant pattern recognition. Moreover, TIClassRBM can handle general transformations contained in images, such as translation, rotation and scaling. The experimental studies on the variations of MNIST and NORB datasets demonstrate that the proposed model yields the best performance among some comparative models. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB A Virtual Machine (VM) is a program running on a conventional microprocessor that emulates the binary instruction set, registers, and memory space of an idealized computing machine, a well-known example being the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Despite there being many binary Instruction Set Architectures (ISA) in existence, all share a set of core properties which have been tailored to their particular applications. An abstract model may capture these generic properties and be subsequently refined to a particular machine, providing a reusable template for development of formally proven ISAs: this is a task to which the EventB [16,181 notation is well suited. This paper describes a project to use the RODIN tool-set [24] to perform such a process, ultimately producing the MIDAS (Microprocessor Instruction and Data Abstraction System) VM, capable of running binary executables compiled From high-level languages such as C [9]. The abstract model is incrementally refined to a model capable of automatic translation to C source code, and compilation for a hardware platform using a standard compiler. A second C compiler, targeted to the VM itself, allows C programs to be executed on it.

AB Plotkin and Pretnar's effect handlers offer a versatile abstraction for modular programming with user-defined effects. Traditional deep handlers are defined by folds over computation trees. In this paper we study shallow handlers, defined instead by case splits over computation trees. We show that deep and shallow handlers can simulate one another up to specific notions of administrative reduction. We present the first formal accounts of an abstract machine for shallow handlers and a Continuation Passing Style (CPS) translation for shallow handlers taking special care to avoid memory leaks. We provide implementations in the Links web programming language and empirically verify that neither implementation introduces unwarranted memory leaks.

TI ON ACHIEVING COMPLETE FAULT COVERAGE FOR SEQUENTIAL-MACHINES
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND
   SYSTEMS
AB A method for generating tests for gate-level stuck-at faults in sequential machines is given, which is applicable when a state-table description of the machine under test is either given or extractable from the given description. A test generation procedure for faults in the state table is first described. The test generation procedure is polynomial in the size of the state table, and is complete and accurate in the following sense. For every given state-table fault, the procedure provides either a minimum-length test, or a proof that the fault is undetectable. This test generation procedure is used for generating complete test sets for stuck-at faults in a gate level implementation of the machine, by translating stuck-at faults in the gate-level implementation into faults in the state table. The translation includes modeling and extraction. Modeling consists of a simple method to select a small subset of state-table faults such that a test set for these faults yields very high coverage of stuck-at faults in the actual implementation. Extraction consists of accurate translation of stuck-at faults in the implementation into equivalent state-table faults, and can be used to derive tests for stuck-at faults which are not detected by the test set for the modeled faults. Based on the test generation algorithm developed and the modeling and extraction of stuck-at faults to translate them into state-table faults, a method to achieve 100% fault-efficiency for stuck-at faults is proposed, and experimental results for stuck-at faults are presented. Short test sequences are shown to be obtained.

TI Multilingualism in cyberspace: a practical reality?
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF INFORMATION ETHICS
AB The loss of a language is often phrased in catastrophic terms despite the evolution of languages being a quite natural process. Here we discuss language loss and language use in the digital domain. We note that while English still dominates cyberspace, other languages are growing rapidly, so it seems likely that the future will not be monolingual but multilingual. We show that efforts to mandate the use of minority languages are unlikely to be successful and can backfire. The question therefore arises of how best to handle minority languages in the digital domain. This article argues that the best, and maybe the only, solution is high-quality machine translation.

TI Analysis of Nonlinear Error Caused by Motions of Rotation Axes for
   Five-Axis Machine Tools with Orthogonal Configuration
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB Since a nonlinear relationship exists between the position coordinates of the rotation axes and components of the tool orientation, the tool will deviate from the required plane, resulting in nonlinear errors and deterioration of machining accuracy. Few attempts have been made to obtain a general formula and common rules for nonlinear error because of the existence of various kinematic structures of machine tools with orthogonal configuration. This paper analyzes the relationship between the deviation of cutter location points and motion of tool orientations. Five-axis CNC machine tools are divided into two groups according to the configuration of the two rotational joints and the home position. Motions of the tool are regarded as a combination of translation and rotation. A model for error calculation is then built. The maximum deviation of the tool with respect to the reference plane generated by the initial and the final orientation is used to quantify the magnitude of the errors. General formulas are derived and common change rules are analyzed. Finally, machining experiment is conducted to validate the theoretical analysis. The research has important implications on the selection of a particular kinematic configuration that may achieve higher accuracy for a specific machining task.

AB A large body of researchers across the globe has been moving genetically coded information and cellular processing techniques to the mathematical domain in terms of analogous variables and their equations. A recent trend has expanded this movement further into the realms of electronics. Many different attempts have been made to create electronic circuits and Boolean machines that model the internal wirings of genetic circuits. This paper presents a very well-known yet simple genetic circuit created to demonstrate bistability in the cellular system. It looks into the working of the Collins toggle switch (CTS), a synthetically created system of two repressors and their respective inducers and a reporter protein. The authors have created a finite state machine that is defined with variables analogous to the proteins in the CTS and responds to these variables in exactly the same way as the plasmids of CTS respond to the original proteins. The finite state machine analogue helps analyse the genetic circuit with greater depth and elaboration.

We explored the combination of deep encoder and shallow decoder in Transformer models via model compression and knowledge distillation. The neural machine translation decoding also benefits from FP16 inference, attention caching, dynamic batching, and batch pruning. Our systems achieve promising results in both translation quality and efficiency, e.g., our fastest system can translate more than 40,000 tokens per second with an RTX 2080 Ti while maintaining 42.9 BLEU on newstest2018.

Translation of programs' CISC object code into optimized RISC object code is a migration path that is easy, gives greatly improved performance, and provides all the benefits of traditional object code compatibility. These benefits include no reprogramming, no retraining, fast time to market, and debugging of optimized programs as if they were still running on the CISC platform. This paper shares our experience in implementing this migration scheme, with measurements of the resulting performance and code size.

TI A Human Machine Hybrid Approach for Systematic Reviews and Maps in
   International Development and Social Impact Sectors
SO FORESTS
AB The international development and social impact evidence community is divided about the use of machine-centered approaches in carrying out systematic reviews and maps. While some researchers argue that machine-centered approaches such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, text mining, automated semantic analysis, and translation bots are superior to human-centered ones, others claim the opposite. We argue that a hybrid approach combining machine and human-centered elements can have higher effectiveness, efficiency, and societal relevance than either approach can achieve alone. We present how combining lexical databases with dictionaries from crowdsourced literature, using full texts instead of titles, abstracts, and keywords. Using metadata sets can significantly improve the current practices of systematic reviews and maps. Since the use of machine-centered approaches in forestry and forestry-related reviews and maps are rare, the gains in effectiveness, efficiency, and relevance can be very high for the evidence base in forestry. We also argue that the benefits from our hybrid approach will increase in time as digital literacy and better ontologies improve globally.

TI Argument Mining in the October 1, 2017 Referendum
SO PROCESAMIENTO DEL LENGUAJE NATURAL
AB Argument mining allows, through software tools, to obtain which are the arguments expressed by the authors in a given text. This article aims to make an analysis of the arguments expressed by users on Twitter in relation to the referendum of October 1, 2017 using the MultiStanceCat dataset provided in the shared task organized at IberEval 2018. Since the tools of argumentation mining work mostly in English, it was necessary to build a neural translation system with post-editing that allows to translate of tweets from Spanish and Catalan to English. The results of argumentation mining on the translated tweets have shown to obtain a minimum percentage of argumentation in all the communities.

AB Recent research has shown that a balanced harmonic mean (F1 measure) of unigram precision and recall outperforms the widely used BLEU and NIST metrics for Machine Translation evaluation in terms of correlation with human judgments of translation quality. We show that significantly better correlations can be achieved by placing more weight on recall than on precision. While this may seem unexpected, since BLEU and NIST focus on n-gram precision and disregard recall, our experiments show that correlation with human judgments is highest when almost all of the weight is assigned to recall. We also show that stemming is significantly beneficial not just to simpler unigram precision and recall based metrics, but also to BLEU and NIST.

TI Representation of propositional expert systems as partial functions
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Propositional expert systems classify cases, and can be built in several different forms, including production rules, decision tables and decision trees. These forms are inter-translatable, but the translations are much larger than the originals, often unmanageably large. In this paper a method of controlling the size problem is demonstrated, based on induced partial functional dependencies, which makes the translations practical in a principled way. The set of dependencies can also be used to filter cases to be classified, eliminating spurious cases, and cases for which the classification is likely to be of doubtful validity.

TI A real-time virtual machine for task placement in loosely-coupled
   computer systems
SO HELIYON
AB Nowadays, virtualization and real-time systems are increasingly relevant. Real-time virtual machines are adequate for closely-coupled computer systems, execute tasks from associated language only and re-target tasks to the new platform at runtime. Complex systems in space, avionics, and military applications usually operate with Loosely-Coupled Computer Systems in a real-time environment for years. In this paper, a new approach is introduced to support task transfer between loosely-coupled computers in a real-time environment to add more features without software upgrading. The approach is based on automatic source code transformation into a platform-independent "Structured Byte-Code" (SBC) and a real-time virtual machine (SBC-RVM). Unlike Ordinary virtual machines which virtualize a specific processor for a specific code only, SBC-RVM transforms source code from any language with a known grammar into SBC without re-targeting the new platform. SBC-RVM executes local or placed tasks and preserving real-time constraints and adequate for Loosely-coupled computer systems.

First, a morphological processor is presented which is built on the basis of a linguistic analysis of Greek inflected forms. This is followed by a discussion of how stress applies to words and how stress shift phenomena are taken into account by the morphological processor. In Greek, word stress distribution is important because it represents a major difficulty in every attempt to create a morphological processor which can be used by speech recognition systems, machine readable dictionaries, and machine translation projects involving Greek as source or target language.

Proposed algorithm reduces the search problem from 2D into 1D using edge projection within the 2D template area. By this, it could effectively reduce the computational burden. Also, it gives comparable discriminating power compared to template matching using intensity. In this paper, rotation and translation search is implemented to cope with typical machine vision application where the height between camera and target object is fixed.

Our verification flow starts from a cycle accurate finite state machine for the RAVEN model checker. We present a translation, which transforms the model into efficient B language code. After refining the RAVEN model and annotating it, the time accurate model is also translated to B so that the B theorem prover can verify the refined model almost automatically. The approach is introduced by the example of a mobile phone echo cancellation unit.

Third, a translation test is performed under optical microscopy and SEM using the slide machine. Then a displacement field calculation is performed using the proposed image analysis method. The results show that the proposed method is adequate for the application of DIG to SEM images.

The algorithm utilizes the translation invariant property of UDWT. To discriminate the real defects and pseudo defects, we use support vector machine (SVM). The total 14 feature attributes are extracted from binary and gray image. To select best model for SVM classier, we search the parameter spaces by exponentially growing sampling test. The experimental results show the proposed methods can be applied to real-world application.

AB Training models for the automatic correction of machine-translated text usually relies on data consisting of (source, MT, human post-edit) triplets providing, for each source sentence, examples of translation errors with the corresponding corrections made by a human post-editor. Ideally, a large amount of data of this kind should allow the model to learn reliable correction patterns and effectively apply them at test stage on unseen (source, MT) pairs. In practice, however, their limited availability calls for solutions that also integrate in the training process other sources of knowledge. Along this direction, state-of-the-art results have been recently achieved by systems that, in addition to a limited amount of available training data, exploit artificial corpora that approximate elements of the "gold" training instances with automatic translations. Following this idea, we present eSCAPE, the largest freely-available Synthetic Corpus for Automatic Post-Editing released so far. eSCAPE consists of millions of entries in which the MT element of the training triplets has been obtained by translating the source side of publicly-available parallel corpora, and using the target side as an artificial human post-edit. Translations are obtained both with phrase-based and neural models. For each MT paradigm, eSCAPE contains 7.2 million triplets for English-German and 3.3 millions for English-Italian, resulting in a total of 14,4 and 6,6 million instances respectively. The usefulness of eSCAPE is proved through experiments in a general-domain scenario, the most challenging one for automatic post-editing. For both language directions, the models trained on our artificial data always improve MT quality with statistically significant gains. The current version of eSCAPE can be freely downloaded from: http://hltshare.fbk.eu/QT21/eSCAPE.html.

TI Active and machine learning-based approaches to rapidly enhance
   microbial chemical production
SO METABOLIC ENGINEERING
AB In order to make renewable fuels and chemicals from microbes, new methods are required to engineer microbes more intelligently. Computational approaches, to engineer strains for enhanced chemical production typically rely on detailed mechanistic models (e.g., kinetic/stoichiometric models of metabolism)-requiring many experimental datasets for their parameterization-while experimental methods may require screening large mutant libraries to explore the design space for the few mutants with desired behaviors. To address these limitations, we developed an active and machine learning approach (ActiveOpt) to intelligently guide experiments to arrive at an optimal phenotype with minimal measured datasets. ActiveOpt was applied to two separate case studies to evaluate its potential to increase valine yields and neurosporene productivity in Escherichia coli. In both the cases, ActiveOpt identified the best performing strain in fewer experiments than the case studies used. This work demonstrates that machine and active learning approaches have the potential to greatly facilitate metabolic engineering efforts to rapidly achieve its objectives.

AB Machine reading comprehension (MRC) has recently reached human-level accuracy on resource-rich languages (e.g. English). However, for low-resource MRC, there is a huge gap between machine and human performance due to limited annotated data. To narrow this gap, we investigate three strategies, namely data augmentation via translation, multilingual training and cross-lingual fine-tuning, to improve low-resource MRC via knowledge transfer. Experiments on a small Chinese MRC dataset (CMRC2018), demonstrate that our strategies are capable of leveraging knowledge from the English SQuAD dataset. Furthermore, the combination of the three strategies achieves significant improvements on the DRCD (the Delta Reading Comprehension Dataset).

AB A path planning method based on machine vision techniques is constructed for a golf-club head robotic welding system. This system uses 3D machine vision techniques to recognize the weldseam and generates a welding path for the robot. The location of the weldseam is discovered by applying a Sobel mask to the captured data. A Laplace mask is also useful to filter out the noise points due to the scatter light refraction of tack-welding spots. The weldseam is then replenished and smoothed out by a B-spline curve fitting. The task frame of the weldseam is computed by finding the tangent, normal, and bi-normal of the curve. The robotic welding path is obtained by further rotations and translation along the axes of the task frame according to the requirement of the welding attitude. The developed machine vision technique and the mathematic framework pertaining to the generation of a welding task frame can readily be used for various three-dimensional welding tasks.

AB This paper focuses on the word sense disambiguation (WSD) problem in the context of Urdu language. Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is a phenomena for disambiguating the text so that machine (computer) would be capable to deduce correct sense of individual given word(s). WSD is critical for solving natural language engineering (NLE) tasks such as machine translation and speech processing etc. It also increase the performance of other tasks such as text retrieval, document classification and document clustering etc. Research work in WSD has been conducted up to different extents in computationally developed languages of the world. In the context of Urdu language the NLE research in general and the WSD research in particular is still in the infancy stage due to the rich morphological structure of Urdu. In this paper, we use machine learning (ML) approaches such as Bayes net classifier (BN), support vector machine (SVM) and decision tree (DT) for WSD in native script Urdu text. The results shown that BN has better F-measure than SVM and DT. The maximum F-measure of 0.711 over 2.5 million words raw Urdu corpus was recorded for the Bayes net classifier.

TI Virtual machine showdown: Stack versus registers
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ARCHITECTURE AND CODE OPTIMIZATION
AB Virtual machines (VMs) enable the distribution of programs in an architecture-neutral format, which can easily be interpreted or compiled. A long-running question in the design of VMs is whether a stack architecture or register architecture can be implemented more efficiently with an interpreter. We extend existing work on comparing virtual stack and virtual register architectures in three ways. First, our translation from stack to register code and optimization are much more sophisticated. The result is that we eliminate an average of more than 46% of executed VM instructions, with the bytecode size of the register machine being only 26% larger than that of the corresponding stack one. Second, we present a fully functional virtual-register implementation of the Java virtual machine (JVM), which supports Intel, AMD64, PowerPC and Alpha processors. This register VM supports inline-threaded, direct-threaded, token-threaded, and switch dispatch. Third, we present experimental results on a range of additional optimizations such as register allocation and elimination of redundant heap loads. On the AMD64 architecture the register machine using switch dispatch achieves an average speedup of 1.48 over the corresponding stack machine. Even using the more efficient inline-threaded dispatch, the register VM achieves a speedup of 1.15 over the equivalent stack-based VM.

AB New applications continue to emerge to control not only linear motion but also rotational motion in high accuracy manufacturing fields. Many five axis-controlled machining centers are therefore in use. On the other hand, a five-axis control machining center, which controls the motion of three translation axes and two rotary axes, has also been put into wide practical use. However, one problem has surfaced; it is difficult to measure the synchronous accuracy of two rotary axes without a high accuracy gyro sensor. In the present report, we proposed a novel method to measure the synchronous accuracy of two rotary axes of a machine tool table that keeps a ball rolling around a circular path on the working plate by dual-arm cooperative control. We investigated the influence of each axis motion error on the ball-rolling path and demonstrated that this method could estimate the synchronous accuracy of two rotary axes of the machine tool table.

AB A structure scheme for a novel hybrid machine tool (HMT) is proposed in this paper. In the scheme, a 4-DOFs 1 PS + 3 TPS type spatial hybrid mechanism is utilized as main feed mechanism, with assistance of a two direction movable work-table, multi-coordinates NC machining can be realized. In the main feed mechanism, fixed platform is connected with moving platform by three TPS driving links and one PS driving link, one translation DOF and three rotation DOFs can be achieved by it. This type HMT enjoys some advantages over its conventional counterparts: large workspace, good dexterity, etc. Closed form inverse displacement analysis model and inverse kinematic model for main feed mechanism are established. A fuzzy PID control scheme for machining control of HMTs with high tracking precision is proposed aiming at highly. nonlinear, tightly coupled and uncertain characteristic of HMTs. Simulation researches for fuzzy PID control of HMTs are carried out. Simulation Results demonstrate the effectiveness and the Robostness of the fuzzy PID controller.

AB In this paper, a novel translator calculation method for the multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA) is proposed based on a machine learning approach. The generalized regression neural networks are introduced to fit the translation function of MLFMA during the procedure of eletromagnetic scattering analysis. Compared to the traditional method, the new method inherits advantages of the generalized regression neural networks (GRNN) and can approximate the translator with high accuracy simultaneously. As an example, a two-level 21) NILENIA for a perfect electrically conductor (PEC) is finally implemented and the translators are reconstructed by using the proposed model. The numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Computer-Aided Manufacturing technology has been widely used for three-axis CNC machining in industry for many years. However, there still have some problems on five-axis machining applications. The major problems are overcut, interference, and trajectory error due to coordinated rotating and translating motions. Therefore, to develop more accurate and efficient five-axis tool-path planning is an important need for CNC machining industry. This research proposes a new method to produce accurate tool paths and orientations for 5-axis machining. The research approach begins with the analysis of the contour error due to the combinational motion of rotation and translation. The tool path feed step and tool orientation can be controlled accurately according to the determined trajectory error. Taking a part for example, the result shows that the trajectory contour error is improved about 5 times, from 0.153 mm to 0.031 mm, by using conventional method and our proposed approach, respectively. The new method improves not only the max. contour error, but part surface smoothness.

TI Evaluation of Commercially Available Machine Interpretation Applications
   for Simple Clinical Communication
SO JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB BackgroundAccessing professional medical interpreters for brief, low risk exchanges can be challenging. Machine translation (MT) for verbal communication has the potential to be a useful clinical tool, but few evaluations exist.ObjectiveWe evaluated the quality of three MT applications for English-Spanish and English-Mandarin two-way interpretation of low complexity brief clinical communication compared with human interpretation.DesignAudio-taped phrases were interpreted via human and 3 MT applications. Bilingual assessors evaluated the quality of MT interpretation on four assessment categories (accuracy, fluency, meaning, and clinical risk) using 5-point Likert scales. We used a non-inferiority design with 15% inferiority margin to evaluate the quality of three MT applications with professional medical interpreters serving as gold standards.Main MeasuresProportion of interpretation exchanges deemed acceptable, defined as a composite score of 16 or greater out of 20 based on the four assessment categories.Key ResultsFor English to Spanish, the proportion of MT-interpreted phrases scored as acceptable ranged from 0.68 to 0.84, while for English to Mandarin, the range was from 0.62 to 0.76. Both Spanish/Mandarin to English MT interpretation had low acceptable scores (range 0.36 to 0.41). No MT interpretation met the non-inferiority threshold.ConclusionWhile MT interpretation was better for English to Spanish or Mandarin than the reverse, the overall quality of MT interpretation was poor for two-way clinical communication. Clinicians should advocate for easier access to professional interpretation in all clinical spaces and defer use of MT until these applications improve.

TI On the gait control of a six-legged walking machine
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE
AB The paper reviews the main strategies for the leg co-ordination of a six-legged walking machine. A 'free gait' algorithm is presented which allows a smooth and stable motion for an arbitrary velocity vector of the vehicle, including a rotation about the vertical axis. It consists of a rule-based central decision process, based on the analysis of a six component vector called 'leg phase state'. The co-ordination strategy consists of preventing gait states where two neighbouring legs are lifted simultaneously. it is shown that, for a uniform translation with no spin, the free gait algorithm is optimal with respect to static stability.

AB Using a metric feature space for pattern recognition, data mining, and machine learning greatly simplifies the mathematics because distances are preserved under rotation and translation in feature space. A metric space also provides a "ruler", or absolute measure of how different two feature vectors are. In the computer vision community color can easily be miss-treated as a metric distance. This paper serves as an introduction to why using a non-metric space is a challenge, and provides details of why color is not a valid Euclidean distance metric.

SO NATURAL COMPUTING
AB In this paper we consider three variants of accepting networks of evolutionary processors. It is known that two of them are equivalent to Turing machines. We propose here a direct simulation of one device by the other. Each computational step in one model is simulated in a constant number of computational steps in the other one while a translation via Turing machines squares the time complexity. We also discuss the possibility of constructing simulations that preserve not only complexity, but also the shape of the simulated network.

AB Semantic similarity plays an important role in a number of applications including information extraction, information retrieval, document clustering and ontology learning. Most work has concentrated on English and other European languages. However, for the Thai language, there has been no research about word semantic similarity. This paper presents an experiment and benchmark data sets investigating the application of a WordNet-based machine measure to Thai similarity. Because there is no functioning Thai WordNet we also investigate the use of English WordNet with machine translation of Thai words.

AB Influenced by the grammatical system of western languages, there are more and more syntactic structures in modern Chinese that can be translated into English attributive clauses. But for the great differences of the syntactic structures, parsing Chinese by western grammatical rules usually does not lead to satisfactory results, which will result in poor translation performance in complex syntactic structures. This paper first attempts to recognize the attributive clauses by using conditional random fields ("CRFs") theory by selecting representative features combined with grammatical information unique in Chinese language. The experiment proves that this method will produce a better result than simply by statistical machine translation method.

TI RELATING THE IMPLEMENTATION TECHNIQUES OF FUNCTIONAL AND FUNCTIONAL
   LOGIC LANGUAGES
SO NEW GENERATION COMPUTING
AB Functional logic languages are declarative programming languages that integrate the programming paradigms of functional and logic languages within a single framework. They are extensions of functional languages with principles derived from logic programming. Narrowing, the evaluation mechanism of functional logic languages, can be defined as a generalization of reduction, the evaluation mechanism of purely functional languages. The unidirectional pattern matching, which is used for parameter passing in functional languages, is simply replaced by the bidirectional unification known from logic programming languages.
   We show in this paper, how to extend a reduction machine, that has been designed for the evaluation of purely functional programs to a machine that performs narrowing. The necessary extensions concern the realization of unification and backtracking, for which we fall back upon the methods of Warren's Prolog engine.21) The narrowing machine embodies an optimized treatment of deterministic computations. A complete specification of the reduction and the narrowing machine and of the translation of a sample language into abstract machine code is given. Comparative results of a C-implementation of the reduction and the narrowing machine show that the time overhead of the more complex narrowing evaluation is, in general, less than 10% of the reduction evaluation.

We are moving from rule-based systems to corpus-oriented paradigms. In this paper, we analyze several generative formalisms together with newer statistical and data-oriented linguistic methodologies. We review existing methods belonging to deep or shallow learning applied in various subfields of computational linguistics. The continuous, fast improvements obtained by practical, applied machine learning techniques may lead us to new theoretical developments in the classic models as well. We discuss several scenarios for future approaches.

AB In this paper, we present a new image compression algorithm which combines Wavelet Support Vector Machines (WSVM) learning with the wavelet transform. Based on the characteristic of wavelet transform, Daubechies 9/7 wavelet has been used to transform the image and the wavelet coefficients are trained with WSVM using translation-invariant wavelet kernels. Compression is achieved by using WSVM learning to approximate wavelet coefficients with the predefined level of accuracy. A minimal number of coefficients (support vectors) are then encoded by an effective entropy coder based on run-length and arithmetic coding. Experimental results show that the proposed method gains better performance than that of existing compression algorithm.

AB Petri nets have long been known as a readable and powerful graphical modelling language. In particular, Petri nets also allow the creation of high-level models of embedded controllers. These models can be translated to executable code. This possibility is already available in some tools including the IOPT Tools. Another possibility is to translate the Petri net model into a state machine, which can then be easily executed by an even larger number of platforms for cyber-physical systems. In that sense, this paper presents a tool that is able to generate a state machine from a non-autonomous class of Petri supported by the IOPT Tools framework (which is publicly available). These state machines would be too large to be manually generated, but can now be automatically created, simulated, and verified using an higher-level modelling language. The state machines can then be used for execution or even as input for additional verification tools. This paper presents the translation algorithm and an illustrative example.

AB Amazing progress in machine-learning, largely based on deep neural networks, has started to make applications once considered impossible, such as real-time translation or self-driving cars, a reality. However, even if, on some restricted problems, machine-learning is getting close to human-level performance, we are still far from the capabilities of the human brain. Machine-learning researchers themselves acknowledge that the progress observed in the past 10 years has been largely due to rapid increase in computing performance, allowing to tackle larger neural networks and larger training sets. So the computer systems and circuits communities can play a very significant role in enabling future progress. While GPUs have been a major driver of this recent progress, both the slowing rate of improvement of standard CMOS technology and the need for even faster progress suggest to at least explore alternative approaches. In this talk, we will discuss lessons learned from research on architectures for machine-learning, and that some of the hurdles ahead largely lie at the circuit level, but can possibly be overcome in the near future.

The proposed new mechanism is based on IVI technology which is a stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation technique developed by China Education and Research Network. And the key idea is to migrate IVI hardware to virtual server and modify neutron network system in virtual network in data center. Eventually the mechanism can be applied in our OpenStack environment.

At first we have processed English words using a rule based approach which extracts individual phonemes from the words and then we have applied statistical approach which converts the English into its equivalent Hindi phoneme and in turn the corresponding Hindi word. Through this approach we have attained 83.40% accuracy.

AB Machine transliteration is required in machine translation to transliterate words which are not present in dictionary such as names of persons, locations, cities and villages, names of roads and building etc. It is noticed that the machine transliteration is less studied for the language pair Marathi-English. Most of the present research in this area is done by using linguistic rule based and grapheme/phoneme based statistical approaches with the help of machine learning tools. This paper proposes Marathi to English forward machine transliteration of named entities of Indian-origin using hybrid approach which is the combination of linguistic rules and metrical approach. Proposed rule-based transliteration method uses phoneme model of the machine transliteration which uses the phonetic mapping between the source language Marathi written using Devanagari script and target language English written using Roman script. The key concept of this method is schwa deletion based on the stress of syllable after phonetic mapping. This approach requires full consonant based input and uses syllable based metrical approach for schwa deletion. Metrical approach works on stress of syllable whether it is unstressed or stressed in the given named entity. The experimental result showed that the absolute performance of the proposed method is high as compare to existing grapheme based approaches.

TI Pseudocode Generation from Source Code Using the BART Model
SO MATHEMATICS
AB In the software development process, more than one developer may work on developing the same program and bugs in the program may be fixed by a different developer; therefore, understanding the source code is an important issue. Pseudocode plays an important role in solving this problem, as it helps the developer to understand the source code. Recently, transformer-based pre-trained models achieved remarkable results in machine translation, which is similar to pseudocode generation. In this paper, we propose a novel automatic pseudocode generation from the source code based on a pre-trained Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer (BART) model. We fine-tuned two pre-trained BART models (i.e., large and base) using a dataset containing source code and its equivalent pseudocode. In addition, two benchmark datasets (i.e., Django and SPoC) were used to evaluate the proposed model. The proposed model based on the BART large model outperforms other state-of-the-art models in terms of BLEU measurement by 15% and 27% for Django and SPoC datasets, respectively.

AB Scheduled sampling is widely used to mitigate the exposure bias problem for neural machine translation. Its core motivation is to simulate the inference scene during training by replacing ground-truth tokens with predicted tokens, thus bridging the gap between training and inference. However, vanilla scheduled sampling is merely based on training steps and equally treats all decoding steps. Namely, it simulates an inference scene with uniform error rates, which disobeys the real inference scene, where larger decoding steps usually have higher error rates due to error accumulations. To alleviate the above discrepancy, we propose scheduled sampling methods based on decoding steps, increasing the selection chance of predicted tokens with the growth of decoding steps. Consequently, we can more realistically simulate the inference scene during training, thus better bridging the gap between training and inference. Moreover, we investigate scheduled sampling based on both training steps and decoding steps for further improvements. Experimentally, our approaches significantly outperform the Transformer baseline and vanilla scheduled sampling on three large-scale WMT tasks. Additionally, our approaches also generalize well to the text summarization task on two popular benchmarks.

AB Irregular computing significantly influences the performance of large scale parallel applications. How to generate local memory access sequence and communication set efficiently for irregular parallel application is an important issue in compiling a data parallel language into a Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) code for distributed-memory machines. In this paper we propose a hybrid approach, which combines the advantages of the algebra method and the integer lattice method. Our approach derives an algebraic solution of communication set enumeration at compile time for the situation of irregular array references in nested loops. Based on the integer lattice, we develop our method for global-to-local and local-to-global index translations in the case of alignment and cyclic (k) distribution. Then, we present our algorithm for the corresponding SPMD code generation, which adopts some communication optimization techniques. In our method, when parameters are known, the communication set generation, the global-to-local and local-to-global index translations, and the SPMD code generation can be completed at compile time without inspector phase of run time.

AB This paper describes the tool csp2B which provides a means of combining CSP-like descriptions with standard B specifications. The notation of CSP provides a convenient way of describing the order in which the operations of a B machine may occur. The function of the tool is to convert CSP-like specifications into standard machine-readable B specifications which means that they may be animated and appropriate proof obligations may be generated. Use of csp2B means that abstract specifications and refinements may be specified purely using CSP or using a combination of CSP and B. The translation is justified in terms of an operational semantics.

AB Cavitation-induced surface erosion has been studied for decades. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) enables localized erosion, with applications in many fields. However, no research has been published on machining solely with HIFU. Compared to existing micro-machining technologies, HIFU exhibits a unique set of benefits: inexpensive, minimal maintenance due to non-contact machining without slurry, mitigated chemical load, and monitoring capability. We demonstrate controlled surface machining of mirror-polished aluminium (AW-5754) using high-frequency (12 MHz) HIFU-induced cavitation erosion. Optimal sonication parameters (transducer-sample distance, amplitude, cycles per burst, number of bursts, and pulse repetition frequency) for stationary surface erosion were first identified experimentally. These parameters served as a basis for studying the effect of sonication parameters during on-the-fly erosion, i.e., engraving lines. The effect of stage translation velocity and the number of repeated passes across the engraved line were also studied. Subsequently, the acronym of our laboratory, "ETLA", was engraved, with a 500 mu m letter height and an average line width of 53 mu m.

AB As the number of Internet and mobile phone users grow, texting and chatting have become popular means of communication. Reaching new heights, the extensive use of cellphones and Internet led into the creation of a new language, where words are transformed and made shorter using various styles. Shortcut texting is used in informal venues such as SMS, online, chat rooms, forums and posts in social networks. Huge amounts of data originating from these informal sources can be utilized for various tasks in machine learning and data analytics. As these data may be written in shortcut forms, text normalization is necessary before NLP actions such as information extraction, data mining, text summarization, opinion classification, and even bilingual translations can be fully achieved, by acting as a preprocessing stage that transforms all informal texts back to their original and more understandable forms. This paper is about NormAPI, an API for normalizing Filipino shortcut texts. NormAPI primarily intends to be used as a preprocessing system that corrects informalities in shortcut texts before they are handed for complete data processing.

TI Machine Translation Evaluation Metric Based on Dependency Parsing Model
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB Most of the syntax-based metrics obtain the similarity by comparing the sub-structures extracted from the trees of hypothesis and reference. These sub-structures cannot represent all the information in the trees because their lengths are limited. To sufficiently use the reference syntax information, a new automatic evaluation metric is proposed based on the dependency parsing model. First, a dependency parsing model is trained using the reference dependency tree for each sentence. Then, the hypothesis is parsed by this dependency parsing model and the corresponding hypothesis dependency tree is generated. The quality of hypothesis can be judged by the quality of the hypothesis dependency tree. Unigram F-score is included in the new metric so that lexicon similarity is obtained. According to experimental results, the proposed metric can perform better than METEOR and BLEU on system level and get comparable results with METEOR on sentence level. To further improve the performance, we also propose a combined metric which gets the best performance on the sentence level and on the system level.

AB In this study, we first investigate a novel capsule network with dynamic routing for linear time Neural Machine Translation (NMT), referred as CAPSNMT. CAPSNMT uses an aggregation mechanism to map the source sentence into a matrix with pre-determined size, and then applys a deep LSTM network to decode the target sequence from the source representation. Different from the previous work (Sutskever et al., 2014) to store the source sentence with a passive and bottom-up way, the dynamic routing policy encodes the source sentence with an iterative process to decide the credit attribution between nodes from lower and higher layers. CAPSNMT has two core properties: it runs in time that is linear in the length of the sequences and provides a more flexible way to aggregate the part-whole information of the source sentence. On WMT14 English-German task and a larger WMT14 English-French task, CAPSNMT achieves comparable results with the Transformer system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that capsule networks have been empirically investigated for sequence to sequence problems.(1)

TI A Novel Character Segmentation Method for Text Images Captured by
   Cameras
SO ETRI JOURNAL
AB Due to the rapid development of mobile devices equipped with cameras, instant translation of any text seen in any context is possible. Mobile devices can serve as a translation tool by recognizing the texts presented in the captured scenes. Images captured by cameras will embed more external or unwanted effects which need not to be considered in traditional optical character recognition (OCR). In this paper, we segment a text image captured by mobile devices into individual single characters to facilitate OCR kernel processing. Before proceeding with character segmentation, text detection and text line construction need to be performed in advance. A novel character segmentation method which integrates touched character filters is employed on text images captured by cameras. In addition, periphery features are extracted from the segmented images of touched characters and fed as inputs to support vector machines to calculate the confident values. In our experiment, the accuracy rate of the proposed character segmentation system is 94.90%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI GlobalMind: Automated analysis of cultural contexts with multicultural
   common-sense computing
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON SEMANTIC WEB AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB The need for more effective communication between people of different countries has increased as travel and communications bring more of the world people together Communication is often difficult because of both language differences and cultural differences. Attempts to bridge these differences include many attempts to perform machine translation or provide language resources such as dictionaries or phrase books; however, many problems related to cultural and conceptual differences still remain. Automated mechanisms to analyze cultural similarities and differences might be used to improve traditional machine translators and as aids to cross-cultural communication. This article presents an approach to automatically compute cultural differences by comparing databases of common-sense knowledge in different languages and cultures. Global Mind provides an interface for acquiring databases of common-sense knowledge from users who speak different languages. It implements inference modules to compute the cultural similarities and differences between these databases. In this article, the design of the GlobalMind databases, the implementation of its inference modules, as well as an evaluation of GlobalMind are described.

TI The universal configurable block/machine - An approach for a
   configurable SoC-architecture
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
AB The universal configurable block/machine is a block-based approach for a configurable system-on-chip-( CSoC-) architecture. The programming model of the blocks is similar to microprocessor models, while the execution model supports con. gurable computing including reconfiguration. This is achieved by the microarchitecture of the blocks and an additional translation phase, resulting in three phases of overall program execution: fetching, translation and execution. These phases may act without strict coupling, simplifying the duplication of the executing part. The resulting hardware model is classified by four parameter: number of blocks, hyperblock sequencer, hyperblock scheduler and a set of block interconnections. The scheduler indicates that the model is capable of executing operating system work by scheduling hardware resources to threads or processes. This homogeneous CSoC may be used as compile-time defined inhomogeneous application-specific architecture. In this case the development process defines threads to run completely in one or more blocks solving partial problems and communicating to others. This enhances the flexibility and the optimization capabilities towards performance and/or real-time behavior.

AB We describe a model of object recognition as machine translation. In this model, recognition is a process of annotating image regions with words. Firstly, images are segmented into regions, which are classified into region types using a variety of features. A mapping between region types and keywords supplied with the images, is then learned, using a method based around EM. This process is analogous with learning a lexicon from an aligned bitext. For the implementation we describe, these words are nouns taken from a large vocabulary. On a large test set, the method can predict numerous words with high accuracy. Simple methods identify words that cannot be predicted well. We show how to cluster words that individually are difficult to predict into clusters that can be predicted well-for example, we cannot predict the distinction between train and locomotive using the current set of features, but we can predict the underlying concept. The method is trained on a substantial collection of images. Extensive experimental results illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the approach.

AB In this paper, we reproduce some of the experiments related to neural network training for Machine Translation as reported in (Vanmassenhove and Way, 2018). They annotated a sample from the EN-FR and EN-DE Europarl aligned corpora with syntactic and semantic annotations to train neural networks with the Nematus Neural Machine Translation (NMT) toolkit. Following the original publication, we obtained lower BLEU scores than the authors of the original paper, but on a more limited set of annotations. In the second half of the paper, we try to analyze the difference in the results obtained and suggest some methods to improve the results. We discuss the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) used in the pre-processing phase and suggest feature ablation in relation to the granularity of syntactic and semantic annotations. The learnability of the annotated input is discussed in relation to existing resources for the target languages. We also discuss the feature representation likely to have been adopted for combining features.

AB Thanks to today's technologies, the world's borders have been fading away and intercultural collaboration has become easier and easier. Language and cultural differences are common problems in intercultural collaboration. Machine translation (MT) is now available to overcome the language barrier, so people can easily express and understand messages in different languages. However, misunderstandings often plague users from different cultures, especially in MT-mediated communication. To communicate productively, it is important to avoid such misunderstandings. One existing work proposed the idea of using automated cultural difference detection to warn the users of misunderstanding. However, no study has examined how such warnings affect the communication. To eliminate this gap, we conduct a controlled experiment on how users react to the warnings and what are the results in terms of communication. The results show that, with the data from cultural difference detection, warning the user of cultural misunderstanding can help reduce misunderstandings and increase awareness of cultural differences. The results of this experiment confirm the effectiveness of cultural misunderstanding alerts and suggest new directions in multilingual chat design.

AB In this paper, we present the first results of the project AMIS (Access Multilingual Information opinionS) funded by Chist-Era. The main goal of this project is to understand the content of a video in a foreign language. In this work, we consider the understanding process, such as the aptitude to capture the most important ideas contained in a media expressed in a foreign language. In other words, the understanding will be approached by the global meaning of the content of a support and not by the meaning of each fragment of a video.
   Several stumbling points remain before reaching the fixed goal. They concern the following aspects: Video summarization, Speech recognition, Machine translation and Speech segmentation. All these issues will be discussed and the methods used to develop each of these components will be presented. A first implementation is achieved and each component of this system is evaluated on a representative test data. We propose also a protocol for a global subjective evaluation of AMIS.

AB Pre-trained sequence-to-sequence models have significantly improved Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Different from prior works where pre-trained models usually adopt an unidirectional decoder, this paper demonstrates that pre-training a sequence-to-sequence model but with a bidirectional decoder can produce notable performance gains for both Autoregressive and Non-autoregressive NMT. Specifically, we propose CeMAT, a conditional masked language model pre-trained on large-scale bilingual and monolingual corpora in many languages.(1) We also introduce two simple but effective methods to enhance the CeMAT, aligned code-switching & masking and dynamic dual-masking. We conduct extensive experiments and show that our CeMAT can achieve significant performance improvement for all scenarios from low- to extremely high-resource languages, i.e., up to +14.4 BLEU on low-resource and +7.9 BLEU on average for Autoregressive NMT. For Non-autoregressive NMT, we demonstrate it can also produce consistent performance gains, i.e., up to +5.3 BLEU. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to pre-train a unified model for fine-tuning on both NMT tasks.

AB The Entity Linking (EL) task identifies entity mentions in a text corpus and associates them with corresponding entities in a given knowledge base. While traditional EL approaches have largely focused on English texts, current trends are towards language-agnostic or otherwise multilingual approaches that can perform EL over texts in many languages. One of the obstacles to ongoing research on multilingual EL is a scarcity of annotated datasets with the same text in different languages. In this work we thus propose VoxEL: a manually-annotated gold standard for multilingual EL featuring the same text expressed in five European languages. We first motivate and describe the VoxEL dataset, using it to compare the behaviour of state of the art EL (multilingual) systems for five different languages, contrasting these results with those obtained using machine translation to English. Overall, our results identify how five state-of-the-art multilingual EL systems compare for various languages, how the results of different languages compare, and further suggest that machine translation of input text to English is now a competitive alternative to dedicated multilingual EL configurations.

AB Health literacy, i.e. the ability to read and understand medical text, is a relevant component of public health. Unfortunately, many medical texts are hard to grasp by the general population as they are targeted at highly-skilled professionals and use complex language and domain-specific terms. Here, automatic text simplification making text commonly understandable would be very beneficial. However, research and development into medical text simplification is hindered by the lack of openly available training and test corpora which contain complex medical sentences and their aligned simplified versions. In this paper, we introduce such a dataset to aid medical text simplification research. The dataset is created by filtering aligned health sentences using expert knowledge from an existing aligned corpus and a novel simple, language independent monolingual text alignment method. Furthermore, we use the dataset to train a state-of-the-art neural machine translation model, and compare it to a model trained on a general simplification dataset using an automatic evaluation, and an extensive human-expert evaluation.

AB We seek to understand how the representations of individual tokens and the structure of the learned feature space evolve between layers in deep neural networks under different learning objectives. We focus on the Transformers for our analysis as they have been shown effective on various tasks, including machine translation (MT), standard left-to-right language models (LM) and masked language modeling (MLM). Previous work used black-box probing tasks to show that the representations learned by the Transformer differ significantly depending on the objective. In this work, we use canonical correlation analysis and mutual information estimators to study how information flows across Transformer layers and how this process depends on the choice of learning objective. For example, as you go from bottom to top layers, information about the past in left-to-right language models gets vanished and predictions about the future get formed. In contrast, for MLM, representations initially acquire information about the context around the token, partially forgetting the token identity and producing a more generalized token representation. The token identity then gets recreated at the top MLM layers.

AB Word alignment is a basic task in natural language processing and it usually serves as the starting point when building a modern statistical machine translation system. However, the state-of-art parallel algorithm for word alignment is still time-consuming. In this work, we explore a parallel implementation of word alignment algorithm on Graphics Processor Unit (GPU), which has been widely available in the field of high performance computing. We use the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) programming model to re-implement a state-of-the-art word alignment algorithm, called IBM Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. A Tesla K40M card with 2880 cores is used for experiments and execution times obtained with the proposed algorithm are compared with a sequential algorithm and a multi-threads algorithm on an IBM X3850 server, which has two Intel Xeon E7 CPUs (2.0GHz * 10 cores). The best experimental results show a 16.8-fold speedup compared to the multi-threads algorithm and a 234.7-fold speedup compared to the sequential algorithm.

AB Training and testing many possible parameters or model architectures of state-of-the-art machine translation or automatic speech recognition system is a cumbersome task. They usually require a long pipeline of commands reaching from pre-processing the training data to post-processing and evaluating the output.
   This paper introduces Sisyphus, a tool that aims at managing scientific experiments in an efficient way. After defining the workflow for a given task, Sisyphus runs all required steps and ensures that all commands finish successfully. It avoids unnecessary computations by reusing tasks that are needed for multiple parts of the workflow and saves the user time by determining the order in which the tasks are to be performed. Since the program and workflow are written in Python they can be easily extended to contain arbitrary code. This makes it possible to use the rich collection of Python tools for editing, debugging, and documentation. It only has few requirements on the underlying server or cluster, and has been successfully tested in many large scale setups and can handle thousands of tasks inside the work-flow.

TI Premodern Media and Networks of Transmission in the Man of Law's Tale
SO EXEMPLARIA-MEDIEVAL EARLY MODERN THEORY
AB This essay argues that the Man of Law's Tale represents cultural and textual transmission through a network of premodern media: voices, texts, bodies, culture, human actions, and nonhuman forces. This model of transmission is rhizomatic, multivocal, and potentially transgressive, and is a practice distinct from the hegemonic, institutional, and linear trajectories of translatio studii et imperii. Drawing on theories of new media and embodied informatics while also challenging their reliance on machine technologies, this paper shows how premodern media distribute agency in the transmission of knowledge and culture during Constance's journeys of conversion between Rome, Syria, and England. The Christian culture she transmits flickers from noise to signal, suggesting that medieval cultural mobility is more fluid than the current paradigm of translation suggests. In this context, "mediation" not only expresses the relationship between a human and her machine technology, but is also a condition of life in a culture. The essay also suggests that transmission is a paradigm for the structure and poetic project of The Canterbury Tales.

TI A review on the long short-term memory model
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW
AB Long short-term memory (LSTM) has transformed both machine learning and neurocomputing fields. According to several online sources, this model has improved Google's speech recognition, greatly improved machine translations on Google Translate, and the answers of Amazon's Alexa. This neural system is also employed by Facebook, reaching over 4 billion LSTM-based translations per day as of 2017. Interestingly, recurrent neural networks had shown a rather discrete performance until LSTM showed up. One reason for the success of this recurrent network lies in its ability to handle the exploding/vanishing gradient problem, which stands as a difficult issue to be circumvented when training recurrent or very deep neural networks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review that covers LSTM's formulation and training, relevant applications reported in the literature and code resources implementing this model for a toy example.

AB Recurrent Neural Networks have lately gained a lot of popularity in language modelling tasks, especially in neural machine translation (NMT). Very recent NMT models are based on Encoder-Decoder, where a deep LSTM based encoder is used to project the source sentence to a fixed dimensional vector and then another deep LSTM decodes the target sentence from the vector. However there has been very little work on exploring architectures that have more than one layer in space (i.e. in each time step). This paper examines the effectiveness of the simple Recurrent Highway Networks (RHN) in NMT tasks. The model uses Recurrent Highway Neural Network in encoder and decoder, with attention. We also explore the reconstructor model to improve adequacy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of all three approaches on the IWSLT English-Vietnamese dataset. We see that RHN performs on par with LSTM based models and even better in some cases. We see that deep RHN models are easy to train compared to deep LSTM based models because of highway connections. The paper also investigates the effects of increasing recurrent depth in each time step.

AB Automatic program repair (APR) is crucial to improve software reliability. Recently, neural machine translation (NMT) techniques have been used to fix software bugs automatically. While promising, these approaches have two major limitations. Their search space often does not contain the correct fix, and their search strategy ignores software knowledge such as strict code syntax. Due to these limitations, existing NMT-based techniques underperform the best template-based approaches.
   We propose CURE, a new NMT-based APR technique with three major novelties. First, CURE pre-trains a programming language (PL) model on a large software codebase to learn developer-like source code before the APR task. Second, CURE designs a new code-aware search strategy that finds more correct fixes by focusing on compilable patches and patches that are close in length to the buggy code. Finally, CURE uses a subword tokenization technique to generate a smaller search space that contains more correct fixes.
   Our evaluation on two widely-used benchmarks shows that CURE correctly fixes 57 Defects4J bugs and 26 QuixBugs bugs, outperforming all existing APR techniques on both benchmarks.

TI Sentence alignment based on the text length between punctuation marks
SO INFORMATION-AN INTERNATIONAL INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL
AB Parallel corpora have become an essential resource for work in multi lingual natural language processing. Sentence aligned parallel corpora are more efficient than non-aligned parallel corpora for cross language information retrieval and machine translation applications. In this paper, we present a new approach to align sentences in bilingual parallel corpora based on the text character length between successive punctuation marks. A probabilistic score is assigned to each proposed correspondence of texts, based on the scaled difference of lengths of the two texts (in characters) and the variance of this difference. Using this score, the time required for punctuation marks matching decreased and the sentence alignment accuracy increased. Using this new approach, we could achieve an error reduction of 26.5% over length based approach when applied on English-Arabic parallel documents. The sentence alignment execution time decreased to 17% of the total time required for the combined model which uses length based approach and punctuation approach combined together. Moreover, the proposed approach result outperforms Melamed and Moore's approach results.

TI Sentence alignment using feed forward neural network
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS
AB Parallel corpora have become an essential resource for work in multi lingual natural language processing. However, sentence aligned parallel corpora are more efficient than non-aligned parallel corpora for cross language information retrieval and machine translation applications. In this paper, we present a new approach to align sentences in bilingual parallel corpora based on feed forward neural network classifier. A feature parameter vector is extracted from the text pair under consideration. This vector contains text features such as length, punctuate score, and cognate score values. A set of manually prepared training data has been assigned to train the feed forward neural network. Another set of data was used for testing. Using this new approach, we could achieve an error reduction of 60% over length based approach when applied on English-Arabic parallel documents. Moreover this new approach is valid for any language pair and it is quite flexible approach since the feature parameter vector may contain more/less or different features than that we used in our system such as lexical match feature.

AB We present an approach to parsing relative clauses in Arabic in the tradition of the Paninian Grammar Framework[2] which leads to deriving a common logical form for equivalent sentences. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of resumptive pronouns in the retrieval of syntactico-semantic relationships. The analysis arises from the development of a lexicalised dependency grammar for Arabic that has application for machine translation.

TI Spatial patterns of the cap-binding complex eIF4F in human melanoma
   cells
SO COMPUTATIONAL AND STRUCTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL
AB As a central node of protein synthesis, the cap-binding complex, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 F (eIF4F), is involved in cell homeostasis, development and tumorigenesis. A large body of literature exists on the regulation and function of eIF4F in cancer cells, however the intracellular localization patterns of this complex are largely unknown. Since different subsets of mRNAs are translated in distinct subcellular compartments, understanding the distribution of translation initiation factors in the cell is of major interest. Here, we developed an in situ detection method for eIF4F at the single cell level. By using an image-based spot feature analysis pipeline as well as supervised machine learning, we identify five distinct spatial patterns of the eIF4F translation initiation complex in human melanoma cells. The quantity of eIF4F complex per cell correlated with the global mRNA translation activity, and its variation is dynamically regulated by cell state or extracellular stimuli. In contrast, the spatial patterns of eIF4F complexes at the single cell level could distinguish melanoma cells harboring different oncogenic driver mutations. This suggests that different tumorigenic contexts differentially regulate the subcellular localization of mRNA translation, with specific localization of eIF4F potentially associated with melanoma cell chemoresistance.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Research Network of Computational and Structural Biotechnology.

TI Increasing adaptability of a speech into sign language translation
   system
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB This paper describes a new version of a speech into sign language translation system with new tools and characteristics for increasing its adaptability to a new task or a new semantic domain. This system is made up of a speech recognizer (for decoding the spoken utterance into a word sequence), a natural language translator (for converting a word sequence into a sequence of signs belonging to the sign language), and a 3D avatar animation module (for playing back the signs). In order to increase the system adaptability, this paper presents new improvements in all the three main modules for generating automatically the task dependent information from a parallel corpus: automatic generation of Spanish variants when generating the vocabulary and language model for the speech recogniser, an acoustic adaptation module for the speech recogniser, data-oriented language and translation models for the machine translator and a list of signs to design. The avatar animation module includes a new editor for rapidly design of the required signs. These developments have been necessary to reduce the effort when adapting a Spanish into Spanish sign language (LSE: Lengua de Signos Espanola) translation system to a new domain. The whole translation presents a SER (Sign Error Rate) lower than 10% and a BLEU higher than 90% while the effort for adapting the system to a new domain has been reduced more than 50%.

TI Strictly proper kernel scores and characteristic kernels on compact
   spaces
SO APPLIED AND COMPUTATIONAL HARMONIC ANALYSIS
AB Strictly proper kernel scores are well-known tools in probabilistic forecasting, while characteristic kernels have been extensively investigated in machine learning. We show that both notions coincide, so insights from one part of the literature can be used in the other. We show that the metric induced by a characteristic kernel cannot reliably distinguish between distributions that are far apart in total variation norm as soon as the underlying space of measures is infinite dimensional. We describe characteristic kernels in terms of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and apply this characterization to continuous kernels on (locally) compact spaces. In the compact case, we show that characteristic kernels exist if and only if the space is metrizable. As special cases we investigate translation-invariant kernels on compact Abelian groups and isotropic kernels on spheres. The latter are of interest for forecast evaluation of probabilistic predictions on spherical domains as encountered in meteorology and climatology. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This work explores the problem of cross-lingual pairwise similarity, where the task is to extract similar pairs of documents across two different languages. Solutions to this problem are of general interest for text mining in the multilingual context and have specific applications in statistical machine translation. Our approach takes advantage of cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) techniques to project feature vectors from one language into another, and then uses locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to extract similar pairs. We show that effective cross-lingual pairwise similarity requires working with similarity thresholds that are much lower than in typical monolingual applications, making the problem quite challenging. We present a parallel, scalable MapReduce implementation of the sort-based sliding window algorithm, which is compared to a brute-force approach on German and English Wikipedia collections. Our central finding can be summarized as \no free lunch": there is no single optimal solution. Instead, we characterize effectiveness-efficiency tradeoffs in the solution space, which can guide the developer to locate a desirable operating point based on application- and resource-specific constraints.

TI Genetic Optimization of Fingerprint Recognition Based on Core Sub-Region
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Fingerprint images that are captured by optical readers usually cannot locate a fingerprint since the rotation and the translation are always together. Considering that both real-time and accurate requirements are need for live applications, this paper presents a novel approach to recognizing a fingerprint based on the core sub-region, which is the area of 100 x 100 pixels surrounding the core point. Log-polar mapping is used to extract the translation-invariant features derived from the discrete wavelet frame transform. Finally, a Bayesian likelihood ratio-based fitness function is devised to genetically select the most discriminative log-polar feature subset by disregarding redundant features via support vector machines classification. The classification results are given for real fingerprint data. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reject imposters efficiently and achieve an over 98% recognition rate operating with two frames/s processing speed. In comparison to the related works, the proposed system is more accurate than the conventional minutiae-based methods.

AB In this paper, we survey some central issues in the historical, current, and future landscape of statistical machine translation (SMT) research, taking as a starting point an extended three-dimensional MT model space. We posit a socio-geographical conceptual disparity hypothesis, that aims to explain why language pairs like Chinese-English have presented MT with so much more difficulty than others. The evolution from simple token-based to segment-based to tree-based syntactic SMT is sketched. For tree-based SMT, we consider language bias rationales for selecting the degree of compositional power within the hierarchy of expressiveness for transduction grammars (or synchronous grammars). This leads us to inversion transductions and the ITG model prevalent in current state-of-the-art SMT, along with the underlying ITG hypothesis, which posits a language universal. Against this backdrop, we enumerate a set of key open questions for syntactic SMT. We then consider the more recent area of semantic SMT. We list principles for successful application of sense disambiguation models to semantic SMT, and describe early directions in the use of semantic role labeling for semantic SMT.

TI Kinetic Analysis Su :rests Evolution of Ribosome Snecificity in Modern
   Elongation Factor-Tus from "Generalist" Ancestors
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB It has been hypothesized that early enzymes are more promiscuous than their extant orthologs. Whether or not this hypothesis applies to the translation machinery, the oldest molecular machine of life, is not known. Efficient protein synthesis relies on a cascade of specific interactions between the ribosome and the translation factors. Here, using elongation factor-Tu (EF-Tu) as a model system, we have explored the evolution of ribosome specificity in translation factors. Employing presteady state fast kinetics using quench flow, we have quantitatively characterized the specificity of two sequence-reconstructed 1.3- to 3.3-Gy-old ancestral EF-Tus toward two unrelated bacterial ribosomes, mesophilic Escherichia coil and thermophilic Thermus thermophilus. Although the modern EF-Tus show clear preference for their respective ribosomes, the ancestral EF-Tus show similar specificity for diverse ribosomes. In addition, despite increase in the catalytic activity with temperature, the ribosome specificity of the thermophilic EF-Tus remains virtually unchanged. Our kinetic analysis thus suggests that EF-Tu proteins likely evolved from the catalytically promiscuous, "generalist" ancestors. Furthermore, compatibility of diverse ribosomes with the modern and ancestral EF-Tus suggests that the ribosomal core probably evolved before the diversification of the EF-Tus. This study thus provides important insights regarding the evolution of modern translation machinery.

TI SCTB-V2: the 2nd version of the Chinese treebank in the scientific
   domain
SO LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
AB Word segmentation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and syntactic parsing are three fundamental Chinese analysis tasks for Chinese language processing, which are also crucial for various downstream tasks such as machine translation and information extraction. To achieve high accuracy for these tasks, treebanks that contain sentences manually annotated with word segmentation, part-of-speech tags, and phrase structures are essential. Although there are large-scale Chinese treebanks in the news domain, such treebanks are unavailable in the scientific domain. This significantly limits the performance of Chinese language processing for scientific text. To address this problem, we annotate the 2nd version of the Chinese treebank in the scientific domain (SCTB-V2). SCTB-V2 contains 12,175 sentences annotated with word segmentation, part-of-speech tags, and phrase structures. We conducted Chinese analyses and machine translation experiments on SCTB-V2. The results show the effectiveness of SCTB-V2. We release this treebank to promote scientific Chinese language processing research http://nlp.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/EN/index.php?A%20Chinese%20Treebank%20 in%20Scientif.ic%20Domain%20%28SCTB%29..

AB In this paper, a robust image watermarking technique has been proposed based on the combination of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and discrete cosine transform (DCT). SVM regression model has been incorporated for geometric distortion correction to achieve improved robustness against de-synchronization attacks such as rotation, translation etc. Low order Pseudo Zernike (PZ) moments have used as a feature vector in SVM regression model. The 3-level DWT transformed DCT coefficients are modified to embed a binary bit. The performance of algorithm has been observed against both intentional and non-intentional attacks. The scheme provides an average imperceptibility of around 42.45 dB. The effect of rotation and translation attack has been estimated using trained SVM regression model. The robustness against de-synchronization attack is performed after correcting the attacked watermarked images. The experimental results show that the algorithm provides adequate robustness against both the geometric and non-geometric attacks.

AB Commit messages are a valuable resource in comprehension of software evolution, since they provide a record of changes such as feature additions and bug repairs. Unfortunately, programmers often neglect to write good commit messages. Different techniques have been proposed to help programmers by automatically writing these messages. These techniques are effective at describing what changed, but are often verbose and lack context for understanding the rationale behind a change. In contrast, humans write messages that are short and summarize the high level rationale. In this paper, we adapt Neural Machine Translation (NMT) to automatically "translate" diffs into commit messages. We trained an NMT algorithm using a corpus of diffs and human-written commit messages from the top 1k Github projects. We designed a filter to help ensure that we only trained the algorithm on higher-quality commit messages. Our evaluation uncovered a pattern in which the messages we generate tend to be either very high or very low quality. Therefore, we created a quality-assurance filter to detect cases in which we are unable to produce good messages, and return a warning instead.

AB Attention-based encoder-decoder neural network models have recently shown promising results in machine translation and speech recognition. In this work, we propose an attention-based neural network model for joint intent detection and slot filling, both of which are critical steps for many speech understanding and dialog systems. Unlike in machine translation and speech recognition, alignment is explicit in slot filling. We explore different strategies in incorporating this alignment information to the encoder-decoder framework. Learning from the attention mechanism in encoder-decoder model, we further propose introducing attention to the alignment-based RNN models. Such attentions provide additional information to the intent classification and slot label prediction. Our independent task models achieve state-of-the-art intent detection error rate and slot filling F1 score on the benchmark ATIS task. Our joint training model further obtains 0.56% absolute (23.8% relative) error reduction on intent detection and 0.23% absolute gain on slot filling over the independent task models.

AB Herein, a novel skip connection structure with double bypass is employed in Transformer. The structure introduces two linear components between the input and output. Moreover, it establishes layer normalization at the beginning of the bypass computation, enhancing the model prediction efficiency. Two methods are employed to deploy the novel skip connection structure in the Transformer. In one method, the Transformer feedforward layer used for machine translation tasks is considered as a branch of the skip connection structure. In the other method, the skip connection structure is introduced into the Transformer model used for binocular parallax calculation tasks. Experimental results show that the machine translation model with the novel skip connection structure is 2% better in BLEU index. Furthermore, in the binocular parallax calculation tasks, the EPE index of the Transformer model with the skip connection structure decreases by 3.8% compared with that of a comparison model. The Transformer with the novel skip connection structure achieves a 7.6% lower 3PX ERROR than the Transformer without the skip connection structure.

AB Rapid changes in public opinion have been observed in recent years about a number of issues, and some have attributed them to the emergence of a global online media sphere [1,2]. Being able to monitor the global media sphere, for any sign of change, is an important task in politics, marketing and media analysis. Particularly interesting are sudden changes in the amount of attention and sentiment about an issue, and their temporal and geographic variations. In order to automatically monitor media content, to discover possible changes, we need to be able to access sentiment across various languages, and specifically for given entities or issues. We present a comparative study of sentiment in news content across several languages, assembling a new multilingual corpus and demonstrating that it is possible to detect variations in sentiment through machine translation. Then we apply the method on a number of real case studies, comparing changes in media coverage about Weinstein, Trump and Russia in the US, UK and some other EU countries.

TI Generation of Coherent Multi-Sentence Texts with a Coherence Mechanism
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB Automatic generation of long texts containing multiple sentences has many applications in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) including question answering, machine translation, and paraphrase generation, etc. However, in terms of readability, the long texts generated by machines are not comparable to those organized by human beings. Through statistics, we observed that human-organized texts generally have a special property: one or more of the words (particularly nouns and pronouns) appeared in one sentence will reappear in the next one in the same or a different form. This repetition of words in consecutive sentences can greatly improve the readability. Based on this observation, we propose CMST, a deep neural network model for generating Coherent Multi-Sentence Texts. CMST explicitly incorporates a training strategy of coherence mechanism to evaluate the repetition of words in consecutive sentences. We evaluate the performance of the CMST on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. The experimental results show that, compared with the baseline models, CMST not only improves the readability of the generated texts, but achieves higher METEOR and ROUGE values.

TI Discrimination of DNA Methylation Signal from Background Variation for
   Clinical Diagnostics
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Advances in the study of human DNA methylation variation offer a new avenue for the translation of epigenetic research results to clinical applications. Although current approaches to methylome analysis have been helpful in revealing an epigenetic influence in major human diseases, this type of analysis has proven inadequate for the translation of these advances to clinical diagnostics. As in any clinical test, the use of a methylation signal for diagnostic purposes requires the estimation of an optimal cutoff value for the signal, which is necessary to discriminate a signal induced by a disease state from natural background variation. To address this issue, we propose the application of a fundamental signal detection theory and machine learning approaches. Simulation studies and tests of two available methylome datasets from autism and leukemia patients demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in clinical diagnostics, providing high discriminatory power for the methylation signal induced by disease, as well as high classification performance. Specifically, the analysis of whole biomarker genomic regions could suffice for a diagnostic, markedly decreasing its cost.

TI On the optimal decision rule for sequential interactive structured
   prediction
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS
AB Interactive structured prediction (ISP) is an emerging framework for structured prediction (SP) where the user and the system collaborate to produce a high quality output. Typically, search algorithms applied to ISP problems have been based on the algorithms for fully-automatic SP systems. However, the decision rule applied should not be considered as optimal since the goal in ISP is to reduce human effort instead of output errors. In this work, we present some insight into the theory of the sequential ISP search problem. First, it is formulated as a decision theory problem from which a general analytical formulation of the optimal decision rule is derived. Then, it is compared with the standard formulation to establish under what conditions the standard algorithm should perform similarly to the optimal decision rule. Finally, a general and practical implementation is given and evaluated against three classical ISP problems: interactive machine translation, interactive handwritten text recognition, and interactive speech recognition.

TI Fitting missing API puzzles with machine translation techniques
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB While implementing software projects, developers do not reinvent the wheel but try to reuse existing API calls and source code. In recent years, the problems related to recommending APIs and code snippets have been intensively investigated. Although current approaches have achieved encouraging performance, there is still the need to improve the recommendation process's effectiveness and efficiency. In this work, we reformulate the problem of API recommendations by proposing learning and recommending API sequences relevant to a given coding context. We present LUPE, a novel approach to API and code recommendation, exploiting cutting-edge deep learning techniques. Thanks to the underlying Encoder-Decoder architecture specialized in transforming sequences, LUPE can effectively learn the order in which invocations occur. The approach has been evaluated on two Android datasets and compared with GAPI and FACER, two state-of-the-art API recommender systems. Being fed with augmented training data, our conceived approach can obtain a high prediction accuracy, and produce a perfect match in several cases, hence outperforming the baselines.

AB The main challenge in English-Malay cross-lingual emotion classification is that there are no Malay training emotion corpora. Given that machine translation could fall short in contextually complex tweets, we only limited machine translation to the word level. In this paper, we bridge the language gap between English and Malay through cross-lingual word embeddings constructed using singular value decomposition. We pre-trained our hierarchical attention model using English tweets and fine-tuned it using a set of gold standard Malay tweets. Our model uses significantly less computational resources compared to the language models. Experimental results show that the performance of our model is better than mBERT in zero-shot learning by 2.4% and Malay BERT by 0.8% when a limited number of Malay tweets is available. In exchange for 6 - 7 times less in computational time, our model only lags behind mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa by a margin of 0.9 - 4.3 % in few-shot learning. Also, the word-level attention could be transferred to the Malay tweets accurately using the cross-lingual word embeddings.

AB Spoken language understanding (SLU) is a component of goal-oriented dialogue systems that aims to interpret user's natural language queries in system's semantic representation format. While current state-of-the-art SLU approaches achieve high performance for English domains, the same is not true for other languages. Approaches in the literature for extending SLU models and grammars to new languages rely primarily on machine translation. This poses a challenge in scaling to new languages, as machine translation systems may not be reliable for several (especially low resource) languages. In this work, we examine different approaches to train a SLU component with little supervision for two new languages - Hindi and Turkish, and show that with only a few hundred labeled examples we can surpass the approaches proposed in the literature. Our experiments show that training a model bilingually (i.e., jointly with English), enables faster learning, in that the model requires fewer labeled instances in the target language to generalize. Qualitative analysis shows that rare slot types benefit the most from the bilingual training.

AB Non-English university students have to read extended bibliography written in English with difficult specialist terminology and use the information and knowledge they acquire in oral presentations and term papers either in their EFL/ESP1 classes or in their subject classes, whose language of instruction is other than English. This paper shows how three basic uses of the Internet - (1) electronic bilingual specialist dictionaries, (2) engines of machine translation, and (3) search for reference materials - can help non-English university students develop research, IT and Internet skills, so that they will overcome their frustration with managing extended and difficult bibliography and move with ease between the ever increasing globalised world (where English is utilised) and their local world (where their local language [e.g. Modem Greek) is used). As these uses of the Internet have been successfully implemented at the University of the Aegean (Lesvos, Greece), the claim in this paper is that they can be applied to any ELT courses at other non-English universities and pairs of languages, scientific discourses and cultures.

TI An Approach to NMT Re-Ranking Using Sequence-Labeling for Grammatical
   Error Correction
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND INTELLIGENT
   INFORMATICS
AB An approach to N-best hypotheses re-ranking using a sequence-labeling model is applied to resolve the data deficiency problem in Grammatical Error Correction (GEC). Multiple candidate sentences are generated using a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model; thereafter, these sentences are re-ranked via a stacked Transformer following a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) with Conditional Random Field (CRF). Correlations within the sentences are extracted using the sequence-labeling model based on the Transformer, which is particularly suitable for long sentences. Meanwhile, the knowledge from a large amount of unlabeled data is acquired through the pre-trained structure. Thus, completely revised sentences are adopted instead of partially modified sentences. Compared with conventional NMT, experiments on the NUCLE and FCE datasets demonstrate that the model improves the F-0.5 score by 8.22% and 2.09%, respectively. As an advantage, the proposed re-ranking method has the advantage of only requires a small set of easily computed features that do not need linguistic inputs.

AB Audio Visual Scene-aware Dialog (AVSD) is a task to generate responses when discussing about a given video. The previous state-of-the-art model shows superior performance for this task using Transformer-based architecture. However, there remain some limitations in learning better representation of modalities. Inspired by Neural Machine Translation (NMT), we propose the Transformer-based Modal Translator (TMT) to learn the representations of the source modal sequence by translating the source modal sequence to the related target modal sequence in a supervised manner. Based on Multimodal Transformer Networks (MTN), we apply TMT to video and dialog, proposing MTN-TMT for the video-grounded dialog system. On the AVSD track of the Dialog System Technology Challenge 7, MTN-TMT outperforms the MTN and other submission models in both Video and Text task and Text Only task. Compared with MTN, MTN-TMT improves all metrics, especially, achieving relative improvement up to 14.1% on CIDEr.

SO SADHANA-ACADEMY PROCEEDINGS IN ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB Users of the WWW across the globe are increasing rapidly. According to Internet live stats there are more than 3 billion Internet users worldwide today and the number of non-English native speakers is quite high there. A large proportion of these non-English speakers access the Internet in their native languages but use the Roman script to express themselves through various communication channels like messages and posts. With the advent of Web 2.0, user-generated content is increasing on the Web at a very rapid rate. A substantial proportion of this content is transliterated data. To leverage this huge information repository, there is a matching effort to process transliterated text. In this article, we survey the recent body of work in the field of transliteration. We start with a definition and discussion of the different types of transliteration followed by various deterministic and non-deterministic approaches used to tackle transliteration-related issues in machine translation and information retrieval. Finally, we study the performance of those techniques and present a comparative analysis of them.

AB The inference of program invariants over machine arithmetic, commonly called bit-vector arithmetic, is an important problem in verification. Techniques that have been successful for unbounded arithmetic, in particular Craig interpolation, have turned out to be difficult to generalise to machine arithmetic: existing bit-vector interpolation approaches are based either on eager translation from bit-vectors to unbounded arithmetic, resulting in complicated constraints that are hard to solve and interpolate, or on bit-blasting to propositional logic, in the process losing all arithmetic structure. We present a new approach to bit-vector interpolation, as well as bit-vector quantifier elimination (QE), that works by lazy translation of bit-vector constraints to unbounded arithmetic. Laziness enables us to fully utilise the information available during proof search (implied by decisions and propagation) in the encoding, and this way produce constraints that can be handled relatively easily by existing interpolation and QE procedures for Presburger arithmetic. The lazy encoding is complemented with a set of native proof rules for bit-vector equations and non-linear (polynomial) constraints, this way minimising the number of cases a solver has to consider.

This paper describes the process of building a large-scale (about 400, 000 sentence pairs) English-Persian parallel corpus called Tehran Parallel Corpus (TPC). The aim of study is to introduce the structure and explain the materials utilized for constructing TPC. In addition, some useful tools developed within the project have been introduced and three sorts of the statistical machine translation systems trained by TPC have been considered. In order to develop a high quality parallel corpus, unsure alignments recognized via a MaxEnt classifier have been eliminated from the corpus. As an intrinsic evaluation, 1,600 sentence pairs are elicited randomly and compared manually with a gold standard test set. As an extrinsic evaluation, three Phrase-based SMT systems, which is trained by TPC are incorporated. The results demonstrate the superiority of our translator systems over English to Persian Google translator system in term of BLEU and TER metrics.

AB This work proposes a natural language stegosystem for Twitter, modifying tweets as they are written to hide 4 bits of payload per tweet, which is a greater payload than previous systems have achieved. The system, CoverTweet, includes novel components, as well as some already developed in the literature. We believe that the task of transforming covers during embedding is equivalent to unilingual machine translation (paraphrasing), and we use this equivalence to de fine a distortion measure based on statistical machine translation methods. The system incorporates this measure of distortion to rank possible tweet paraphrases, using a hierarchical language model; we use human interaction as a second distortion measure to pick the best. The hierarchical language model is designed to model the specific language of the covers, which in this setting is the language of the Twitter user who is embedding. This is a change from previous work, where general-purpose language models have been used. We evaluate our system by testing the output against human judges, and show that humans are unable to distinguish stego tweets from cover tweets any better than random guessing.

A National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) program called A Specialized Platform for Innovative Research Exploration (ASPIRE) leverages advances in AI/ML, automated synthetic chemistry, and high-throughput biology, and seeks to enable translation and drug development by catalyzing exploration of biologically active chemical space. Here we discuss the opportunities and challenges surrounding the application of AI/ML to the exploration of novel biologically relevant chemical space as part of ASPIRE.

AB Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) plays a more and more important role in the field of industry. To deal with the heterogeneity of manufacture-dependent programming languages, IEC 61131-3 international standard has promoted the PLC openness to developing. In this paper, we present a proposal to implement the IEC 61131-3 standard in a PLC virtual machine (VM), which is a new kind of high-level language VM and takes Instruction List (IL) as the intermediate code. We discuss the syntax and semantics of IL, and show the design architecture for the emulation engine using both interpretation and translation methods. The PLC VM enables developers to rapidly porting an IEC-61131-3 application onto different platforms. We have implemented the PLC VM on a C51 based embedded PLC platform.

AB This paper introduces two recent open source software packages developed for unsupervised natural language modeling. ne Morfessor program segments words automatically into morpheme-like units without any rule-based morphological analyzers. The VariKN toolkit trains language models producing a compact set of high-order n-grams utilizing state-of-art Kneser-Ney smoothing. As an example, this paper shows how to construct a language model for speech recognition in multiple languages utilizing only a minimal amount of linguistic resources. Morfessor and VariKN also have other applications in text understanding, information retrieval and machine translation. Unsupervised machine learning techniques are particularly well suited for the development of systems for less-resourced languages, because they do not depend on manually designed morphological or syntactical analyzers or annotated data.

TI Translation of UML state machines to Modelica: Handling semantic issues
SO SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION
   INTERNATIONAL
AB ModelicaML is a UML profile that enables modeling and simulation of systems and their dynamic behavior. ModelicaML combines the power of the OMG UML standardized graphical notation for systems and software modeling, and the simulation power of Modelica. This addresses the increasing need for precise and integrated modeling of products containing both software and hardware. This article discusses the usage of executable UML state machines for system modeling, i.e. usage of the same formalism for describing the state-based dynamic behavior of physical system components and software. Moreover, it points out that the usage of Modelica as an action language enables an integrated simulation of continuous-time and reactive/event-based system dynamics. The main purpose of this article is however to highlight issues that are identified regarding the UML specification which are experienced with typical executable implementations of UML state machines. The issues identified are resolved and rationales for the taken design decisions are provided.

AB The increase in the availability of genetic data in the last years is prompting the efforts to use tools from communications engineering for the understanding of genetic information. Processes in molecular biology can be modeled through the use of these tools. A communication theory based model for the process of translation in gene expression is proposed. The model is based on the assumption that the ribosome decodes the mRNA sequences using the 3' end of the 16SrRNA molecule as a one dimensional codebook. The biological consistency of the model is proven in the detection of the Shine-Dalgarno signal and the initiation codon for translation initiation. Furthermore, implications on the role of the 16SrRNA 3' end in the complete process of prokaryotic translation are presented and discussed. Interestingly, the obtained results lay out the possibility of an interaction of this part of the ribosome in the process of translation termination. Finally, results obtained via the proposed model are compared with published experimental results for different mutations of the rRNA molecule. Total agreement between both sets of results prove the validity of the proposed model. By means of simulated mutations in the last 13 bases of the 16grRNA, a global analysis of this part of the ribosome in the process of translation is established. This work illustrates the relevance of communication theory based models for genetic regulatory systems.

SO TEORIA-RIVISTA DI FILOSOFIA
AB Although Turing's Question - Can Machines Think? - has not yet found an answer, it can be considered outdated. It is not important to determine if you think, it is more important than the brain electronic behave like a human brain. In the same way it is not important that you feel emotions, it is important that you act like a human who experiences emotions. The development of the studies on artificial neural networks, in particular in the field of deep learning has significantly expanded the scenario of human replication. We are in the field of "Affective Computing", a branch of human-computer interaction, which deals with creating "Affective machines" able to interact with the user, taking into account his emotional reactions. The properly philosophical question we ask ourselves is "why should we build machines that replicate human interaction and thinking in a relational sense?", without neglecting to examine the conditions of possibility of an ethics of the machines.

TI Protein Abundance Prediction Through Machine Learning Methods
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Proteins are responsible for most physiological processes, and their abundance provides crucial information for systems biology research. However, absolute protein quantification, as determined by mass spectrometry, still has limitations in capturing the protein pool. Protein abundance is impacted by translation kinetics, which rely on features of codons. In this study, we evaluated the effect of codon usage bias of genes on protein abundance. Notably, we observed differences regarding codon usage patterns between genes coding for highly abundant proteins and genes coding for less abundant proteins. Analysis of synonymous codon usage and evolutionary selection showed a clear split between the two groups. Our machine learning models predicted protein abundances from codon usage metrics with remarkable accuracy, achieving strong correlation with experimental data. Upon integration of the predicted protein abundance in enzyme-constrained genome-scale metabolic models, the simulated phenotypes closely matched experimental data, which demonstrates that our predictive models are valuable tools for systems metabolic engineering approaches.

AB This paper presents a new dual domain mapping based on a unified bidirectional sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) learning. Traditionally, dual learning in domain mapping was constructed with intrinsic connection where the conditional generative models in two directions were mutually leveraged and combined. The additional feedback from the other generation direction was used to regularize sequential learning in original direction of domain mapping. Domain matching between source sequence and target sequence was accordingly improved. However, the reconstructions for knowledge in two domains were ignored. The dual information based on separate models in two training directions was not sufficiently discovered. To cope with this weakness, this study proposes a closed-loop seq2seq learning where domain mapping and domain knowledge are jointly learned. In particular, a new feature-level dual learning is incorporated to build a dualformer where feature integration and feature reconstruction are further performed to bridge dual tasks. Experiments demonstrate the merit of the proposed dualformer for machine translation based on the multi-objective seq2seq learning.

AB Word sense ambiguity resolution is one of the major issues in the process of machine translation. Statistical and example-based methods are usually applied for this purpose. In statistical methods, ambiguity resolution is mostly carried out by making use of some statistics extracted from previously translated documents or dual corpora of source and target languages. In this paper, we look at the problem from a different viewpoint. The proposed system consists of two main parts. The first part includes a data mining algorithm which runs offline and extracts some useful knowledge about the co-occurrences of the words. The second part of the system is an expert system whose knowledge base includes the set of association rules generated by the first part. For the inference engine of the expert system, we propose an efficient algorithm based on forward chaining in order to deduce the correct senses of the words. The performance of the system in terms of applicability and precision will be analyzed and discussed through a set of experiments.

TI Research Status and Prospects of Computational Linguistics

AB Computational linguistics had made considerable progress in China during the period of the "13th Five-Year Plan". Inspired by deep learning algorithms, certain breakthroughs have been made in the basic research aspects. In the meantime, this period also witnessed valuable applications in computational linguistics in areas such as speech recognition, machine translation, automatic question and answer systems, knowledge resource construction, as well as language and information processing of ancient Chinese characters and other languages. However, we are still catching up in many fields. Moreover, the dividends brought by deep learning algorithms are draining away. To win the competition, we need to conduct basic research on algorithms, the neural mechanism of language, and the nature of language comprehension. We also need to invest in training interdisciplinary talents and strengthen research in emerging areas such as machine language ability.

TI BaNeP: An End-to-End Neural Network Based Model for Bangla
   Parts-of-Speech Tagging
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In Natural Language Processing, Parts-of-Speech tagging is a vital component that significantly impacts applications like machine translation, spell-checker, information retrieval, and speech processing. In languages such as English and Dutch, POS tagging is considered a solved problem (accuracy: 97%). However, for low-resource languages like Bangla, challenges are still there. In this article, we have proposed a novel RNN-based network named BaNeP to determine parts of speech for Bangla words. The proposed network extracts structural features through a bidirectional LSTM-based sub-network, and intricate contextual relations among words of a sentence are identified through an elaborate weighted context extraction procedure. These features are then combinedly utilized to generate the final Parts-of-Speech prediction. Training the model requires only an annotated dataset vanishing the need for any hand-crafted features. Experimental results on the LDC2010T16 dataset show significant accuracy improvement compared to existing Bangla POS taggers.

AB With recent advances in network architectures for Neural Machine Translation (NMT) recurrent models have effectively been replaced by either convolutional or self-attentional approaches, such as in the Transformer. While the main innovation of the Transformer architecture is its use of self-attentional layers, there are several other aspects, such as attention with multiple heads and the use of many attention layers, that distinguish the model from previous baselines. In this work we take a fine-grained look at the different architectures for NMT. We introduce an Architecture Definition Language (ADL) allowing for a flexible combination of common building blocks. Making use of this language, we show in experiments that one can bring recurrent and convolutional models very close to the Transformer performance by borrowing concepts from the Transformer architecture, but not using self-attention. Additionally, we find that self-attention is much more important for the encoder side than for the decoder side, where it can be replaced by a RNN or CNN without a loss in performance in most settings. Surprisingly, even a model without any target side self-attention performs well.

AB Cloud Computing is a technology that moves the World forward. It helps the mobile users to run compute demanding applications on a remote cloud and access the results on their mobile devices. Usual processing of the cloud based applications is realized via a WAN connection. However, this approach is inefficient for real-time applications due to relatively huge WAN latency. Cloudlets solve this problem by exploiting the benefits of Cloud Computing without being WAN-limited. The cloudlet is a small cloud located near the mobile user. Cloudlets can perform the same processing tasks as a remote cloud by using Virtual Machines (VMs).
   In this paper we introduce the cloudlet approach to design a Multilingual Dictionary, which is a Cloudlet based application specifically developed to be processed on a near cloudlet as well as on a distant cloud. It will be used for translating words entered through a mobile device by using a VM deployment on the cloud/cloudlet and displaying the results on the mobile device. The initial version will support translation between two languages. Afterwards, it will be expanded to support multilingual translation.

SO COMPUTERS AND THE HUMANITIES
AB Internet search engines allow access to online information from all over the world. However, there is currently a general assumption that users are fluent in the languages of all documents that they might search for. This has for historical reasons usually been a choice between English and the locally supported language. Given the rapidly growing size of the Internet, it is likely that future users will need to access information in languages in which they are not fluent or have no knowledge of at all. This paper shows how information retrieval and machine translation can be combined in a cross-language information access framework to help overcome the language barrier. We present encouraging preliminary experimental results using English queries to retrieve documents from the standard Japanese language BMIR-J2 retrieval test collection. We outline the scope and purpose of cross-language information access and provide an example application to suggest that technology already exists to provide effective and potentially useful applications.

AB The referential properties of noun phrases in the Japanese language, which has no articles, are useful for article generation in Japanese-English machine translation and for anaphora resolution in Japanese noun phrases. They are generally classified as generic noun phrases, definite noun phrases, and indefinite noun phrases. In the previous work, referential properties were estimated by developing rules that used clue words. If two or more rules were in conflict with each other, the category having the maximum total score given by the rules was selected as the desired category. The score given by each rule was established by hand, so the manpower cost was high, In this work, we automatically adjusted these scores by using a machine-learning method and succeeded in reducing the amount of manpower needed to adjust these scores.

AB Machine translation (MT) has benefited from using synthetic training data originating from translating monolingual corpora, a technique known as backtranslation. Combining back-translated data from different sources has led to better results than when using such data in isolation. In this work we analyse the impact that data translated with rule-based, phrase-based statistical and neural MT systems has on new MT systems. We use a real-world low-resource use-case (Basque-to-Spanish in the clinical domain) as well as a high-resource language pair (German-to-English) to test different scenarios with backtranslation and employ data selection to optimise the synthetic corpora. We exploit different data selection strategies in order to reduce the amount of data used, while at the same time maintaining high-quality MT systems. We further tune the data selection method by taking into account the quality of the MT systems used for backtranslation and lexical diversity of the resulting corpora. Our experiments show that incorporating backtranslated data from different sources can be beneficial, and that availing of data selection can yield improved performance.

AB With the increasing use of technology in classrooms, computer assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) is becoming a vital tool in language learning. In this paper, we present a system that takes advantage of data from learners of a specific L1 to better model phonological errors at various levels in the system. At the lexical level, a statistical machine translation approach is used to model common phonological errors produced by a specific L1 population. At the acoustic level, L1-dependent maximum likelihood (ML) nonnative models and discriminative training are explored. In our experiments, use of a Korean language dependent nonnative lexicon gives us diagnostic abilities that did not exist in our baseline configuration. Replacing the native ML acoustic model with the L1-dependent nonnative model produces relative improvements of 27-37% in precision for phone detection/identification tasks. We also propose a constrained variant of minimum phone error (MPE) training which is better adapted to phone detection/diagnosis. This technique produces 5-6% relative improvement in precision in comparison to ML nonnative acoustic models.

AB Nowadays, training end-to-end neural models for spoken language translation (SLT) still has to confront with extreme data scarcity conditions. The existing SLT parallel corpora are indeed orders of magnitude smaller than those available for the closely related tasks of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT), which usually comprise tens of millions of instances. To cope with data paucity, in this paper we explore the effectiveness of transfer learning in end-to-end SLT by presenting a multilingual approach to the task. Multilingual solutions are widely studied in MT and usually rely on "target forcing", in which multilingual parallel data are combined to train a single model by prepending to the input sequences a language token that specifies the target language. However, when tested in speech translation, our experiments show that MT-like target forcing, used as is, is not effective in discriminating among the target languages. Thus, we propose a variant that uses target-language embeddings to shift the input representations in different portions of the space according to the language, so to better support the production of output in the desired target language. Our experiments on end-to-end SLT from English into six languages show important improvements when translating into similar languages, especially when these are supported by scarce data. Further improvements are obtained when using English ASR data as an additional language (up to +2:5 BLEU points).

AB Identifying named entities (NEs) present in electronic newspapers in regional languages is an important step in machine translation and summarization systems. In this paper, we propose a statistical named entity recognition system based on machine learning for the identification and classification of named entities present in Marathi language text. In our system, named entities are identified and classified using conditional random fields (CRFs). As being a morphologically rich language, statistical algorithms achieves good NE identification and classification accuracy but needs extra knowledge to improve accuracy. Experiments conducted on the FIRE-2010 corpus show that our system submitted for the challenge achieves the precision, recall and Fl-measure of 82.33%, 70.68% and 75.51% under the CRF algorithm.

AB The past decade has seen a remarkable series of advances in machine learning, and in particular deeplearning approaches based on artificial neural networks, to improve our abilities to build more accurate systems across a broad range of areas, including computer vision, speech recognition, language translation, and natural language understanding tasks. This paper is a companion paper to a keynote talk at the 2020 International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) discussing some of the advances in machine learning, and their implications on the kinds of computational devices we need to build, especially in the post-Moore's Lawera. It also discusses some of the ways that machine learning may be able to help with some aspects of the circuit design process. Finally, it provides a sketch of at least one interesting direction towards much larger-scale multi-task models that are sparsely activated and employ much more dynamic, exampleand task-based routing than the machine learning models of today.

AB In this era of globalisation and technology, determining the gender of a person from forenames has numerous applications especially in the machine translation and natural language processing fields. In this paper, we used a supervised machine learning approach to classify 10000 first names into either a male or female name. The names were manually extracted from an online telephone directory and then manually classified into an appropriate category. We obtained the highest accuracy of 88.0% when using support vector machines while the Naive Bayes produced the lowest accuracy of 84.7%. A total of 15 features were used in this study. Traditionally, such systems have relied on a name dictionary to output the gender of forenames. However, our proposed system can predict the gender of unseen or unknown names. Furthermore, our dataset consists of names from different origins such as European, African, Arabic, Indian and Chinese, unlike previous studies which use names from one origin only.

AB A smart contract originally drafted by natural language is an essential task of many applications in blockchain technology. Firstly, natural language cannot be directly executed by computers, self-executing requires terms of the smart contract be computer-readable and executable. Secondly, in crossing environments or parties, contract translation needs the overall meaning of a sentence to have a meticulous precision, besides, low tolerance of mistakes for reducing a tedious process. Lastly, many kinds of templates of smart contracts need a common sense of agreement where each party agrees on the context of the contract. This paper explores the problems of the smart contract in natural language and self-executing to redefine the smart contract through an approach, which supports a human-readable, computer-understandable and self-executable contract representations with enabling semantic structural based on Machine Natural Language (MNL). Meanwhile, a common dictionary (CoDic) transfers natural languages into universal machine codes or languages without the ambiguity across parties.

CY DEC 29-31, 2007
CL Cairo, EGYPT
SP IEEE
AB To specify, design, and implement complex system-on-chip (SoC), a new modeling method, transaction level modeling (TLM), has been proposed recently. TLM allows designers to focus on functionality while abstracting implementation details. At the register transfer level (RTL), however, different modules communicate through detailed pin level signaling. SoC design methodologies involve the integration of different intellectual property (IP) blocks modeled at different levels of abstraction. Therefore a special module or channel is needed in order to link modules, IN, designed at different abstraction levels. This module, called transactor, can be modeled using a finite state machine (FSM) providing a functional specification of the protocol's behavior. In this paper, we propose a methodology to specify transactors using graphical finite state machine (FSM). This technique enables an automatic generation of SystemC TLM-RTL transactors via an intermediate translation of the user-defined FSM to the Abstract State Machines Language (AsmL). The UTOPIA standard protocol is provided as an illustration of this approach.

TI Interpolation control algorithm for a three-RPS parallel spindle head
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART I-JOURNAL OF
   SYSTEMS AND CONTROL ENGINEERING
AB A five-axis computer numerical control hybrid machine tool composed mainly of a three-RPS parallel spindle head with one translation and two rotations is investigated; because of its unique machining characteristics, this machine tool has been applied to high-efficiency aerospace monolithic component processing, and its trajectory control is one of the core technologies underpinning its efficacy. This research investigates a new type of five-axis hybrid machine tool which is loaded with a three-RPS parallel spindle head and finds a cutter orientation interpolation algorithm which can ensure its high-precision, and high-speed, operation in machining processes. First, the kinematic model of the hybrid machine tool is established using the vector chain method. Using this model, the virtual reality mapping relationship between the control axis space and the operating space is established. Then a control algorithm governing two interpolation strategies in the operation and joint spaces is proposed; this method disperses the cutter vector in the workspace. Through the mapping relationship, the point data array in the joint space can be obtained from the machining data which are calculated from the mapping model, and then the improved three B-spline interpolation method is used in the joint space. Thereafter, the post-machining module outputs the interpolation data to the motor, and the moving platform can realise the desired tool path. Finally, using the hybrid machine tool for the machining of an S' test-piece, the results prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the interpolation algorithm. The experiment indicates that the interpolation algorithm can be used in this kind of parallel machine tool control system.

AB Generating video descriptions has many important applications such as human-robot interaction, video indexing, video summarization and assisting for the visually impaired. Many significant breakthroughs in deep learning and releases of large-scale open-domain video description datasets allow us to explore this task more effectively. Recently, Venugopalan et al. (S2VT) propose to caption a video via the technique on machine translation. We propose tracklet attention method to capture spatio-temporal information in the decoding phase and reserve the encoding phase similar to S2VT to retain the technique on machine translation. On the other hand, labels for video captioning are expensive and scarce, and training corpus is hard to completely cover rare words presenting in testing set. Hence, we propose to use sentence augmentation method to enrich our training corpus. Finally, we conduct experiments to demonstrate that tracklet attention and sentence augmentation improve the performance of S2VT on the validation set of Microsoft Research Video to Text dataset (MSR-VTT). In addition, we also achieve the state-of-the-art performance on Video Titles in the Wild dataset (VTW) by applying tracklet attention.

AB In the Embedded Systems and SoC (System-on-Chip) area, we defined a model-driven HW-SW co-design methodology based on the UML 2, a SystemC UML profile for the HW side, and a multi-threaded C UML profile for the SW side, which allows modeling of the system at higher levels of abstraction (from a functional executable level to Register Transfer Level) -- far beyond the capabilities of existing HDLs. In this paper, we present the SystemC Process State Machines, an extension of the UML state machine formalism, that we defined as part of the SystemC UML profile to model the reactive behavior and concurrency aspects of SoC components, abstracting the SystemC design primitives available for this scope and guaranteeing straightforward translation to SystemC code.

TI Systematic abstraction of abstract machines
SO JOURNAL OF FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
AB We describe a derivational approach to abstract interpretation that yields novel and transparently sound static analyses when applied to well-established abstract machines for higher-order and imperative programming languages. To demonstrate the technique and support our claim, we transform the CEK machine of Felleisen and Friedman (Proc. of the 14th ACM SIGACT-SIGPLAN Symp. Prin. Program. Langs, 1987, pp. 314-325), a lazy variant of Krivine's machine (Higher-Order Symb. Comput. Vol 20, 2007, pp. 199-207), and the stack-inspecting CM machine of Clements and Felleisen (ACM Trans. Program. Lang. Syst. Vol 26, 2004, pp. 1029-1052) into abstract interpretations of themselves. The resulting analyses bound temporal ordering of program events; predict return-flow and stack-inspection behavior; and approximate the flow and evaluation of by-need parameters. For all of these machines, we find that a series of well-known concrete machine refactorings, plus a technique of store-allocated continuations, leads to machines that abstract into static analyses simply by bounding their stores. These machines are parameterized by allocation functions that tune performance and precision and substantially expand the space of analyses that this framework can represent. We demonstrate that the technique scales up uniformly to allow static analysis of realistic language features, including tail calls, conditionals, mutation, exceptions, first-class continuations, and even garbage collection. In order to close the gap between formalism and implementation, we provide translations of the mathematics as running Haskell code for the initial development of our method.

AB We develop a method for analyzing multivariate time series using topological data analysis (TDA) methods. The proposed methodology involves converting the multivariate time series to point cloud data, calculating Wasserstein distances between the persistence diagrams and using the k-nearest neighbours algorithm (k-NN) for supervised machine learning. Two methods (symmetry-breaking and anchor points) are also introduced to enable TDA to better analyze data with heterogeneous features that are sensitive to translation, rotation or choice of coordinates. We apply our methods to room occupancy detection based on 5 time-dependent variables (temperature, humidity, light, CO2 and humidity ratio). Experimental results show that topological methods are effective in predicting room occupancy during a time window. We also apply our methods to an Activity Recognition dataset and obtained good results.

TI Transducers based on networks of polarized evolutionary processors
SO THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB We consider a new type of transducer that does not scan sequentially the input word. This transducer is actually a network of polarized evolutionary processors (NPEP) which receives a word as input and collects in the output node, when the computation halts, the translation of the input word. We prove that these transducers can simulate the work of generalized sequential machines on every input. Furthermore, all words obtained by a given finite state transducer by the shortest computations on a given word can also be computed by the new transducers. Unlike the case of generalized sequential machines, every recursively enumerable language can be the transduction, defined by the new transducer, of a very simple regular language.

AB People in developing countries with restricted schooling, face hurdles with their digital enablement. Constrained education creates issues with comprehensibility of information on internet and other digital platforms. Most content on digital platforms use enriched vocabulary for more accomplished users and hence does not seem to be very useful for digitally semi-literate users. Artificial Intelligence (AI), Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be applied for text simplification to bridge the digital divide and empower these users. In this paper we propose to achieve reductive paraphrasing using Neural Machine Translation (NMT) framework along with encoder-decoder model and Gated Recurring Unit (GRU). Our approach combines Zero-shot Learning (ZSL) using multi-pivot method to execute our experiment. We have considered English as the base language and three pivot languages (French, German and Spanish) to verify our claims. We have designed the simplified vocabulary from movies for younger audience. It has been observed that using the approach as described in our paper, an improvement of an average of 25% in ease of comprehension can be achieved.

AB The manual transcription process of Sign Language is a workintensive step which requires considerable effort to create Signs. Even, often the result of this step misses the natural aspect of motion to be conform to the natural human interpretation. In other words, the lack of the sign language annotated corpora is closely related to the difficulty of the sign creation task. In this paper, we propose a novel tool Sign(motion) for creating an annotated sign language corpus based on Natural Human Gestures: By overlaying a real signer motion onto an articulated 3D skeleton using Microsoft Kinect and Leap motion sensors. Signmotion is created to support the natural 3D facial expression, the natural 3D body posture and gives the possibility to annotate and analyze each sign and motion in the recorded animation. The resulting data and structure are precise enough to create and to store signs to be used for Sign Language data analysis or Machine Translation using virtual signer.

TI Parameterized verification of leader/follower systems via first-order
   temporal logic
SO FORMAL METHODS IN SYSTEM DESIGN
AB We introduce a framework for the verification of protocols involving a distinguished machine (referred to as a leader) orchestrating the operation of an arbitrary number of identical machines (referred to as followers) in a network. At the core of our framework is a high-level formalism capturing the operation of these types of machines together with their network interactions. We show that this formalism automatically translates to a tractable form of first-order temporal logic. Checking whether a protocol specified in our formalism satisfies a desired property (expressible in temporal logic) then amounts to checking whether the protocol's translation in first-order temporal logic entails that property. Many different types of protocols used in practice, such as cache coherence, atomic commitment, consensus, and synchronization protocols, fit within our framework. First-order temporal logic also facilitates parameterized verification by enabling us to model such protocols abstractly without referring to individual machines.

AB Nowadays with the development of industrial systems, engineers are having more difficulties to design complex systems, meaning that they have to conduct several simulations to design system models. In the case of safety assessment, this creates a need for the safety model to be consistent with the system engineering model, since both models are supposed to represent the same architecture. In this work we present a methodology for synchronisation of two kinds of state machines, Harel's Statecharts and Guarded Transition Systems. These formalisms are used to model system behavior respectively in MBSE (Model Based System Engineering) and MBSA (Model Based Safety Assessment) tools. This methodology, based on the SmartSync framework [1] that aims at asserting structural consistency between MBSE and MBSA, is composed of 3 steps: abstraction to a pivot formalism, comparison and concretization. We compare two mappings of concepts used for translation from our state machines to the S2ML language.

AB The compilation process is the process of translating programs written in high-level programming languages (source programs) into machine language (object programs). Source programs such as, pascal, basic, c++ while the program objects such as compilation files have an extension file such as*.exeor*.com.The file can run on its own without he help ofthe source program (the file has property executable). Translators are divided in to two types of interpreter sand compilers.Both functions are the same, the difference lies in the translation process. In this research, a compilation machine called Automatic Lessimic Analyzer which can be used as an analysis machine. There are two job descriptions of the analysis machine, in the front as an analysis and behind as a synthesis function. For example, a simple program is included (c++) can be analyzed successfully and it can detect errors as a source program. While at the end, it will generate code generation and program object optimization.

AB Sign Language Recognition (SLR) has been an active research field for the last two decades. However most research to date has considered SLR as a naive gesture recognition problem. SLR seeks to recognize a sequence of continuous signs but neglects the underlying rich grammatical and linguistic structures of sign language that differ from spoken language. In contrast, we introduce the Sign Language Translation (SLT) problem. Here, the objective is to generate spoken language translations from sign language videos, taking into account the different word orders and grammar.
   We formalize SLT in the framework of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) for both end-to-end and pretrained settings (using expert knowledge). This allows us to jointly learn the spatial representations, the underlying language model, and the mapping between sign and spoken language.
   To evaluate the performance of Neural SLT we collected the first publicly available Continuous SLT dataset, RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T(1). It provides spoken language translations and gloss level annotations for German Sign Language videos of weather broadcasts. Our dataset contains over .95M frames with >67K signs from a sign vocabulary of >1K and >99K words from a German vocabulary of >2.8K. We report quantitative and qualitative results for various SLT setups to underpin future research in this newly established field. The upper bound for translation performance is calculated at 19.26 BLEU-4, while our end-to-end frame-level and gloss-level tokenization networks were able to achieve 9.58 and 18.13 respectively.

AB We introduce Smart Shuffling, a cross-lingual embedding (CLE) method that draws from statistical word alignment approaches to leverage dictionaries, producing dense representations that are significantly more effective for cross-language information retrieval (CUR) than prior CLE methods. This work is motivated by the observation that although neural approaches are successful for monolingual IR, they are less effective in the cross-lingual setting. We hypothesize that neural CUR fails because typical cross-lingual embeddings "translate" query terms into related terms - i.e., terms that appear in a similar context - in addition to or sometimes rather than synonyms in the target language. Adding related terms to a query (i.e., query expansion) can be valuable for retrieval, but must be mitigated by also focusing on the starting query. We find that prior neural CUR models are unable to bridge the translation gap, apparently producing queries that drift from the intent of the source query.
   We conduct extrinsic evaluations of a range of CLE methods using CUR performance, compare them to neural and statistical machine translation systems trained on the same translation data, and show a significant gap in effectiveness. Our experiments on standard CUR collections across four languages indicate that Smart Shuffling fills the translation gap and provides significantly improved semantic matching quality. Having such a representation allows us to exploit deep neural (re-)ranking methods for the CUR task, leading to substantial improvement with up to 21% gain in MAP, approaching human translation performance. Evaluations on bilingual lexicon induction show a comparable improvement.

AB Recent advances in proactive cyber threat intelligence rely on early detection of cyber threats in hacker communities. Dark Net Markets (DNMs) are growing platforms in hacker community that provide hackers with highly specialized tools and products which may not be found in other platforms. While text classification techniques have been used for cyber threat detection in English DNMs, the task is hindered in non-English platforms due to the language barrier and lack of ground-truth data. Current approaches use monolingual models on machine translated data to overcome these challenges. However, the translation errors can deteriorate the classification results. The abundance of data in English DNMs can be leveraged in learning non-English threats without using machine translation. In this study, we show that a deep cross-lingual model that can jointly learn the common language representation from two languages, significantly outperforms a monolingual model learned on machine translated data for identifying cyber threats in non-English DNMs. Unlike most studies, our approach does not require any external data source such as bilingual word embeddings or bilingual lexicons. Our experiments on Russian DNMs show that this approach can achieve better performance than state-of-the-art methods for non-English cyber threat detection in malicious hacker community.

TI Kinematics analysis of a hybrid manipulator for computer controlled
   ultra-precision freeform polishing
SO ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING
AB As one of the final processing steps of precision machining, polishing process is a very key decision for surface quality. This paper presents a novel hybrid manipulator for computer controlled ultra-precision (CCUP) freeform polishing. The hybrid manipulator is composed of a three degree-of-freedom (DOF) parallel module, a two DOF serial module and a turntable providing a redundant DOF. The parallel module gives the workpiece three translations without rotations. The serial module holds the polishing tool and gives it no translations on the polishing contact area due to its particular mechanical design. A detailed kinematics model is established for analyzing the kinematics of the parallel module and the serial module, respectively. For the parallel module, the inverse kinematics, the forward kinematics, the Jacobian matrix, the workspace and the dexterity distribution are analyzed systematically. Workspaces are also investigated for varying structural parameters. For the serial module, the inverse kinematics, the forward kinematics, the workspace and the precession motion analysis are carried out. An example of saddle surface finishing with this manipulator is given and the movement of actuators with respect to this shape is analyzed theoretically. These analysis results illustrate that the proposed hybrid manipulator is a very suitable machine structure for CCUP freeform polishing, (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The world wide web is a natural setting for cross-lingual information retrieval. The European Union is a typical example of a multilingual scenario, where multiple users have to deal with information published in at least 20 languages. Given queries in some source language and a target corpus in another language, the typical approximation consists in translating either the query or the target dataset to the other language. Other approaches use parallel corpora to obtain a statistical dictionary of words among the different languages. In this work, we propose to use a training corpus made up by a set of Query-Relevant Document Pairs (QRDP) in a probabilistic cross-lingual information retrieval approach which is based on the IBM alignment model 1 for statistical machine translation. Our approach has two main advantages over those that use direct translation and parallel corpora: we will not obtain a translation of the query, but a set of associated words which share their meaning in some way and, therefore, the obtained dictionary is, in a broad sense, more semantic than a translation one. Besides, since the queries are supervised, we are working in a more restricted domain than that when using a general parallel corpus (it is well known that in this context results are better than those which are performed in a general context). In order to determine the quality of our experiments, we compared the results with those obtained by a direct translation of the queries with a query translation system, observing promising results.

AB Microscopy is commonly used in machining to study the effects of tool wear. In modern tool condition monitoring systems, the analytical capabilities are further enhanced by machine learning, allowing for automated segmentation of the various visible defects. The prevailing challenge, however, is the divergence among different use cases, as the visual properties of cutting tool images are influenced by many domain-specific factors such as the type of the cutting tool, the respective machining process, and the image acquisition unit. Thus, we propose the usage of automated domain adaptation so that existing training data from source domains can be used effectively to train segmentation models for novel target domains, while minimizing the need for newly labelled data. This is achieved through image-to-image translation using generative adversarial networks, which generate synthetic images with similar visual characteristics as the target domain based on existing masks of the source domains. Our validation shows that with as few as ten labelled images from the target domain, a sufficient prediction performance of 0.72 mIoU can be achieved when tested on unseen images from the target domain. This corresponds to a reduction of manual labelling efforts by two-thirds compared to conventional labelling and training methods. Thus, by adapting existing data, prediction performance is increased while expensive data generation is minimized.

TI Full-mobility 3-(C)under-barCC parallel-kinematics machines: Forward
   kinematics, singularity, workspace and dexterity analyses
SO MECHANISM AND MACHINE THEORY
AB The 3-(C) under bar CC class of parallel-kinematics machines (PKMs) bears many interesting features, as found in a previous paper on its optimum design. In this paper, its forward-kinematics (FK), singularity, workspace and dexterity analyses are studied. FK reveals that the rotation and translation of the moving platform (MP) are decoupled at the displacement level; moreover, a simple formulation is derived for the orientation subproblem that admits up to eight solutions, which is minimal; a quartic resolvent polynomial for the FK is then derived. All solutions thus can be found simultaneously in closed-form, while the computational cost is reduced; this brings robustness, especially when the robot operates near a singular configuration. Next, the translation problem is solved from a linear-equation system. These features, rare in six-dof PKMs, greatly simplify its simulation and control. Next, the singularity in question is shown to be determined solely by the orientation of the MP, thereby simplifying dramatically its evaluation and representation. Furthermore, the robot is shown to bear position and orientation workspaces of reasonable size, together with high dexterity. These features make the proposed PKM class quite promising in a variety of applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB More than other machine learning techniques, neural networks have been shown to excel at tasks where humans traditionally outperform computers: recognizing objects in images, distinguishing spoken words from background noise or playing "Go". These are hard problems, where hand-crafting solutions is rarely feasible due to their inherent complexity. Higher level program comprehension is not dissimilar in nature: while a compiler or program analysis tool can extract certain facts from (correctly written) code, it has no intrinsic `understanding' of the data and for the majority of real-world problems, a human developer is needed -for example to find and fix a bug or to summarize the bahavior of a method. We perform a pilot study to determine the suitability of neural machine translation (NMT) for processing plain-text source code. We find that, on one hand, NMT is too fragile to accurately tokenize code, while on the other hand, it can precisely recognize different types of tokens and make accurate guesses regarding their relative position in the local syntax tree. Our results suggest that NMT may be exploited for annotating and enriching out-of-context code snippets to support automated tooling for code comprehension problems. We also identify several challenges in applying neural networks to learning from source code and determine key differences between the application of existing neural network models to source code instead of natural language.

TI Neural spelling correction: translating incorrect sentences to correct
   sentences for multimedia
SO MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB The aim of a spelling correction task is to detect spelling errors and automatically correct them. In this paper we aim to perform the Korean spelling correction task from a machine translation perspective, allowing it to overcome the limitations of cost, time and data. Based on a sequence to sequence model, the model aligns its source sentence with an 'error filled sentence' and its target sentence aligned to the correct counter part. Thus, 'translating' the error sentence to a correct sentence. For this research, we have also proposed three new data generation methods allowing the creation of multiple spelling correction parallel corpora from just a single monolingual corpus. Additionally, we discovered that applying the Copy Mechanism not only resolves the problem of overcorrection but even improves it. For this paper, we evaluated our model upon these aspects: Performance comparisons to other models and evaluation on overcorrection. The results show the proposed model to even out-perform other systems currently in commercial use.

Optimal conditions were identified for high-resolution surface laser etching, and via drilling. Several practical applications were developed: glass templates for micro fluid diffraction devices, phase gratings for excimer laser projection techniques, micro fluid vertical channel-connectors, etc.. It is demonstrated that the interaction of ultrafast laser pulses with glass combines several different processes (direct ablation, explosive material ejection, and thermal material modification). A dynamic numerical model was developed for, this process. It was successfully used for modelling of laser micro-machining with arbitrary 3D translations of the target.

AB We propose a kind of admissible support vector kernel called spline wavelet kernel. This is based on the theory of multi-resolution analysis and support vector kernel function. In fact, spline wavelet kernels are the multi-dimensional spline wavelet function with translation vectors and dilation factors and they are a set of complete orthonormal bases in the square integral space. Hence, the support vector machine (SVM) with spline wavelet kernel can approximate almost any objective function in the square integral space theoretically. Thus, the generalization ability of the SVM is improved greatly. The results obtained by our simulations show that the regression's accuracy of SVM with spline wavelet kernel is significantly higher than that of SVM with Gaussian kernel under the same conditions.

TI Who is Best Suited for the Job? Task Allocation Process Between Teachers

AB Due to advances in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), computer systems are becoming increasingly intelligent and capable of taking on new tasks (e.g., automatic translation of texts). In education, such AI-powered smart machines (e.g., chatbots, social robots) have the potential to support teachers in the classroom in order to improve the quality of teaching. However, from a teacher's point of view, it may be unclear which subtasks could be best outsourced to the smart machine.
   Considering human augmentation, this paper presents a theoretical basis for the use of smart machines in education. It highlights the relative strengths of teachers and smart machines in the classroom and proposes a staged process for assigning classroom tasks. The derived task allocation process can be characterized by its three main steps of 1) break-down of task sequence and rethinking the existing task structure, 2) invariable task assignment (normative and technical considerations), and 3) variable task assignment (efficiency considerations). Based on the comparative strengths of both parties, the derived process ensures that subtasks are assigned as efficiently as possible (variable task assignment), while always granting priority to subtasks of normative importance (invariable task assignment). In this way, the derived task allocation process can serve as a guideline for the design and the implementation of smart machine projects in education.

TI Assessing the Usability of Raw Machine Translated Output: A

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION
AB This article reports on the results of a project that aimed to investigate the usability of raw machine translated technical support documentation for a commercial online file storage service. Adopting a user-centered approach, the ISO/TR 16982 definition of usabilitygoal completion, satisfaction, effectiveness, and efficiency is utilized and eye-tracking measures that are shown to be reliable indicators of cognitive effort are applied along with a posttask questionnaire. The study investigated these measures for the original user documentation written in English and in four target languages: Spanish, French, German, and Japanese, all of which were translated using a freely available online statistical machine translation engine. Using native speakers for each language, the study found several significant differences between the source and MT output, a finding that indicates a difference in usability between well-formed content and raw machine translated content. One target language in particular, Japanese, was found to have a considerably lower usability level when compared with the original English.

AB Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) is a technology to update a remote machine's memory without intervention at the receiver side. We evaluate where RDMA can be usefully applied and where it is a loss in Object-Oriented DSM systems. RDMA is difficult to use in modern OO-DSMs due to their support for large address spaces, advanced protocols, and heterogeneity. First, a communication pattern that is based on objects reduces the applicability of bulk RDMA. Second, large address spaces (meaning far larger than that of a single machine) and large numbers of machines require an address space translation scheme to map an object at different addresses on different machines. Finally, RDMA usage is hard since without polling (which would require source code modifications), incoming RDMA messages are hard to notice on time.
   Our results show that even with RDMA, update protocols are slower than invalidation protocols, But RDMA can be successfully applied to fetching of objects in an invalidation protocol and improves performance by 20.6%.

TI English-Welsh Cross-Lingual Embeddings
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Cross-lingual embeddings are vector space representations where word translations tend to be co-located. These representations enable learning transfer across languages, thus bridging the gap between data-rich languages such as English and others. In this paper, we present and evaluate a suite of cross-lingual embeddings for the English-Welsh language pair. To train the bilingual embeddings, a Welsh corpus of approximately 145 M words was combined with an English Wikipedia corpus. We used a bilingual dictionary to frame the problem of learning bilingual mappings as a supervised machine learning task, where a word vector space is first learned independently on a monolingual corpus, after which a linear alignment strategy is applied to map the monolingual embeddings to a common bilingual vector space. Two approaches were used to learn monolingual embeddings, including word2vec and fastText. Three cross-language alignment strategies were explored, including cosine similarity, inverted softmax and cross-domain similarity local scaling (CSLS). We evaluated different combinations of these approaches using two tasks, bilingual dictionary induction, and cross-lingual sentiment analysis. The best results were achieved using monolingual fastText embeddings and the CSLS metric. We also demonstrated that by including a few automatically translated training documents, the performance of a cross-lingual text classifier for Welsh can increase by approximately 20 percent points.

TI Early Detection of Lung Carcinoma Using Machine Learning
SO INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION AND SOFT COMPUTING
AB Lung cancer is a poorly understood disease. Smokers may develop lung cancer due to the inhalation of carcinogenic substances while smoking, but nonsmokers may develop this disease as well. Lung cancer can spread to other parts of the body and this process is called metastasis. Because the lung cancer is difficult to identify in the initial stages. The objective of this work is to reduce the mortality rate of the disease by identifying it at an earlier stage based on the existing symptoms. Artificial intelligence plays active roles in tasks such as entropy extraction through preprocessing strategies, ordinal to cardinal value conversions, table normalizations for easy meta computations, and preparation of machine learning tools for iterative processes to achieve rational convergence. The machine learning methodologies incorporated in this work are the cross-validation classification tree, random forest cross-validation classification, and random tree, all of which are included in an ensemble algorithm. The ensemble algorithm classifies lung cancer with maximum precision rates. The outcome of the classification provides 94.3% accuracy, which is the highest precision rate in comparison with the conventional methodologies. Semantics preprocessing of a lung cancer training set is performed with least entropy, and then translation, aggregation, and navigation based methodologies are applied for identifying the disease at its initial stage.

TI Angular interpolations for planar implicit curves
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB In multi-axis CNC machining, a cutting tool combines translation movements and rotational movements with respect to a workpiece. This entails CNC interpolation to take angular feedrates defining the speed of the rotational movement into account, while current interpolations are overwhelmingly based on linear federates defining the speed of the translation movement. The paper presents an approach using angular feedrate interpolations for planar tool paths in multi-axis machining, where a planar tool path is identified by a position curve assumed to be a planar implicit curve and a tool-orientation curve is obtained based on the position curve. The angular feedrate interpolations calculate the tool position and orientation at each sampling cycle based on specified angular feedrates and given tool paths. The paper relates analytically geometric properties of the prescribed path to two-dimensional rigid body motions along the path by angular feedrates and angular feed acceleration. The results are then used to develop the angular feedrate interpolation and improve the interpolation from the deviation analysis. The angular feedrate is further related to the linear feedrate and the contour error. Comparison between existing linear interpolation and proposed angular interpolation is also presented under the maximum allowed contour error constraint. Further simulations are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the interpolation scheme for complex curves.

AB Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a prominent subject which includes various subcategories such as text classification, error correction, machine translation, etc. Unlike other languages, there are limited number of Turkish NLP studies in literature. In this study, we apply text classification on Turkish documents by using n-gram features. Our algorithm applies different preprocessing techniques, namely, n-gram choice (character level or word level, bigram or trigram models), stemming, and use of punctuation, and then determines the Turkish document's author and genre, and the gender of the author. For this purpose, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines and Random Forest are used as classification techniques. Finally, we discuss the effects of above mentioned preprocessing techniques to the performance of Turkish text classification.

AB Support Vector Machines (SVMS) are efficient tools, which have been widely studied and used in many fields. However, original SVM (C-SVM) only focuses on the scatter between classes, but neglects the global information about the data which are also vital for an optimal classifier. Therefore, C-SVM loses some robustness. To solve this problem, one approach is to translate (i.e., to move without rotation or change of shape) the hyperplane according to the global characteristics of the data. However, parts of existing work using this approach are based on specific distribution assumption (S-SVM), while the rest fail to utilize the global information (GS-SVM). In this paper, we propose a simple but efficient method based on weighted scatter degree (WSD-SVM) to embed the global information into GS-SVM without any distribution assumptions. A comparison of WSD-SVM, C-SVM and GS-SVM is conducted, and the results on several data sets show the advantages of WSD-SVM.

The outputs of PCNN represent unique features of original stimulus and are invariant to translation, rotation, scaling and distortion, which is particularly suitable for feature extraction. In this paper, PCNN and intersecting cortical model (ICM), which is a simplified version of PCNN model, are applied to extract geometrical changes of rotation and scale invariant texture features, then an one-class support vector machine based classification method is employed to train and predict the features. The experimental results show that the pulse features outperform of the classic Gabor features in aspects of both feature extraction time and retrieval accuracy, and the proposed one-class support vector machine based retrieval system is more accurate and robust to geometrical changes than the traditional Euclidean distance based system.

AB Binary translation has been widely used as object code migration across different architectures. Most current works are targeted towards running an existing (old architecture) binary version of a complex application on a newer architecture and so availability of resources is not a problem. In this paper we propose a technique called RABIT for emulating a newer architecture's binary on an older one. RABIT will allow the consumers to emulate the applications developed for newer hardware on their older machines by incurring some performance trade-offs. This way the needy consumers can take advantage of the newer software features on their existing machines before they decide to upgrade them to later models. In situations where the newer hardware is in place, our technique can be used to run applications redundantly on the older machine for dependability analysis. It also provides the CPU architects with an instruction-level simulator to test the design and stability of a new CPU before the new hardware is actually in place. RABIT's design consists of a translator an interpreter and a set of operating system services. To deal with the less amount of resources like registers in the older architecture as compared to the newer ones, we present a new register allocation algorithm. The feasibility of the technique is established by simulating RABIT for its performance.

AB This paper describes a monocular vision-based obstacle detection method for a mobile robot using a support vector machine (SVM). A single camera is mounted on the front of a mobile robot and an SVM is trained to classify obstacles as they are encountered by the robot. Since it is not possible to train on all obstacle types a-priori, a one-class SVM is used to learn the appearance of the floor in the absence of obstacles. Anything that is not recognized as a floor is classified as an obstacle. To improve robustness in recognizing floor features, images are preprocessed using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to provide translation invariance. Experimental results indicate high accuracy and specificity for four different floor surfaces that were tested.

Ideally, these are basic vocabulary units suitable for different tasks, such as text understanding, machine translation, information retrieval, and statistical language modeling. Because in unsupervised morpheme analysis the morphemes can have arbitrary names, the analyses are here evaluated by a comparison to a linguistic gold standard by matching the morphemesharing word pairs. The data sets were provided for four languages: Finnish, German, English, and Turkish and the participants were encouraged to apply their algorithm to all of them. The results show significant variance between the methods and languages, but the best methods seem to be useful in all tested languages and match quite well with the linguistic analysis.

AB Part-of-speech tagging is the basis of Natural Language Processing, and is widely used in information retrieval, text processing and machine translation fields. The traditional statistical machine learning methods of POS tagging rely on the high quality training data, but obtaining the training data is very time-consuming. The methods of POS tagging based on dictionaries ignore the context information, which lead to lower performance. This paper proposed a POS tagging approach which combines methods based on dictionaries and traditional statistical machine learning. The experimental results show that the approach not only can solve the problem that the training data are insufficient in statistical methods, but also can improve the performance of the methods based on dictionaries. The People's Daily corpus in January 1998 is used as testing data, and the accurate rate of POS tagging achieves 95.80%. For the ambiguity word POS tagging, the accuracy achieves 88%.

TI Global Translation of Classification Models
SO INFORMATION
AB The widespread and growing usage of machine learning models, particularly for critical areas such as law, predicate the need for global interpretability. Models that cannot be audited are vulnerable to biases inherited from the datasets that were used to develop them. Moreover, locally interpretable models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To address this issue, the present paper proposes a new methodology that can translate any existing machine learning model into a globally interpretable one. MTRE-PAN is a hybrid SVM-decision tree architecture that leverages the interpretability of linear hyperplanes by creating a set of polygons that delimit the decision boundaries of the target model. Moreover, the present paper introduces two new metrics: certain and boundary model parities. These metrics can be used to accurately evaluate the performance of the interpretable model near the decision boundaries. These metrics are used to compare MTRE-PAN to a previously proposed interpretable architecture called TRE-PAN. As in the case of TRE-PAN, MTRE-PAN aims at providing global interpretability. The comparisons are performed over target models developed using three benchmark datasets: Abalone, Census and Diabetes data. The results show that MTRE-PAN generates interpretable models that have a lower number of leaves and a higher agreement with the target models, especially around the most important regions in the feature space, namely the decision boundaries.

AB Recent high-profile successes in machine learning have found solutions to problems that were long-thought to be decades away and has generated renewed interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) research. For example, the recent success and rapid commercialization of deep learning has catapulted technical achievements in many fields, including computer vision, speech recognition, games, and machine translation. These successes present new opportunities for advancing nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques. This paper review's the fundamental concepts of ML and their underlying connections to statistics. We then discuss past applications and methods of ML for NDE. We also describe the still unresolved challenges for this field, such as the unavailability of reliable training data. We then discuss current research in ML for NDE that is directed toward solving these challenges. Finally, we outline how the most recent advances in ML, such as deep learning and transfer learning, have the potential to revolutionize how we design future NDE solutions.

AB A robotic automatic welding system is constructed for welding golf heads. This system uses machine vision technique to recognize the weldseam and generated welding path for the robot. The location of the weldseam is discovered by applying a Sobel mask to the captured data. Laplace mask is also useful to filter out the noise points due to the scatter light refraction of tack-welding spots. The weldseam is then replenished anti smoothed out by B-spline curve fitting. The task frame of the weldseam is computed by finding the tangent, normal, and bi-normal of the curve. The robotic welding path is obtained by further rotations and translation along the axes of the task frame according to the requirement of the welding attitude. The developed machine vision technique and the mathematic framework pertaining to the generation of welding task frame can readily be used for various three-dimensional welding.

AB Named entity recognition (NER) is an important and very effective for the Machine Translation, Retrieval (IR), Information Extraction (IE) from huge corpus, Question Answering (QA) system, text Mining and text clustering and etc. NER help us to classify or identify the Noun and its types such place / location, people, department, Ministry, organization, times and etc. The huge data available on social Media, websites, news channels and many more sources can be classified so that it can be used in research for NLP processes such as in Machine Translation, Speech Technology, Information Extraction and etc. To process this huge data or corpus we propose recent technics of Machine Learning and Deep Neural Network. The Deep Neural Network approach will help to identify the Named entity (NE) from huge corpus or text by training the corpus using Word2vec approach. On the basis of fetched tokens and tag.
   we categorize these tokens into different Grammar categories based of cosine similarity concept of Deep Neural Network. Cosine similarity help to find the tag of unknown token or phases by finding its neared Vectors which are not trained earlier in Word2vec database. We have used the supervised learning (SL) technics to train the network.

AB We study the online version of the scheduling problem involving selfish agents considered by Archer and Tardos [FOCS 2001]: jobs must be scheduled on m, parallel related machines, each of them owned by a different selfish agent.
   Our study focuses on general techniques to translate approximation/competitive algorithms into equivalent approximation/competitive truthful mechanisms. Our results show that this translation is more problematic in the online setting than in the offline one. For m = 2, we develop an offline and an online "translation" technique which, given any rho-approximation/competitive (polynomial-time) algorithm, yields an f(rho)-approximation/competitive (polynomial-time) mechanism, with f (rho) = rho(1 + epsilon) in the offline case, for every epsilon > 0. By contrast, one of our lower bounds implies that, in general, online p-competitive algorithms cannot be turned into rho(1 + epsilon)-competitive mechanisms, for some epsilon > 0 and every m >= 2.
   We also investigate the issue of designing new online algorithms from. scratch so to obtain efficient competitive mechanisms, and prove some lower bounds on a class of "natural" algorithms. Finally, we consider the variant introduced by Nisan and Ronen [STOC 1999] in which machines can be verified. For this model, we give a O(1)-competitive online mechanism for any number of machines and prove that some of the above lower bounds can be broken.

TI Investigating the Lack of Translation from Cruzain Inhibition to
   Trypanosoma cruzi Activity with Machine Learning and Chemical Space
   Analyses
SO CHEMMEDCHEM
AB Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by the protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi. Cruzain, its main cysteine protease, is commonly targeted in drug discovery efforts to find new treatments for this disease. Even though the essentiality of this enzyme for the parasite has been established, many cruzain inhibitors fail as trypanocidal agents. This lack of translation from biochemical to biological assays can involve several factors, including suboptimal physicochemical properties. In this work, we aim to rationalize this phenomenon through chemical space analyses of calculated molecular descriptors. These include statistical tests, visualization of projections, scaffold analysis, and creation of machine learning models coupled with interpretability methods. Our results demonstrate a significant difference between the chemical spaces of cruzain and T. cruzi inhibitors, with compounds with more hydrogen bond donors and rotatable bonds being more likely to be good cruzain inhibitors, but less likely to be active on T. cruzi. In addition, cruzain inhibitors seem to occupy specific regions of the chemical space that cannot be easily correlated with T. cruzi activity, which means that using predictive modeling to determine whether cruzain inhibitors will be trypanocidal is not a straightforward task. We believe that the conclusions from this work might be of interest for future projects that aim to develop novel trypanocidal compounds.

TI Text Compression-Aided Transformer Encoding
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Text encoding is one of the most important steps in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It has been done well by the self-attention mechanism in the current state-of-the-art Transformer encoder, which has brought about significant improvements in the performance of many NLP tasks. Though the Transformer encoder may effectively capture general information in its resulting representations, the backbone information, meaning the gist of the input text, is not specifically focused on. In this paper, we propose explicit and implicit text compression approaches to enhance the Transformer encoding and evaluate models using this approach on several typical downstream tasks that rely on the encoding heavily. Our explicit text compression approaches use dedicated models to compress text, while our implicit text compression approach simply adds an additional module to the main model to handle text compression. We propose three ways of integration, namely backbone source-side fusion, target-side fusion, and both-side fusion, to integrate the backbone information into Transformer-based models for various downstream tasks. Our evaluation on benchmark datasets shows that the proposed explicit and implicit text compression approaches improve results in comparison to strong baselines. We therefore conclude, when comparing the encodings to the baseline models, text compression helps the encoders to learn better language representations.

AB Virtualization provides benefits for many workloads, but the overheads of virtualizing memory are not universally low. The cost comes from managing two levels of address translation-one in the guest virtual machine (VM) and the other in the host virtual machine monitor (VMM)-with either nested or shadow paging. Nested paging directly performs a two-level page walk that makes TLB misses slower than unvirtualized native, but enables fast page tables changes. Alternatively, shadow paging restores native TLB miss speeds, but requires costly VMM intervention on page table updates.
   This paper proposes agile paging that combines both techniques and exceeds the best of both. A virtualized page walk starts with shadow paging and optionally switches in the same page walk to nested paging where frequent page table updates would cause costly VMM interventions. Agile paging enables most TLB misses to be handled as fast as native while most page table changes avoid VMM intervention. It requires modest changes to hardware (e.g., demark when to switch) and VMM policies (e.g., predict good switching opportunities).
   We emulate the proposed hardware and prototype the software in Linux with KVM on x86-64. Agile paging performs more than 12% better than the best of the two techniques and comes within 4% of native execution for all workloads.

TI Support Vector Machine-based Denoising Technique for Removal of White
   Noise in Partial Discharge Signal
SO ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS
AB Abstract-Partial discharge (PD) measurement has emerged as a dominant investigative tool for condition monitoring of insulation in high voltage equipment. In general, PD signals are severely polluted by several noises like white noise, random noise, discrete spectral interferences (DSI). The challenge lies with removing these noises from PD signal effectively by preserving the signal features. In this article, support vector machine (SVM) based denoising technique has been proposed for the removal of white noise from PD signal. The proposed SVM technique retains the edge of the original signal efficiently and also pseudo Gibbs phenomenon does not exist with SVM technique. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, artificially simulated PD signal mixed with white noise and the measured PD readings are considered. For the purpose of comparison, other denoising techniques such as fast Fourier transform (FFT), discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and translation invariant wavelet transform (TIWT) are also considered. The results reveal that, SVM based denoising technique shows better performance in terms of higher signal to noise ratio, signal reconstruction error ratio, cross correlation coefficient and reduction in noise level, mean square error, and waveform distortion.

TI Improving Clinical Translation of Machine Learning Approaches Through
   Clinician-Tailored Visual Displays of Black Box Algorithms: Development
   and Validation
SO JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS
AB Background: Despite the promise of machine learning (ML) to inform individualized medical care, the clinical utility of ML in medicine has been limited by the minimal interpretability and black box nature of these algorithms.
   Objective: The study aimed to demonstrate a general and simple framework for generating clinically relevant and interpretable visualizations of black box predictions to aid in the clinical translation of ML.
   Methods: To obtain improved transparency of ML, simplified models and visual displays can be generated using common methods from clinical practice such as decision trees and effect plots. We illustrated the approach based on postprocessing of ML predictions, in this case random forest predictions, and applied the method to data from the Left Ventricular (LV) Structural Predictors of Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) Registry for individualized risk prediction of SCD, a leading cause of death.
   Results: With the LV Structural Predictors of SCD Registry data, SCD risk predictions are obtained from a random forest algorithm that identifies the most important predictors, nonlinearities, and interactions among a large number of variables while naturally accounting for missing data. The black box predictions are postprocessed using classification and regression trees into a clinically relevant and interpretable visualization. The method also quantifies the relative importance of an individual or a combination of predictors. Several risk factors (heart failure hospitalization, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging indices, and serum concentration of systemic inflammation) can be clearly visualized as branch points of a decision tree to discriminate between low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients.
   Conclusions: Through a clinically important example, we illustrate a general and simple approach to increase the clinical translation of ML through clinician-tailored visual displays of results from black box algorithms. We illustrate this general model-agnostic framework by applying it to SCD risk prediction. Although we illustrate the methods using SCD prediction with random forest, the methods presented are applicable more broadly to improving the clinical translation of ML, regardless of the specific ML algorithm or clinical application. As any trained predictive model can be summarized in this manner to a prespecified level of precision, we encourage the use of simplified visual displays as an adjunct to the complex predictive model. Overall, this framework can allow clinicians to peek inside the black box and develop a deeper understanding of the most important features from a model to gain trust in the predictions and confidence in applying them to clinical care.

TI Importance of transducer displacement and tilting on three-dimensional
   echocardiographic volume assessment using apical or off-axis rotational
   acquisition: An in vitro study
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY
AB Objective. The goal of this study was to assess effects of translation (horizontal displacement) and angulation (transducer tilting) on 3-dimensional (3D) echocardiographic volumes of both balloons and human left ventricles after autopsy.
   Methods. Six water-filled (non-) aneurysmatic balloons of 150, 250, and 350 ml, and 3 hearts of different sizes and shapes were suspended upright in a water bath. Angulation and/or translation was performed respectively by tilting the transducer with a mechanical arm in a vertical plane relative to the balloon tip or true apex of the hearts and by shifting the water bath in the same vertical plane. For balloon and left ventricular (LV) volume assessment, a 3D conical data set was obtained by TomTec rotational acquisition in combination with a HP Sonos 5500 ultrasound machine.
   Results: For the 6 balloons, translation from 1 to 4 cm yielded volumes of up to 74% of the optimal volume (100%); angulation of 10 degrees or 20 degrees, volumes of up to 80% and 34%. Translation with 10-degree angulation yielded volumes up to 64%; for 20-degree angulation and translation, there was no volume loss. Results were similar for the left ventricles.
   Conclusions. Even minor angulation or translation of the transducer yields substantial underestimation of the true volume. Off-axis para-apical views, however, defined as angulation of 20 degrees and greater than 0.5 cm translation in this in vitro model, obviate volume underestimation. Such views in patients, if obtainable, may be an attractive alternative for conventional apical 3D acquisition, especially in dilated and aneurysmatic hearts.

AB Attention-based sequence-to-sequence modeling provides a powerful and elegant solution for applications that need to map one sequence to a different sequence. Its success heavily relies on the availability of large amounts of training data. This presents a challenge for speech applications where labelled speech data is very expensive to obtain, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation (ST). In this study, we propose a general multi-task learning framework to leverage text data for ASR and ST tasks. Two auxiliary tasks, a denoising autoencoder task and machine translation task, are proposed to be co-trained with ASR and ST tasks respectively. We demonstrate that representing text input as phoneme sequences can reduce the difference between speech and text inputs, and enhance the knowledge transfer from text corpora to the speech to text tasks. Our experiments show that the proposed method achieves a relative 10 similar to 15% word error rate reduction on the English LIBRISPEECH task compared with our baseline, and improves the speech translation quality on the MUST-C tasks by 3.6 similar to 9.2 BLEU.

AB This paper discusses the design and implementation of a deconverter framework for the Malayalam Language. The Universal Networking Language or UNL facilitates translation between Natural Languages across the world. The paper focuses on the linguistic aspects of Malayalam required for the deconversion process. The case marking module handles the different UNL relations and their corresponding language features in Malayalam. A Morphological Generator takes care of generation of Malayalam words with the appropriate case endings and features, with respect to the cases and UNL attributes present in the UNL expression. The words are rearranged by the Syntax Planning Module to produce proper Natural Language sentences. These language dependent features for Malayalam have been successfully incorporated into a Deconverter Framework that handles English and Tamil currently. The Deconverter for Malayalam can currently produce simple Malayalam sentences and handle sentences with single clausal phrases also. It is being enhanced to handle more types of sentences. The present system is a small achievement towards attaining a complete translation facility for the Malayalam language. The following sections examine what has been implemented so far in the Deconverter and what more can be done to realize that dream of a translation facility.

SO TEXTO LIVRE-LINGUAGEM E TECNOLOGIA
AB Due to its morpho-phonological, morphosyntactic, lexical and other systems and subsystems of its functioning, the Arabic language represents a system of non-concatenation (or non-chaining of morphemes). It differs in this sense from Indo-European languages - with concatenation systems - and remains, so to speak, a fairly complex language to manage in the field of Automatic Language Processing (NLP). This, especially when it comes toautomatically translating language facts that carry cultural elements specific to that language. The data examined in this article is indicative of the gap resulting from an automatic translation of Arabic legal texts into to other languages such as French or English. The genetically different nature of the languages question not only poses problems of a linguistic nature in the passage from one language to another, but also and above all that the legal texts in the Arabic language carry semantic, cultural, religious and civilizational loads that do not always reflect the same referents or gestalt of the target languages. It is concluded that human intervention in this translation process is more than necessary as revealed by the study of legal texts in Saudi Arabia.

AB Document-level neural machine translation (DocNMT) achieves coherent translations by incorporating cross-sentence context. However, for most language pairs there's a shortage of parallel documents, although parallel sentences are readily available. In this paper, we study whether and how contextual modeling in DocNMT is transferable via multilingual modeling. We focus on the scenario of zero-shot transfer from teacher languages with document level data to student languages with no documents but sentence level data, and for the first time treat document-level translation as a transfer learning problem. Using simple concatenation-based DocNMT, we explore the effect of 3 factors on the transfer: the number of teacher languages with document level data, the balance between document and sentence level data at training, and the data condition of parallel documents (genuine vs. back-translated). Our experiments on Europarl-7 and IWSLT-10 show the feasibility of multilingual transfer for DocNMT, particularly on document-specific metrics. We observe that more teacher languages and adequate data balance both contribute to better transfer quality. Surprisingly, the transfer is less sensitive to the data condition, where multilingual DocNMT delivers decent performance with either back-translated or genuine document pairs.

SO AILA REVIEW
AB Key findings, analysis and recommendations that have emerged from a research project, 'Using Human Language Technology to enhance academic integrity, inclusivity, knowledge exchange, student diversity and retention' at the University of South Australia conducted in 2019 are discussed in this article. The primary purpose of the project was to address some of the challenges and opportunities afforded by increasing student and teacher diversity at a predominantly English-medium Australian university through newly enhanced human language translation technology (HLT) also known as machine translation (MT). This technology is frequently used for the translation of human language, and it falls under the umbrella of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. From the institution's perspective, key aims of the project were to contribute to the university's Digital Learning Strategy priorities and core values embedded in a structural transformation of the university. These include integrity, accountability, diversity, social justice, engagement and collaboration. The researchers' objectives focussed on multilingual pedagogics using HLT to support knowledge exchange (transknowledging), and translanguaging for all students. These disrupt inequitable hierarchies, and position bi-/multilingual students as valuable resources for monolingual staff and students.

SO RENAISSANCE STUDIES
AB This article examines the published translations into Italian (1701) and Spanish (1702) of Pierre Le Moyne's Gallerie des femmes fortes (1647). Through an analysis of a number of peritexts, rather than the text itself, it aims to examine how Le Moyne's Gallerie, a volume fundamentally rooted in the political, ideological and aesthetic climate of 1647 France, was appropriated in other socio-cultural and political climates. Freed from its original moment of creation and, to a lesser degree, from its creator, the book becomes a changing entity to be shaped at will by a new creator or creators, within a new set of sociocultural parameters. Analysis of the prologues, in particular, of translators Laura Maria Foschiera and Fernando Bravo de Lagunas y Bedoya, throws light on their respective socio-cultural contexts and intended readerships, and highlights the importance of peritexts in shaping the book-as-object and its reception. Of particular interest is the Lima translation (1702) largely believed to have been lost up until now.

CL Raleigh, NC
AB A fundamental challenge for engineering communication systems is the problem of transmitting information from the source to the receiver over a noisy channel. This same problem exists in a biological system. How can information required for the proper functioning of a cell, an organism, or a species be transmitted in an error introducing environment? Source codes (compression codes) and channel codes (error-correcting codes) address this problem in engineering communication systems. The ability to extend these information theory concepts to study information transmission in biological systems can contribute to the general understanding of biological communication mechanisms and extend the field of coding theory into the biological domain. In this work, we review and compare existing coding theoretic methods for modeling genetic systems. We introduce a new error-correcting code framework for understanding translation initiation, at the cellular level and present research results for Escherichia coli K-12. By studying translation initiation, we hope to gain insight into potential error-correcting aspects of genomic sequences and systems. Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of The Franklin Institute.

SO INTERPRETER AND TRANSLATOR TRAINER
AB This paper will draw on Gareth Morgan's management classic, Images of Organization, to explore how translation studies programmes are developed and administered at Mainz University in Germany. Morgan identifies various metaphors that can be used to interpret the ways in which organisations are structured and managed. In accordance with his suggestions for reading organisational life, I shall first provide a survey of how his entire range of metaphors can be applied to the management of translation studies programmes, and then proceed to integrate the insights gained by building two detailed storylines. Since there can be no single 'correct' interpretive frame, I shall create two alternative storylines based on the metaphors of organisations as machines and as organisms. My focus will be on the role played by two types of documents, assessment regulations and module handbooks, and by the university bodies involved in their production and administration. While Mainz University will serve as an example, the type of reading performed here can be applied to any university, and some of the specific issues discussed will be relevant to other universities in Germany as well as in other countries.

AB Despite the near-human performances already achieved on formal texts such as news articles, neural machine translation still has difficulty in dealing with "user-generated" texts that have diverse linguistic phenomena but lack large-scale high-quality parallel corpora. To address this problem, we propose a counterfactual domain adaptation method to better leverage both large-scale source-domain data (formal texts) and small-scale target-domain data (informal texts). Specifically, by considering effective counterfactual conditions (the concatenations of source-domain texts and the target-domain tag), we construct the counterfactual representations to fill the sparse latent space of the target domain caused by a small amount of data, that is, bridging the gap between the source-domain data and the target-domain data. Experiments on English-to-Chinese and Chinese-to-English translation tasks show that our method outperforms the base model that is trained only on the informal corpus by a large margin, and consistently surpasses different baseline methods by +1.12 similar to 4.34 BLEU points on different datasets. Furthermore, we also show that our method achieves competitive performances on cross-domain language translation on four language pairs.

AB This paper describes the submission to the IWSLT 2021 offline speech translation task by the UPC Machine Translation group. The task consists of building a system capable of translating English audio recordings extracted from TED talks into German text. Submitted systems can be either cascade or end-to-end and use a custom or given segmentation. Our submission is an end-to-end speech translation system, which combines pre-trained models (Wav2Vec 2.0 and mBART) with coupling modules between the encoder and decoder, and uses an efficient fine-tuning technique, which trains only 20% of its total parameters. We show that adding an Adapter to the system and pre-training it, can increase the convergence speed and the final result, with which we achieve a BLEU score of 27.3 on the MuST-C test set. Our final model is an ensemble that obtains 28.22 BLEU score on the same set. Our submission also uses a custom segmentation algorithm that employs pre-trained Wav2Vec 2.0 for identifying periods of untranscribable text and can bring improvements of 2.5 to 3 BLEU score on the IWSLT 2019 test set, as compared to the result with the given segmentation.

AB This paper is concerned with exploring efficient domain adaptation for the task of statistical machine translation, which is based on extracting sentence pairs (pseudo in-domain subcorpora, that are most relevant to the in domain corpora) from a large-scale general-domain web bilingual corpus. These sentences are selected by our proposed unsupervised phrase-based data selection model. Compared with the traditional bag-of-words models, our phrase-based data selection model is more effective because it captures contextual information in modeling the selection of phrase as a whole, rather than selection of single words in isolation. These pseudo in-domain subcorpora can then be used to train small domain-adapted spoken language translation system which outperforms the system trained on the entire corpus, with an increase of 1.6 BLEU points. Performance is further improved when we use these pseudo in-domain corpus/models in combination with the true in-domain corpus/model, with increases of 4.5 and 3.9 BLEU points over single in-and general-domain baseline system, respectively.

AB Knowledge Graphs are used in an increasing number of applications. Although considerable human effort has been invested into making knowledge graphs available in multiple languages, most knowledge graphs are in English. Additionally, regional facts are often only available in the language of the corresponding region. This lack of multilingual knowledge availability clearly limits the porting of machine learning models to different languages. In this paper, we aim to alleviate this drawback by proposing THOTH, an approach for translating and enriching knowledge graphs. THOTH extracts bilingual alignments between a source and target knowledge graph and learns how to translate from one to the other by relying on two different recurrent neural network models along with knowledge graph embeddings. We evaluated THOTH extrinsically by comparing the German DBpedia with the German translation of the English DBpedia on two tasks: fact checking and entity linking. In addition, we ran a manual intrinsic evaluation of the translation. Our results show that THOTH is a promising approach which achieves a translation accuracy of 88.56%. Moreover, its enrichment improves the quality of the German DBpedia significantly, as we report +18.4% accuracy for fact validation and +19% F1 for entity linking.

AB This paper describes CMU's submissions to the IWSLT 2022 dialect speech translation (ST) shared task for translating Tunisian-Arabic speech to English text. We use additional paired Modern Standard Arabic data (MSA) to directly improve the speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) components of our cascaded systems. We also augment the paired ASR data with pseudo translations via sequence-level knowledge distillation from an MT model and use these artificial triplet ST data to improve our end-to-end (E2E) systems. Our E2E models are based on the Multi-Decoder architecture with searchable hidden intermediates. We extend the Multi-Decoder by orienting the speech encoder towards the target language by applying ST supervision as hierarchical connectionist temporal classification (CTC) multi-task. During inference, we apply joint decoding of the ST CTC and ST autoregressive decoder branches of our modified Multi-Decoder. Finally, we apply ROVER voting, posterior combination, and minimum bayes-risk decoding with combined N-best lists to ensemble our various cascaded and E2E systems. Our best systems reached 20.8 and 19.5 BLEU on test2 (blind) and test1 respectively. Without any additional MSA data, we reached 20.4 and 19.2 on the same test sets.

SO LINGUISTICA ANTVERPIENSIA NEW SERIES-THEMES IN TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB We describe the results of a research project aimed at automatic detection of MT errors using state-of the-art MT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU. Currently, these automated metrics give only a general indication of translation quality at the corpus level and cannot be used directly for identifying gaps in the coverage of MT systems. Our methodology uses automatic detection of frequent multiword expressions (MWEs) in sentence-aligned parallel corpora and computes an automated evaluation score for concordances generated for such MWEs which indicates whether a particular expression is systematically mistranslated in the corpus. The method can be applied both to source and target MWEs to indicate, respectively, whether MT can successfully deal with source expressions, or whether certain frequent target expressions can be successfully generated. The results can be useful jar systematically checking the coverage of MT systems in order to speed up the development cycle of rule-based MT. This approach can also enhance current techniques for finding translation equivalents by distributional similarity and for automatically identifying features of MT-tractable language.

TI smFRET Study Progress in The Dynamics of Ribosome Translocation
SO PROGRESS IN BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS
AB Ribosome is a protein translation machine and the target of a variety of clinical antimicrobial drugs. Therefore, in-depth understanding of bacterial protein translation mechanism is of great significance. Translation consists of initiation, elongation, termination, and recycling, coordinating to achieve high fidelity and precise regulation. Translocation is one of the most important events in the process of translation, which requires large conformational changes of the ribosome as well as the precise movement of tRNA(2)-mRNA through ribosome. In bacteria, translocation is driven by elongation factor G that catalyzes the hydrolysis of GTP. The recent development in single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) makes it possible to study tRNA movements and observe the conformational dynamics of the ribosome in real time. Here, we review the recent smFRET study progress in the dynamics of ribosome translocation. These advances will provide much insights into the molecular details and dynamics of the ribosome complexes, shedding new light on the process of translocation.

AB Speech-to-text translation has many potential applications for low-resource languages, but the typical approach of cascading speech recognition with machine translation is often impossible, since the transcripts needed to train a speech recognizer are usually not available for low-resource languages. Recent work has found that neural encoder-decoder models can learn to directly translate foreign speech in high-resource scenarios, without the need for intermediate transcription. We investigate whether this approach also works in settings where both data and computation are limited. To make the approach efficient, we make several architectural changes, including a change from character-level to word-level decoding. We find that this choice yields crucial speed improvements that allow us to train with fewer computational resources, yet still performs well on frequent words. We explore models trained on between 20 and 160 hours of data, and find that although models trained on less data have considerably lower BLEU scores, they can still predict words with relatively high precision and recall around 50% for a model trained on 50 hours of data, versus around 60% for the full 160 hour model. Thus, they may still be useful for some low-resource scenarios.

AB This paper describes our scheme to translate spoken English lectures into Japanese consisting of an English automatic speech recognition system (ASR) that utilizes a deep neural network (DNN) and an English to Japanese phrase-based statistical machine translation system (SMT). We focused on domain adaptation of the acoustic and translation models. For domain adaptation of the translation model, frequently appearing English-phrases consisting of multiple words are extracted from transcripts of in-domain lectures based on n-gram words or a part of syntax tree. Then we translated the English phrases into Japanese-phrases by hand semi-automatically. These phrase pairs of source and target language are used to learn an SMT model for domain adaptation. An adaptation method directly inserts these phrase pairs into a phrase table or adds them to a parallel corpus. In the experiments, n-gram and syntax tree based methods are compared whilst extracting frequent English-phrases. Furthermore, the adapted phrase table and the parallel corpus are compared. When the frequent English and Japanese phrase pairs based on syntax tree were added to the phrase table, the baseline model was improved.

TI Cryo-EM structures of the 80S ribosomes from human parasites Trichomonas
   vaginalis and Toxoplasma gondii
SO CELL RESEARCH
AB As an indispensable molecular machine universal in all living organisms, the ribosome has been selected by evolution to be the natural target of many antibiotics and small-molecule inhibitors. High-resolution structures of pathogen ribosomes are crucial for understanding the general and unique aspects of translation control in disease-causing microbes. With cryo-electron microscopy technique, we have determined structures of the cytosolic ribosomes from two human parasites, Trichomonas vaginalis and Toxoplasma gondii, at resolution of 3.2-3.4 angstrom. Although the ribosomal proteins from both pathogens are typical members of eukaryotic families, with a co-evolution pattern between certain species-specific insertions/extensions and neighboring ribosomal RNA (rRNA) expansion segments, the sizes of their rRNAs are sharply different. Very interestingly, rRNAs of T. vaginalis are in size comparable to prokaryotic counterparts, with nearly all the eukaryote-specific rRNA expansion segments missing. These structures facilitate the dissection of evolution path for ribosomal proteins and RNAs, and may aid in design of novel translation inhibitors.

TI Analytical method for softness abrasive flow field based on discrete
   phase model
SO SCIENCE CHINA-TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Aiming at the problem of difficult contact finishing for mini structural surface in course of mould manufacturing, a new no-tool precision machining method based on soft abrasive flow machining (SAFM) was proposed. It allocated restrained component near surface machined, constituted restrained abrasive flow passage, and made the surface become a segment of passage wall. It could control turbulence abrasive flow in restrained passage, realize micro cutting for passage wall, and utilize the irregular motion of abrasive flow to eliminate the mono-directional marks on machined surfaces, and the precision could reach the specular level. A two-phase dynamic model of abrasive flow oriented to SAFM combined with discrete phase model (DPM) was established, the law of two-phase flow motion and the related physical parameters was obtained by corresponding numerical simulation method, and the mechanism of precision machining in SAFM was discussed. Simulation results show that the abrasive flow machining process mainly appears as translation of ablating location with the influence by granular pressure, and as the variation of machining efficiency with the influence by near-wall particle velocity. Thus via control of the inlet velocity and its corresponding machining time, it is supposed to work out the machining process according to the machining requirements by using the Preston equation to seek the relationship among velocity, pressure and material removing rate. By tracking near-wall particles, it can be confirmed that the movement of near-wall abrasive particles is similar to stream-wise vortices. The cutting traces on workpiece surfaces assume disorderly arrangement, so the feasibility of the SAFM method can be reaffirmed.

TI Toward a translational molecular ratchet: face-selective translation
   coincident with deuteration in a pseudo-rotaxane
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In the molecular world, molecular ratchets can realize the unidirectional movement in molecular machines. However, construction of artificial molecular ratchets has been still a great challenge. In this study, we investigate the formation of pseudo-rotaxane of a newly designed two-station axis molecule with alpha-cyclodextrin (alpha-CD) and the deuteration of acidic protons in the axis in D2O by H-1 NMR at varying temperatures. Using the NMR data, we roughly estimate apparent rate constants for association, dissociation, and translation of alpha-CD during the pseudo-rotaxane formation based on a simplified kinetic model. These rate constants are indicative of face-selective and ratchet-like translation of alpha-CD on the axis because of the 2-methylpyridinium residues in the axis. We also evaluate apparent first-order rate constants for the deuteration. Comparison of these rate constants indicates that the face-selective translation of alpha-CD somehow couples with the deuteration. On the basis of this study, it is concluded that a translational molecular ratchet can be constructed using a large energy gradient with appropriate energy barriers and an enthalpically-driven coupled reaction.

AB Word alignment models are used to generate word-aligned parallel text which is used in statistical machine translation systems. Currently, the most popular word alignment models are IBM models which have been widely applied in a large number of translation systems. The parameters of IBM models are estimated by using Maximum Likelihood principle, i.e. by counting the co-occurrence of words in the parallel text. This way of parameter estimation leads to the "ambiguity" problem when some words stand together in many sentence pairs but each of them is not translation of any other. Additionally, this method requires large amount of training data to achieve good results. However, parallel text which is used to train the IBM models is usually limited for low-resource languages. In this work, we try to solve these two problems by adding semantic information to the models. Our semantic information is derived from word embeddings which only need monolingual data to train. We deploy evaluation on a language pair that has great differences in grammar structure, English-Vietnamese. Even with this challenged task, our proposed models gain significant improvements in word alignment result and help increasing translation quality.

AB Spoken language processing (SLP) systems such as speech summarization and translation can be achieved by cascade models. It combines an automatic speech recognition (ASR) frontend and a natural language processing (NLP) backend including machine translation (MT) or text summarization (TS). With this cascade approach, we can exploit large non-paired datasets to independently train stateof-the-art models for each module. However, ASR errors directly affect the performance of the NLP backend in the cascade approach. In this paper, we reduce the impact of ASR errors on the NLP backend by combining transcriptions from various ASR systems. Recognizer output voting error reduction (ROVER) is a widely used technique for system combination. Although ROVER improves ASR performance, the combination process is not optimized for backend tasks. We propose a system combination that resembles ROVER using attention fusion to achieve the alignment and the combination of multiple ASR hypotheses. This allows the combination process to be optimized for the backend NLP task without changing the ASR frontend. Our proposed technique is general and can be applied to various SLP tasks. We confirm its effectiveness on both speech summarization and translation experiments.

TI Taking MT Evaluation Metrics to Extremes: Beyond Correlation with Human
   Judgments
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Automatic Machine Translation (MT) evaluation is an active field of research, with a handful of new metrics devised every year. Evaluation metrics are generally benchmarked against manual assessment of translation quality, with performance measured in terms of overall correlation with human scores. Much work has been dedicated to the improvement of evaluation metrics to achieve a higher correlation with human judgments. However, little insight has been provided regarding the weaknesses and strengths of existing approaches and their behavior in different settings. In this work we conduct a broad meta-evaluation study of the performance of a wide range of evaluation metrics focusing on three major aspects. First, we analyze the performance of the metrics when faced with different levels of translation quality, proposing a local dependency measure as an alternative to the standard, global correlation coefficient. We show that metric performance varies significantly across different levels of MT quality: Metrics perform poorly when faced with low-quality translations and are not able to capture nuanced quality distinctions. Interestingly, we show that evaluating low-quality translations is also more challenging for humans. Second, we show that metrics are more reliable when evaluating neural MT than the traditional statistical MT systems. Finally, we show that the difference in the evaluation accuracy for different metrics is maintained even if the gold standard scores are based on different criteria.

AB Machine translation (MT) models used in industries with constantly changing topics, such as translation or news agencies, need to adapt to new data to maintain their performance over time. Our aim is to teach a pre-trained MT model to translate previously unseen words accurately, based on very few examples. We propose (i) an experimental setup allowing us to simulate novel vocabulary appearing in human-submitted translations, and (ii) corresponding evaluation metrics to compare our approaches. We extend a data augmentation approach using a pre-trained language model to create training examples with similar contexts for novel words. We compare different fine-tuning and data augmentation approaches and show that adaptation on the scale of one to five examples is possible. Combining data augmentation with randomly selected training sentences leads to the highest BLEU score and accuracy improvements. Impressively, with only 1 to 5 examples, our model reports better accuracy scores than a reference system trained with on average 313 parallel examples.

AB Bilingual Named Entity Extraction is,important to some cross language information processes such as machine translation (MT), cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR), etc. A lot of previous work extracted bilingual Named Entities from parallel corpus. Here we propose a multi-feature based method to extract bilingual Named Entities from comparable corpus. We first recognize the, Chinese and English Named Entities respectively from the Chinese and English part of the comparable corpus. Then all the feature scores are calculated for every possible pair of Chinese and English Named Entities. At last we combine these feature scores together and decide which pairs are mutual translations. For translation score calculation, we didn't use the formula of IBM model I like previous approach. In stead, we used a modified edit distance to take the order of words into consideration. Experiment shows that-the F-score of this method increased by 11%. And with the multi-feature integration strategy encouraging results are obtained.

AB Computer vision has benefited from initializing multiple deep layers with weights pretrained on large supervised training sets like ImageNet. Natural language processing (NLP) typically sees initialization of only the lowest layer of deep models with pretrained word vectors. In this paper, we use a deep LSTM encoder from an attentional sequence-to-sequence model trained for machine translation (MT) to contextualize word vectors. We show that adding these context vectors (CoVe) improves performance over using only unsupervised word and character vectors on a wide variety of common NLP tasks: sentiment analysis (SST, IMDb), question classification (TREC), entailment (SNLI), and question answering (SQuAD). For fine-grained sentiment analysis and entailment, CoVe improves performance of our baseline models to the state of the art.

AB Dynamic binary translation (DBT) is a commonly used technology in virtual machines. Most DBT systems, like Dynamo, can only translate programs statically linked but not ones dynamically linked. Statically linked programs will lead to expansion of binary codes, which is the indirect reason of loss on performance. In this paper, we propose an approach to implement dynamic linking on DBT systems. During the research, we came across some challenges related with operating systems, compilation and architecture, which will be discussed later in detail. And we have developed a module and had it tested on our DBT system, CrossBit. The statistics show that CrossBit with dynamic linking reduces the number of translated blocks and execution time.

AB It is trendy that virtualization technology is adopted by server and desktop computers recently. Binary translation is an important method to implement full virtualization supporting any guest operating system without modification. Traditional methods use trap or interrupt to catch sensitive instruction's execution. Its performance is influenced by trap's context switch overhead. This article proposes a novel code scanning and replacing strategy, named as Block-based In-Place Replacement. BIPR tries to find a code block whose length is longer than 5 bytes and replaces the block with 5-bytes JMP instruction. The translated code block has same run-time mode as original code. As a result, BIPR's cost is lower than traditional trap methods. Moreover, it gives an optimize strategy, i.e. Super Block-based In-Place Replacement, to reduce unnecessary translation overhead of BIPR and get better performances. Experiment results prove that SBIPR performs pretty.

TI Investigating alignment interpretability for low-resource NMT
SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB The attention mechanism in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models added flexibility to translation systems, and the possibility to visualize soft-alignments between source and target representations. While there is much debate about the relationship between attention and the yielded output for neural models (Jain and Wallace 2019; Serrano and Smith 2019; Wiegreffe and Pinter 2019; Vashishth et al. 2019), in this paper we propose a different assessment, investigating soft-alignment interpretability in low-resource scenarios. We experimented with different architectures (RNN (Bahdanau et al. 2015), 2D-CNN (Elbayad et al. 2018), and Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017)), comparing them with regards to their ability to produce directly exploitable alignments. For evaluating exploitability, we replicated the Unsupervised Word Segmentation (UWS) task from Godard et al. (2018). There, source words are translated into unsegmented phone sequences. Posterior to training, the resulting soft-alignments are used for producing segmentation over the target side. Our results showed that a RNN-based NMT model produced the most exploitable alignments in this scenario. We then investigated methods for increasing its UWS scores by comparing the following methodologies: monolingual pre-training, input representation augmentation (hybrid model), and explicit word length optimization during training. We reached the best results by using the hybrid model, which uses an intermediate monolingual-rooted segmentation from a non-parametric Bayesian model (Goldwater 2007) to enrich the input representation before training.

AB An important concern in training multilingual neural machine translation (NMT) is to translate between language pairs unseen during training, i.e zero-shot translation. Improving this ability kills two birds with one stone by providing an alternative to pivot translation which also allows us to better understand how the model captures information between languages.
   In this work, we carried out an investigation on this capability of the multilingual NMT models. First, we intentionally create an encoder architecture which is independent with respect to the source language. Such experiments shed light on the ability of NMT encoders to learn multilingual representations, in general. Based on such proof of concept, we were able to design regularization methods into the standard Transformer model, so that the whole architecture becomes more robust in zero-shot conditions. We investigated the behaviour of such models on the standard IWSLT 2017 multilingual dataset. We achieved an average improvement of 2.23 BLEU points across 12 language pairs compared to the zero-shot performance of a state-of-the-art multilingual system. Additionally, we carry out further experiments in which the effect is confirmed even for language pairs with multiple intermediate pivots.

AB Cross-lingual text classification (CLTC) refers to the task of classifying documents in diffierent languages into the same taxonomy of categories. An open challenge in CLTC is to classify documents for the languages where labeled training data are not available. Existing approaches rely on the availability of either high-quality machine translation of documents (to the languages where massively training data are available), or rich bilingual dictionaries for effiective translation of trained classification models (to the languages where labeled training data are lacking). This paper studies the CLTC challenge under the assumption that neither condition is met. That is, we focus on the problem of translating classification models with highly incomplete bilingual dictionaries. Specifically, we propose two new approaches that combines unsupervised word embedding in diffierent languages, supervised mapping of embedded words across languages, and probabilistic translation of classification models. The approaches show significant performance improvement in CLTC on a benchmark corpus of Reuters news stories (RCV1/RCV2) in English, Spanish, German, French and Chinese and an internal dataset in Uzbek, compared to representative baseline methods using conventional bilingual dictionaries or highly incomplete ones.

TI An Improved Sign Language Translation Model with Explainable Adaptations
   for Processing Long Sign Sentences
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB Sign language translation (SLT) is an important application to bridge the communication gap between deaf and hearing people. In recent years, the research on the SLT based on neural translation frameworks has attracted wide attention. Despite the progress, current SLT research is still in the initial stage. In fact, current systems perform poorly in processing long sign sentences, which often involve long-distance dependencies and require large resource consumption. To tackle this problem, we propose two explainable adaptations to the traditional neural SLT models using optimized tokenization-related modules. First, we introduce a frame stream density compression (FSDC) algorithm for detecting and reducing the redundant similar frames, which effectively shortens the long sign sentences without losing information. Then, we replace the traditional encoder in a neural machine translation (NMT) module with an improved architecture, which incorporates a temporal convolution (T-Conv) unit and a dynamic hierarchical bidirectional GRU (DH-BiGRU) unit sequentially. The improved component takes the temporal tokenization information into consideration to extract deeper information with reasonable resource consumption. Our experiments on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline up to about 1.5+ BLEU-4 score gains.

TI Paraphrasing tools, language translation tools and plagiarism: an
   exploratory study
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EDUCATIONAL INTEGRITY
AB In a recent unit of study in an undergraduate Health Sciences pathway course, we identified a set of essays which exhibited similarity of content but demonstrated the use of bizarre and unidiomatic language. One of the distinct features of the essays was the inclusion of unusual synonyms in place of expected standard medical terminology.We suspected the use of online paraphrasing tools, but were also interested in investigating the possibility of the use of online language translation tools. In order to test the outputs of these tools, we used as a seed document a corpus of text which had been provided to the students as prompt for the essay. This document was put through six free online paraphrasing tools and six separate iterative language translations through the online Google Translate tool.The results demonstrated that free online paraphrasing tools did not identify medical terminology as standardised or accepted nomenclature and substituted synonyms, whereas Google Translate largely preserved medical terminology.We believe that textual indicators such as the absence of standard discipline-based terminology may be of assistance in the identification of machine paraphrased text.

TI Dynamic basis of fidelity and speed in translation: Coordinated
   multistep mechanisms of elongation and termination
SO PROTEIN SCIENCE
AB As the universal machine that transfers genetic information from RNA to protein, the ribosome synthesizes proteins with remarkably high fidelity and speed. This is a result of the accurate and efficient decoding of mRNA codons via multistep mechanisms during elongation and termination stages of translation. These mechanisms control how the correct sense codon is recognized by a tRNA for peptide elongation, how the next codon is presented to the decoding center without change of frame during translocation, and how the stop codon is discriminated for timely release of the nascent peptide. These processes occur efficiently through coupling of chemical energy expenditure, ligand interactions, and conformational changes. Understanding this coupling in detail required integration of many techniques that were developed in the past two decades. This multidisciplinary approach has revealed the dynamic nature of translational control and uncovered how external cellular factors such as tRNA abundance and mRNA modifications affect the synthesis of the protein product. Insights from these studies will aid synthetic biology and therapeutic approaches to translation.

AB Dynamic binary translation (DBT) is a powerful technique with several important applications. System-level binary translators have been used for implementing a Virtual Machine Monitor [2] and for instrumentation in the OS kernel [10]. In current designs, the performance overhead of binary translation on kernel-intensive workloads is high. e.g., over 10x slowdowns were reported on the syscall nanobenchmark in [2], 2-5x slowdowns were reported on lmbench microbenchmarks in [10]. These overheads are primarily due to the extra work required to correctly handle kernel mechanisms like interrupts, exceptions, and physical CPU concurrency.
   We present a kernel-level binary translation mechanism which exhibits near-native performance even on applications with large kernel activity. Our translator relaxes transparency requirements and aggressively takes advantage of kernel invariants to eliminate sources of slowdown. We have implemented our translator as a loadable module in unmodified Linux, and present performance and scalability experiments on multiprocessor hardware. Although our implementation is Linux specific, our mechanisms are quite general; we only take advantage of typical kernel design patterns, not Linux-specific features. For example, our translator performs 3x faster than previous kernel-level DBT implementations while running the Apache web server.

AB Applying the Transformer architecture on the character level usually requires very deep architectures that are difficult and slow to train. These problems can be partially overcome by incorporating a segmentation into tokens in the model. We show that by initially training a subword model and then finetuning it on characters, we can obtain a neural machine translation model that works at the character level without requiring token segmentation. We use only the vanilla 6-layer Transformer Base architecture. Our character-level models better capture morphological phenomena and show more robustness to noise at the expense of somewhat worse overall translation quality. Our study is a significant step towards highperformance and easy to train character-based models that are not extremely large.

TI Quantum Supremacy for Simulating a Translation-Invariant Ising Spin
   Model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We introduce an intermediate quantum computing model built from translation-invariant Ising-interacting spins. Despite being nonuniversal, the model cannot be classically efficiently simulated unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. Equipped with the intrinsic single-instance-hardness property, a single fixed unitary evolution in our model is sufficient to produce classically intractable results, compared to several other models that rely on implementation of an ensemble of different unitaries (instances). We propose a feasible experimental scheme to implement our Hamiltonian model using cold atoms trapped in a square optical lattice. We formulate a procedure to certify the correct functioning of this quantum machine. The certification requires only a polynomial number of local measurements assuming measurement imperfections are sufficiently small.

AB In this paper, we present the results of an unmanned ground vehicle robot development effort completed at NASA LaRC's Robotics and Intelligent Machines Lab. The low-cost robot, named Mobius, was developed as part of an investigation into novel omnidirectional locomotion technologies. The vehicle is equipped with lightweight Mecanum (a.k.a. Swedish) wheels. Operator input is provided using a commercial joystick and wireless link. Directional commands are converted to a 45-degree rotated coordinate system, leading to a simple and intuitive mathematical solution for teleoperable Mecanum-wheel-based platforms. A high-level processor running Linux serves to input user commands, output sensor data, and perform translation on incoming direction values. Sensors include dual pan-and-tilt color cameras providing real-time mono and stereoscopic video feedback. At the microcontroller level, a simple fuzzy logic algorithm has been implemented for wheel speed control. The robot platform is capable of performing complete 360-degree translation, bidirectional rotation, and simultaneous translation with rotation.

AB N-best reranking in statistical machine translation (SMT) aims to rescore the possible translation hypotheses such that the best hypothesis appears on the top of the list. The current models either use the standard features (a.k.a model features) that are derived from the SMT decoder or the manually crafted features for reranking. However, in practice, the results are disappointing which had only very small effect on the overall performance. In this paper, we investigate using additional semantic and syntactic feature representations to the reranking framework, with the goal to better capture the differences between best hypothesis and others. These representations are the sentence embeddings that are learned using the recursive autoencoder (RAE). The proposed features are extensively evaluated with various reranking algorithms on WMT2015 French-to-English translation data. The empirical results reveal that the proposed reranking model is able to yield an additional improvement of 1.23 BLEU points over the baseline SMT system.

AB In order to construct a good machine translation system or make any natural language processing research for cross language information retrieval you must have a good parallel corpus. Internet archive contains a lot of parallel documents. To construct a good parallel corpus from the Internet archive, you must have a good bilingual dictionary. This paper describes an algorithm to automatically extract an English/ Arabic bilingual dictionary from parallel texts that exist in the Internet archive. The system should preferably be useful for many different language pairs. Unlike most of the systems done, our system can extract translation pairs from a very small parallel corpus. This new system can extract translations from only two sentences in one language and two sentences in the other language if the requirements of the system accomplished. Moreover, this system is able to extract word pairs that are translation of each other and the explanation of the Arabic or English word in the other language as well. The accuracy of the system is 59.1% in the case of one English word translated to one Arabic word, 23.9% in the case of one English word translated to more than one Arabic word (Arabic phrase), and 14.6% in the case of one Arabic word translated to more than one English word (English phrase).

AB The industry practice for night video surveillance is to use auxiliary near-infrared (NIR) LEDs, usually centered at 850nm or 940nm, for scene illumination. NIR LEDs are used to save power consumption while hiding the surveillance coverage area from naked human eyes. The captured images are almost monochromatic, and visual color and texture tend to disappear, which hinders human and machine perception. A few existing studies have tried to convert such NIR images to RGB images through deep learning, which can not provide satisfying results, nor generalize well beyond the training dataset. In this paper, we aim to break the fundamental restrictions on reliable NIR-to-RGB (NIR2RGB) translation by examining the imaging mechanism of single-chip silicon-based RGB cameras under NIR illuminations, and propose to retrieve the optimal LED multiplexing via deep learning. Experimental results show that this translation task can be significantly improved by properly multiplexing NIR LEDs close to the visible spectral range than using 850nm and 940nm LEDs.

TI Methylation of ribosomal RNA by NSUN5 is a conserved mechanism
   modulating organismal lifespan
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Several pathways modulating longevity and stress resistance converge on translation by targeting ribosomal proteins or initiation factors, but whether this involves modifications of ribosomal RNA is unclear. Here, we show that reduced levels of the conserved RNA methyltransferase NSUN5 increase the lifespan and stress resistance in yeast, worms and flies. Rcm1, the yeast homologue of NSUN5, methylates C2278 within a conserved region of 25S rRNA. Loss of Rcm1 alters the structural conformation of the ribosome in close proximity to C2278, as well as translational fidelity, and favours recruitment of a distinct subset of oxidative stress-responsive mRNAs into polysomes. Thus, rather than merely being a static molecular machine executing translation, the ribosome exhibits functional diversity by modification of just a single rRNA nucleotide, resulting in an alteration of organismal physiological behaviour, and linking rRNA-mediated translational regulation to modulation of lifespan, and differential stress response.

AB The Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) was originally developed for data compression, but can also be applied to indexing text. In this paper, an adaptation of the BWT to word-based indexing of the training corpus for an example-based machine translation (EBMT) system is presented. The adapted BWT embeds the necessary information to retrieve matched training instances without requiring any additional space and can be instantiated in a compressed form which reduces disk space and memory requirements by about 40% while still remaining searchable without decompression.
   Both the speed advantage from O(log N) lookups compared to the O(N) lookups in the inverted-file index which had previously been used and the structure of the index itself act as enablers for additional capabilities and run-time speed. Because the BWT groups all instances of any n-gram together, it can be used to quickly enumerate the most-frequent n-grams, for which translations can be precomputed and stored, resulting in an order-of-magnitude speedup at run time.

TI BabelFish: Fusing Address Translations for Containers
SO IEEE MICRO
AB Cloud computing has begun a transformation from using virtual machines to using containers. Containers are attractive because of their "build once, run anywhere" computing model and their minimal performance overhead. Cloud providers leverage the lean nature of containers to run hundreds of them or more on a few cores. Furthermore, containers enable the serverless paradigm, which involves the creation of short-lived processes. In this work, we identify that containerized environments create page translations that are extensively replicated across containers in the TLB and in page tables. The result is high TLB pressure and redundant kernel work during page table management. To remedy this situation, this article proposes BabelFish, a novel architecture to share page translations across containers in the TLB and in page tables. BabelFish reduces the mean and tail latency of containerized workloads, cold-start effects of function execution, and container bring-up time. This work also advocates for the need to provide more hardware support for containerized and serverless environments.

AB We present MeetDot, a videoconferencing system with live translation captions overlaid on screen. The system aims to facilitate conversation between people who speak different languages, thereby reducing communication barriers between multilingual participants. Currently, our system supports speech and captions in 4 languages and combines automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) in a cascade. We use the retranslation strategy to translate the streamed speech, resulting in caption flicker. Additionally, our system has very strict latency requirements to have acceptable call quality. We implement several features to enhance user experience and reduce their cognitive load, such as smooth scrolling captions and reducing caption flicker. The modular architecture allows us to integrate different ASR and MT services in our backend. Our system provides an integrated evaluation suite to optimize key intrinsic evaluation metrics such as accuracy, latency and erasure.

TI Optimizing wavelet neural networks using modified cuckoo search for
   multi-step ahead chaotic time series prediction
SO APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
AB Determining the optimal number of hidden nodes and their proper initial locations are essentially crucial before the wavelet neural networks (WNNs) start their learning process. In this paper, a novel strategy known as the modified cuckoo search algorithm (MCSA), is proposed for WNNs initialization in order to improve its generalization performance. The MCSA begins with an initial population of cuckoo eggs, which represent the translation vectors of the wavelet hidden nodes, and subsequently refines their locations by imitating the breeding mechanism of cuckoos. The resulting solutions from the MCSA are then used as the initial translation vectors for the WNNs. The feasibility of the proposed method is evaluated by forecasting a benchmark chaotic time series, and its superior prediction accuracy compared with that of conventional WNNs demonstrates its potential benefit.

AB In this work, we propose a flow-adapter architecture for unsupervised NMT. It leverages normalizing flows to explicitly model the distributions of sentence-level latent representations, which are subsequently used in conjunction with the attention mechanism for the translation task. The primary novelties of our model are: (a) capturing language-specific sentence representations separately for each language using normalizing flows and (b) using a simple transformation of these latent representations for translating from one language to another. This architecture allows for unsupervised training of each language independently. While there is prior work on latent variables for supervised MT, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses latent variables and normalizing flows for unsupervised MT. We obtain competitive results on several unsupervised MT benchmarks.

AB Subword units are an effective way to alleviate the open vocabulary problems in neural machine translation (NMT). While sentences are usually converted into unique subword sequences, subword segmentation is potentially ambiguous and multiple segmentations are possible even with the same vocabulary. The question addressed in this paper is whether it is possible to harness the segmentation ambiguity as a noise to improve the robustness of NMT. We present a simple regularization method, subword regularization, which trains the model with multiple subword segmentations probabilistically sampled during training. In addition, for better subword sampling, we propose a new subword segmentation algorithm based on a unigram language model. We experiment with multiple corpora and report consistent improvements especially on low resource and out-of-domain settings.

AB Higher-order recursion schemes are rewriting systems for simply typed terms and they are known to be equi-expressive with collapsible pushdown automata (CPDA) for generating trees. We argue that CPDA are an essential model when working with recursion schemes. First, we give a new proof of the translation of schemes into CPDA that does not appeal to game semantics. Second, we show that this translation permits to revisit the safety constraint and allows CPDA to be seen as Krivine machines. Finally, we show that CPDA permit one to prove the effective MSO selection property for schemes, subsuming all known decidability results for MSO on schemes.

AB Non-autoregressive translation (NAT) models, which remove the dependence on previous target tokens from the inputs of the decoder, achieve significantly inference speedup but at the cost of inferior accuracy compared to autoregressive translation (AT) models. Previous work shows that the quality of the inputs of the decoder is important and largely impacts the model accuracy. In this paper, we propose two methods to enhance the decoder inputs so as to improve NAT models. The first one directly leverages a phrase table generated by conventional SMT approaches to translate source tokens to target tokens, which are then fed into the decoder as inputs. The second one transforms source-side word embeddings to target-side word embeddings through sentence-level alignment and word-level adversary learning, and then feeds the transformed word embeddings into the decoder as inputs. Experimental results show our method largely outperforms the NAT baseline (Gu et al. 2017) by 5:11 BLEU scores on WMT14 English-German task and 4:72 BLEU scores on WMT16 English-Romanian task.

TI Smart sequential multilateration measurement strategy for volumetric
   error compensation of an extra-small machine tool
SO PRECISION ENGINEERING-JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETIES FOR
   PRECISION ENGINEERING AND NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Research on machine tools has mainly focused, during these last couple of decades, on methods of error mapping and compensation techniques in aim of improving their geometrical accuracy. Over the last ten years, new measurement methods based on tracking laser (TL) multilateration have appeared. These methods have generally been applied to large machine tools or coordinate measuring machines. However, compact extra-small (XXS) machines have rarely been approached. The aim of this paper is to provide an optimal experimental strategy for estimating volumetric errors and then compensating these machine tools in the best possible manner. The method is based on the sequential multilateration technique, using a TL. This study focuses on the calibration of the translation axes of a five-axis machine tool. In this work, the accuracy of the machine is defined as the mean error vector measured in the entire working volume of the machine. The influence of a great number of factors (TL positions, offset size, acquisition time, temperature, etc.) that could affect the accuracy of the machine tool is then studied. For that purpose, a Design of Experiment (DOE) is carried out to discriminate the effect of these parameters. A Screening process is thus first used to refine the set of factors. This set is then retained to obtain the Response Surface (RS) with its Statistical Confidence Boundaries (SCB). Finally, these factors are optimized to derive the smartest strategy for providing the smallest reduced residual volumetric error after compensation. The results of this optimization are validated by an experiment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In natural language processing, this problem arises in several areas of application, including natural language generation, speech recognition and machine translation. We present two tabular algorithms for parsing of non-recursive context-free grammars, and show that they perform well in practical settings, despite the fact that this problem is PSPACE-complete.

AB Various studies show that pretrained language models such as BERT cannot straightforwardly replace encoders in neural machine translation despite their enormous success in other tasks. This is even more astonishing considering the similarities between the architectures. This paper sheds some light on the embedding spaces they create, using average cosine similarity, contextuality metrics and measures for representational similarity for comparison, revealing that BERT and NMT encoder representations look significantly different from one another. In order to address this issue, we propose a supervised transformation from one into the other using explicit alignment and fine-tuning. Our results demonstrate the need for such a transformation to improve the applicability of BERT in MT.

AB We propose a bilingually-motivated segmenting framework for Chinese which has no clear delimiter for word boundaries. It involves producing Chinese tokens in line with word-based languages' words using a bilingual segmenting algorithm, provided with bitexts, and deriving a probabilistic tokenizing model based on previously annotated Chinese sentences. In the bilingual segmenting algorithm, we first convert the search for segmentation into a sequential tagging problem, allowing for a polynomial-time dynamic programming solution, and incorporate a control to balance mono- and bi-lingual information in tailoring Chinese sentences. Experiments show that our framework, applied as a pre-tokenization component, significantly outperforms existing segmenters in translation quality, suggesting our methodology supports better segmentation for bilingual NLP applications involving isolated languages such as Chinese.

TI The evolving role of ribosomes in the regulation of protein synthesis
SO ACTA BIOCHIMICA POLONICA
AB Maintenance of the cellular homeostasis is firmly linked with protein synthesis. Therefore, it is tightly controlled at multiple levels. An advancement in quantitative techniques, mainly over the last decade, shed new light on the regulation of protein production, which pointed the ribosome as a new player. Ribosomes are macromolecular machines that synthesize polypeptide chains using mRNA as a template. The enormous complexity of ribosomes provides many possibilities of changes in their composition and consecutively in their target specificity. However, it is not clear how this specialization is enforced by the cell and which stimuli provoke that diversity. This review presents an overview of currently available knowledge about ribosome heterogeneity, focusing on changes in protein composition, and their role in the control of translation specificity. Importantly, besides the potential advantage of ribosome-mediated regulation of protein synthesis, its failure can play a crucial role in disease development.

AB In statistical machine translation, single-word based models have an important deficiency; they do not take contextual information into account for the translation decision. A possible solution called Phrase-Based, consists in translating a sequence of words instead of a single word. We show how this approach obtains interesting results in some corpora. One shortcoming of the phrase-based alignment models is that they do not have the generalization capability in word reordering. A possible solution could be the template-based approach, which uses sequences of classes of words instead of sequences of words. We present a template-based alignment model that uses a Part Of Speech tagger for word classes. We also propose an improved model that combines both models. The basic idea is that if a sequence of words has been seen in training, the phrase-based model can be used; otherwise, the template-based model can be used. We present the results from different tasks.

SO TRANS-REVISTA DE TRADUCTOLOGIA
AB This In this contribution we will highlight the vulnerability of DeepL in relation to the automatic translation of cultural references in the legal field into Spanish, specifically the German legal term Landgericht. Inconsistencies at the semantic level mostly occur because the tool works from a sentence approach instead of a textual one. For this reason, we will give some didactic guidelines on how to deal with this problem in the classroom, especially in the post-editing phase. In this sense, we focus on four specific criteria: the material criterion, the composition criterion, the hierarchical criterion and the territorial criterion, and complete them with a multilevel textual analysis of the textual class in question (apostille). The ultimate aim is to offer the student a very complete guide so that he or she can face this challenge with guarantees. This is the partial result of a teaching innovation project led by the author of this article.

AB One of the most critical issues in translating Korean into other languages is the common use of empty arguments. Since even mandatory elements in Korean are often dropped unlike English, the missing elements should be resolved during translation to obtain grammatical sentences. In this paper, we focus on missing subjects in intra-sentential level, which can be regarded as the identification of subject sharing between clauses. In order to reflect syntactic information in resolving missing subjects, we use a parse tree kernel, a specialized convolution kernel. In experimental evaluation, syntactic information turns out to be positively related to the identification of subject shareness. Our method achieves an accuracy of 81.39% and outperforms the baseline system assuming that two adjacent clauses share a subject.

AB Machine Translation, an automated system that intakes the text from the source language as an input, applies some computation on that input and gives the equivalent text in the target language without any human involvement. This research work focuses on developing the models for English to Nepali sentence translation incorporating Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) with attention. Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) Score is calculated to evaluate the efficiency of the model. Different parameters has been used to test the model. The model has been tested with neural network layer 2 and 4 and with hidden units 128, 256 and 512. The GRU cells in encoder and decoder with attention with 2 layer of neural network and 512 hidden units appears to be better in translating the English sentences into Nepali sentences with highest BLEU score 12.3.

AB Inserting proper punctuation marks and deleting speech disfluencies are two of the most essential tasks in spoken language processing. This challenging task has prompted extensive research using various techniques, such as conditional random fields. Neural networks, however, are relatively under-explored for this task.
   Combining different modeling techniques with different advantages has the potential to lead to improvements. In this work, we first establish the performance of joint modeling of punctuation prediction and disfluency detection using neural networks. We then combine a conditional random fields based model and a neural networks based model log-linearly, and show that the combined approach outperforms both individual models, by 2.7% and 3.5% in F-score for speech disfluency and punctuation detection, respectively. When used as a preprocessing step to machine translation this also results in an improved translation quality of 2.5 BLEU points compared to the baseline and of 0.6 BLEU points compared to the non-combined model.

AB FORTRAN, a classical imperative language is mapped into IF1, a machine-independent dataflow graph description language with Single Assingment Semantics (SAS). Parafrase 2 (P2) is used as the front-end of our system. It parses the source code, generates an intermediate representation and performs several types of analysis. Our system extends the internal representation of P2 with two data structures: the Variable to Edge Translation Table and the Function to Graph Translation Table. It then proceeds to map the internal representation of P2 into IF1 code. The generated IF1 is then processed by the back-end of the Optimizing SISAL Compiler that generates parallel executables on multiple target platforms. We have tested the correctness and the performance of our system with several benchmarks. The results show that even on a single processor there is no performance degradation from the translation to SAS. Furthermore, it is shown that on a range of processors, reasonable speedup can be achieved.

TI Zero-shot domain paraphrase with unaligned pre-trained language models
SO COMPLEX & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB Automatic paraphrase generation is an essential task of natural language processing. However, due to the scarcity of paraphrase corpus in many languages, Chinese, for example, generating high-quality paraphrases in these languages is still challenging. Especially in domain paraphrasing, it is even more difficult to obtain in-domain paraphrase sentence pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for domain-specific paraphrase generation in a zero-shot fashion. Our approach is based on a sequence-to-sequence architecture. The encoder uses a pre-trained multilingual autoencoder model, and the decoder uses a pre-trained monolingual autoregressive model. Because these two models are pre-trained separately, they have different representations for the same token. Thus, we call them unaligned pre-trained language models. We train the sequence-to-sequence model with an English-to-Chinese machine translation corpus. Then, by inputting a Chinese sentence into this model, it could surprisingly generate fluent and diverse Chinese paraphrases. Since the unaligned pre-trained language models have inconsistent understandings of the Chinese language, we believe that the Chinese paraphrasing is actually performed in a Chinese-to-Chinese translation manner. In addition, we collect a small-scale English-to-Chinese machine translation corpus in the domain of computer science. By fine-tuning with this domain-specific corpus, our model shows an excellent capability of domain-paraphrasing. Experiment results show that our approach significantly outperforms previous baselines regarding Relevance, Fluency, and Diversity.

AB We present Grid Beam Search (GBS), an algorithm which extends beam search to allow the inclusion of pre-specified lexical constraints. The algorithm can be used with any model that generates a sequence (y) over cap = {y(0) ... y(T)}, by maximizing p(y vertical bar x) = Pi(t)p(y(t)vertical bar x; {y(0) ... y(t-1)}). Lexical constraints take the form of phrases or words that must be present in the output sequence. This is a very general way to incorporate additional knowledge into a model's output without requiring any modification of the model parameters or training data. We demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of Lexically Constrained Decoding by conducting experiments on Neural Interactive-Predictive Translation, as well as Domain Adaptation for Neural Machine Translation. Experiments show that GBS can provide large improvements in translation quality in interactive scenarios, and that, even without any user input, GBS can be used to achieve significant gains in performance in domain adaptation scenarios.

TI High-quality bilingual subtitle document alignments with application to
   spontaneous speech translation
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB In this paper, we investigate the task of translating spontaneous speech transcriptions by employing aligned movie subtitles in training a statistical machine translator (SMT). In contrast to the lexical-based dynamic time warping (DTW) approaches to bilingual subtitle alignment, we align subtitle documents using time-stamps. We show that subtitle time-stamps in two languages are often approximately linearly related, which can be exploited for extracting high-quality bilingual subtitle pairs. On a small tagged data-set, we achieve a performance improvement of 0.21 F-score points compared to traditional DTW alignment approach and 0.39 F-score points compared to a simple line-fitting approach. In addition, we achieve a performance gain of 4.88 BLEU score points in spontaneous speech translation experiments using the aligned subtitle data obtained by the proposed alignment approach compared to that obtained by the DTW based alignment approach demonstrating the merit of the time-stamps based subtitle alignment scheme.

TI Person name disambiguation on the web in a multilingual context
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Person Name Disambiguation on the Web is the problem of grouping web pages retrieved by a search engine when looking for a person name according to the individual they refer to. This problem has been addressed in a monolingual scenario where all the search results are written in the same language. However, search engines can also return links to web pages written in different languages. We study how to address multilingualism for this problem using the MC4WePS data set, a recent gold standard that includes real search results written in different languages. For this purpose, we first analyze the suitability of using a translation tool to treat multilingualism with two state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. Since the use of this kind of tools increases the processing time of the disambiguation process, we propose an approach to deal with multilingualism that generalizes the monolingual scenario and does not require any translation resources. Our approach obtains better results than the translation approaches with the gold standard, making it a competitive choice in a real scenario. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we propose a novel data augmentation method for attention-based end-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E-ASR), utilizing a large amount of text which is not paired with speech signals. Inspired by the back-translation technique proposed in the field of machine translation, we build a neural text-to-encoder model which predicts a sequence of hidden states extracted by a pre-trained E2E-ASR encoder from a sequence of characters. By using hidden states as a target instead of acoustic features, it is possible to achieve faster attention learning and reduce computational cost, thanks to sub-sampling in E2E-ASR encoder, also the use of the hidden states can avoid to model speaker dependencies unlike acoustic features. After training, the text-to-encoder model generates the hidden states from a large amount of unpaired text, then E2E-ASR decoder is retrained using the generated hidden states as additional training data. Experimental evaluation using LibriSpeech dataset demonstrates that our proposed method achieves improvement of ASR performance and reduces the number of unknown words without the need for paired data.

TI Preactivation of the quadriceps muscle could limit cranial tibial
   translation in a cranial cruciate ligament deficient canine stifle
SO RESEARCH IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
AB Cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL) deficiency is the leading cause of lameness of the canine stifle. Application of tension in the quadriceps muscle could trigger cranial tibial translation in case of CrCL rupture. We replaced the quadriceps muscle and the gastrocnemius muscle by load cells and turn-buckles. First, eight canine limbs were placed in a servo-hydraulic testing machine, which applied 50% of body weight (BW). In a second phase, the CrCL was transected, and the limbs were tested in a similar manner.
   In a third phase, a quadriceps pretension of 15% BW was applied and limbs were again tested in a similar manner. Cranial tibial translation was significantly decreased in CrCL deficient stifles (p <0.05) when quadriceps pretension was applied.
   These findings indicate that quadriceps pretension could play a role in the stability of a CrCL deficient stifle and should then be considered in rehabilitation programs and conservative treatment of CrCL rupture in dogs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mitoribosomes in trypanosomatid parasites diverged markedly from their bacterial ancestors and other eukaryotic lineages in terms of protein composition, rRNA content, and overall architecture, yet their core functional elements remained conserved. Recent cryo-electron microscopy studies provided atomic models of trypanosomatid large and small mitoribosomal subunits and their precursors, making these parasites the organisms with the best-understood biogenesis of mitoribosomes. The structures revealed molecular mechanisms and players involved in the assembly of mitoribosomes not only in the parasites, but also in eukaryotes in general.

TI A Survey of Word Reordering in Statistical Machine Translation:
   Computational Models and Language Phenomena
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Word reordering is one of the most difficult aspects of statistical machine translation (SMT), and an important factor of its quality and efficiency. Despite the vast amount of research published to date, the interest of the community in this problem has not decreased, and no single method appears to be strongly dominant across language pairs. Instead, the choice of the optimal approach for a new translation task still seems to be mostly driven by empirical trials.
   To orient the reader in this vast and complex research area, we present a comprehensive survey of word reordering viewed as a statistical modeling challenge and as a natural language phenomenon. The survey describes in detail how word reordering is modeled within different string-based and tree-based SMT frameworks and as a stand-alone task, including systematic overviews of the literature in advanced reordering modeling.
   We then question why some approaches are more successful than others in different language pairs. We argue that besides measuring the amount of reordering, it is important to understand which kinds of reordering occur in a given language pair. To this end, we conduct a qualitative analysis of word reordering phenomena in a diverse sample of language pairs, based on a large collection of linguistic knowledge. Empirical results in the SMT literature are shown to support the hypothesis that a few linguistic facts can be very useful to anticipate the reordering characteristics of a language pair and to select the SMT framework that best suits them.

AB Beam search is a widely used approximate search strategy for neural network decoders, and it generally outperforms simple greedy decoding on tasks like machine translation. However, this improvement comes at substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose a flexible new method that allows us to reap nearly the full benefits of beam search with nearly no additional computational cost. The method revolves around a small neural network actor that is trained to observe and manipulate the hidden state of a previouslytrained decoder. To train this actor network, we introduce the use of a pseudo-parallel corpus built using the output of beam search on a base model, ranked by a target quality metric like BLEU. Our method is inspired by earlier work on this problem, but requires no reinforcement learning, and can be trained reliably on a range of models. Experiments on three parallel corpora and three architectures show that the method yields substantial improvements in translation quality and speed over each base system.

TI Understanding Subtitles by Character-Level Sequence-to-Sequence Learning
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB This paper presents a character-level sequence-to- sequence learning method, RNNembed. Thismethod allows the system to read raw characters, instead of words generated by preprocessing steps, into a pure single neural network model under an end-to-end framework. Specifically, we embed a recurrent neural network into an encoder-decoder framework and generate character-level sequence representation as input. The dimension of input feature space can be significantly reduced as well as avoiding the need to handle unknown or rare words in sequences. In the language model, we improve the basic structure of a gated recurrent unit by adding an output gate, which is used for filtering out unimportant information involved in the attention scheme of the alignment model. Our proposed method was examined in a large-scale dataset on an English-to-Chinese translation task. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves a translation performance comparable, or close, to conventional word-based and phrase-based systems.

AB In this paper, we optimize the boosted results of AdaBoost algorithm by particle swarm optimization (PSO) and form a learning algorithm PSO-AB. We use it to boost the classification ability of support vector machine (SVM) and back propagation neural network (BPNN). This PSO-AB adopts SVM and BPNN to classify the experimental data, uses AdaBoost algorithm to boost the classification results, and then uses PSO to optimize the boosted results. Translation initiation sites (TIS) prediction results show that AdaBoost algorithm could improve the accuracy of training set, but for testing set the result is not satisfactory. PSO-AB makes it possible to maximize the testing accuracy of AdaBoost algorithm on the premise of that the accuracy of training set is still exact. PSO-AB will be a more effective method to classification problems compared with AdaBoost algorithm and base learning algorithm.

TI Multi-view self-attention networks
SO KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS
AB Self-attention networks (SANs) have attracted an amount of research attention for their outstanding performance under the machine translation community. Recent studies proved that SANs can be further improved by exploiting different inductive biases, each of which guides SANs to learn a specific view of the input sentence, e.g., short-term dependencies, forward and backward views, as well as phrasal patterns. However, less studies investigate how these inductive techniques complementarily improve the capability of SANs and this would be an interesting question to be answered. In this paper we selected five inductive biases which are simple and not over parameterized to investigate their complementarily. We further propose multi-view self-attention networks, which jointly learn different linguistic aspects of the input sentence under a unified framework. Specifically, we propose and exploit a variety of inductive biases to regularize the conventional attention distribution. Different views are then aggregated by a hybrid attention mechanism to quantify and leverage the specific views and their associated representation conveniently. Experiments on various translation tasks demonstrate that different views are able to progressively improve the performance of SANs, and the proposed approach outperforms both the strong TRANSFORMER baseline and related models on TRANSFORMER-BASE and TRANSFORMER-BIG settings. Extensive analyses on 10 linguistic probing tasks verify that different views indeed tend to extract distinct linguistic features and our method gives highly effective improvements in their integration.(1) (c)& nbsp;2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI Conditional random fields versus template-matching in MT phrasing tasks
   involving sparse training data
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS
AB This communication focuses on comparing the template-matching technique to established probabilistic approaches - such as conditional random fields (CRF) - on a specific linguistic task, namely the phrasing of a sequence of words into phrases. This task represents a low-level parsing of the sequence into linguistically-motivated phrases. CRF represents the established method for implementing such a data-driven parser, while template-matching is a simpler method that is faster to train and operate. The two aforementioned techniques are compared here to determine the most suitable approach for extracting an accurate model.
   The specific application studied is related to a machine translation (MT) methodology (namely PRESEMT), though the comparison performed holds for other applications as well, for which only sparse training data are available. PRESEMT uses small parallel corpora to learn structural transformations from a source language (SL) to a target language (TL) and thus translate input text. This results in the availability of only sparse training data from which to train the parser. Experimental results indicate that for a limited-size training set, as is the case for the PRESEMT methodology, template-matching generates a superior phrasing model that in turn generates higher quality translations. This is confirmed by studying more than one source/target language pairs, for multiple independent testsets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Swiss avalanche bulletin is produced twice a day in four languages. Due to the lack of time available for manual translation, a fully automated translation system is employed, based on a catalogue of predefined phrases and predetermined rules of how these phrases can be combined to produce sentences. The system is able to automatically translate such sentences from German into the target languages French, Italian and English without subsequent proofreading or correction. Our catalogue of phrases is limited to a small sublanguage. The reduction of daily translation costs is expected to offset the initial development costs within a few years. After being operational for two winter seasons, we assess here the quality of the produced texts based on an evaluation where participants rate real danger descriptions from both origins, the catalogue of phrases versus the manually written and translated texts. With a mean recognition rate of 55%, users can hardly distinguish between the two types of texts, and give similar ratings with respect to their language quality. Overall, the output from the catalogue system can be considered virtually equivalent to a text written by avalanche forecasters and then manually translated by professional translators. Furthermore, forecasters declared that all relevant situations were captured by the system with sufficient accuracy and within the limited time available.

AB Translation quality can be improved by global information from the required target sentence because the decoder can understand both past and future information. However, the model needs additional cost to produce and consider such global information. In this work, to inject global information but also save cost, we present an efficient method to sample and consider a semantic draft as global information from semantic space for decoding with almost free of cost. Unlike other successful adaptations, we do not have to perform an EM-like process that repeatedly samples a possible semantic from the semantic space. Empirical experiments show that the presented method can achieve competitive performance in common language pairs with a clear advantage in inference efficiency. We will open all our source code on GitHub.

AB In the present paper we describe TectoMT, a multi-purpose open-source NLP framework. It allows for fast and efficient development of NLP applications by exploiting a. wide range of software modules already integrated in TectoMT, such as tools for sentence segmentation, tokenization, morphological analysis, POS tagging, shallow and deep syntax parsing, named entity recognition, anaphora resolution, tree-to-tree translation, natural language generation, word-level alignment of parallel corpora, and other tasks. One of the most complex applications of TectoMT is the English-Czech machine translation system with transfer on deep syntactic (tectogrammatical) layer. Several modules are available also for other languages (German, Russian, Arabic). Where possible, modules are implemented in a language-independent way, so they call be reused in many applications.

SO CADERNOS DE TRADUCAO
AB Using the Relevance Theory as guideline we investigate the processing effort of the modal particle (MP) wohl in the linguistic pair german/portuguese in post-editing tasks. As experimental background, we use three distinct research tools: the program Translog-II; the eye-tracker Tobii T60; retrospective reports (free and guided). Sixteen participants, eight Brazilian and eight German, post-edited to Portuguese three machine translation inputs in German containing the MP wohl in three different positions related to the same sentence. The results here presented tend to confirm the hypothesis by GUTT (1998) and the study on processing analysis performed by ALVES (2007), which show that the relation between effort and effect does not obey a linear relation among themselves. Therefore, the analysis of how modal particles are processed in post-editing tasks tends to show that different cognitive environments imply distinct allocation of the minimum cognitive effort needed to achieve a relevant contextual effect.

The proposed scheme aims to naturally extend the existing tectogrammatic annotation of the Prague Dependency Treebank and represents a step towards capturing the cognitive (ontological) content of a discourse. The existence of such an annotation will allow the training and testing of algorithms for automatic extraction of temporal relations which, in turn, contributes to various NLP tasks such as information retrieval and machine translation. 233 sentences of Czech translations of the Wall Street Journal (Penn Treebank) have been annotated so far. We also present statistics on the distribution of respective temporal relations based on this preliminary annotation data as well as the performance of a grammar-based algorithm.

TI RNA chaperone activity of large ribosomal subunit proteins from

SO RNA
AB The ribosome is a highly dynamic ribonucleoprotein machine. During assembly and during translation the ribosomal RNAs must routinely be prevented from failing into kinetic folding traps. Stable occupation of these trapped states may be prevented by proteins with RNA chaperone activity. Here, ribosomal proteins from the large (50S) ribosome subunit of Escherichia coli were tested for RNA chaperone activity in an in vitro trans splicing assay. Nearly a third of the 34 large ribosomal subunit proteins displayed RNA chaperone activity. We discuss a possible role of this function during ribosome assembly and during translation.

AB This paper presents an approach for choosing the correct translation of an ambiguous word in a given sentence. An unsupervised learning is applied and a non-aligned bilingual Portuguese to Chinese bilingual corpus is used in disambiguating word senses. The identification of the relationships between words is done by considering its surrounding words and their relative distance to tackle syntactical relationships. All the related words are then translated to the target language in finding out the correct senses of ambiguous words. The selection is based on a statistical and a mathematical model by assigning a score to each of the sense identified previously. After all the senses discovered, its semantic and syntactical information are converted into a set of rules and stored in the database for later use in the disambiguation process. Preliminary experiment results of the proposed method shows an improvement of 6% in assigning correctly the corresponding translation over the baseline method.

TI 'Personal Effects' Translation, Intimacy and Domestication in the Poetry
   of Solmaz Sharif
SO MIDDLE EAST JOURNAL OF CULTURE AND COMMUNICATION
AB Solmaz Sharif's debut poetry collection, Look (2016), has been hailed by critics for its formal experimentation and as a searing indictment of war. Using various words from the 2007 Department of Defense (DOD) Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, Sharif highlights the sterility of the official vocabulary of the US military machine and the 'war on terrorism'. The poet juxtaposes the DOD's lexicon with reflections on personal relationships, family, love and loss along with traces of the multiple sites of home of an Istanbul-born, Iranian-American poet. In this essay, I argue that throughout the collection, the poet engages in a subversive, translative act; Sharif presents an intralingual mode of translation in which her poems destabilize the seeming neutrality and sanitizing effect of military vocabulary by consistently juxtaposing it with representations of the effects and consequences of violence, as well as images of intimacy, in order to articulate an anti-war stance.

Different types of documentation style are discussed, as well as different user profiles. It is found that documentation is often inadequate in identifying the level of linguistic background and knowledge necessary to use translation software, and in explaining technical (linguistic) terms needed to use the soft-ware effectively. In particular, the level of knowledge and training needed to use the software is often incompatible with the user profile implied by the documentation. Also, guidance on how to perform more complex tasks, which may be especially idiosyncratic, is often inadequate or missing altogether.

Our algorithm translates several existing WordNets to Vietnamese using a freely available machine translator, removes translation ambiguities by applying ranking methods based on occurrence counts and Google distances on translation candidates. We also establish connections between synsets and extract glosses for synsets. Finally, we carefully look at the VWN created and identify problematic issues in the VWN due to differences in culture and agglutinative morphology of Vietnamese and other languages used.

AB A series of experimental results of field-reversed configurations (FRCs) on a KMAX (Keda Mirror with AXisymmetricity) tandem mirror machine are reported. Single-side FRC translation processes with three different gas species were measured by avalanche photodiodes. Consistent with the theoretical prediction, the measured FRC speeds were inversely proportional to the square root of the ion mass. However, the speeds of the hydrogen FRC increased even in a uniform magnetic field region while the speeds of the helium and argon FRCs decreased. Possible mechanisms are discussed. The speed of the second pass due to the reflection of the mirror fields was found to be similar to 1/3 of the first pass speed. The internal magnetic fields were measured for a colliding-merging argon FRC, and the results show that, even for very slow-moving FRCs, merging can occur.

TI Linguistically Annotated Reordering: Evaluation and Analysis
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Linguistic knowledge plays an important role in phrase movement in statistical machine translation. To efficiently incorporate linguistic knowledge into phrase reordering, we propose a new approach: Linguistically Annotated Reordering (LAR). In LAR, we build hard hierarchical skeletons and inject soft linguistic knowledge from source parse trees to nodes of hard skeletons during translation. The experimental results on large-scale training data show that LAR is comparable to boundary word-based reordering (BWR) (Xiong, Liu, and Lin 2006), which is a very competitive lexicalized reordering approach. When combined with BWR, LAR provides complementary information for phrase reordering, which collectively improves the BLEU score significantly.
   To further understand the contribution of linguistic knowledge in LAR to phrase reordering, we introduce a syntax-based analysis method to automatically detect constituent movement in both reference and system translations, and summarize syntactic reordering patterns that are captured by reordering models. With the proposed analysis method, we conduct a comparative analysis that not only provides the insight into how linguistic knowledge affects phrase movement but also reveals new challenges in phrase reordering.

AB Finding Semantic similarity is an important component in various fields such as information retrieval, question-answering system, machine translation and text summarization. This paper describes two different approaches to find semantic similarity on SemEval 2016 dataset. First method is based on lexical analysis whereas second method is based on distributed semantic approach. Both approaches are trained using feed-forward neural network and layer-recurrent network to predict the similarity score.

AB Sequence-to-sequence models have been widely used in end-to-end speech processing, for example, automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech translation (ST), and text-to-speech (TTS). This paper focuses on an emergent sequence-to-sequence model called Transformer, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in neural machine translation and other natural language processing applications. We undertook intensive studies in which we experimentally compared and analyzed Transformer and conventional recurrent neural networks (RNN) in a total of 15 ASR, one multilingual ASR, one ST, and two TTS benchmarks. Our experiments revealed various training tips and significant performance benefits obtained with Transformer for each task including the surprising superiority of Transformer in 13/15 ASR benchmarks in comparison with RNN. We are preparing to release Kaldi-style reproducible recipes using open source and publicly available datasets for all the ASR, ST, and TTS tasks for the community to succeed our exciting outcomes.

TI Quality assurance of a helical tomotherapy machine
SO PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
AB Helical tomotherapy has been developed at the University of Wisconsin, and 'Hi-Art II' clinical machines are now commercially manufactured. At the core of each machine lies a ring-gantry-mounted short linear accelerator which generates x-rays that are collimated into a fan beam of intensity-modulated radiation by a binary multileaf, the modulation being variable with gantry angle. Patients are treated lying on a couch which is translated continuously through the bore of the machine as the gantry rotates. Highly conformal dose-distributions can be delivered using this technique, which is the therapy equivalent of spiral computed tomography. The approach requires synchrony of gantry rotation, couch translation, accelerator pulsing and the opening and closing of the leaves of the binary multileaf collimator used to modulate the radiation beam. In the course of clinically implementing helical tomotherapy, we have developed a quality assurance (QA) system for our machine. The system is analogous to that recommended for conventional clinical linear accelerator QA by AAPM Task Group 40 but contains some novel components, reflecting differences between the Hi-Art devices and conventional clinical accelerators. Here the design and dosimetric characteristics of Hi-Art machines are summarized and the QA system is set out along with experimental details of its implementation. Connections between this machine-based QA work, pre-treatment patient-specific delivery QA and fraction-by-fraction dose verification are discussed.

However, recent advances in syntax-based NLP model design are unsuitable for these toolkits. To combat this problem, we introduce a weighted finite-state tree automata toolkit, which incorporates recent developments in weighted tree automata theory and is useful for natural language applications such as machine translation, sentence compression, question answering, and many more.

TI Ribosome recycling in mRNA translation, quality control, and homeostasis
SO BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Protein biosynthesis is a conserved process, essential for life. Ongoing research for four decades has revealed the structural basis and mechanistic details of most protein biosynthesis steps. Numerous pathways and their regulation have recently been added to the translation system describing protein quality control and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) surveillance, ribosome-associated protein folding and post-translational modification as well as human disorders associated with mRNA and ribosome homeostasis. Thus, translation constitutes a key regulatory process placing the ribosome as a central hub at the crossover of numerous cellular pathways. Here, we describe the role of ribosome recycling by ATP-binding cassette sub-family E member 1 (ABCE1) as a crucial regulatory step controlling the biogenesis of functional proteins and the degradation of aberrant nascent chains in quality control processes.

TI Molecular mimicry between protein and tRNA
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION
AB Mimicry is a sophisticated development in animals, fish, and plants that allows them to fool others by imitating a shape or color for diverse purposes, such as to prey, evade, lure, pollinate, or threaten. This is not restricted to the macro-world, but extends to the microworld as molecular mimicry. Recent advances in structural and molecular biology uncovered a set of translation factors that resembles a tRNA shape and, in one case, even mimics a tRNA function for deciphering the genetic code. Nature must have evolved this art of molecular mimicry between protein and ribonucleic acid by using different protein structures until the translation factors sat in the cockpit of a ribosome machine, on behalf of tRNA, and achieved diverse actions. Structural, functional, and evolutionary aspects of molecular mimicry will be discussed.

AB The softmax bottleneck has been shown to limit the expressiveness of neural language models. Mixture of Softmaxes (MoS) is an effective approach to address such a theoretical limitation, but are expensive compared to softmax in terms of both memory and time. We propose Mixtape, an output layer that breaks the softmax bottleneck more efficiently with three novel techniques-logit space vector gating, sigmoid tree decomposition, and gate sharing. On four benchmarks including language modeling and machine translation, the Mixtape layer substantially improves the efficiency over the MoS layer by 3.5x to 10.5x while obtaining similar performance. A network equipped with Mixtape is only 20% to 34% slower than a softmax-based network with 10-30K vocabulary sizes, and outperforms softmax in perplexity and translation quality.

AB This paper discusses a strategy for implementing OpenMP on distributed memory systems that relies on a source-to-source translation from OpenMP to Global Arrays. Global Arrays is a library with routines for managing data that is declared as shared in a user program. It provides a higher level of control over the mapping of such data to the target machine and enables precise specification of the required accesses. We introduce the features of Global Arrays, outline the translation and its challenges and consider how user-level support might enable us to improve this process. Early experiments are discussed. The paper concludes with some ideas for future work to improve the performance of this and other approaches to providing OpenMP on clusters and other distributed memory platforms.

AB A quality estimation (QE) approach informed with machine translation (MT) and speech recognition (ASR) features has recently shown to improve the performance of a spoken language translation (SLT) system in an in-domain scenario. When domain mismatch is progressively introduced in the MT and ASR systems, the SLT system's performance naturally degrades. The use of QE to improve SLT performance has not been studied in this context. In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of QE under this setting. Our experiments showed that across moderate levels of domain mismatches, QE led to consistent translation improvements of around 0.4 in BLEU score. The QE system relies on 116 features derived from the ASR and MT system input and output. Feature analysis was conducted to understand the information sources contributing the most to performance improvements. LDA dimension reduction was used to summarise effective features into sets as small as 3 without affecting the SLT performance. By inspecting the principal components, eight features including the acoustic model scores and count-based word statistics on the bilingual text were found to be critically important, leading to a further boost of around 0.1 BLEU score over the full set of features. These findings provide interesting possibilities for further work by incorporating the effective QE features in SLT system training or decoding.

The kinematics and dynamics equations of the presented vibration reduction platform were deduced. And then the workspace, tuning principles and dynamics characteristics were studied. The simulations show that the presented parallel mechanism or vibration reduction platform is valid for reducing vibration and the system has different natural frequencies in case that the upper platform of the mechanism works on some specific positions, so it can be used to achieve tunable vibration control.

AB Position encoding (PE), an essential part of self-attention networks (SANs), is used to preserve the word order information for natural language processing tasks, generating fixed position indices for input sequences. However, in cross-lingual scenarios, e.g., machine translation, the PEs of source and target sentences are modeled independently. Due to word order divergences in different languages, modeling the cross-lingual positional relationships might help SANs tackle this problem. In this paper, we augment SANs with cross-lingual position representations to model the bilingually aware latent structure for the input sentence. Specifically, we utilize bracketing transduction grammar (BTG)-based reordering information to encourage SANs to learn bilingual diagonal alignments. Experimental results on WMT' 14 English double right arrow German, WAT' 17 Japanese double right arrow English, and WMT' 17 Chinese double left right arrow English translation tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly and consistently improves translation quality over strong baselines. Extensive analyses confirm that the performance gains come from the cross-lingual information.

We propose a paradigm, termed Two-Headed Monster (THM), which consists of two symmetric encoder modules and one decoder module connected with co-attention. As a specific and concrete implementation of THM, Crossed Co-Attention Networks (CCNs) are designed based on the Transformer model. We test CCNs on WMT 2014 EN-DE and WMT 2016 EN-FI translation tasks and show both advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method. Our model outperforms the strong Transformer baseline by 0.51 (big) and 0.74 (base) BLEU points on EN-DE and by 0.17 (big) and 0.47 (base) BLEU points on EN-FI but the epoch time increases by circa 75%.

AB Most text-to-text generation tasks, for example text summarisation and text simplification, require copying words from the input to the output. We introduce copycat, a transformerbased pointer network for such tasks which obtains competitive results in abstractive text summarisation and generates more abstractive summaries. We propose a further extension of this architecture for automatic post-editing, where generation is conditioned over two inputs (source language and machine translation), and the model is capable of deciding where to copy information from. This approach achieves competitive performance when compared to state-of-the-art automated post-editing systems. More importantly, we show that it addresses a well-known limitation of automatic post-editing - overcorrecting translations - and that our novel mechanism for copying source language words improves the results.

AB Cross-lingual or cross-domain correspondences play key roles in tasks ranging from machine translation to transfer learning. Recently, purely unsupervised methods operating on monolingual embeddings have become effective alignment tools. Current state-of-theart methods, however, involve multiple steps, including heuristic post-hoc refinement strategies. In this paper, we cast the correspondence problem directly as an optimal transport (OT) problem, building on the idea that word embeddings arise from metric recovery algorithms. Indeed, we exploit the Gromov-Wasserstein distance that measures how similarities between pairs of words relate across languages. We show that our OT objective can be estimated efficiently, requires little or no tuning, and results in performance comparable with the state-of-the-art in various unsupervised word translation tasks.

TI An efficient adapting virtual intermediate instruction set towards
   optimized dynamic binary translator (DBT) system
SO JOURNAL OF CENTRAL SOUTH UNIVERSITY
AB A new efficient adapting virtual intermediate instruction set, V-IIS, is designed and implemented towards the optimized dynamic binary translator (DBT) system. With the help of this powerful but previously little-studied component, DBTs can not only get rid of the dependence of machine(s), but also get better performance. From our systematical study and evaluation, experimental results demonstrate that if V-IIS is well designed, without affecting the other optimizing measures, this could make DBT's performance close to those who do not have intermediate instructions. This study is an important step towards the grand goal of high performance "multi-source" and "multi-target" dynamic binary translation.

AB Transliteration pair acquisition has received significant attention as a technique for constructing up-to-date transliteration lexicons, and for supporting machine translation and cross-language information retrieval. Previous studies on transliteration pair acquisition focused on only the phonetic similarity model but seldom considered the real-usage of transliterations in texts. Moreover, previous web-based validation models considered only one-way validation (validation from the viewpoint of a source term) rather than joint validation between a source term and a target term. To address these problems, we propose a novel transliteration pair acquisition model that extracts transliteration pairs from the Web and validates the pairs by combining the phonetic similarity and joint web-validation models. Experiments demonstrated that our transliteration pair acquisition model was effective.

TI Automatic Real-Time Pose Estimation of Machinery from Images
SO SENSORS
AB The automatic positioning of machines in a large number of application areas is an important aspect of automation. Today, this is often done using classic geodetic sensors such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and robotic total stations. In this work, a stereo camera system was developed that localizes a machine at high frequency and serves as an alternative to the previously mentioned sensors. For this purpose, algorithms were developed that detect active markers on the machine in a stereo image pair, find stereo point correspondences, and estimate the pose of the machine from these. Theoretical influences and accuracies for different systems were estimated with a Monte Carlo simulation, on the basis of which the stereo camera system was designed. Field measurements were used to evaluate the actual achievable accuracies and the robustness of the prototype system. The comparison is present with reference measurements with a laser tracker. The estimated object pose achieved accuracies higher than 16 mm with the translation components and accuracies higher than 3 mrad with the rotation components. As a result, 3D point accuracies higher than 16 mm were achieved by the machine. For the first time, a prototype could be developed that represents an alternative, powerful image-based localization method for machines to the classical geodetic sensors.

AB There are more than 6000 languages in the world but only a small number possess the resources required for implementation of Human Language Technologies (HLT). Thus, HLT are mostly concerned by languages for which large resources are available or which have suddenly become of interest because of the economic or political scene. On the contrary, languages from developing countries or minorities have been less worked on in the past years. One way of improving this "language divide" is do more research on portability of HLT for multilingual applications.
   In this paper, we concentrate on speech-to-speech translation. We present here our methodology for fast development of ASR systems for under-resourced languages or, as they are called now, pi-languages (poorly equipped). We present the resources collected for Vietnamese, and the experimental results of our first Vietnamese ASR system. The current validation of our methodology for Khmer is described next. We also discuss some issues related to machine translation and present first contributions of our laboratory in this context of "pi-languages".

Recently developed Cycle-Consistency Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN), a variant of GAN has been successfully used for unpaired image-to-image translation. We present a modified CycleGAN for translation of underwater ship engine sounds with high perceptual quality. The proposed network is composed of an improved generator model trained to translate underwater audio from one vessel type to other, an improved discriminator to identify the data as real or fake and a modified cycle-consistency loss function. The quantitative and qualitative analysis of the proposed CycleGAN are performed on publicly available underwater dataset ShipsEar by evaluating and comparing Mel-cepstral distortion, pitch contour matching, nearest neighbor comparison and mean opinion score with existing algorithms. The analysis results of the proposed network demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed network.

AB In this paper we will briefly describe the approaches taken by the Cheshire (Berkeley) Group for the CLEF Adhoc-TEL 2009 tasks (Mono and Bilingual retrieval). Recognizing that many potentially relevant documents in each of the TEL sub-collections are in other languages, we tried to use multiple translations of the topics for searching each subcollection, combined into a single query. Overall this strategy performed very poorly compared to the the basic monolingual approach used last year (and repeated for one run in each language this year). Once again this year we used probabilistic text retrieval based on logistic regression and incorporating blind relevance feedback for all of the rims. All translation for bilingual tasks was performed using the LEC Power Translator PC-based MT system. Our results this year, however, were surprising poor compared to last year's results. Additional analysis has shown that, for some cases, unexpected hyphenations in the machine translation and untranslatecl words were to blame.

AB This paper proposes a learning and extracting method of bilingual word pairs from aligned parallel corpora with maximum entropy modeling. We define a probabilistic model of bilingual word pairs and four types of feature functions which express statistical and linguistic properties such as co-occurrence information and morphological information. Co-occurrence information restricts the sense of words. Morphological information restricts the part-of-speech of words. Experiment results in which Japanese and English parallel corpora are used show that our method performs better than the previous methods and can extract bilingual word pairs which do not appear in training corpora with almost the same accuracy as the appeared pairs due to the property of maximum entropy modeling.

AB The utility of linguistic annotation in neural machine translation has been already established. The experiments were however limited to recurrent sequence-to-sequence architectures and relatively small data settings. We focus on the state-of-the-art Transformer model and use comparably larger corpora. Specifically, we try to promote the knowledge of source-side syntax using multi-task learning either through simple data manipulation techniques or through a dedicated model component. The novel idea is to interpret Transformer self-attention as a dependency parse. While the data manipulation techniques are ineffective in large data settings, the treatment of self-attention as dependencies helps in translation and reveals that Transformer model can very easily grasp this structure.

AB Human-mediated translation refers to situations in which a human interpreter translates between a source and a target language using either a written or a spoken representation of the source language. In this work we improve the recognition performance on the (English) speech of the human translator and, in case of a spoken source language representation, at the same time on the (Spanish) speech of the source language speaker. To do so, machine translation techniques are used within an iterative system design to translate between the source and target language resources. The used ASR and MT systems are then recursively biased towards the gained knowledge. In the case of a written source language representation we are able to reduce the word error rate of our English baseline system by 35.8% relative. In case of a spoken source language representation we are able to reduce the word error rate by 29.9% relative for English and 20.9% relative for Spanish.

In this paper, we propose an open source ArbEngVec which provides several Arabic-English cross-lingual word embedding models. To train our bilingual models, we use a large dataset with more than 93 million pairs of Arabic-English parallel sentences. In addition, we perform both extrinsic and intrinsic evaluations for the different word embedding model variants. The extrinsic evaluation assesses the performance of models on the cross-language Semantic Textual Similarity (STS), while the intrinsic evaluation is based on the Word Translation (WT) task.

TI Verification of Scheduling of Conditional Behaviors in High-Level
   Synthesis
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VERY LARGE SCALE INTEGRATION (VLSI) SYSTEMS
AB High-level synthesis (HLS) technique translates the behaviors written in high-level languages like C/C++ into register transfer level (RTL) design. Due to its complexity, proving the correctness of an HLS tool is prohibitively expensive. Translation validation is the process of proving that the target code is a correct translation of the source program being compiled. The path-based equivalence checking (PBEC) method is a widely used translation validation method for verification of the scheduling phase of HLS. The existing PBEC methods cannot handle significant control structure modification that occurs in the efficient scheduling of conditional behaviors. Hence, they produce a false-negative result. In this article, we identify some scenarios involving path merge/split where the state-of-the-art PBEC approaches fail to show the equivalence even though behaviors are equivalent. We propose a value propagation-based PBEC method along with a new cutpoint selection scheme to overcome this limitation. Our method can also handle the scenario where adjacent conditional blocks (CBs) having an equivalent conditional expression are combined into one CB. Experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of our method over the existing methods.

TI A Novel Tool (Single-Flute) Condition Monitoring Method for End Milling
   Process Based on Intelligent Processing of Milling Force Data by Machine
   Learning Algorithms
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRECISION ENGINEERING AND MANUFACTURING
AB Tool condition monitoring is deemed as an essential technology of the intelligent manufacturing. Tool wear which directly affects the tool life makes a negative influence on the quality and dimensional accuracy of the machined surface, even leads to tool breakage, machine downtime, and other severe problems. Therefore, an available tool condition monitoring system is essential for the machining process to guarantee the processing quality and improve the machining efficiency. This paper proposes a new tool condition monitoring method based on the general judgment of cutting force. Milling force from a single-flute is predicted by deducing a theoretical formula based on un-deformed chip thickness. Based on the formula, cutting force samples used for machine learning paradigms are generated through time domain translation and Gaussian distribution. Nonlinear manifold learning methods are applied in the visualization of high dimensional data. Principal component analysis as a practical feature extraction method is used to reduce the large dimensionality of the sample set. The performance of respectively linear kernel, polynomial kernel, radial basis function and sigmoid kernel are self-compared to estimate the classification results via support vector machine. Experiments are carried out on an annealed Ti-6Al-4V alloy to measure the feasibility of this method.

AB In this paper, we improvise an existing word vector based machine translation system to measure semantic relatedness across languages and apply it to the language pair of English and Hindi. We also evaluate the model using human scored word relatedness datasets. Unlike most systems performing a similar task, the system does not make use of parallel corpora, which are cumbersome and not practical to build between all possible pairs of languages. The system learns a linear transformation between multidimensional word vector spaces of a pair of languages using a set of known translations, called a bilingual dictionary. An approach to reduce the effort in building a usable bilingual dictionary in the system is also proposed.

AB This paper shows how object-oriented specifications, written in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) can be translated into formal, behavioural descriptions and used as a basis for automatic test generation. The behavioural descriptions are written in a language of communicating state machines: the Intermediate Format (IF). The translation from UML to IF is based upon an earlier formal semantics, written in the Abstract State Machine (ASM) notation. Descriptions written in IF can be automatically explored; the results of these explorations are test trees, ready for input to a variety of testing packages. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB The gap control problem in hole-machining of Pyrex (R) wafer by electrochemical discharge machining (ECDM) to obtain a smooth quality and acceptable material removal rate is studied. Analysis of the pulse signals shows that the average current pulse interval is constant, and it is mainly related to the ion translation conditions, such as the electrolyte concentration and the flushing strategy. The most steady and intense average current density can be obtained if the voltage on-time is around 3 times the average current pulse interval and the voltage off-time is 1/4 of the on-time for bubble film dissipation. The utmost allowable feed rate at each depth is recorded as the reference of the feed rate in real continuous machining to avoid the damage to the wafer. By applying 80% of the extreme allowable feed rate, 99.9% quality-proved holes can be acquired. The diametric error at the entrance or exit is within 6%. Besides, there is no crater-like problem around the hole that facilitates the succeeding bonding process. This study contributes to the successful production of reusable optical biological chips with integrated micro fluidic channels.

TI Development of CAM system for 3D surface machining with CNC lathe
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MECHANICAL DESIGN SYSTEMS AND MANUFACTURING
AB We have developed a new machining method which realizes turning of non-axisymmetric curved surfaces with a rotation axis (called NACS-Turning hereafter). NACS-Turning is a CNC turning method with 3-axis synchronous which is composed of a turning axis and two translation axes. This method forms a profile of a non-axisymmetric curved surface by adopting a liner motor in X axis and by synchronizing the X axis with the rotation axis at high speed. We confirmed dramatic improvement of productivity by using this machining method. However, at present, the generation of tool paths for shape forming using NACS-Turning are obtained with APIs associated with a commercial 3D-CAD program and geometric calculations. Therefore, we have developed a new CAM application for NACS-Turning in this paper. Since this machining method is three-axis simultaneous control, even though composition of the axis is the same as a general two-axis turning lathe, tool paths have to be generated in three dimensional space. Therefore, applying for a tool generation method of a machining center is required. Specifically, machining points are generated by calculating intersection lines on free surfaces as machining surfaces are calculated, and coordinates of tool center points are calculated by using the inverse offset method. In this paper, first, outline of NACS-Turning is mentioned. Next, the detail of the developed CAM system which is limited to a rotary tool. Finally, we report effectiveness by cutting experimentation.

AB A new approach to the problem of part recognition is proposed by using maximum mutual information. The method applies entropy to measure image feature, combined with color information and local shape information, and uses mutual information as a new matching criterion between the images for image recognition. This method solves the problem that histogram algorithm can not represent the spatial information. This method not only has the feature of translation invariant, but also avoids image segmentation which may lead to a complex calculation, so it can be realized easily. The result shows that proposed approach is accuracy, stability, and reliability in the processing of machine part image recognition.

   system
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB Multi-axis laser processing has significant advantages and broad application prospects. Multi-coordinate spatial positioning is the key to realize its technical application. In this paper, the mathematical modeling of multi-axis positioning was carried out for a typical five-axis laser processing equipment. The space vector of the rotation axis was calibrated. The construction principle and calculation method of the workpiece machining coordinate system (WCS) were expounded. On the basis of solving the rotation and translation matrix, the geometrical information including machining position and posture in the CAD coordinate system was converted into the machine coordinate system (MCS) through coordinate transformation, which lays a technical foundation for multi-coordinate laser processing. At the same time, the verification of machining application, such as multi-axis positioning processing of rings on planar features, and spatial helical positioning machining on cylindrical surfaces were carried out, which proved the feasibility and effect of the proposed method. The modeling method proposed in this work is scalable and can be applied to different types and structures of equipment in the computer-integrated manufacturing. The research results of this work have important theoretical and technical value for the high-performance application of five-axis laser processing equipment.

TI From the sup-decomposition to sequential decompositions
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL IMAGING AND VISION
AB W-operators are discrete set operators that are both translation invariant and locally defined within a finite window W. A particularly interesting property of W-operators is that they have a sup-decomposition in terms of a family sup-generating operators, that are parameterized by the operator basis. The sup-decomposition has a parallel structure that usually is not efficient for computation in conventional sequential machines. In this paper, we formalize the problem of transforming sup-decompositions into purely sequential decompositions (when they exist). The techniques were developed for general W-operators, specialized for increasing W-operators and applied on operators built by compositions of dilations and erosions.

AB Scene Text Recognition (STR) is a task of localizing and transcribing textual information captured in real-word images. With its increasing accuracy, it becomes a new source of textual data for standard Natural Language Processing tasks and poses new problems because of the specific nature of Scene Text. In this paper, we learn a string hypotheses decoding procedure in an STR pipeline using structured prediction methods that proved to be useful in automatic Speech Recognition and Machine Translation. The model allow to employ a wide range of typographical and language features into the decoding process. The proposed method is evaluated on a standard dataset and improves both character and word recognition performance over the baseline.

AB Crowdsourced crisis response harnesses distributed networks of humans in combination with information and communication technology (ICT) to create scalable, flexible and rapid communication systems that promote well-being, survival, and recovery during the acute phase of an emergency. In this paper, we analyze a recent experience in which CrowdFlower conducted crowdsourced translation, categorization and geo-tagging for SMS-based reporting as part of Mission 4636 after a 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck Haiti on January 12, 2010. We discuss CrowdFlower's approach to this task, lessons learned from the experience, and opportunities to generalize the techniques and technologies involved for other ICT for development (ICTD) applications. We find that CrowdFlower's most significant contribution to Mission 4636 and to the broader field of crowdsourced crisis relief lies in the flexible, scalable nature of the pool of earthquake survivors, volunteers, workers, and machines that the organization engaged during the emergency response efforts.

It is shown how the grammatical relations between elements of sentence in English formed by strict word order, prepositions, suffixes etc., can be formally transformed into their Azerbaijani equivalents. Evaluation results on the test data of the English-Azerbaijani MT system are presented.

AB The electrochemical discharge machining (ECDM) has been proved to be a potential process for the machining of high-strength non-conductive materials. Traveling wire electrochemical discharge machining (TW-ECDM), a newly developed technology, is used to slice the small size (10-30 mm diameter) optical glass and quartz bars. The electrical-thermal etching effect and its feasibility are investigated. The energy release intensities and their physical phenomena under different sizes of discharge wires, power source modulations and methods of electrolyte supply are discussed. The pulsed dc power proves better spark stability and more spark energy release proportion than constant dc power. The input power is modulated to obtain the appropriate frequencies and duty factors for machining glass and quartz materials. The ion translation rate, the electrolyte immersing depth and the concentration of the alkali are found to be the dominant factors of bubbles reaction. Based on the SEM photographs of the workpiece surface, it is noted that the more purple the sparks from the mixed gases of hydrogen and vapor, the better the etching effect is. The V-shape defect occurring at the cut-in and cut-out can be significantly reduced by rotating the workpiece. Finally the appropriate cutting conditions for the quartz and borosilicate optical glass materials are concluded. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The Effect of L2 Proficiency on Post-editing Machine Translated Texts
SO JOURNAL OF ASIA TEFL
AB The present study examines how proficiency in the second language (L2) affects language learners' ability to post-edit texts that are machine-translated from the learners' native language (L1) to L2. More specifically, the study investigates how L2 proficiency level affects the degree to which Korean learners of English can discern the accuracy of L1-to-L2 machine-translated (MT) text and whether it affects the level of errors (word, phrase, clause, sentence) that are corrected in the post-editing process. Fifty-nine Korean university students' proficiency was measured using a doze test and a writing test. They were then given a source text (Korean) and a machine-translated text (English) and were asked to detect and correct as many errors as they can. The overall results of the study showed that L2 proficiency does have a significant effect on how language learners post-edit machine-translated output. With increasing proficiency, the number of corrections increased especially above the word-level, and significant group differences could be found in post-editing patterns of the MT text. The findings have important pedagogical implications for integrating MT activities in L2 classrooms with learners of different proficiency levels.

AB Large model size and high computational complexity prevent the neural machine translation (NMT) models from being deployed to low resource devices (e.g. mobile phones). Due to the large vocabulary, a large storage memory is required for the word embedding matrix in NMT models, in the meantime, high latency is introduced when constructing the word probability distribution. Based on reusing the word embedding matrix in the softmax layer, it is possible to handle the two problems brought by large vocabulary at the same time. In this paper, we propose Partial Vector Quantization (P-VQ) for NMT models, which can both compress the word embedding matrix and accelerate word probability prediction in the softmax layer. With P-VQ, the word embedding matrix is split into two low dimensional matrices, namely the shared part and the exclusive part. We compress the shared part by vector quantization and leave the exclusive part unchanged to maintain the uniqueness of each word. For acceleration, in the softmax layer, we replace most of the multiplication operations with the efficient looking-up operations based on our compression to reduce the computational complexity. Furthermore, we adopt curriculum learning and compact the word embedding matrix gradually to improve the compression quality. Experimental results on the Chinese-to-English translation task show that our method can reduce 74.35% of parameters of the word embedding and 74.42% of the FLOPs of the softmax layer. Meanwhile, the average BLEU score on the WMT test sets only drops 0.04.

TI A Biomechanical Evaluation of the DRUJ After Distal Oblique Bundle
   Reconstruction
SO JOURNAL OF HAND SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME
AB Purpose Distal oblique bundle (DOB) reconstruction for distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability is an alternative to the Adams 2-incision distal radioulnar ligament reconstruction. The DOB reconstruction offers a single incision and is a technically less demanding procedure requiring a shorter tendon autograft. The DOB and Adams reconstruction may provide similar stability. This study sought to compare the biomechanical stability of the 2 DRUJ reconstructions. We hypothesized that DOB reconstruction would result in equivalent DRUJ translation, cyclic loading to failure, and maximal load to failure compared with the Adams reconstruction.
   Methods Ten fresh-frozen cadaver arms underwent DOB or Adams reconstructions. Volar, dorsal, and total translation of the radius relative to the ulna at the DRUJ were measured before and after each reconstruction. Translation was measured with a 20-N force in neutral position and 60 degrees in pronation and supination. Measurements were obtained using a custom jig and electromagnetic motion-tracking system sensors. Total cycles and maximal load to failure of each reconstruction were measured and recorded using an electromechanical testing machine.
   Results There was a DOB incidence of 70%. Distal radioulnar joint translation, total cycles, and failure load were similar for the 2 reconstructions. On average, the DOB reconstruction had less dorsal translation than did the Adams in supination. Translation in the DOB reconstruction was similar to that of native DRUJs. In supination, on average, the Adams reconstruction had greater total, volar, and dorsal translation compared with native DRUJs.
   Conclusions In terms of translation, cyclical loading, and maximal load to failure, the DOB reconstruction for DRUJ instability is similar to the Adams reconstruction. (Copyright (C) 2020 by the American Society for Surgery of the Hand. All rights reserved.)

TI Hand-in-hand advances in biomedical engineering and sensorimotor
   restoration
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS
AB Background: Living in a multisensory world entails the continuous sensory processing of environmental information in order to enact appropriate motor routines. The interaction between our body and our brain is the crucial factor for achieving such sensorimotor integration ability. Several clinical conditions dramatically affect the constant body-brain exchange, but the latest developments in biomedical engineering provide promising solutions for overcoming this communication breakdown.
   New method: The ultimate technological developments succeeded in transforming neuronal electrical activity into computational input for robotic devices, giving birth to the era of the so-called brain-machine interfaces. Combining rehabilitation robotics and experimental neuroscience the rise of brain-machine interfaces into clinical protocols provided the technological solution for bypassing the neural disconnection and restore sensorimotor function.
   Results: Based on these advances, the recovery of sensorimotor functionality is progressively becoming a concrete reality. However, despite the success of several recent techniques, some open issues still need to be addressed.
   Comparison with existing method(s): Typical interventions for sensorimotor deficits include pharmaceutical treatments and manual/robotic assistance in passive movements. These procedures achieve symptoms relief but their applicability to more severe disconnection pathologies is limited (e.g. spinal cord injury or amputation).
   Conclusions: Here we review how state-of-the-art solutions in biomedical engineering are continuously increasing expectances in sensorimotor rehabilitation, as well as the current challenges especially with regards to the translation of the signals from brain-machine interfaces into sensory feedback and the incorporation of brain-machine interfaces into daily activities.

AB Activity diagrams are part of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to specify a system's behavior. This formalism has been substantially revised in UML 2. Concepts like signal handling and interruptible activity regions were introduced. By using a token flow semantics for describing the execution, activities drift apart from state diagrams. Therefore, it is no more possible to apply verification techniques designed for state diagrams to activity diagrams. This problem is faced by introducing a transformation of activities into a state transition system covering the basic concepts of activity diagrams including but not limited to the aforementioned ones.

The proof is non-uniform, the dichotomy being whether the given real alpha is Martin-L " of random or not. It follows that given any universal machine U, there is another universal machine V such that the halting probability Omega(U) of U is not a translation of the halting probability Omega(V) of V by a left-c. e. real. We do not know if there is a uniform proof of this fact.

AB The article presents the inverse dynamics model of a novel translating parallel machine and proposes the structure of a force controller for the execution of tasks characterised by interaction with the environment. The task space model of machine's dynamics is obtained in an efficient and compact form by means of the principle of virtual work. A virtual prototyping environment has been set up to test by computer simulation the potential of such kinematic architecture: the resulting dynamics is rather poor, mainly due to the high moving masses, but it is shown that hybrid position/force control schemes should be able to provide good performances, including the case of rather difficult operations, such as the peg-in-hole assembly.

The system stiffness and workspace of the parallel manipulator are conducted in the paper. In order to locate the maximum system stiffness and workspace, single and multi-objective optimizations are performed in terms of rotation angles in x and y axes and translation displacement in z axis with genetic algorithms. By optimizing the design variables including geometric dimensions of the manipulator, the system stiffness and workspace of the proposed parallel kinematic manipulator has been greatly improved.

AB This paper deals with the kinematic analysis and dimensional synthesis of a new 2R1T (R: rotation, T: translation) parallel kinematic machine (PKM). This is a 2PRU-UPR (P, R, U standing for prismatic, revolute and universal joint, respectively) PKM that is actuated by three actuated prismatic joints, two of which are mounted on the fixed base to reduce the movable mass. Firstly, the mobility and inverse kinematics of the 2PRU-UPR PKM are proposed. And then the motion/force transmissibility is evaluated by the local transmission index and good transmission workspace. Moreover, the singular configurations are obtained according to the motion/force transmissibility. Dimensional synthesis is carried out based on the GTW, and the optimized architectural parameters with good GTW are obtained. Finally, a prototype based on the optimized parameters has been developed, which has great potential in machining workpieces with curved surfaces.

AB Mounting environmental concerns and changing attitudes have led to recycling programs to divert waste from entering land-fill sites. This trend has led municipalities to explore improved methods and tools such as machine vision for sorting and managing the growing volume of recyclable materials. This paper describes an approach to visual sorting using image intensity data and a support vector machine applied to the unique problem of sorting polycoat containers from plastic bottles. The approach is rotation, translation and scale invariant since it uses features derived from image histograms. We also demonstrate that the approach is robust to the size, shape, varied labeling and deformation of the recycled material. An experiment is performed to verify the approach using separate test and training data. Despite the use of a modest number of training images, the system achieves a classification accuracy of over 96% using images obtained from a single grey-scale camera.

My research shows that Wittgenstein's work began to engage the attention of AI researchers not only in the 1970s down to the present but right from the early beginnings of computational research in the 1950s. More specifically, his later philosophy inspired a group of researchers called the Cambridge Language Research Unit (CLRU) to start one of the first programs in machine translation, information retrieval, mechanical abstracting, and knowledge representation technologies in the early 1950s, all of which have later been claimed for AI and cognitive science. I focus on the philosophical work of CLRU founder Margaret Masterman and her extraordinary but forgotten contributions to ordinary language philosophy.

The work involved data translation, transcription, pre-processing as well as developing Word2Vec and FastText algorithms and ultimately a combined analysis engine. The reported experiments are conducted on field data captured from communities in India, hence offering a unique opportunity to examine automated context-based qualitative data analysis. The approach is proven feasible despite the dominant limitations on technology infrastructure and community awareness. The machine learning results identify themes from the interview data within minutes as opposed to hours of manual investigations through conventional qualitative analysis techniques. The outcomes from the analysis engine can be used for creating a grounded theory for further studies, hence facilitating an evidence-based approach to the evaluation of underserved communities.

TI EXACT2: the semantics of biomedical protocols
SO BMC BIOINFORMATICS
AB Background: The reliability and reproducibility of experimental procedures is a cornerstone of scientific practice. There is a pressing technological need for the better representation of biomedical protocols to enable other agents (human or machine) to better reproduce results. A framework that ensures that all information required for the replication of experimental protocols is essential to achieve reproducibility.
   Methods: We have developed the ontology EXACT2 (EXperimental ACTions) that is designed to capture the full semantics of biomedical protocols required for their reproducibility. To construct EXACT2 we manually inspected hundreds of published and commercial biomedical protocols from several areas of biomedicine. After establishing a clear pattern for extracting the required information we utilized text-mining tools to translate the protocols into a machine amenable format. We have verified the utility of EXACT2 through the successful processing of previously 'unseen' (not used for the construction of EXACT2) protocols.
   Results: The paper reports on a fundamentally new version EXACT2 that supports the semantically-defined representation of biomedical protocols. The ability of EXACT2 to capture the semantics of biomedical procedures was verified through a text mining use case. In this EXACT2 is used as a reference model for text mining tools to identify terms pertinent to experimental actions, and their properties, in biomedical protocols expressed in natural language. An EXACT2-based framework for the translation of biomedical protocols to a machine amenable format is proposed.
   Conclusions: The EXACT2 ontology is sufficient to record, in a machine processable form, the essential information about biomedical protocols. EXACT2 defines explicit semantics of experimental actions, and can be used by various computer applications. It can serve as a reference model for for the translation of biomedical protocols in natural language into a semantically-defined format.

TI Measurement Parameters Optimized for Sequential Multilateration in
   Calibrating a Machine Tool with a DOE Method
SO Applied Sciences-Basel
AB Improving volumetric error compensation is one of the machine tool user's key objectives. Smart compensation is bound to calibration accuracy. Calibration quality depends largely on its setup factors. An evaluation criterion is thus required to test the quality of the compensation deduced from these setup factors. The residual error map, which characterizes post-compensation machine errors, is therefore chosen and then needs to be evaluated. In this study, the translation axes of a machine tool were calibrated with a multilateration tracking laser interferometer. In order to optimize such measurements, the residual error map was then characterized by two appliances: a laser interferometer and the tracking laser already employed for the calibration, using for that purpose the sequential multilateration technique. This research work thus aimed to obtain a smart setup of parameters of machine tool calibration analyzing these two residual error maps through the Design Of Experiment (DOE) method. To achieve this goal, the first step was to define the setup parameters for calibrating a compact machine tool with a multilateration tracking laser. The second step was to define both of the measurement processes that are employed to estimate the residual error map. The third step was to obtain the optimized setup parameters using the DOE method.

AB Laser milling of flat substrates is quite well established process, where laser structuring of rollers is still in development. Due to the large varieties of laser sources, stages, control systems and CAD/CAM systems, it is difficult to create solution that works for all systems. In order to generate control programs for the machine for rollers structuring usually multi axis machining is employed, enabling simultaneous rotation and translations. Taking into account complexity of the task and accuracy required for such applications it takes much longer time for calculation and significantly enlarges the resulting program code. The paper discusses simplified method for laser micro structuring of rollers.

AB Natural language understanding (NLU) systems for speech applications require large quantities of annotated data. We investigate the use of a domain-independent machine-translation based paraphrase system to improve performance without incurring the costs of obtaining additional annotated data in an NLU system. Our experimental system incorporates Support Vector Machine (SVM) domain and intent models to detect intents, and a conditional random field (CRF) model to identify semantic slots in a given query. Two approaches are compared. In the first, we retrain models using generated paraphrases to augment the original training set. In the second, we use paraphrases as supplementary features of the original queries in the SVM and CRF models. Experiments in four domains indicate that incorporating paraphrase yields useful performance gains, and that the feature-based approach provides more stable performance than synthetic augmentation of training data.

SO BMC BIOINFORMATICS
AB Background: A finite state machine manipulating information-carrying DNA strands can be used to perform autonomous molecular-scale computations at the cellular level.
   Results: We propose a new finite state machine able to detect and correct aberrant molecular phenotype given by mutated genetic transcripts. The aberrant mutations trigger a cascade reaction: specific molecular markers as input are released and induce a spontaneous self-assembly of a wild type protein or peptide, while the mutational disease phenotype is silenced. We experimentally demostrated in in vitro translation system that a viable protein can be autonomously assembled.
   Conclusion: Our work demostrates the basic principles of computational genes and particularly, their potential to detect mutations, and as a response thereafter administer an output that suppresses the aberrant disease phenotype and/or restores the lost physiological function.

TI Systems engineering the organ preservation process for transplantation
SO CURRENT OPINION IN BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Improving organ preservation and extending the preservation time would have game-changing effects on the current practice of organ transplantation. Machine perfusion has emerged as an improved preservation technology to expand the donor pool, assess graft viability and ensure adequate graft function. However, its efficacy in extending the preservation time is limited. Subzero organ preservation does hold the promise to significantly extend the preservation time and recent advances in cryobiology bring it closer to clinical translation. In this review, we aim to broaden the perspective in the field from a focus on these individual technologies to that of a systems engineering. This would enable the creation of a preservation process that integrates the benefits of machine perfusion with those of subzero preservation, with the ultimate goal to provide on demand availability of donor organs through organ banking.

AB Acceleration of Machine Learning applications on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) has shown to have advantages over other computing platforms in recent work. However, since machine learning code is often specified in a high-level software language such as Python, the manual translation of the algorithm to either C code for high-level synthesis or to Register Transfer Level (RTL) code for synthesis is time consuming and requires the designer to have expertise in designing hardware. In order to show how we can make FPGAs more accessible to software developers, we present a demonstration of LeFlow: an open-source tool which maps numerical computation models written in TensorFlow to synthesizable RTL. This demonstration includes two examples which begin with a model written in TensorFlow and show how a designer would use the LeFlow tool to generate Verilog, simulate the result, and synthesize the design to target FPGAs.

TI The non-translation strategy in translating ISIS radical discourse
SO JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE AGGRESSION AND CONFLICT
AB This paper examines the contribution of translation to the shaping of ISIS concepts and discourses circulated through its media machine, which includes Dabiq Magazine and the Al-Furqan Foundation. It will explore propaganda strategies used by ISIS to disseminate radical thought through professional digitalized media by drawing on a corpus of texts published in such outlets - including political speeches given by ISIS leaders, as well as online reports, all of which are translated by ISIS' own translators, the mujtahidun (the industrious ones). A comparative analysis of the original and the translated texts reveals a number of translation strategies that ISIS deploys to construct radicalized knowledge, to serve a violent agenda, and to appeal to a large number of potential foreign fighters. It will be argued that non-translation is a particularly important strategy employed to achieve these objectives. It will also be suggested that Islamic concepts such as Khilafah, Jama'ah, Ummah, Hijra, Bay'ah, Da'wah, Jihad, tawaghit, and other motifs saturated with an ancient Islamic register tend to be left untranslated as a way of reinforcing perceptions of Muslim unity, power, allegiance, and brotherhood against the enemy. The analysis further reveals that particular ideological concepts are left untranslated when ISIS propagandists advocate fighting against the "unbelievers", arguably in an attempt to galvanize the group's followers - whether by appealing to their religious fanaticism or by promoting the uncritical reproduction of symbolic discourses grounded in Islamic history. These strategies highlight a need for awareness of the importance of language use in the reproduction of radical systems of thought and the use of (non-)translation for recruitment purposes. This socio-political linguistic study draws on Critical Discourse Analysis - incorporating the work of Fairclough (1995), Gramsci (1971) and Bourdieu (1991) to unravel the connections that exist between language use and the power of ISIS as a group, and to illustrate how specific translation techniques are adopted to reinforce the Caliphate's hegemony.

AB The narrator's name in the Hadith is one of the most important components in determining the validity of a hadith, but with the large number of Hadiths that exist, causing the process of determining the validity of a Hadith manually becomes difficult, especially in the Indonesian Hadith translation. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a method that aims to find entities in a text document, in this case the entity includes the name of the person, location, organization, etc. This study will discuss the implementation of the Named Entity Recognition to the Indonesian translation of the Hadith collection to find the names of narrators from each Hadith. In this study 200 Hadiths from 9 different books consisting of 31010 tokens and 2241 narrator name entities will be used as datasets. Because of the variety of entity forms and the amount of data used, this study will use a supervised-learning approach, and to maximize performance from the NER system, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is chosen as a classifier model that is known to have good generalization capabilities in classifying data and ability to deal with high-dimensional data. Some combinations of test scenarios on the NER model showed the highest F-1 results of 0.9 with training data totaling 140 Hadiths consisting of 1564 entities and testing 60 Hadiths consisting of 677 entities. The narrator name produced by the NER system will then be used as an index of the Hadiths that have been narrated by the narrator using the Inverted Index method. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB The Infineon SLE 88 is a smart card processor that offers strong protection mechanisms. One of them is a memory management system, typically used for sandboxing application programs dynamically loaded on the chip. High-level (EAL5+) evaluation of the chip requires a formal security model.
   We formally model the memory management system as an Interacting State Machine and prove, using Isabelle/HOL, that the associated security requirements are met. We demonstrate that our approach enables an adequate level of abstraction, which results in an efficient analysis, and points out potential pitfalls like non-injective address translation.

TI Can we explain machine learning-based prediction for rupture status
   assessments of intracranial aneurysms?
SO BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS & ENGINEERING EXPRESS
AB Although applying machine learning (ML) algorithms to rupture status assessment of intracranial aneurysms (IA) has yielded promising results, the opaqueness of some ML methods has limited their clinical translation. We presented the first explainability comparison of six commonly used ML algorithms: multivariate logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), and Bayesian additive regression trees (BART). A total of 112 IAs with known rupture status were selected for this study. The ML-based classification used two anatomical features, nine hemodynamic parameters, and thirteen morphologic variables. We utilized permutation feature importance, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithms to explain and analyze 6 Ml algorithms. All models performed comparably: LR area under the curve (AUC) was 0.71; SVM AUC was 0.76; RF AUC was 0.73; XGBoost AUC was 0.78; MLPNN AUC was 0.73; BART AUC was 0.73. Our interpretability analysis demonstrated consistent results across all the methods; i.e., the utility of the top 12 features was broadly consistent. Furthermore, contributions of 9 important features (aneurysm area, aneurysm location, aneurysm type, wall shear stress maximum during systole, ostium area, the size ratio between aneurysm width, (parent) vessel diameter, one standard deviation among time-averaged low shear area, and one standard deviation of temporally averaged low shear area less than 0.4 Pa) were nearly the same. This research suggested that ML classifiers can provide explainable predictions consistent with general domain knowledge concerning IA rupture. With the improved understanding of ML algorithms, clinicians' trust in ML algorithms will be enhanced, accelerating their clinical translation.

AB Automated functional testing consists in deriving test cases from the specification model of a program to detect faults within an implementation. In our work, we investigate using Constraint Handling Rules (CHRs) to automate the test cases generation process of functional testing. Our case study is a formal model of the Java Card Virtual Machine (JCVM) written in a sub-language of the Coq proof assistant. In this paper we define an automated translation from this formal model into CHRs and propose to generate test cases for each bytecode definition of the JCVM. The originality of our approach resides in the use of CHRs to faithfully model the formally specified operational semantics of the JCVM. The approach has been implemented in Eclipse Prolog and a full set of test cases have been generated for testing the JCVM.

Motivated by the way humans learn, the NEML is a continuous learning strategy which uses the knowledge already acquired to learn new information and, therefore, to improve its performance. The NEML was chosen to be applied in our context because it has two desirable features to deal with our intended problem: (i) it uses the Internet as knowledge source and (ii) it combines different extractions methods to improve the final result. In the experiments presented in this paper, NEBEL reached 65% accuracy in the English-Portuguese pair of languages.

SO REACTION CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB Multivariate chemical reaction optimization involving catalytic systems is a non-trivial task due to the high number of tuneable parameters and discrete choices. Active machine learning (ML) represents a powerful strategy for automating reaction optimization. However, the translation of chemical reaction conditions into a machine-readable format requires the identification of highly informative features which accurately capture the factors which determine reaction success. Herein, we compare the efficacy of different calculated chemical descriptors for a high throughput experimentation generated dataset to determine the impact on a supervised ML model when predicting reaction yield. Then, the effect of featurization and size of the initial dataset within a closed-loop reaction optimization was examined. Finally, the balance between descriptor complexity and dataset size was considered. Ultimately, tailored descriptors did not outperform simple generic representations, however, a larger initial dataset accelerated reaction optimization.

AB Digital Quran is a natural language document that use either Arabic font or images of the verses. In the Al-Quran there are 18994 unique words. Thus, the image approach uses a significant amount of memory space. However there is not much work has been done using machine translation (MT) technique for the Quranic representation. This paper will proposed Arabic information retrieval based on keywords search in Hexadecimal Representation using Al-Quran verses as the test case. All Quranic words will transliterate into machine language in the form of binary format after removing diacritic and duplication. This machine language approach in representing Digital Quran reduces the size of storage around 47-54% and retrieval time up to 20% hence reduce the query cost for Arabic information retrieval in general.

AB Writing English is a big barrier for most Chinese users. To build a computer-aided system that helps Chinese users not only on spelling checking and grammar checking but also on writing in the way of native-English is a challenging task. Although machine translation is widely used for this purpose, how to find an efficient way in which human collaborates with computers remains an open issue. In this paper, based on the comprehensive study of Chinese users requirements, we propose an approach to machine aided English writing system, which consists of two components: 1) a statistical approach to word spelling help, and 2) an information retrieval based approach to intelligent recommendation by providing suggestive example sentences. Both components work together in a unified way, and highly improve the productivity of English writing. We also developed a pilot system, namely PENS (Perfect ENglish System). Preliminary experiments show very promising results.

We computed equilibrium geometries and electronic properties (DFT) for a database of 249 Organic donor-acceptor pairs. We obtain similarity metrics between pairs of donors in terms of electronic and structural parameters, and we use such metrics to predict photovoltaic efficiency through linear and non-linear machine learning models. We observe that using only electronic or structural parameters leads to similar results, while considering both parameters at the same time improves the predictive capability of the models up to correlations of r approximate to 0.7. Such correlation allows for reliable predictions of efficient materials, and lends to be coupled with combinatorial of evolutionary approaches for a more reliable virtual screening of candidate materials.

We will focus on lexical semantics in the embedding layer of the network. We propose to examine the distribution of meaning in the vector space representation of words in neural networks trained for NLP tasks. Furthermore, we propose to consider various theories of meaning in the philosophy of language and to find a methodology that would enable us to connect these areas.

TI Lost in Translation: A Multilingual Survey of Interlinguistic Variations
   in Terms Used in Pharmacovigilance
SO DRUG SAFETY
AB Introduction Although English is the universal language of science, it is nevertheless the first language of only about 6% of the world's population, and 75% of people do not speak English at all. It is therefore important that accurate translations of scientific information should be available, not only for professionals but also for the general public. This applies to pharmacovigilance as much as to any other discipline. Objective The aim of this study was to determine how pharmacovigilance terms are translated into other languages, in order to judge the extent to which differences between languages might impair communication in pharmacovigilance. Methods I surveyed the translation of 26 pharmacovigilance terms into 26 languages via a panel of 83 pharmacovigilance experts. Results Three types of terms emerged: Type 1-those that are similar in form across all, or almost all, of the languages surveyed (e.g. 'signal' and 'risk'); Type 2-terms that are similar in form across some languages but not all (e.g. 'pharmacovigilance' and 'surveillance'); Type 3-terms for which there are major differences across languages (e.g. 'hazard'). Conclusion Misconceptions in the communication of pharmacovigilance information may arise through difficulties in translation. Metaphorical expressions are best avoided in serious scientific publications, in order to reduce the difficulties of translation. A multilingual glossary of terms and definitions, which could be used to program a dedicated machine translator, would be of value. Published guidelines offer guidance to methods of translation, but they are complex and time-consuming and are mostly used in translating instruments for eliciting patient-reported outcomes.

AB Machine learning (ML) poses complex challenges for user experience (UX) designers. Typically unpredictable and opaque, it may produce unforeseen outcomes detrimental to particular groups or individuals, yet simultaneously promise amazing breakthroughs in areas as diverse as medical diagnosis and universal translation. This results in a polarized view of ML, which is often manifested through a technology-as-monster metaphor. In this paper, we acknowledge the power and potential of this metaphor by resurfacing historic complexities in human-monster relations. We (re)introduce these liminal and ambiguous creatures, and discuss their relation to ML. We offer a background to designers' use of metaphor, and show how the technology-as-monster metaphor can generatively probe and (re)frame the questions ML poses. We illustrate the effectiveness of this approach through a detailed discussion of an early-stage generative design workshop inquiring into ML approaches to supporting student mental health and well-being.

TI Advances in machine translation for sign language: approaches,
   limitations, and challenges
SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
AB Sign languages are used by the deaf community around the globe to communicate with one another. These are gesture-based languages where a deaf person performs gestures using hands and facial expressions. Every gesture represents a word or a phrase in the natural language. There are more than 200 different sign languages in the world. In order to facilitate the learning of sign languages by the deaf community, researchers have compiled sign language repositories comprising of gestures. Similarly, algorithms have been proposed to translate the natural language into sign language, which is subsequently converted into gestures using avatar technology. On the other hand, several different approaches for gesture recognition have also been proposed in the literature, many of which use specialized hardware. Similarly, cell phone applications have been developed for learning and translation of sign languages. This article presents a systematic literature review of these multidisciplinary aspects of sign language translation. It provides a detailed analysis of carefully selected 147 high-quality research articles and books related to the subject matter. Specifically, it categorizes different approaches used for each component, discusses their theoretical foundations, and provides a comparative analysis of the proposed approaches. Lastly, open research challenges and future directions for each facet of the sign language translation problem have been discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey on sign language translation that discusses state-of-the-art research from multi-disciplinary perspectives.

AB Our aim was to develop a Bayesian delineation framework of clinical target volumes (CTVs) for prostate cancer radiotherapy using an anatomical-features-based machine learning (AF-ML) technique. Probabilistic atlases (PAs) of the pelvic bone and the CTV were generated from 43 training cases. Translation vectors, which could move the CTV PAs to CTV locations, were estimated using the AF-ML after a bone-based registration between the PAs and planning computed tomography (CT) images. An input vector derived from 11 AF points was fed to three AF-ML techniques (artificial neural network: ANN, random forest: RF, support vector machine: SVM). The AF points were selected from edge points and centroids of anatomical structures around prostate. Reference translation vectors between centroids of CTV PAs and CTVs were given to the AF-ML as teaching data. The CTV regions were extracted by thresholding posterior probabilities produced by using the Bayesian inference with the translated CTV PA and likelihoods of planning CT values. The framework was evaluated based on a leave-one-out test with CTV contours determined by radiation oncologists. Average location errors of CTV PAs along the anterior-posterior and superior-inferior directions without AF-ML were 5.7 +/- 4.6 mm and 5.5 +/- 4.3 mm, respectively, whereas the errors along the two directions with ANN, which showed the best performance, were 2.4 +/- 1.7 mm and 2.2 +/- 2.2 mm, respectively. The average Dice's similarity coefficient between reference and estimated CTVs for 44 test cases were 0.81 +/- 0.062 with ANN. The framework using AF-ML could accurately estimate CTVs of prostate cancer radiotherapy.

AB MPI is a popular programming paradigm on parallel machines today. MPI libraries sometimes use O(N) data structures to implement MPI functionality. The IBM Blue Gene/Q machine has 16 GB memory per node. If each node runs 32 MPI processes, only 512 MB is available per process, requiring the MPI library to be space efficient. This scenario will become severe in a future Exascale machine with tens of millions of cores and MPI endpoints. We explore techniques to compress the dense O(N) mapping data structures that map the logical process ID to the global rank. Our techniques minimize topological communicator mapping state by replacing table lookups with a mapping function. We also explore caching schemes with performance results to optimize overheads of the mapping functions for recent translations in multiple MPI micro-benchmarks, and the 3D FFT and Algebraic Multi Grid application benchmarks.

AB API calls can be described using natural language and can be implemented using a programming language. A programming environment that can process natural language descriptions within source code and provide context aware code suggestions can significantly improve productivity of developers and make programming more accessible to non-programmers and less experienced programmers. This paper proposes a context-aware tool called API Call Programming Interface (ACPI) which allows developers to write a natural language description for methods within source code and get correct and compilable API Call (AC) based on the text description and surrounding code. Existing work and code suggestion tools only consider the user's natural language description as input and ignore the contextual surrounding code. We take surrounding code into account and include information about local variable names within the code suggestion. Our approach consists of three modules. First, Method Name Generator, an unsupervised neural-embeddings-based algorithm to map the natural language description of methods to a list of most likely method names. Second, an AST Generator, a supervised Machine Translation model that predicts the structure of the AST from the list of the method names. And third, a Code Synthesizer that assigns local variables names to the AST to get the final method calls. Further, we include a Ranking Module that ranks the list of suggested method names based on their completeness. We evaluated our approach on data from 1000 high-quality Java projects and achieved an accuracy of 61% for API calls suggestions from natural language descriptions, which outperforms prior work and demonstrates the potential of our approach. We also conducted productivity experiments with 148 undergraduate participants to measure the usefulness of ACPI. The experiment showed that programming with ACPI can reduce programming time by 45% and increase programming accuracy from 19% to 83% when compared to programming without ACPI in four code completion tasks.

AB An optical system for the automatic recalibration of large machine tools during the machining process has been developed. The system provides an error signal during operation in order to compensate for structural deformations of axis and sliding parts. Those signals are used to reach a global positioning error below 50 microns on 3-axis translation stages, having range of several meters. One collimated diode laser beam has been mounted to the machining table reference system. Three resistive-type 2D-position-sensing devices are used to locate the beam on each axis. Before the first two sensors in the optical path, the beam is split by a wedge pentaprism in two secondary beams. The first one propagates linearly along the sensor for the displacement measurement. The second one is deflected with a fixed 90 angle and defines the sampling direction of the next axis. By duplicating the system using a second pentaprism on the latter deflected beam, three axis are monitored. In order to avoid any active electronic devises on the milling head, a passive corner cube is placed on the side of the head. Laser beam is then back reflected on a final position-sensitive sensor mounted in proximity of the second pentaprism. Additional channels consisting in laser beams back-reflected by mirrors on similar position sensing devices were used to acquire angular measurements as well. The tests performed on the prototype demonstrate the capability of mapping the actual deviations from the ideal linear translation with an error of 25 um along the full axis travel.

AB In this study, two machine learning based approaches have been compared that can add personal communication traits to a conversational recommender system. The first approach involves the creation of generative models for reactive tokens such as backchannels. The second approach involves a method for rewriting the conversational text by applying machine translation. Both approaches can impart personal communication traits to systems that incorporate a dialogue corpus. Two methods were implemented for a persuasive recommender system and their positive or negative effects based on an individual's personality were experimentally analyzed through a restaurant ranking task. The results suggest that addition of personal communication traits decrease objective persuasiveness while increasing the individual's impression on recommender systems.

AB Solver-aided domain-specific languages (SDSLs) are an emerging class of computer-aided programming systems. They ease the construction of programs by using satisfiability solvers to automate tasks such as verification, debugging, synthesis, and non-deterministic execution. But reducing programming tasks to satisfiability problems involves translating programs to logical constraints, which is an engineering challenge even for domain-specific languages.
   We have previously shown that translation to constraints can be avoided if SDSLs are implemented by (traditional) embedding into a host language that is itself solver-aided. This paper describes how to implement a symbolic virtual machine (SVM) for such a host language. Our symbolic virtual machine is lightweight because it compiles to constraints only a small subset of the host's constructs, while allowing SDSL designers to use the entire language, including constructs for DSL embedding. This lightweight compilation employs a novel symbolic execution technique with two key properties: it produces compact encodings, and it enables concrete evaluation to strip away host constructs that are outside the subset compilable to constraints. Our symbolic virtual machine architecture is at the heart of ROSETTE, a solver-aided language that is host to several new SDSLs.

TI A New Machine Learning Framework for Effective Evaluation of English

AB With the rapid development of information technology, English education has attracted the interest of scholars for its ability to rely on computers to analyze and understand human language. Taking machine learning (ML) as the core, this paper tries to develop an evaluation system for ML-based English education. Specifically, a basic ML model was established with four stages: environment, knowledge base, learning process, and implementation process. The entire ML system was divided from top to bottom into a user layer, a business layer, and a data layer. Application results show that, during the ML, even users with similar personal data and the same goal have vastly different suitable learning materials, due to their gap in personal capabilities. The research provides an effective way to evaluate English education in the context of computer science and artificial intelligence.

TI General approaches to efficient d-q simulation and model translation for
   synchronous machines: a recap
SO ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH
AB This paper summarizes some recent findings in the area of synchronous machine modeling by means of equivalent circuits of arbitrary order. This allows us to propose a concise analytical expression to be derived for the admittance matrix and yields a structure of the state matrices which facilitates their numerical evaluation. By organizing the parameters into two structured vectors, we show how to calculate the state matrices and admittance matrix of generalized models of machine by means of MATLAB programs. The techniques are proposed for passing from the equivalent circuits to the operational impedances and vice-versa. Lastly, we transpose the conventional electromechanical state equations into our generalized modeling framework and derive new formulas for the matrices used in the eigenvalue analysis of synchronous motors and generators. Besides conventional stability studies, the present approaches along with the MATLAB toolbox could be useful for machine-converter system optimization, motor starting problems, digital TNA implementation and machine models identification. The latter application is investigated in particular with a view to enhancing current methods used to analyse short-circuit oscillograms recorded during the commissioning of large utility grade generators and synchronous condensers.

AB In this paper, a hybrid strategy of rules and statistics is employed to implement the Uyghur Noun Re-inflection model. More specifically, completed Uyghur sentences are taken as an input, and these Uyghur sentences are marked with part of speech tagging, and the nouns in the sentences remain the form of the stem. In this model, relevant linguistic rules and statistical algorithms are used to find the most probable noun suffixes and output the Uyghur sentences after the nouns are re-inflected. With rules of linguistics artificially summed up, the training corpora are formed by the human-machine exchange. The final experimental result shows that the Uyghur morphological re-inflection model is of high performance and can be applied to various fields of natural language processing, such as Uyghur machine translation and natural language generation.

The translator from sign language to text is supported by two devices, namely the Microsoft Kinect and 5DT Sensor Gloves in order to gather data about the motion and shape of the hands. The hands configurations are classified using Support Vector Machines. The classification of the movement and orientation of the hands is achieved through the use of Dynamic Time Warping algorithm. The translation of Portuguese text to Portuguese Sign Language is supported by a 3D avatar which interprets the entered text and performs the corresponding animations. A serious game directed to assist in the difficult task of learning the Portuguese Sign Language is presented.

AB The objective of the study is to establish the technologies of automatic similarity analysis and comparison of two method patents in order to reduce the cost and human efforts. We propose a method to compare the similarity between the components and prepositions. The proposed methods automatically extract components, relations between components, steps, and relations between steps, and establish a machine readable tree structures for similarity comparison. Our experiments use the USPTO database [1] as data resource. The study conducts two experiments to evaluate the performance: 1) applying genetic algorithms to learn the weightings in calculation of step similarity and 2) comparing the performance with a statistical similarity calculation method, BLEU. The experimental results show that the system performs better in terms of recall and precision than BLEU methods that are usually adopted in machine translation.

SO COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM
AB MACHINE LEARNING, OR ML, is all the rage today, and there are good reasons for that. Models created by machine-learning algorithms for problems such as spam filtering, speech and image recognition, language translation, and text understanding have many advantages over code written by human developers. Machine learning, however, is not as magical as it sounds at first. In fact, it is rather analogous to how human developers create code using test-driven development. 4 Given a training set of input-output pairs {(a,b)|a is an element of A, b is an element of B}, guess a function f is an element of A -> B that passes all the given tests but also generalizes to unspecified input values.
   A big difference between human-written code and learned models is that the latter are usually not represented by text and hence are not understandable by human developers or manipulable by existing tools.

In a previous paper [1], we proposed a new design called CVM (Communication Virtual Machine) to overcome these problems by having a high-level API which can be reused and extended easily for user-centric applications in any domain. Within CVM framework, we came across a practical issue, which is actually the case for any end-to-end multimedia communication, namely the NAT-traversal (network address translation) problem that limits the reliability and availability of CVM and variants of CVM. In this paper, we explain about the necessity of self-configuration for the NAT-traversal problem in end-to-end communications, and propose a solution within the core CVM framework.

AB Optical character recognition (OCR) is one of the most popular techniques used for converting printed documents into machine-readable ones. While OCR engines can do well with modern text, their performance is unfortunately significantly reduced on historical materials. Additionally, many texts have already been processed by various out-of-date digitisation techniques. As a consequence, digitised texts are noisy and need to be post-corrected. This article clarifies the importance of enhancing quality of OCR results by studying their effects on information retrieval and natural language processing applications. We then define the postOCR processing problem, illustrate its typical pipeline, and review the state-of-the-art post-OCR processing approaches. Evaluation metrics, accessible datasets, language resources, and useful toolkits are also reported. Furthermore, the work identifies the current trend and outlines some research directions of this field.

AB Riboswitch development for clinical, technological, and synthetic biology applications constantly seeks to optimize regulatory behavior. Here, we present a machine learning approach to improve the regulation of a tetracycline (tc)-dependent riboswitch device composed of two individual tc aptamers. We developed a bioinformatics model that combines random forest analysis with a convolutional neural network to predict the switching behavior of such tandem riboswitches. We found that both biophysical parameters and the hydrogen bond pattern influence regulation. Our new design pipeline led to significant improvement of the tc riboswitch device with a dynamic range extension from 8.5 to 40-fold. We are confident that our novel method not only results in an excellent tc-dependent riboswitch device but further holds great promise and potential for the optimization of other riboswitches.

AB This paper present a novel method for robust and early Cercospora leaf spot detection in sugar beet using hybrid algorithms of template matching and support vector machine. We adopt three-stage framework to achieve our research target: first, a plant segmentation index of G-R is introduced to distinguish leaf parts from soil-contained background for automatic selection of initial subtemplates; second, we adopt a robust template matching method called orientation code matching (OCM), which could not only realize the continuous and site-specific observation of disease development, but also shows its excellent robustness for nonrigid plant object searching in scene illumination, foliar translation and small rotation; afterward, we employ a machine learning method of support vector machine (SVM) for robust and early disease classification by a color-based feature named two dimensional (2D) xy-color histogram, which has stable ability to classify disease against various illumination changes. The indoor experiment results demonstrate the robust performance of our proposed method for early disease detection against complex changes of external environment.

AB For network computing on desktop machines, fast execution of Java bytecode programs is essential because these machines are expected to run substantial application programs written in Java. We believe higher Java performance can be achieved by exploiting instruction-level parallelism (ILP) in the context of Java JIT compilation. This paper introduces VLaTTe, a Java JIT compiler for VLIW machines that performs efficient scheduling while doing fast register allocation. It is an extended version of our previous JIT compiler for RISC machines called LaTTe [1] whose translation overhead is low (i.e., consistently taking one or two seconds for SPECJVM98 benchmarks) due to its fast register allocation. VLaTTe adds the scheduling capability onto the same framework of register allocation, with a constraint for precise in-order exception handling which guarantees the same Java exception behavior with the original bytecode program. Our experimental results on the SPECJVM98 benchmarks show that VLaTTe achieves a geometric mean of useful IPC 1.7 (2-ALU), 2.1 (4-ALU), and 2.3 (8-ALU), while the scheduling/allocation overhead is 3.6 times longer than LaTTe's on average, which appears to be reasonable.

AB Biological literature is rich in mechanistic information that can be utilized to construct executable models of complex systems to increase our understanding of health and disease. However, the literature is vast and fragmented, and therefore, automation of information extraction from papers and of model assembly from the extracted information is necessary. We describe here our approach for translating machine reading outputs, obtained by reading biological signaling literature, to discrete models of cellular networks. We use outputs from three different reading engines, and demonstrate the translation of different features using examples from cancer literature. We also outline several issues that still arise when assembling cellular network models from state-of-the-art reading engines. Finally, we illustrate the details of our approach with a case study in pancreatic cancer.

AB The Semantic Web is founded on a number of Formal Languages (FL) whose benefits are precision, lack of ambiguity, and ability to automate reasoning tasks such as inference or query answering. This however poses the challenge of mediation between machines and users because the latter generally prefer Natural Languages (NL) for accessing and authoring knowledge. In this paper, we introduce the N < A > F design pattern based on Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), Huet's zippers and Montague grammars to zip together a natural language and a formal language. Unlike question answering, translation does not go from NL to FL, but as symbol N < A > F suggests, from ASTs (A) of an intermediate language to both NL (N < A) and FL (A > F). ASTs are built interactively and incrementally through a user-machine dialog where the user only sees NL, and the machine only sees FL.

AB We present a reversible runtime environment for simple parallel programs and its experimental implementation. We aim at a lightweight implementation of the backtrack reversibility by the state-saving mechanism using stacks. We translate a program to a sequence of simple commands of an executable intermediate representation for reversible stack machines. The parallel composition is implemented using the multiprocessing feature of Python. While executing the commands, the stack machines collect the information for the backward execution in the auxiliary stacks for the update history of the variables and the history of jumps. The commands for the backward execution is obtained by reversing the commands for the forward execution by replacing each command with the corresponding reversed command. In the purpose of behaviour analysis with reversibility such as debugging, our runtime is more portable than the source-to-source translation of a high-level programming language.

AB Type-preserving (or typed) compilation uses typing derivations to certify correctness properties of compilation. We have designed and implemented a typed compiler for an idealized logic programming language we call T-Prolog. The crux of our approach is a new certifying abstract machine which we call the Typed Warren Abstract Machine (TWAM). The TWAM has a dependent type system strong enough to show programs obey a semantics based on provability in first-order logic (FOL). We present a soundness metatheorem which (going beyond the guarantees provided by most typed compilers) constitutes a partial behavior correctness guarantee: well-typed TWAM programs are sound proof search procedures with respect to a FOL signature. We argue why this guarantee is a natural choice for significant classes of logic programs. This metatheorem justifies our design and implementation of a certifying compiler from T-Prolog to TWAM.

AB We build on the series of work by Dal Lago and coauthors and identify proof nets (of linear logic) as higher-order quantum circuits. By accommodating quantum measurement using additive slices, we obtain a comprehensive framework for programming and interpreting quantum computation. Specifically, we introduce a quantum lambda calculus MLLqm and define its geometry of interaction (GoI) semantics-in the style of token machines-via the translation of terms into proof nets. Its soundness, i.e. invariance under reduction of proof nets, is established. The calculus MLLqm attains a pleasant balance between expressivity (it is higher-order and accommodates all quantum operations) and concreteness of models (given as token machines, i.e. in the form of automata).

AB Bilingual semantic term association is very useful in cross-language information retrieval, statistical machine translation, and many other applications in natural language processing. In this paper, we present a method, named SBA-term, which applies sparse linear regression (Lasso, Least Squares with l(1) penalty) and L-2 rescaling for design matrix to the task of bilingual term association. The approach hinges on formulating the task as a feature selection problem within a classification framework. Our experimental results indicate that our novel proposed method is more efficient than co-occurrence at extracting relevant bilingual terms semantic associations. In addition, our approach connects the vibrant area of sparse machine learning to an important problem of natural language processing.

AB The declarative nature of functional programming languages causes many difficulties in their efficient implementation on conventional machines. The problem is much harder when the language has non-strict (lazy) semantics. Abstract machines serve as an intellectual aid in bridging the semantic gap between such languages and the conventional von Neumann architecture. However they become more and more complex with time as efficiency considerations force the instruction set of the machine to grow in size. In this paper we explain the phenomenon in context of the Three Instruction Machine (TIM). We then define a rationalized instruction set for TIM that allows us to view all enhancements to TIM in a uniform way, This instruction set is quite close to RISC instructions and clearly identifies the key operations on closures. Translation of functional programs to our rationalized instruction set opens up scope for various local and global optimizations. We illustrate this by showing how to build control flow graphs and perform optimizations on it. Lazy arguments in functional programs make it hard to predict evaluation order statically. We define the notion of pseudo-lazy arguments to statically expose the control flow information, wherever possible, for doing better flow analysis.

TI Software Engineering Meets Systems Engineering: Conceptual Modeling
   Applied to Engineering Operations
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND NETWORK SECURITY
AB Models are fundamentally crucial to many scientific fields, including software engineering, systems engineering, enterprise modeling, and business modeling. This paper focuses on diagrammatic conceptual modeling, as opposed to mathematical or computational models, wherein a conceptual model is a translation of reality processes into an abstract mechanism that has similar structure and parallel events of the external processes. Although various modeling approaches exist, including UML (Unified Modeling Language) in software engineering and its dialect, SysML (System Modeling Language), in systems engineering, several difficulties arise in such models, including the problem of model multiplicity that is related to the lack an integrated view of structure and behavior. This paper generalizes conceptual modeling to be applied in organizations at large. According to authorities, the so-called organization theory portrays organizations as machine-like systems. As a machine, an organization coordinates its parts to transform inputs into outputs. Therefore, we synthesize the notion of an organization as a machine and apply a new modeling methodology called thinging machine (TM) to real engineering operations. The results show the viability of the TM methodology serving as a foundation for highlevel modelling of systems.

TI Kinematic Analysis and Parameter Measurement for Multi-Axis Laser
   Engraving Machine Tools
SO MACHINES
AB Multi-axis Laser Engraving Machine Tools (LEMT) are widely used in precision processing of parts with complex surface. The accuracy of kinematic model and parameter measurement are the key factors determining the processing quality of LEMT. In this paper, a kinematic model of multi-axis LEMT was established based on Homogeneous Transformation Matrix (HTM). Two types of unknown parameters, linkage parameters and positioning parameters, were measured in the presented model. Taking advantage of the characteristics of laser processing, this paper proposed a rapid measurement method of linkage parameters by combining the machine tool motion with the laser marking action. For positioning parameters, this study proposed a non-contact measurement method based on structured light scanner, which can obtain the translation values and the rotation values from the Workpiece Coordinate System (WCS) to the Basic Coordinate System (BCS) simultaneously. After the measurement of two kinds of parameters of a multi-axis LEMT was completed, the processing of a spatial curve was performed and the average contour error was controlled at 15.1 mu m, which is sufficient to meet the project requirements.

TI Development of an optical measuring system for integrated geometric
   errors of a three-axis miniaturized machine tool
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB Miniaturized machine tool (mMT) is one kind of downsized machine tool derived from conventional machines to manufacture miniature parts. However, it is extremely difficult to calibrate an mMT due to its small dimension. This paper presents a novel method that uses laser diode and optics to measure integrated geometric errors ( three translation errors and three rotational errors). The squareness error between two axes is calculated by the least-square method. These seven errors are acquired simultaneously in one setup for each motion direction. The proposed measuring system consists of laser diodes, beam splitters, and 2D position sensing detectors (PSDs). The relationship between the PSD readings and the geometric errors calculated by the algorithm based on homogeneous transformation matrix is derived according to the configuration of measured mMT. Simulation is carried out to prove the validity of this algorithm. Sensitivity analysis based on the mounting errors of system components is also presented in this paper. Finally, an experiment is executed to verify the feasibility of the proposed measuring method.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB We aimed to develop machine learning classifiers as a risk-prevention mechanism to help medical professionals with little or no knowledge of the patient's languages in order to predict the likelihood of clinically significant mistakes or incomprehensible MT outputs based on the features of English source information as input to the MT systems. A MNB classifier was developed to provide intuitive probabilistic predictions of erroneous health translation outputs based on the computational modelling of a small number of optimised features of the original English source texts. The best performing multinominal Naive Bayes classifier (MNB) using a small number of optimised features (8) achieved statistically higher AUC (M = 0.760, SD = 0.03) than the classifier using high-dimension natural features (135) (M = 0.631, SD = 0.006, p < 0.0001, SE = 0.004) and the automatically optimised classifier (22) (M = 0.7231, SD = 0.0084, p < 0.0001, SE = 0.004). Furthermore, MNB (8) had statistically higher sensitivity (M = 0.885, SD = 0.100) compared with the full-feature classifier (135) (M = 0.577, SD = 0.155, p < 0.0001, SE = 0.005) and the automatically optimised classifier (22) (M = 0.731, SD = 0.139, p < 0.0001, SE = 0.0023). Finally, MNB (8) reached statistically higher specificity (M = 0.667, SD = 0.138) compared to the full-feature classifier (135) (M = 0.567, SD = 0.139, p = 0.0002, SE = 0.026) and the automatically optimised classifier (22) (M = 0.633, SD = 0.141, p = 0.0133, SE = 0.026).

TI On performance enhancement of parallel kinematic machine
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING
AB This paper proposes a spatial three degrees of freedom (DOF) parallel kinematic machine enhanced by a passive leg and a web-based remote control system. First, the geometric model of the parallel kinematic machine is addressed. In the mechanism, a fourth kinematic link-a passive link connecting the base center to the moving platform center-is introduced. Each of the three parallel limbs is actuated by one prismatic joint, respectively. The additional link has three passive DOF, namely two rotations around x and y axes and one translation along z axis. With the existence of this link, the unwanted motion of the tool (located in the moving platform) is constrained. The fourth link also enhances the global stiffness of the structure and distributes the torque from machining. With the kinematic model, a web-based remote control approach is applied. The concept of the web-based remote manipulation approach is introduced and the principles behind the method are explored in detail. Finally, a remote manipulation is demonstrated to the proposed structure using web-based remote control concept.

AB This paper presents a synchronous frame current regulator for salient-pole AC machines which is insensitive to both parameters and synchronous frequencies. The transformation from stationary to synchronous frame is known to produce a frame-dependent cross-coupling term, which results in degradation in current response at high speeds and is represented as an asymmetric pole in the complex vector form of such systems. The asymmetric pole close to right half plane (RHP) in the complex vector s-domain cannot be perfectly canceled by parameter-based design of PI controllers due to parameter variation. Complex vector design synchronous frame PI current regulator with a virtually translated asymmetric pole is shown in this paper to reduce the parameter sensitivity and to improve disturbance rejection. The current regulator with the virtually translated pole have been analyzed in complex vector form for non-salient-pole AC machine and in scalar form for salient-pole AC machines. It has been shown to yield comparable performances in both cases. This paper includes experimental verification of the performance of the proposed current regulator for an IPMSM.

TI Humans and machines as dual elements of complex systems
SO NAVAL ENGINEERS JOURNAL
AB The application of advanced design methods and technology has led to a significant increase in the amount of information used by a typical shipboard operator. This increase of information has advanced the level of information possessed by the operator, but has also increased demand on the operator. This increased demand, in the form of information interpretation, ambiguities, translation, and others, has increased the level of stress present in the human/machine interface. This increased stress level leads to increased safety concerns and decreased productivity on the part of the operator. Due to these system problems, it is appropriate to propose a new model of human/machine design.
   The proposed system design includes the description of a methodology to define the human/machine mix of tasks dynamically. Ibis dynamic mix will be based on the task loading present in the system. For example, as task loading increases, the machine will accomplish more tasks, whereas when the loading decreases, the human will be responsible for more tasks. This works toward the benefit of the operator and system in both cases. An example of the design of a simple interface utilizing this methodology is also presented.

In this paper an online sequential extreme learning machine (OSELM) algorithm adopted as training procedure for wavelet network based on serial-parallel nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) model. The proposed model used as system identification for nonlinear dynamic systems. The main advantage of OSELM over conventional algorithms is the ability of updating network weights sequentially through data sample-by-sample in a single learning step. This attains good performance at extremely fast learning. The initial kernel parameters of WN played a big role to ensure fast and better learning performance. Simulation of the proposed scheme applied to nonlinear dynamic systems validates that WN-OSELM is superior in terms of identification accuracy and fast learning ability compared to NN-OSELM.

TI Design and development of a novel 4-DOF parallel kinematic coordinate
   measuring machine (CMM)
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING
AB This paper presents the development of a new Coordinate Metrology Machine (CMM) using a novel four degrees of freedom parallel kinematics, namely C4, with three translations and one rotation about its X-axis. Design of the configuration, selection of the components, and detailing their interactions are among the most challenging tasks in this process. A detailed kinematic model of the designed configuration is derived, and the velocity Jacobian matrix for the moving platform and legs is calculated. Using the developed analytical approach, a novel graphical approach, and an experimental method the singularity and dexterity of the mechanism in the CMM's workspace are defined. Following a systematic design improvement process, variety of design parameters and components' details were analysed to select the optimum mechanism with the greatest dexterity and stiffness, and without singular points in a well-formed workspace. The final design is validated by construction of a fully functioning prototype of the mechanism, and experimentally testing variety of case studies. The results showed that the developed C4 mechanism presents a satisfactory level of dexterity and stiffness within a well-formed workspace as a CMM machine.

AB Borrowing ideas from Production functions in micro-economics, in this paper we introduce a framework to systematically evaluate the performance and cost trade-offs between machine-translated and manually-created labelled data for task-specific fine-tuning of massively multilingual language models. We illustrate the effectiveness of our framework through a case study on the TyDIQA-GoldP dataset. One of the interesting conclusions of the study is that if the cost of machine translation is greater than zero, the optimal performance at least cost is always achieved with at least some or only manually-created data. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt towards extending the concept of production functions to study data collection strategies for training multilingual models, and can serve as a valuable tool for other similar cost vs data trade-offs in NLP.

AB In Morpho Challenge competitions, the objective has been to design statistical machine learning algorithms that discover which morphemes (smallest, individually meaningful units of language) words consist of. Ideally, these are basic vocabulary units suitable for different tasks, such as text understanding, machine translation, information retrieval (IR), and statistical language modeling. In this paper, we propose to evaluate the morpheme analyses by performing IR, experiments, where the words in the documents and queries are replaced by their proposed morpheme representations and the search is based on morphemes instead of words. In this paper, the evaluations are run for three languages: Finnish, German, and English using the queries, texts, and relevance judgments available in CLEF forum. The results show that the morpheme analysis has a significant; effect in IR performance in all languages, and that the performance of the best unsupervised methods call be superior to the supervised reference methods.

TI Multimodal Machine Learning: A Survey and Taxonomy
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Our experience of the world is multimodal - we see objects, hear sounds, feel texture, smell odors, and taste flavors. Modality refers to the way in which something happens or is experienced and a research problem is characterized as multimodal when it includes multiple such modalities. In order for Artificial Intelligence to make progress in understanding the world around us, it needs to be able to interpret such multimodal signals together. Multimodal machine learning aims to build models that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. It is a vibrant multi-disciplinary field of increasing importance and with extraordinary potential. Instead of focusing on specific multimodal applications, this paper surveys the recent advances in multimodal machine learning itself and presents them in a common taxonomy. We go beyond the typical early and late fusion categorization and identify broader challenges that are faced by multimodal machine learning, namely: representation, translation, alignment, fusion, and co-learning. This new taxonomy will enable researchers to better understand the state of the field and identify directions for future research.

AB This paper presents the tool path optimization algorithms to compute and estimate the non-linear inverse kinematics errors of the 5-axis milling machine. The approach is based on a global approximation of the required surface by a virtual surface constructed from the tool trajectories. Errors are computed from the difference between the required surface and the virtual surface and displayed numerically and graphically through the virtual machine simulator. The simulator is based on 3D representation and employing the inverse kinematics approach to derive the corresponding rotational and translation movement of the mechanism. The simulator makes it possible to estimate the errors of a 3D tool-path based on a prescribed set of the cutter location (CL) points as well as a set of the cutter contact (CC) points with tool inclination angle. Errors, particularly near the vicinity of the large milling errors, are minimized using a discrete algorithm based on a shortest path strategy. Furthermore, the simulator can be used to simulate the milling process, verify the final cut of the actual tool-path before testing with the real machine. Thus, it reduces the cost of iterative trial and errors.

TI Toward human level machine intelligence - Is it achievable? The need for
   a paradigm shift
SO IEEE COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE MAGAZINE
AB Officially, AI was born in 1956. Since then, very impressive progress has been made in many areas-but not in the realm of human level machine intelligence. Anyone who has been forced to use a dumb automated customer service system will readily agree. The Turing Test lies far beyond. Today, no machine can pass the Turing Test and none is likely to do so in the foreseeable future.
   During much of its early history, AI was rife with exaggerated expectations. A headline in an article published in the late forties of last century was headlined, "Electric brain capable of translating foreign languages is being built." Today, more than half a century later, we do have translation software, but nothing that can approach the quality of human translation. Clearly, achievement of human level machine intelligence is a challenge that is hard to meet.
   Humans have many remarkable capabibilities; there are two that stand out in importance. First, the capability to reason, converse and make rational decisions in an environment of imprecision, uncertainty, incompleteness of information, partiality of truth and possibility. And second, the capability to perform a wide variety of physical and mental tasks without any measurements and any computations. A prerequisite to achievement of human level machine intelligence is mechanization of these capabilities and, in particular, mechanization of natural language understanding. In my view, mechanization of these capabilities is beyond the reach of the armamentarium of AI-an armamentarium which in large measure is based on classical, Aristotelian, bivalent logic and bivalent-logic-based probability theory.
   To make significant progress toward achievement of human level machine intelligence, a paradigm shift is needed. More specifically, what is needed is an addition to the armamentarium of AI of two methodologies: (a) a nontraditional methodology of computing with words (CW) or more generally, NL-Computation; and (b) a countertraditional methodology which involves a progression from computing with numbers to computing with words. The centerpiece of these methodologies is the concept of precisiation of meaning. Addition of these methodologies to AI would be an important step toward the achievement of human level machine intelligence and its applications in decision-making, pattern recognition, analysis of evidence, diagnosis, and assessment of causality. Such applications have a position of centrality in our infocentric society.

TI Transductive learning as an alternative to translation initiation site
   identification
SO BMC BIOINFORMATICS
AB Background: The correct protein coding region identification is an important and latent problem in the molecular biology field. This problem becomes a challenge due to the lack of deep knowledge about the biological systems and unfamiliarity of conservative characteristics in the messenger RNA ( mRNA). Therefore, it is fundamental to research for computational methods aiming to help the patterns discovery for identification of the Translation Initiation Sites (TIS). In the field of Bioinformatics, machine learning methods have been widely applied based on the inductive inference, as Inductive Support Vector Machine (ISVM). On the other hand, not so much attention has been given to transductive inference-based machine learning methods such as Transductive Support Vector Machine (TSVM). The transductive inference performs well for problems in which the amount of unlabeled sequences is considerably greater than the labeled ones. Similarly, the problem of predicting the TIS may take advantage of transductive methods due to the fact that the amount of new sequences grows rapidly with the progress of Genome Project that allows the study of new organisms. Consequently, this work aims to investigate the transductive learning towards TIS identification and compare the results with those obtained in inductive method.
   Results: The transductive inference presents better results both in F-measure and in sensitivity in comparison with the inductive method for predicting the TIS. Additionally, it presents the least failure rate for identifying the TIS, presenting a smaller number of False Negatives (FN) than the ISVM. The ISVM and TSVM methods were validated with the molecules from the most representative organisms contained in the RefSeq database: Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana. The transductive method presented F-measure and sensitivity higher than 90% and also higher than the results obtained with ISVM. The ISVM and TSVM approaches were implemented in the TransduTIS tool, TransduTIS-I and TransduTIS-T respectively, available in a web interface. These approaches were compared with the TISHunter, TIS Miner, NetStart tools, presenting satisfactory results.
   Conclusions: In relation to precision, the results are similar for the ISVM and TSVM classifiers. However, the results show that the application of TSVM approach ensured an improvement, specially for F-measure and sensitivity. Moreover, it was possible to identify a potential for the application of TSVM, which is for organisms in the initial study phase with few identified sequences in the databases.

TI SPEChecker: Checking the feasibility of Slow-port-exhaustion attack on
   various hypervisors
SO INTERNET OF THINGS
AB Nowadays, with the emergence of IoT technologies, the number of devices connected to the Internet is rapidly increasing. As a result, Network Address Translation (NAT) mechanism is widely used to let multiple devices within a private network make use of a fewer number of public IP addresses. In this research, we focus on Port Address Translation (PAT), an extension of the NAT mechanism that can translate both the IP address and the port number of a TCP/IP packet. An apparent downside of PAT is the fact that when all of the ports are used, no more new outbound connections could be made from the local addresses. In 2018, we introduced Slow-port-exhaustion DoS Attack on a virtual network, a novel type of DoS Attack that exploits some flaws of the TCP protocol and the limitation of the PAT mechanism. In this attack, a compromised internal virtual machine with a low amount of attack bandwidth can occupy the host machine's ports for a long time and therefore makes other machines on the same virtual network could not connect to the external network. In this paper, we present SPEChecker, a testing tool that can be used to check the feasibility of the Slow-port-exhaustion attack on virtual networks. In the analysis, we also explore a case of a TCP Host that could support this attack. Our testing results also show the potential of SPEChecker in evaluating virtual network security.

In 2005, several independent efforts showed that discriminative models could be used to enhance or replace the standard generative approach. Building on this work, we demonstrate substantial improvement in word-alignment accuracy, partly though improved training methods, but predominantly through selection of more and better features. Our best model produces the lowest alignment error rate yet reported on Canadian Hansards bilingual data.

TI Machine Learning-Based Hurricane Wind Reconstruction
SO WEATHER AND FORECASTING
AB Here we present a machine learning-based wind reconstruction model. The model reconstructs hurricane surface winds with XGBoost, which is a decision-tree-based ensemble predictive algorithm. The model treats the symmetric and asymmetric wind fields separately. The symmetric wind field is approximated by a parametric wind profile model and two Bessel function series. The asymmetric field, accounting for asymmetries induced by the storm and its ambient environment, is represented using a small number of Laplacian eigenfunctions. The coefficients associated with Bessel functions and eigenfunctions are predicted by XGBoost based on storm and environmental features taken from NHC best-track and ERA-Interim data, respectively. We use HWIND for the observed wind fields. Three parametric wind profile models are tested in the symmetric wind model. The wind reconstruction model's performance is insensitive to the choice of the profile model because the Bessel function series correct biases of the parametric profiles. The mean square error of the reconstructed surface winds is smaller than the climatological variance, indicating skillful reconstruction. Storm center location, eyewall size, and translation speed play important roles in controlling the magnitude of the leading asymmetries, while the phase of the asymmetries is mainly affected by storm translation direction. Vertical wind shear impacts the asymmetry phase to a lesser degree. Intended applications of this model include assessing hurricane risk using synthetic storm event sets generated by statistical-dynamical downscaling hurricane models.

AB This paper is meant for a heuristic approach for the refinements of corpus based on regular expressions and its possible applications in the field of Opinion Mining. Corpus which is the plural form of 'corpora' is nothing but the collection of linguistic data. And here the proposed work is based on a corpus of reviews: more specifically product reviews. The reviews are in the html files which are easily available in popular review sites like Cnet.com. The revolution in information and technologies has given a new era in the development of language industries. The versatility in technological development, along with the translations available in different languages has lead to use of this corpus for specific machine learning mechanism as well as various automatic translation applications. But the prime objective of researchers as well as the naive users is to give a fast developing technique of machine learning systems that should be both exact and effective. Most of the time it becomes a veiy tedious job to create exact dataset for the work due to the crisis of accurate corpus regarding respective research work. And that is why; we have proposed an algorithm for creating a corpus for opinion mining research field.

AB Current sequence-to-sequence models are trained to minimize cross-entropy and use soft-max to compute the locally normalized probabilities over target sequences. While this setup has led to strong results in a variety of tasks, one unsatisfying aspect is its length bias: models give high scores to short, inadequate hypotheses and often make the empty string the argmax-the so-called cat got your tongue problem. Recently proposed entmax-based sparse sequence-to-sequence models present a possible solution, since they can shrink the search space by assigning zero probability to bad hypotheses, but their ability to handle word-level tasks with transformers has never been tested. In this work, we show that entmax-based models effectively solve the cat got your tongue problem, removing a major source of model error for neural machine translation. In addition, we generalize label smoothing, a critical regularization technique, to the broader family of Fenchel-Young losses, which includes both cross-entropy and the ent-max losses. Our resulting label-smoothed ent-max loss models set a new state of the art on multilingual grapheme-to-phoneme conversion and deliver improvements and better calibration properties on cross-lingual morphological inflection and machine translation for 7 language pairs.

AB Translating characters instead of words or word-fragments has the potential to simplify the processing pipeline for neural machine translation (NMT), and improve results by eliminating hyper-parameters and manual feature engineering. However, it results in longer sequences in which each symbol contains less information, creating both modeling and computational challenges. In this paper, we show that the modeling problem can be solved by standard sequence-to-sequence architectures of sufficient depth, and that deep models operating at the character level outperform identical models operating over word fragments. This result implies that alternative architectures for handling character input are better viewed as methods for reducing computation time than as improved ways of modeling longer sequences. From this perspective, we evaluate several techniques for character-level NMT, verify that they do not match the performance of our deep character baseline model, and evaluate the performance versus computation time tradeoffs they offer. Within this framework, we also perform the first evaluation for NMT of conditional computation over time, in which the model learns which timesteps can be skipped, rather than having them be dictated by a fixed schedule specified before training begins.

AB Translation initiation sites (TIS) recognition is one of the first, steps in gene structure prediction, and one of the common components in any gene recognition system Many methods have been described HI the libel;Wire to identify TIS in transcripts such as mRNA, EST and cDNA sequences However, the recognition of TIS in DNA sequences is a fat more challenging task, and the methods described so far for transcripts achieve poor results in DNA sequences Most, methods approach tins problem taking into account, its biological features In this work we try a different, view, considering this classification problem from a purely machine learning perspective
   From the point of view of machine learning, TIS recognition is a. class imbalance problem Thus, in this paper we approach TIS recognition from tins angle, and apply the different methods that. have been developed to deal with imbalance datasets
   Results show an advantage of class imbalance methods with respect. to the same methods applied without considering the class unbalance nature of the problem The applied methods are also able to improve the results obtained with the best method in the literature, winch is based on looking for the next, in-frame stop codon from the putative TIS that, must be predicted.

SO MOLECULAR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY
AB Here, we develop computational methods to assess and consolidate large, diverse protein interaction data sets, with the objective of identifying proteins involved in the coupling of multicomponent complexes within the yeast gene expression pathway. From among similar to 43000 total interactions and 2100 proteins, our methods identify known structural complexes, such as the spliceosome and SAGA, and functional modules, such as the DEAD-box helicases, within the interaction network of proteins involved in gene expression. Our process identifies and ranks instances of three distinct, biologically motivated motifs, or patterns of coupling among distinct machineries involved in different subprocesses of gene expression. Our results confirm known coupling among transcription, RNA processing, and export, and predict further coupling with translation and nonsense-mediated decay. We systematically corroborate our analysis with two independent, comprehensive experimental data sets. The methods presented here may be generalized to other biological processes and organisms to generate principled, systems-level network models that provide experimentally testable hypotheses for coupling among biological machines.

AB The paper discusses a number of specific problems of natural text parsing that emerge during the operation of a highly developed rule-based machine translation system, ETAP-3. Emphasis is laid on two classes of problems: 1) adequacy of linguistic description of the working languages of the MT system and 2) means of resolving lexical and syntactic ambiguity of the source text. It is claimed that no parser, however sophisticated or advanced, can be made entirely free of lacunae and gaps. The reason is that many of the linguistic facts, including those critical for parser operation, have never come into view of researchers simply because they have not had at their disposal mass material of unexpected or incorrect parsing. It is exactly such material that is amply provided by a highly developed NLP system. If handled properly, this feedback helps the researcher to find the gaps of scientific descriptions and eliminate them. Consequently, linguistic experimentation with NLP systems becomes a rightful and very promising scientific method In a way, linguistic applications start to stimulate theoretical research, thus inverting the situation that has existed ever since NLP came to life.

In this paper we present a Persian-English sentence-aligned parallel corpus by mining Wikipedia. We propose a method of extracting sentence-level alignment by using an extended link-based bilingual lexicon method. Experimental results show that our method increase precision, while it reduce the total number of generated candidate pairs.

AB Embedding matrices are key components in neural natural language processing (NLP) models that are responsible to provide numerical representations of input tokens (i.e. words or subwords). In this paper, we analyze the impact and utility of such matrices in the context of neural machine translation (NMT). We show that detracting syntactic and semantic information from word embeddings and running NMT systems with random embeddings is not as damaging as it initially sounds. We also show how incorporating only a limited amount of task-specific knowledge from fully-trained embeddings can boost the performance NMT systems. Our findings demonstrate that in exchange for negligible deterioration in performance, any NMT model can be run with partially random embeddings. Working with such structures means a minimal memory requirement as there is no longer need to store large embedding tables, which is a significant gain in industrial and on-device settings. We evaluated our embeddings in translating English into German and French and achieved a 5:3x compression rate. Despite having a considerably smaller architecture, our models in some cases are even able to outperform state-of-the-art baselines.

AB The need for automated text evaluation is common to several AI disciplines. In this work, we explore the use of Machine Translation (MT) evaluation metrics for Textual Case Based Reasoning (TCBR). MT and TCBR typically propose textual solutions and both rely on human reference texts for evaluation purposes. Current TCBR. evaluation metrics such as precision and recall employ a single human reference but these metrics are misleading when semantically similar texts are expressed with different sets of keywords. MT metrics overcome this challenge with the use of multiple human references. Here, we explore the use of multiple references as opposed to a single reference applied to incident reports from the medical domain. These references are created introspectively from the original dataset using the CBR similarity assumption. Results indicate that TCBR systems evaluated with these new metrics are closer to human judgements. The generated text in TCBR is typically similar in length to the reference since it is a revised form of an actual solution to a similar problem, unlike MT where generated texts can sometimes be significantly shorter. We therefore discovered that some parameters in the MT evaluation measures are not useful for TCBR due to the intrinsic difference in the text generation process.

AB Sindhi is an Indo-Aryan language that is spoken by 24 Million people around the globe. By analyzing the recently researched data one can find that this is the lowest researched language with regard to the computations of the digital era, lacking behind in most importantly the sentiment analysis technique of Natural Language Processing. The digitization of the world required this language to be analyzed for prediction and other purposes. Sindhi can be analyzed thoroughly through Sentiment Analysis and several Natural Language Processing models are contributing to making the languages more predictable. The insubstantial amount of text analysis of this language can be because of the complexity of this language. Hence, there is a need for this language to be analyzed more efficiently using extraordinary machine learning algorithms. This paper focuses on the major aims of analysis of the Sindhi language's Newspaper Dataset `Awami Awaz' using the very famous machine learning algorithm Bi-Directional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT). This model works in both directions and accepts 104 languages. This work also claims some challenges in analyzing the typical Sindhi language which is not a chunk of BERT's multilingual 104 languages dataset. The problem is tackled by transliterating this language into English for achieving results. BERT, after translation through Google Translation API, secured 67.2% of accuracy. The hindrances can be overcome by adding the Sindhi vocabulary to BERT's multilingual dataset.

AB The use of architectures based on transformers presents a state of the art revolution in natural language processing (NLP). The employment of these architectures with high computational costs has increased in the last few months, despite the existing use of parallelization techniques. This is due to the high performance that is obtained by increasing the size of the learnable parameters for these kinds of architectures, while maintaining the models' predictability. This relates to the fact that it is difficult to do research with limited computational resources. A restrictive element is the memory usage, which seriously affects the replication of experiments. We are presenting a new architecture called Informer, which seeks to exploit the concept of information organization. For the sake of evaluation, we use a neural machine translation (NMT) dataset, the English-Vietnamese IWSLT15 dataset (Luong and Manning, 2015). In this paper, we also compare this proposal with architectures that reduce the computational cost to O (n . r), such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2020). In addition, we have managed to improve the SOTA of the BLEU score from 33.27 to 35.11.

AB Annotating documents or datasets using concepts of biomedical ontologies has become increasingly important. Such ontology-based semantic annotations can improve the interoperability and the quality of data integration in health care practice and biomedical research. However, due to the restrictive coverage of non-English ontologies and the lack of comparably good annotators as for English language, annotating non-English documents is even more challenging. In this paper we aim to annotate medical forms in German language. We present a parallel corpus where all medical forms are in both German and English languages. We use three annotators to automatically generate annotations and these annotations are manually verified to construct an English Silver Standard Corpus (SSC). Based on the parallel corpus of German and English documents and the SSC, we evaluate the quality of different annotation approaches, mainly 1) direct annotation using German corpus and German ontologies and 2) integrating machine translators to translate German corpus and annotate the translated corpus with English ontologies. The results show that using German ontologies only produces very restricted results, whereas translation achieves better annotation quality and is able to retain almost 70% of the annotations.

AB Named entity (NE) transliteration is mainly a phonetically based transcription of names across languages using different writing systems. For the Myanmar language, robust transliteration of named entities is still a challenging task, because of the complex writing system and the lack of data. The Myanmar NE transliteration dictionary has so far developed over 135,255 NE instance pairs of western person, organization and place names. We apply statistical experiments on Phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBSMT) model using 2-Grams, 3-Grams, 4-Grams, 5-Grams and 6-Grams language models in decoding. Different units in the Myanmar script, i.e., characters and syllables are compared. We perform experiments on 1,000 test data set and 1,000 development data set of our proposed dictionary and measure the performance of our system applying bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) score. We discuss detailed observations of our experiments in this paper. According to the evaluations, we got the significant results on syllable unit for Myanmar (Myan) to English (Eng) transliteration direction with 89.3% BLEU score and on character unit for English (Eng) to Myanmar (Myan) transliteration direction with 82.0% BLEU score.

AB In conventional metamorphic testing, metamorphic relations (MRs) are identified as necessary properties of a computer program's intended functionality, whereby violations of MRs reveal faults in the program-under the assumption that the source and follow-up inputs (test cases used in metamorphic testing) are valid. In the present study, the authors argue that MRs can also be used to validate and assess the quality of the program's input data-under the assumption that the source or follow-up inputs can be inappropriately generated. Using this new perspective, a case study in the natural language processing domain is used to explore the different types of text messages that are difficult to interpret by (Chinese-English) machine translation. A total of 46,180 short user comments on Personal Tailor (a 2013 Chinese film), collected from Douban (a popular Chinese social media platform), has been used as the primary dataset of this study, and the analysis of results demonstrates that the proposed MR-based data validation method is useful for the automatic identification of poorly translated text messages.

AB We present a CPU server with multiple FPGAs that is purely software-programmable by a unified framework to enableflexible implementation of modern real-life complex AI that scales to large model size (100M+ parameters), while delivering real-time inference latency (similar to ms). Using multiple FPGAs, we scale by keeping a large model persistent in on-chip memories across FPGAs to avoid costly off-chip accesses. We study systems with 1 to 8 FPGAs for different devices: Intel (R) Arria (R) 10, Stratix (R) 10, and a research Stratix 10 with an AI chiplet. We present the first multi-FPGA evaluation of a complex NMT with bi-directional LSTMs, attention, and beam search. Our system scales well. Going from 1 to 8 FPGAs allows hosting similar to 8x larger model with only similar to 2x latency increase. A batch-1 inference for a 100M-parameter NMT on 8 Stratix 10 FPGAs takes only similar to 10 ms. This system offers 110x better latency than the only prior NMT work on FPGAs, which uses a high-end FPGA and stores the model off-chip.

AB A chatbot or conversational agent is a software that can communicate with a human by using natural language. One of the essential tasks in artificial intelligence and natural language processing is the modeling of conversation. Since the beginning of artificial intelligence, its been the hardest challenge to create a good chatbot. Although chatbots can perform many tasks, the primary function they have to play is to understand the utterances of humans and to respond to them appropriately. In the past, simple statistic methods or handwritten templates and rules were used for the constructions of chatbot architectures. With the increasing learning capabilities, end-to-end neural networks have taken the place of these models in around 2015. Especially now, the encoder-decoder recurrent model is dominant in the modeling of conversations. This architecture is taken from the neural machine translation domain, and it performed very well there. Until now, plenty of features and variations are introduced that have remarkably enhanced the conversational capabilities of chatbots.
   In this paper, we performed a detailed survey on recent literature. We examined many publications from the last five years, which are related to chatbots. Then we presented different related works to our subject, and the AI concepts needed to build an intelligent conversational agent based on deep learning models Finally, we presented a functional architecture that we propose to build an intelligent chatbot for health care assistance.

AB Improving end-to-end speech recognition by incorporating external text data has been a longstanding research topic. There has been a recent focus on training E2E ASR models that get the performance benefits of external text data without incurring the extra cost of evaluating an external language model at inference time. In this work, we propose training ASR model jointly with a set of text-to-text auxiliary tasks with which it shares a decoder and parts of the encoder. When we jointly train ASR and masked language model with the 960-hour Librispeech and Opensubtitles data respectively, we observe WER reductions of 16% and 20% on test-other and test-clean respectively over an ASR-only baseline without any extra cost at inference time, and reductions of 6% and 8% compared to a stronger MUTE-L baseline which trains the decoder with the same text data as our model. We achieve further improvements when we train masked language model on Librispeech data or when we use machine translation as the auxiliary task, without significantly sacrificing performance on the task itself.

AB A computationally relevant theory of lexical semantics must take into consideration both the form and the content of three different static knowledge sources - the lexicon, the ontological domain model and a text meaning representation language. Meanings of lexical units are interpreted in terms of their mappings into the ontology and/or their contributions to the text meaning representation. We briefly describe one such theory. Its precepts have been used in DIONYSUS, a machine translation system prototype.

AB Complete Multi-lingual Neural Machine Translation (C-MNMT) achieves superior performance against the conventional MNMT by constructing multi-way aligned corpus, i.e., aligning bilingual training examples from different language pairs when either their source or target sides are identical. However, since exactly identical sentences from different language pairs are scarce, the power of the multi-way aligned corpus is limited by its scale. To handle this problem, this paper proposes "Extract and Generate" (EAG), a two-step approach to construct large-scale and high-quality multi-way aligned corpus from bilingual data. Specifically, we first extract candidate aligned examples by pairing the bilingual examples from different language pairs with highly similar source or target sentences; and then generate the final aligned examples from the candidates with a well-trained generation model. With this two-step pipeline, EAG can construct a large-scale and multi-way aligned corpus whose diversity is almost identical to the original bilingual corpus. Experiments on two publicly available datasets i.e., WMT-5 and OPUS-100, show that the proposed method achieves significant improvements over strong baselines, with +1.1 and +1.4 BLEU points improvements on the two datasets respectively.

AB We provide an overview on the preliminary development of a neural machine translation and deep learning approach to extract the emotional content of economic and financial news from Spanish journals. To this end, we exploit a dataset of over 14 million articles published in Spanish newspapers over the period from 1st of July 1996 until 31st of December 2019. We examine the role of these news-based emotions indicators in forecasting the Spanish IBEX-35 stock market index by using DeepAR [8], an advanced neural forecasting method based on auto-regressive Recurrent Neural Networks operating into a probabilistic setting. The DeepAR model is trained by adopting a rolling-window approach to best accounting for non-linearities in the data, and employed to produce point and density forecasts. After providing an overview of the methodology under current development, some preliminary findings are also given, showing an improvement in the IBEX-35 index fitting when the emotional variables are included in the model, and an overall validity of the employed approach.

TI Entropy-based discrimination between translated Chinese and original
   Chinese using data mining techniques
SO PLOS ONE
AB The present research reports on the use of data mining techniques for differentiating between translated and non-translated original Chinese based on monolingual comparable corpora. We operationalized seven entropy-based metrics including character, wordform unigram, wordform bigram and wordform trigram, POS (Part-of-speech) unigram, POS bigram and POS trigram entropy from two balanced Chinese comparable corpora (translated vs non-translated) for data mining and analysis. We then applied four data mining techniques including Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), Random Forest (RF) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to distinguish translated Chinese from original Chinese based on these seven features. Our results show that SVMs is the most robust and effective classifier, yielding an AUC of 90.5% and an accuracy rate of 84.3%. Our results have affirmed the hypothesis that translational language is categorically different from original language. Our research demonstrates that combining information-theoretic indicator of Shannon's entropy together with machine learning techniques can provide a novel approach for studying translation as a unique communicative activity. This study has yielded new insights for corpus-based studies on the translationese phenomenon in the field of translation studies.

AB Automatic text recognition from ancient handwritten record images is an important problem in the genealogy domain. However, critical challenges such as varying noise conditions, vanishing texts, and variations in handwriting makes the recognition task difficult. We tackle this problem by developing a handwritten-to-machine-print conditional Generative Adversarial network (HW2MP-GAN) model that formulates handwritten recognition as a text-Image-to-text-Image translation problem where a given image, typically in an illegible form, is converted into another image, close to its machine-print form. The proposed model consists of three-components including a generator, and word-level and character-level discriminators. The model incorporates Sliced Wasserstein distance (SWD) and U-Net architectures in HW2MP-GAN for better quality image-to-image transformation. Our experiments reveal that HW2MP-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art baseline cGAN models by almost 30 in Frechet Handwritten Distance (FHD), 0.6 in average Levenshtein distance and 39% in word accuracy for image-to-image translation on IAM database. Further, HW2MP-GAN improves handwritten recognition word accuracy by 1.3% compared to baseline handwritten recognition models on IAM database.

SO IEEE ACCESS
AB It has always been a challenge for drawing novices to start learning from a zero proficiency level, oftentimes the process itself can discourage them from continuing. Imagine if there was a method that could automatically transform line shapes into arbitrary styles, it would be a time-saving wonder. In this paper, based on the machine translation method of Sequence to Sequence Learning model, we approximately regard the lines in the image as "words", and the long lines as "sentences", using data extracted from paired images to train. Our model extracts line features, and then transfers the features to the lines that formed the input images to generate the output images, which could be understood as an emulation of the machine translation process between two languages. The performance of our model has achieved promising results, attesting that our model has an excellent performance when it comes to the line style transfer using Sequence to Sequence Learning. Our method can be used as a supplement to the GAN model and expand the application and research of image style transfer.

TI MACHINE TRANSLATION FOR CHEMICAL SAFETY INFORMATION
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Hundreds of thousands of Chemical Safety Information Sheets (Material Safety Data Sheets) exist in main world languages.  A few data bases exist in a machine readable form.  In order to benefit from the bulk of this information a special microcomputer based translation system was developed, which translates the information sheets from the Finnish mainframe data base KETURI, Finnish Register of Chemical Safety Data Sheets, containing ca. 45,000 data sheets, into English.  The translated sheets will be further used by the seven participating developing countries once they have prepared their own chemical safety data sheets in their respective languages.  The intermediate results, the English language chemical safety data sheets may be processed and disseminated in various forms:  as word processor files, microcomputer data bases, on microfiche, and on CD-ROM (Compact Disc- Read Only Memory).  The initial results, after the processing of ca. 1000 sheets, are encouraging.  Although the language is relatively limited, the idea of using artificial intelligence in translating bulks of safety information is revolutionary and may have far reaching consequences.  The project was established jointly by the International Occupational Safety and Health Information Centre, CIS, of the International Labour Office, ILO, and the Kielikone Project of the Finnish SITRA Foundation.

The impact of the historical and social situatedness of Roget's Thesaurus on such algorithms is considered. The paper concludes by discussing connections between Masterman's research and modem research.

AB Recent work showed how an expression in a functional programming language can be compiled into a massively redundant asynchronous spatial computation called a distributed virtual machine. A DVM is comprised of bytecodes reified as actors undergoing diffusion and communicating via messages containing encapsulated virtual machine states. Significantly, it was shown that both the efficiency and the robustness of expression evaluation by DVM increase with redundancy. In the present work, spatial computations that become more efficient and robust over time are described. They accomplish this by self-replication, which increases the redundancy of the elements of which they are comprised. The first and simplest of these self-replicating DVMs copies itself by reflection; it reads itself from a contiguous range of memory. The remainder are quines. As such, they reproduce by translating and transcribing self-descriptions. The nature of the self-descriptions and of the translation and transcription processes differ in each case. The most complex self-replicating DVM described represents a fundamentally new kind of artificial organism-a machine language program reified as a spatial computation that reproduces by compiling its own source-code.

AB In Neural Machine Translation (and, more generally, conditional language modeling), the generation of a target token is influenced by two types of context: the source and the prefix of the target sequence. While many attempts to understand the internal workings of NMT models have been made, none of them explicitly evaluates relative source and target contributions to a generation decision. We argue that this relative contribution can be evaluated by adopting a variant of Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Its underlying 'conservation principle' makes relevance propagation unique: differently from other methods, it evaluates not an abstract quantity reflecting token importance, but the proportion of each token's influence. We extend LRP to the Transformer and conduct an analysis of NMT models which explicitly evaluates the source and target relative contributions to the generation process. We analyze changes in these contributions when conditioning on different types of prefixes, when varying the training objective or the amount of training data, and during the training process. We find that models trained with more data tend to rely on source information more and to have more sharp token contributions; the training process is non-monotonic with several stages of different nature.(1)

TI Direct self-control strategy for brushless DC motor with reduced torque
   ripple
SO IET ELECTRIC POWER APPLICATIONS
AB This study proposed a direct self-control (DSC) strategy with reduced torque ripple for brushless DC motor (BLDCM). Taking the inherent advantage of DSC, sensorless control can be easily achieved from the relationship between commutation points of BLDCM and the hexagon-shape flux linkage locus. Furthermore, in the premise that position sensor is absent, excellent steady-state torque performance can also be achieved by the proposed strategy, which is achieved by increasing the degrees of control freedom through translation of switching point. In addition, another attractive feature lies in its relatively simpler control structure. Detailed analysis of torque ripple is carried out by deriving the expressions of torque variation rate through solving differential equations. Durations of voltage vectors are calculated to ensure the minimisation of torque ripple. The superiority of the proposed method is confirmed by comparative experiments.

AB This paper addresses the problem of predicting the pronunciation of Japanese words, especially those that are newly created and therefore not in the dictionary. This is an important task for many applications including text-to-speech and text input method, and is also challenging, because Japanese kanji (ideographic) characters typically have multiple possible pronunciations. We approach this problem by considering it as a simplified machine translation/transliteration task, and propose a solution that takes advantage of the recent technologies developed for machine translation and transliteration research. More specifically, we divide the problem into two subtasks: (1) Discovering the pronunciation of new words or those words that are difficult to pronounce by mining unannotated text, much like the creation of a bilingual dictionary using the web: (2) Building a decoder for the task of pronunciation prediction, for which we apply the state-of-the-art discriminative substring-based approach. Our experimental results show that our classifier for validating the word-pronunciation pairs harvested from unannotated text achieves over 98% precision and recall. On the pronunciation prediction task of unseen words, our decoder achieves over 70% accuracy, which significantly improves over the previously proposed models.

AB In language processing, training data with extremely large variance may lead to difficulty of language model's convergence. It is difficult for the network parameters to adapt sentences with largely varied semantics or grammatical structures. To resolve this problem, we introduce a model that concentrates the each of the heterogeneous features in the input sentences. Build upon the encoder-decoder architecture, we design a latent-enhanced multi-filter seq2seq model (LEMS) that analyzes the input representations by introducing a latent space transformation and clustering. The representations are extracted from the final hidden state of the encoder and lie in the latent space. A latent space transformation is applied for enhancing the quality of the representations. Thus the clustering algorithm can easily separate samples based on the features of these representations. Multiple filters are trained by the features from their corresponding clusters, the heterogeneity of the training data can be resolved accordingly. We conduct two sets of comparative experiments on semantic parsing and machine translation, using the Geo-query dataset and Multi30k English-French to demonstrate the enhancement our model has made, respectively.

AB Contrary to the popular believes, the structure of signs exceeds the simple combination of hands movements and shapes. Furthermore, sign significance resides, not in the hand shape, the position, the movement, the orientation or facial expression but in the combination of all five. In this context, our aim is to propose a model for non-manual gesture generation for sign language machine translation. We developed in previous works a new gesture generator that does not support facial animation. We propose a multi-layer model to be used for the development of new software for generating non-manual gestures NMG. Three layers compose the system. The first layer represents the interface between the system and external programs. Its role is to do the linguistic treatment in order to compute all linguistic information, such as the grammatical structure of the sentence. The second layer contains two modules (the manual gesture generator and the non-manual gesture generator). In first module the non-manual gestures generator uses three dimension facial modeling and animation techniques to produce facial expression in sign language.

AB The growing complexity of modern digital design makes designers shift toward starting design exploration using high-level languages, and generating register transfer level (RTL) design from system level modeling (SLM) using high-level synthesis or manual transformation. Unfortunately, this translation process is very complex and may introduce bugs into the generated design. In this paper, we propose a novel SLM and RTL sequential equivalence checking method. The proposed method bases on Finite state machines with datapath (FSMD) equivalence checking method. The proposed method recognizes the corresponding path-pairs of FSMDs using machine learning (ML) technique from all the paths. And then it compares the corresponding path-pairs by symbolic simulation. The advantage of our method is that it separates the corresponding path pairs from all the paths and avoids blind comparisons of path pairs. Our method can deal with greatly different SLM and RTL designs and dramatically reduce the complexity of the path -based FSMD equivalence checking problem. The promising experimental results show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI D-Amino acids and D-Tyr-tRNA(Tyr) deacylase: stereospecificity of the
   translation machine revisited
SO FEBS LETTERS
AB Until 30 years ago, it had been considered that D-amino acids were excluded from living systems except for D-amino acids in the cell wall of microorganisms. However, D-amino acids, in the form of free amino acids, peptides and proteins, were recently detected in various living organisms from bacteria to mammals. The extensive distribution of bio-functional D-amino acids challenges the current concept of protein synthesis: more attention should be paid to the stereospecificity of the translation machine. Besides aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, elongation factor Tu and some other mechanisms, D-Tyr-tRNA(Tyr) deacylases provide a novel checkpoint since they specifically recycle misaminoacylated D-Tyr-tRNA(Tyr) and some other D-aminoacyl-tRNAs. Their unique structure represents a new class of tRNA-dependent hydrolase. These unexpected findings have far-reaching implications for our understanding of protein synthesis and its origin.

AB As the real-world applications (image segmentation, speech recognition, machine translation, etc.) are increasingly adopting Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), DNN's vulnerabilities in a malicious environment have become an increasingly important research topic in adversarial machine learning. Adversarial machine learning (AML) focuses on exploring vulnerabilities and defensive techniques for machine learning models. Recent work has shown that most adversarial audio generation methods fail to consider audios' temporal dependency (TD) (i.e., adversarial audios exhibit weaker TD than benign audios). As a result, the adversarial audios are easily detectable by examining their TD. Therefore, one area of interest in the audio AML community is to develop a novel attack that evades a TD-based detection model. In this contribution, we revisit the LSTM model for audio transcription and propose a new audio attack algorithm that evades the TD-based detection by explicitly controlling the TD in generated adversarial audios. The experimental results show that the detectability of our adversarial audio is significantly reduced compared to the stale-of-the-art audio attack algorithms. Furthermore, experiments also show that our adversarial audios remain nearly indistinguishable from benign audios with only negligible perturbation magnitude.

AB Obtaining human-like performance in NLP is often argued to require compositional generalisation. Whether neural networks exhibit this ability is usually studied by training models on highly compositional synthetic data. However, compositionality in natural language is much more complex than the rigid, arithmetic-like version such data adheres to, and artificial compositionality tests thus do not allow us to determine how neural models deal with more realistic forms of compositionality. In this work, we re-instantiate three compositionality tests from the literature and reformulate them for neural machine translation (NMT). Our results highlight that: i) unfavourably, models trained on more data are more compositional; ii) models are sometimes less compositional than expected, but sometimes more, exemplifying that different levels of compositionality are required, and models are not always able to modulate between them correctly; iii) some of the non-compositional behaviours are mistakes, whereas others reflect the natural variation in data. Apart from an empirical study, our work is a call to action: we should rethink the evaluation of compositionality in neural networks and develop benchmarks using real data to evaluate compositionality on natural language, where composing meaning is not as straightforward as doing the math.(1)

AB Text Matching is the task of examining two pieces of texts, such as query and documents, and determining whether they have the same meaning. Text Matching is very important in many NLP tasks, such as document retrieval, question answering, automatic conversation, machine translation, etc. In recent years, there existed some representation-based and interaction-based neural networks which have achieved some improvements. However powerful attention mechanism is rarely used in these models. Inspired by the success of attention in machine translation and document classification, in this paper, we propose a Deep Hierarchical Attention Networks for Text Matching, namely Deep-HAN-Matching. Specifically, Deep-HAN-Matching extracts meaningful matching patterns and rich contextual features hierarchically from words to total document at the query term level using the recurrent neural network and attention mechanism, and finally rank the matching score produced by the fully connected neural network. Experimental results on WikiQA, a popular benchmark dataset for answer sentence selection in question answering, show that our model can significantly outperform traditional retrieval baseline models and some recent deep neural network based matching models.

AB Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the ability of a computer program capacity to understand both spoken and written human languages. Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a method for separating words with similar meanings and determining the words with the precise significance of meaning. It is an essential and critical application for all NLP tasks. Several methodological approaches come up in the context of WSD. There are supervised and unsupervised WSD approaches that are widely used in the disambiguation process. Supervised WSD approaches have shown better results than unsupervised approaches. The Naive Bayesian (NB) classifiers approach is known as one of the best methods among all the supervised approaches for WSD. NB is a classification algorithm that is based on the Bayes theorem and it simplifies learning by accepting that features are independent of a given class. In this paper, we use an NB classifier to disambiguate ambiguous English words by predicting part-of-speech inclusive of "noun,""verb,""adverb," and "adjective." This disambiguation module is an enhancement in machine translation. The system reported the performance measure of eighty-five percent of the scale of F1-measure.

AB Cross language information retrieval focuses on how to use the query expressed in one language to search the information expressed in another language. One of the key problems is to adopt different methods to establish bilingual semantic correspondence. In recent years, topic model has become an effective method in machine learning, information retrieval and natural language processing. This paper systematically studies the cross language retrieval model, cross language text classification method and cross language text clustering method. Without the help of cross language resources such as machine translation and bilingual dictionaries, it can effectively solve the many to many problem of Vocabulary Translation in CLIR and the problem of partial decomposition of unknown words. The experimental results on the cross language text classification evaluation corpus established in this paper show that the performance of cross language and single language text classification on the bilingual topic space constructed by this method is close to or better than that of single language classification on the original feature space, and the performance of cross language text clustering is close to or better than that of single language document clustering.

AB In face of the high number of different hardware platforms we need to program with Internet-of-Things (IoT), virtual machines (VMs) pose as a promising technology to allow a program once, deploy everywhere strategy. Unfortunately, existing VMs are either too heavy or use a stripped-down version to work on resource-constrained IoT devices. We present COISA, a compact virtual platform that relies on OpenISA, an instruction set architecture (ISA) that strives for easy emulation, to allow a single program to be deployed on many platforms, including tiny microcontrollers. By exploring the benefits of using a concrete ISA as our VM language, our experimental results indicate that COISA is easily portable and is capable of running unmodified guest applications in highly heterogeneous host platforms, including one with only 2kB of RAM. For time-critical IoT applications on constrained platforms where extracting performance is of paramount importance, we propose the use of cloud-assisted translations, which employ static binary translation to deliver a binary fully converted to the native ISA used in the IoT device.

TI Generative Adversarial Neural Machine Translation for Phonetic Languages
   via Reinforcement Learning
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TOPICS IN COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) heavily depends on the context vectors generated via attention network for the target word prediction. Existing works primarily focus on generating context vectors from words or subwords of sentences, limiting NMT models' ability to learn sufficient information about the source sentence representations. These situations are even worse when languages belong to extremely low-resource categories due to rare word problem. To improve the learning of source sentence representations and handle the rare word problem of Low Resource Languages (LRLs), we propose a novel improvement in Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)-NMT by incorporating deep reinforcement learning-based optimised attention in generator and convolutional neural network in discriminator. We also create the novel joint embedding of subwords and sub-phonetic representation of sentences as input to GAN that helps models to learn the better representations and generate suitable context vectors compared to existing traditional approaches for LRLs. To show the effectiveness of our method, we demonstrate experiments on LRLs pairs, e.g., Gujarati ? Hindi, Nepali $\leftrightarrow$ Hindi, Punjabi ? Hindi, Maithili ? Hindi and Urdu ? Hindi. Our proposed novel approach suppress the existing state-of-the-art techniques with considerable improvement.

TI Machine Translation Vs. Multilingual Dictionaries Assessing Two
   Strategies for the Topic Modeling of Multilingual Text Collections
SO COMMUNICATION METHODS AND MEASURES
AB The goal of this paper is to evaluate two methods for the topic modeling of multilingual document collections: (1) machine translation (MT), and (2) the coding of semantic concepts using a multilingual dictionary (MD) prior to topic modeling. We empirically assess the consequences of these approaches based on both a quantitative comparison of models and a qualitative validation of each method's potentials and weaknesses. Our case study uses two text collections (of tweets and news articles) in three languages (English, Hebrew, Arabic), covering the ongoing local conflicts between Israeli authorities, settlers, and Palestinian Bedouins in the West Bank. We find that both methods produce a large share of equivalent topics, especially in the context of fairly homogenous news discourse, yet show limited but systematic differences when applied to highly heterogenous social media discourse. While the MD model delivers a more nuanced picture of conflict-related topics, it misses several more peripheral topics, especially those unrelated to the dictionary's focus, which are picked up by the MT model. Our study is a first step toward instrument validation, indicating that both methods yield valid, comparable results, while method-specific differences remain.

TI Unlocking Applications of Cell-Free Biotechnology through Enhanced Shelf
   Life and Productivity of E. coli Extracts
SO ACS SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY
AB Cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) is a platform biotechnology that enables a breadth of applications. However, field applications remain limited due to the poor shelf-stability of aqueous cell extracts required for CFPS. Lyophilization of E. coli extracts improves shelf life but remains insufficient for extended storage at room temperature. To address this limitation, we mapped the chemical space of ten low-cost additives with four distinct mechanisms of action in a combinatorial manner to identify formulations capable of stabilizing lyophilized cell extract. We report three key findings: (1) unique additive formulations that maintain full productivity of cell extracts stored at 4 degrees C and 23 degrees C; (2) additive formulations that enhance extract productivity by nearly 2-fold; (3) a machine learning algorithm that provides predictive capacity for the stabilizing effects of additive formulations that were not tested experimentally. These findings provide a simple and low-cost advance toward making CFPS field-ready and cost-competitive for biomanufacturing.

TI GANterfactual - Counterfactual Explanations for Medical Non-experts
   Using Generative Adversarial Learning
SO FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB With the ongoing rise of machine learning, the need for methods for explaining decisions made by artificial intelligence systems is becoming a more and more important topic. Especially for image classification tasks, many state-of-the-art tools to explain such classifiers rely on visual highlighting of important areas of the input data. Contrary, counterfactual explanation systems try to enable a counterfactual reasoning by modifying the input image in a way such that the classifier would have made a different prediction. By doing so, the users of counterfactual explanation systems are equipped with a completely different kind of explanatory information. However, methods for generating realistic counterfactual explanations for image classifiers are still rare. Especially in medical contexts, where relevant information often consists of textural and structural information, high-quality counterfactual images have the potential to give meaningful insights into decision processes. In this work, we present GANterfactual, an approach to generate such counterfactual image explanations based on adversarial image-to-image translation techniques. Additionally, we conduct a user study to evaluate our approach in an exemplary medical use case. Our results show that, in the chosen medical use-case, counterfactual explanations lead to significantly better results regarding mental models, explanation satisfaction, trust, emotions, and self-efficacy than two state-of-the art systems that work with saliency maps, namely LIME and LRP.

AB For global organizations, bringing individuals with diverse background together stimulates idea generation as well as extends existing knowledge base, which is beneficial for group productivity. However, native speakers (NS) may dominate cross-lingual teamwork communicating solely in a common language, which may reduce diversity and harm productivity of the whole group. As a solution, we consider it necessary to support non-native speakers' (NNS) contribution for equalizing NS' and NNS' participation. In this study, we examine how recent language support technologies might affect the group dynamics of collocated multilingual teams consisting of multiple NSs and NNSs. In our experiment, quads of two NSs and two NNSs were provided with a language support tool that integrates machine translation, automatic speech recognition and shared display to enable NNSs participating in multilingual teamwork without requiring them to use a common language. Automatic language detection allowed them to dynamically decide what language to use in their group discussions. We found that using the tool increased the variety of languages used (e.g., Chinese, English and Japanese) and had the potential to equalize NS' and NNS' participation.

TI Potential and limitations of radiomics in neuro-oncology
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB Radiomics seeks to apply classical methods of image processing to obtain quantitative parameters from imaging. Derived features are subsequently fed into algorithmic models to aid clinical decision making. The application of radiomics and machine learning techniques to clinical medicine remains in its infancy. The great potential of radiomics lies in its objective, granular approach to investigating clinical imaging. In neuro-oncology, advanced machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, are at the forefront of new discoveries in the field. However, despite the great promise of machine learning aided radiomic approaches, the current use remains confined to scholarly research, without real-world deployment in neuro-oncology. The paucity of data, inconsistencies in preprocessing, radiomic feature instability, and the rarity of the events of interest are critical barriers to clinical translation. In this article, we will outline the major steps in the process of radiomics, as well as review advances and challenges in the field as they pertain to neuro-oncology. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Two-points-based receptance coupling method for tool-tip dynamics
   prediction
SO MACHINING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Tool-tip frequency response function (FRF) is essential to predict chatter vibration in milling. This key input can be acquired by experimental tests, but a new test has to be performed for every tool clamped on the machine. To avoid such time-consuming procedures, receptance coupling methods have been developed, allowing coupling of the experimental dynamic response of the machine to the numerical model of the tool. Such techniques require joint rotation response, which is hard to experimentally identify. Inversion of receptance coupling technique is usually performed on additional experimental measurements to overcome this issue. This procedure amplifies measurement uncertainties, reducing accuracy of the coupling approach. In this article, a novel receptance coupling technique is presented. Machine and toolkit are connected through two distinct points, eliminating the experimental phase and computation of rotational degrees of freedom (DOFs). Only translation responses are required, acquired by a single test setup. Proposed technique was experimentally validated on different case studies.

TI A Comparison Study on the Orientation Capability and Parasitic Motions
   of Two Novel Articulated Tool Heads with Parallel Kinematics
SO ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
AB This paper proposes two novel articulated tool heads based on three degree-of-freedom (DoF) parallel kinematic mechanisms (PKMs). They can realize one translation and the A/B-axis (rotations about the x-and y-axes) linkage movements. Both of the proposed tool heads can be used as modular machining units in five-axis machine centers. Based on the proposed configurations, the performance comparison on orientation capability and parasitic motions is carried out to provide theoretical foundation for the design of a five-axis hybrid machine. In this process, the motion/force transmissibility is taken into consideration and the orientation capability is investigated by using local transmission index (LTI) as the evaluation criterion. To get better orientation performance of the selected configuration, kinematic optimization is carried out and a geometric deviation parameter is brought into the already established configuration. Consequently, the orientation capability of more than fifty degrees is achieved. The proposition of the tool heads and the corresponding comparison and optimization are very helpful for the development of the new hybrid machine tool.

AB Traditional knowledge distillation adopts a two-stage training process in which a teacher model is pre-trained and then transfers the knowledge to a compact student model. To overcome the limitation, online knowledge distillation is proposed to perform one-stage distillation when the teacher is unavailable. Recent researches on online knowledge distillation mainly focus on the design of the distillation objective, including attention or gate mechanism. Instead, in this work, we focus on the design of the global architecture and propose Tree-Structured Auxiliary online knowledge distillation (TSA), which adds more parallel peers for layers close to the output hierarchically to strengthen the effect of knowledge distillation. Different branches construct different views of the inputs, which can be the source of the knowledge. The hierarchical structure implies that the knowledge transfers from general to task-specific with the growth of the layers. Extensive experiments on 3 computer vision and 4 natural language processing datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without bells and whistles. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of online knowledge distillation for machine translation tasks. (1)

TI SAE-PD-Seq: sequence autoencoder-based pre-training of decoder for
   sequence learning tasks
SO SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING
AB Sequence learning approaches require careful tuning of parameters for their success. Pre-trained sequence models exhibit a superior performance compared to the sequence models that are randomly initialized. This work presents a sequence autoencoder based pre-trained decoder approach for sequence learning. This approach is applicable for the tasks in which the output is a sequence. In the proposed method, a SAE (Sequence Auto Encoder) is trained with an objective of reconstructing the input sequence. The weights of the pre-trained SAE are then used to initialize the decoder in the sequence model developed based on the encoder-decoder paradigm. The proposed pre-trained decoder-based approach achieves superior performance as compared to the pre-trained encoder-based approach and the pre-trained encoder- and decoder-based approach. The behavior of the suggested approach is examined using unsupervised pre-training. The proposed method is evaluated for neural machine translation and image caption generation tasks. Outcomes of the experimental studies on benchmark datasets indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TI Matching Measurement Strategy and Form Error Compensation for Freeform
   Surface Machining Based on STS Turning
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The freeform surface quality is limited by the measurement, and form error cannot be convergent via compensation machining. This paper proposed a surface matching measurement strategy based on the least squares principle and iterative precision adjustment to precisely obtain surface form error after manufacturing by single point diamond turning. Through the coordinate transformation of translation and rotation, the measured surface was aligned with theoretical surface at the same coordinate system. The corresponding simulation was carried out to verify the performance of the proposed method, and the simulation results indicated that this method can achieve accurate alignment in a sub-nanometer range. Finally, with XY polynomial freeform surface as the ideal surface, compensation experiments were undertaken. The form error of freeform converged continuously after compensation machining for three times, during which the form accuracy of PV and RMS were down to 335 nm and 34 nm respectively from 1.4 um and 173 nm. The results showed that capability of the proposed compensation method was verified and the form accuracy could be improved effectively.

AB Though the community has made great progress on Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) task, most of the previous works are solving English-based MRC problems, and there are few efforts on other languages mainly due to the lack of large-scale training data. In this paper, we propose Cross-Lingual Machine Reading Comprehension (CLMRC) task for the languages other than English. Firstly, we present several back-translation approaches for CLMRC task, which is straightforward to adopt. However, to accurately align the answer into another language is difficult and could introduce additional noise. In this context, we propose a novel model called Dual BERT, which takes advantage of the large-scale training data provided by rich-resource language (such as English) and learn the semantic relations between the passage and question in a bilingual context, and then utilize the learned knowledge to improve reading comprehension performance of low-resource language. We conduct experiments on two Chinese machine reading comprehension datasets CMRC 2018 and DRCD. The results show consistent and significant improvements over various state-of-the-art systems by a large margin, which demonstrate the potentials in CLMRC task. (1)

TI Identification of vibration-speed curve for hydroelectric generator unit

SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART O-JOURNAL OF
   RISK AND RELIABILITY
AB The faults of hydroelectric generator unit have many different symptoms, and the relation between vibration amplitude and rotating speed is an important diagnosis criterion. In this article, a novel vibration-speed curve identification approach based on statistical fuzzy vector chain code and support vector machine is proposed and applied to identify the relation between vibration amplitude and rotating speed. In the identification process, the shape features of vibration-speed curve are extracted by statistical fuzzy vector chain code at first and then input to support vector machine to identify the type of vibration-speed curve; furthermore, the fault type of hydroelectric generator unit can be determined. Compared with the previous methods, statistical fuzzy vector chain code shows the advantages of low feature dimension, simple calculation, invariance to scaling and translation, and sensitive variance to rotation. The results of identification and comparative experiments show that the proposed method is more effective and efficient and can identify the vibration-speed curve with satisfactory accuracy.

TI CryoETGAN: Cryo-Electron Tomography Image Synthesis via Unpaired Image
   Translation
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
AB Cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET) has been regarded as a revolution in structural biology and can reveal molecular sociology. Its unprecedented quality enables it to visualize cellular organelles and macromolecular complexes at nanometer resolution with native conformations. Motivated by developments in nanotechnology and machine learning, establishing machine learning approaches such as classification, detection and averaging for Cryo-ET image analysis has inspired broad interest. Yet, deep learning-based methods for biomedical imaging typically require large labeled datasets for good results, which can be a great challenge due to the expense of obtaining and labeling training data. To deal with this problem, we propose a generative model to simulate Cryo-ET images efficiently and reliably: CryoETGAN. This cycle-consistent and Wasserstein generative adversarial network (GAN) is able to generate images with an appearance similar to the original experimental data. Quantitative and visual grading results on generated images are provided to show that the results of our proposed method achieve better performance compared to the previous state-of-the-art simulation methods. Moreover, CryoETGAN is stable to train and capable of generating plausibly diverse image samples.

AB Previous work mainly focuses on improving cross-lingual transfer for NLU tasks with a multilingual pretrained encoder (MPE), or improving the performance on supervised machine translation with BERT. However, it is under-explored that whether the MPE can help to facilitate the cross-lingual transferability of NMT model. In this paper, we focus on a zero-shot cross-lingual transfer task in NMT. In this task, the NMT model is trained with parallel dataset of only one language pair and an off-the-shelf MPE, then it is directly tested on zero-shot language pairs. We propose SixT, a simple yet effective model for this task. SixT leverages the MPE with a two-stage training schedule and gets further improvement with a position disentangled encoder and a capacity-enhanced decoder. Using this method, SixT significantly outperforms mBART, a pretrained multilingual encoder-decoder model explicitly designed for NMT, with an average improvement of 7.1 BLEU on zero-shot any-to-English test sets across 14 source languages. Furthermore, with much less training computation cost and training data, our model achieves better performance on 15 any-to-English test sets than CRISS and m2m-100, two strong multilingual NMT baselines.

AB In the context of under-resourced neural machine translation (NMT), transfer learning from an NMT model trained on a high resource language pair, or from a multilingual NMT (M-NMT) model, has been shown to boost performance to a large extent. In this paper, we focus on so-called cold start transfer learning from an M-NMT model, which means that the parent model is not trained on any of the child data. Such a set-up enables quick adaptation of M-NMT models to new languages. We investigate the effectiveness of cold start transfer learning from a many-to-many M-NMT model to an under-resourced child. We show that sufficiently large sub-word vocabularies should be used for transfer learning to be effective in such a scenario. When adopting relatively large sub-word vocabularies we observe increases in performance thanks to transfer learning from a parent M-NMT model, both when translating to and from the under-resourced language. Our proposed approach involving dynamic vocabularies is both practical and effective. We report results on two under-resourced language pairs, i.e. Icelandic-English and Irish-English.

AB Neurotechnology as a research area can be defined as the convergence of neuroscience and tissue engineering/regenerative medicine. Through directed global initiatives concentrated on a better understanding of the human brain, an exponential rise in innovative functional biomaterials for the symbiotic integration of man and machine has risen. Unfortunately, neurotechnology as with other disruptive technologies faces the daunting path of traversing the broad chasm between the bench (development of technology) and the bedside (application of technology). Clinical translation of medical devices intended to assess, monitor, and treat sensorimotor injuries must address a selection of design and functional constraints which are cost limiting from a traditional manufacturing perspective. As a highly versatile technology, 3D printing in combination with advanced functional materials can be used to manufacture scaffolds for tissue engineering the neural-prosthesis interface as well as devices with predesigned capabilities of integrating spatial and temporal data sets usable in a diagnostic and therapeutic context. Therefore, recent neurotechnological advancements will be discussed in the realm of 3D printed functional materials (>2013) with a focus on their potential for clinical translation.

AB Modern standard Arabic (MSA) is the official language of spoken and written Arabic media. Colloquial Arabic (CA) is the set of spoken variants of modem Arabic that exist in the form of regional dialects. CA is used in informal and everyday conversations while MSA is formal communication. An Arabic speaker switches between the two variants according to the situation. Developing an automatic speech recognition system always requires a large collection of transcribed speech or text, and for CA dialects this is an issue. CA has limited textual resources because it exists only as a spoken language, without a standardised written form unlike MSA. This paper focuses on the data sparsity issue in CA textual resources and proposes a strategy to emulate a native speaker in colloquialising MSA to be used in CA language models (LMs) by use of a machine translation (MT) framework. The empirical results in Levantine CA show that using LMs estimated from colloquialised MSA data outperformed MSA LMs with a perplexity reduction up to 68% relative. In addition, interpolating colloquialised MSA LMs with a CA LMs improved speech recognition performance by 4% relative.

TI Machine Learning Based Prediction and Modeling in Healthcare Secured
   Internet of Things
SO MOBILE NETWORKS & APPLICATIONS
AB In this paper, we present the concept and the prototype implementation of our novel "Smart Observatory of Involuntary Medical Seizures (SOIMS)". SOIMS merges Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN), Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) as an intelligent platform for the prediction and modelling of involuntary seizures. The prediction process is elaborated with our proposed algorithms, namely, Qualifying Linear Regression Algorithm (QuLRA), Selective Clustering Algorithm (SeCA) and Real Time Clusters Correlation Algorithm (RT2CA). The assessment of the proposed system is validated based on the Physionet ECG patients' dataset. The implementation of the prototype involves an IoT/WEB proxy security embedded for translation between nodes CoAP/DTLS protocol and Hospital Information System (HIS) HTTP/TLS protocol. Our proposed solution outperforms existing schemes in the literature at different levels, namely: a) it uses a hierarchical combination of machine learning and prediction algorithms; b) it is open-source, interoperable and user friendly; c) it is a secured prototype implementation; and d) it reaches a higher rate of accuracy according to the correlation criterion.

AB Data Diversification is a recently proposed method of data augmentation for Neural Machine Translation (NMT). While it attracts broad attention due to its effectiveness, the reason for its success is unclear. In this paper, we first establish a connection between data diversification and knowledge distillation, and prove that data diversification reduces the modality complexity. We also find knowledge distillation has a lower complexity of data modality than data diversification, but challenging to boost performance. Our analysis reveals that knowledge distillation has a negative impact on the word frequency distribution where increasing rare words with unreliable representations. Furthermore, data diversification trains multiple models to further decrease the modality complexity, suffering from unbearable computational expenses. To reduce the computational cost, we propose adjustable sampling, which samples a model multiple times instead of training multiple models. Different from other sampling methods, our method introduces entropy to adjust the quality and diversity of the generated sentences, achieving the goal of reducing modality complexity and noise introduction. Extensive experimental results show our method dramatically reduces the computational cost of data diversification without loss of accuracy, and achieves improvements over other strong sampling methods.

AB This paper presents a chat application that make use of speech as interaction mode between users in their mother tongue. This system is based on Machine Translation (MT) which automatically translates a sentence from one language to other. Now-a-days, Chat has become increasingly important as an effective means to communicate in social networks. But in existing personal chat systems, chat services are text-based only. To circumvent this issue, innovative, practical XMPP-based chat system architecture is proposed in this paper that creates a Speech based chat services by integrating state-of-the-art technologies like Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Text to Speech (TTS) and Machine Translation (MT). The proposed system eliminates the need to have a common language for chat communication. In this chat system the user speak in their own language after selecting the language of their comfort. The audio will be recognized in real time. The text is translated to the language opted by end user and the system synthesizes it. Here, we discuss an interface prototype that can overcome the language barrier to some extent.

TI Human cortical prostheses: lost in translation?
SO NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS
AB Direct brain control of a prosthetic system is the subject of much popular and scientific news. Neural technology and science have advanced to the point that proof-of-concept systems exist for cortically-controlled prostheses in rats, monkeys, and even humans. However, realizing the dream of making such technology available to everyone is still far off. Fortunately today there is great public and scientific interest in making this happen, but it will only occur when the functional benefits of such systems outweigh the risks. In this article, the authors briefly summarize the state of the art and then highlight many issues that will directly limit clinical translation, including system durability, system performance, and patient risk. Despite the challenges, scientists and clinicians are in the desirable position of having both public and fiscal support to begin addressing these issues directly. The ultimate challenge now is to determine definitively whether these prosthetic systems will become clinical reality or forever unrealized. (DOI:10.3171/2009.4.FOCUS0987)

CL Incheon, SOUTH KOREA
AB In this paper, we study the problem of generating mispronounced speech mimicking non-native (L2) speakers learning English as a Second Language (ESL) for the mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD) task. The paper is motivated by the widely observed yet not well addressed data sparsity issue in MDD research where both L2 speech audio and its fine-grained phonetic annotations are difficult to obtain, leading to unsatisfactory mispronunciation feedback accuracy. We propose L2-GEN, a new data augmentation framework to generate L2 phoneme sequences that capture realistic mispronunciation patterns by devising an unique machine translation-based sequence paraphrasing model. A novel diversified and preference-aware decoding algorithm is proposed to generalize L2-GEN to handle both unseen words and new learner population with very limited L2 training data. A contrastive augmentation technique is further designed to optimize MDD performance improvements with the generated synthetic L2 data. We evaluate L2-GEN on public L2-ARCTIC and SpeechOcean762 datasets. The results have shown that L2-GEN leads to up to 3.9%, and 5.0% MDD F1-score improvements in in-domain and out-ofdomain scenarios respectively.

TI Analyzing and Controlling Inter-Head Diversity in Multi-Head Attention
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Multi-head attention, a powerful strategy for Transformer, is assumed to utilize information from diverse representation subspaces. However, measuring diversity between heads' representations or exploiting the diversity has been rarely studied. In this paper, we quantitatively analyze inter-head diversity of multi-head attention by applying recently developed similarity measures between two deep representations: Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis (SVCCA) and Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). By doing so, we empirically show that multi-head attention does diversify representation subspaces of each head as the number of heads increases. Based on our analysis, we hypothesize that there exists an optimal inter-head diversity with which a model can achieve better performance. To examine our hypothesis, we deeply inspect three techniques to control the inter-head diversity; (1) Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion regularizer among representation subspaces, (2) Orthogonality regularizer, and (3) Drophead as zero-outing each head randomly in every training step. In our experiments on various machine translation and language modeling tasks, we show that controlling inter-head diversity leads to the best performance among baselines.

AB Natural Language Processing is a computer science and artificial intelligence topic concerned with computer-human language interactions and how computers are designed for processing and exploring a variety of natural language data, in particular. The Structured Query Language for non-expert users is usually challenging database storage, they may not know the database structure. For database applications to improve the interaction between database and user, a new intelligent interface is therefore necessary. The concept of utilizing a natural language instead of a structured query language has led to the creation of the natural language interface to database systems as a new form of the processing procedure. This research aims to build a query generating process using an algorithm for machine learning to represent information according to the user's demands for answering the query and obtaining information. For the conversion of Natural Language Query into Structured Query, we utilized a lowercase conversion, removing escaped words, tokenization, PoS tagging, word similarity, Jaro-Winkler matching algorithm, and the method Naive Bayes.

TI LINEAR MOTION ERROR EVALUATION OF OPEN-LOOP CNC MILLING USING A LASER
   INTERFEROMETER
SO ACTA MECHANICA ET AUTOMATICA
AB The usage of computerised numerical control (CNC) machines requires accuracy verification to ensure the high accuracy of the processed products. This paper introduces an accuracy verification method of an open-loop CNC milling machine using a fringe counting of He-Ne laser interferometry to evaluate the best possible accuracy and functionality. The linear motion accuracy of open-loop CNC milling was evaluated based on the number of pulses from the controller against the actual displacement measured by the He-Ne fringe-counting method. Interval distances between two pulses are also precisely measured using the He-Ne interferometry. The linear motion error and controller error can be simultaneously evaluated in sub-micro accuracy. The linear positioning error due to the micro-stepping driver accuracy of the mini-CNC milling machine was measured with the expanded uncertainty of measurement and was estimated at 240 nm. The experimental results show that linear motion error of the open-loop CNC milling can reach up to 50 mu m for 200 mm translation length.

AB The enormous growth of information available on the internet poses a great challenge to Information Extraction tasks. Named Entity Recognition is one of such an Information Extraction task which works on locating the presence of entities belonging to some predefined categories. It is a crucial pre-processing tool assisting in diverse Natural Language Processing applications such as Automatic Text Summarization, Machine Translation, etc. In this article, we analyze the performance of different supervised machine learning algorithms worked for Named Entity Recognition task. For this, we use five diverse learning algorithms namely, Conditional Random Field (CRF), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based neural network to create a variety of models based upon several combinations of different features that are independent of any domain-specific knowledge. These algorithms are evaluated mainly for the Hindi language. The evaluation of experimental results shows how Multilayer Perceptron based neural network approach performs better than other supervised learning methods used in this task.

TI Making Compiling Query Engines Practical
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
AB Compiling queries to machine code is a very efficient way for executing queries. One often overlooked problem with compilation is the time it takes to generate machine code. Even with fast compilation frameworks like LLVM, generating machine code for complex queries often takes hundreds of milliseconds. Such durations can be a major disadvantage for workloads that execute many complex, but quick queries. To solve this problem, we propose an adaptive execution framework, which dynamically switches from interpretation to compilation. We also propose a fast bytecode interpreter for LLVM, which can execute queries without costly translation to machine code and dramatically reduces the query latency. Adaptive execution is fine-grained, and can execute code paths of the same query using different execution modes. Our evaluation shows that this approach achieves optimal performance in a wide variety of settings-low latency for small data sets and maximum throughput for large data sizes. Besides compilation time, we also focus on debugging, which is another important challenge of compilation-based query engines. To address this problem, we present a novel, database-specific debugger for compiling query engines.

AB We propose a static analysis technique that computes upper bounds of virtual machine usages in a concurrent language with explicit acquire and release operations of virtual machines. In our language it is possible to delegate other (ad-hoc or third party) concurrent code to release virtual machines (by passing them as arguments of invocations). Our technique is modular and consists of (i) a type system associating programs with behavioural types that records relevant information for resource usage (creations, releases, and concurrent operations), (ii) a translation function that takes behavioural types and return cost equations, and (iii) an automatic off-the-shelf solver for the cost equations. A soundness proof of the type system establishes the correctness of our technique with respect to the cost equations. We have experimentally evaluated our technique using a cost analysis solver and we report some results. The experiments show that our analysis allows us to derive bounds for programs that are better than other techniques, such as those based on amortized analysis.

TI Cross-platform binary code similarity detection based on NMT and graph
   embedding
SO MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES AND ENGINEERING
AB Cross-platform binary code similarity detection is determining whether a pair of binary functions coming from different platforms are similar, and plays an important role in many areas. Traditional methods focus on using platform-independent characteristic strands intersecting or control flow graph (CFG) matching to compute the similarity and have shortages in terms of efficiency and scalability. The existing deep-learning-based methods improve the efficiency but have a low accuracy and still using manually constructed features. Aiming at these problems, a cross-platform binary code similarity detection method based on neural machine translation (NMT) and graph embedding is proposed in this manuscript. We train an NMT model and a graph embedding model to automatically extract two parts of semantics of the binary code and represent it as a high-dimension vector, named an embedding. Then the similarity of two binary functions can be measured by the distance between their corresponding embeddings. We implement a prototype named SimInspector. Our comparative experiment result shows that SimInspector outperforms the state-of-the-art approach, Gemini, by about 6% with respect to similarity detection accuracy, and maintains a good efficiency.

TI Homopolar Bearingless Slice Motor With Flux-Biasing Halbach Arrays
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS
AB In this article, we present a new configuration of bearingless slice motor that levitates and rotates a ring-shaped solid steel reluctance rotor. The rotor is 50 mm in diameter and has salient features on the outer surface. Symmetric sets of Halbach magnet arrays, mounted on the tips of stator teeth, establish a homopolar bias flux around the rotor. The bias flux passively stabilizes the rotor in the out-of-plane tilts and axial translation, whereas the rotor's radial translations are actively stabilized by feedback control. The rotor saliencies spatially modulate the air-gap bias flux such that the resulting torque-current relationship is similar to that of permanent-magnet synchronous machines. We have designed, built, and tested a prototype bearingless motor and control system. The prototype system achieves a torque constant of 14.9 mNm/A, maximum speed of 5500 r/min, and suspension bandwidth of 84 Hz with a phase margin of 11.3$<^>{\circ }$. The rated torque and speed are 26.8 mNm and 3486 r/min, respectively, and the axial and tilting passive stiffnesses are 15.3 N/mm and 34.4 mNm/$<^>{\circ }$, respectively.

AB This study developed a method called non-axisymmetric curved surface turning (MACS-Turning) for a CNC lathe composed of a turning axis and two translation axes. The NACS-Turning method controls the three axes synchronously. This new machining method can reduce the lead time for non circular shapes such as cam profiles or pistons for internal combustion engines. In our previous report, we presented an outline of a machining principle and a CAM system for NACS-Turning. However, at the same time, we found the problem that the X-axis slide exceeds the allowable acceleration. Therefore, it is preferable that the acceleration is verified during the cam application, and the tool path is generated within the allowable acceleration range. Therefore, this paper first describes the determination method of machinable conditions for NACS-Turning in the cam application. Next, based on the result, relationships between the acceleration of the X-axis slide and machining conditions are clarified. Finally, the experimental procedure showed that our proposed method does not exceed the allowable acceleration of the X-axis slide.

AB Current practices in metric evaluation focus on one single dataset, e.g., Newstest dataset in each year's WMT Metrics Shared Task. However, in this paper, we qualitatively and quantitatively show that the performances of metrics are sensitive to data. The ranking of metrics varies when the evaluation is conducted on different datasets. Then this paper further investigates two potential hypotheses, i.e., insignificant data points and the deviation of Independent and Identically Distributed (i.i.d) assumption, which may take responsibility for the issue of data variance. In conclusion, our findings suggest that when evaluating automatic translation metrics, researchers should take data variance into account and be cautious to claim the result on a single dataset, because it may leads to inconsistent results with most of other datasets.

AB In the medical field, a serious problem exists with regard to communication between hospital staff and foreign patients. For example, medical translators cannot provide support in cases in which round-the-clock support is required during hospitalization. We propose the use of a multilingual communication support system called the Petit Translator between people speaking different languages in the hospital setting. From the results of experiments performed in such a setting, we found the following: (1) by clicking the conversation scene, the interface can retrieve the parallel text more efficiently than the paper media, and (2) when a questioner appropriately limits the type of reply for a respondent, prompt conversation can occur.

AB This paper proposes to disambiguate word senses by corpus-based ontology learning. Our approach is a hybrid method. First, we apply the previously-secured dictionary information to select the correct senses of some ambiguous words with high precision, and then use the ontology to disambiguate the remaining ambiguous words. The mutual information between concepts in the ontology was calculated before using the ontology as knowledge for disambiguating word senses. If mutual information is regarded as a weight between ontology concepts, the ontology can be treated as a graph with weighted edges, and then we locate the least weighted path from one concept to the other concept. In our practical machine translation system, Our word sense disambiguation method achieved a 9% improvement over methods which do not use ontology for Korean translation.

AB We present the first known direct measurement of word alignment coverage on an Arabic-English parallel corpus using inversion transduction grammar constraints. While direct measurements have been reported for several European and Asian languages, to date no results have been available for Arabic or any Semitic language despite much recent activity on Arabic-English spoken language and text translation. Many recent syntax based statistical MT models operate within the domain of ITG expressiveness, often for efficiency reasons, so it has become important to determine the extent to which the ITG constraint assumption holds. Our results on Arabic provide further evidence that ITG expressiveness appears largely sufficient for core MT models.

AB By the use of exponential-type functions (ETFs) the simpler formulas for the expansion of Slater-type orbitals (STOs) in terms of STOs at a displaced center are derived. The expansion coefficients for translation of STOs are presented by a linear combination of overlap integrals. The final results are of a simple structure and are, therefore, especially useful for machine computations of arbitrary multielectron multicenter molecular integrals over STOs that arise in the Hartree-Fock-Roothaan approximation and also in the Hylleraas correlated wave function method for the determination of arbitrary multielectron properties of atoms and molecules.

AB Parallel corpora are a valuable resource for machine translation, but at present their availability and utility is limited by genre- and domain-specificity, licensing restrictions, and the basic difficulty of locating parallel texts in all but the most dominant of the world's languages. A parallel corpus resource not vet explored is the World Wide Web, which hosts an abundance of pages in parallel translation, offering a potential solution to some of these problems and unique opportunities of its own. This paper presents the necessary first step in that exploration: a method for automatically finding parallel translated documents on the Web. The technique is conceptually simple, fully language independent, and scalable, and preliminary evaluation results indicate that the method may be accurate enough to apply without human intervention.

AB Automatic post-editing (APE) seeks to automatically refine the output of a black-box machine translation (MT) system through human post-edits. APE systems are usually trained by complementing human post-edited data with large, artificial data generated through back-translations, a time-consuming process often no easier than training a MT system from scratch. In this paper, we propose an alternative where we fine-tune pre-trained BERT models on both the encoder and decoder of an APE system, exploring several parameter sharing strategies. By only training on a dataset of 23K sentences for 3 hours on a single GPU we obtain results that are competitive with systems that were trained on 5M artificial sentences. When we add this artificial data, our method obtains state-of-the-art results.

TI Ribosome heterogeneity: another level of complexity in bacterial
   translation regulation
SO CURRENT OPINION IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB Translation of the mRNA-encoded genetic information into proteins is catalyzed by the intricate ribonucleoprotein machine, the ribosome. Historically, the bacterial ribosome is viewed as an unchangeable entity, constantly equipped with the entire complement of RNAs and proteins. Conversely, several lines of evidence indicate the presence of functional selective ribosomal subpopulations that exhibit variations in the RNA or the protein components and modulate the translational program in response to environmental changes. Here, we summarize these findings, which raise the functional status of the ribosome from a protein synthesis machinery only to a regulatory hub that integrates environmental cues in the process of protein synthesis, thereby adding an additional level of complexity to the regulation of gene expression.

AB Code-mixing and code-switching create challenges in the field of natural language processing applications like Machine Translation and Speech-to-Speech Translation. Detection of foreign words is very much essential for smooth processing of natural language. A statistical language independent approach for automatic detection of foreign words in mixed language has been introduced in this paper. Initially, the proposed approach has been applied on Benglish text which is combination of Bangla text contains English words. The methodology can be easily adopted for other languages where such code mixing exists. The proposed approach yields an accuracy of 71.82% when tested on sentences collected from Bangla blogs and social networking websites.

AB Transformer is a powerful architecture that achieves superior performance on various sequence learning tasks, including neural machine translation, language understanding, and sequence prediction. At the core of the Transformer is the attention mechanism, which concurrently processes all inputs in the streams. In this paper, we present a new formulation of attention via the lens of the kernel. To be more precise, we realize that the attention can be seen as applying kernel smoother over the inputs with the kernel scores being the similarities between inputs. This new formulation gives us a better way to understand individual components of the Transformer's attention, such as the better way to integrate the positional embedding. Another important advantage of our kernel-based formulation is that it paves the way to a larger space of composing Transformer's attention. As an example, we propose a new variant of Transformer's attention which models the input as a product of symmetric kernels. This approach achieves competitive performance to the current state of the art model with less computation. In our experiments, we empirically study different kernel construction strategies on two widely used tasks: neural machine translation and sequence prediction.

AB System combination has emerged as a powerful method for machine translation (MT). In the construction of word level confusion network (CN), the alignment and skeleton selection are two key issues of system combination. The paper introduces multi-CN for solving skeleton selection. We fail to yield the better performance through using simple prior score as CN-based feature, so we introduce more sophisticated CN-based and consensus-decoding-based features into combination framework to test multi-CN's validity. The approaches of multi-CN are shown to be superior to single-CN in the setting of the Chinese-to-English track of the 2008 NIST Open MT evaluation.

AB The provability logic Grz is characterized by a class of modal frames that is not first-order definable. We present a simple embedding of Grz into decidable fragments of classical first-order logic such as FO2 and the guarded fragment. The embedding is an O((n.log n)(3))-time transformation that neither involves first principles about Turing machines (and therefore is easy to implement), nor the semantical characterization of Grz (and therefore does not use any second-order machinery). Instead, we use the syntactic relationships between cut-free sequent-style calculi for Grz, S4 and T. We first translate Grz into T, and then we use the relational translation from T into FO2.

AB Automatic text summarization is a challenging natural language processing (NLP) task which has been researched for several decades. The available datasets for multi-document summarization (MDS) are, however, rather small and usually focused on the newswire genre. Nowadays, machine learning methods are applied to more and more NLP problems such as machine translation, question answering, and single-document summarization. Modern machine learning methods such as neural networks require large training datasets which are available for the three tasks but not yet for MDS. This lack of training data limits the development of machine learning methods for MDS. In this work, we automatically generate a large heterogeneous multilingual multi-document summarization corpus. The key idea is to use Wikipedia articles as summaries and to automatically search for appropriate source documents. We created a corpus with 7,316 topics in English and German, which has variing summary lengths and variing number of source documents. More information about the corpus can be found at the corpus GitHub page at https://github.com/AIPHES/auto-hMDS.

SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
AB The shape feature of an object represents the geometrical information which plays an important role in the image understanding and image retrieval. How to get an excellent shape feature that has rotation, scaling and translation (RST) invariance is a problem in this field. This paper proposed a novel local extreme learning machine (LELM) classification algorithm to extract the shape features. LELM finds nearest neighbors of the testing set from the original training set and trains a local classification model. The shape feature is represented by an analytic decision function with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel obtained by LELM. Our method has the following advantages: (1) LELM not only keeps the local structure of the samples, but also solves the imbalance problem between variance and bias. (2) Features obtained by the RBF kernel are RST invariant. (3) LELM is more robust against the noise and fragmentation compared to other methods. We also demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in image retrieval.

These different views contain redundant information that can be explored to enhance the performance of speech and language processing applications. We propose a method that directly integrates ASR word graphs or lattices and phrase tables from an SMT system to combine such parallel speech data and improve ASR performance. We apply this technique to speeches from four European Parliament committees and obtain a 16.6% relative improvement (20.8% after a second iteration) in WER, when Portuguese and Spanish interpreted versions are combined with the original English speeches. Our results indicate that further improvements may be possible by including additional languages.

In this paper, we take a natural step towards learning strong but light-weight NMT systems. We proposed a novel group-permutation based knowledge distillation approach to compressing the deep Transformer model into a shallow model. The experimental results on several benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method. Our compressed model is 8 times shallower than the deep model, with almost no loss in BLEU. To further enhance the teacher model, we present a Skipping Sub-Layer method to randomly omit sub-layers to introduce perturbation into training, which achieves a BLEU score of 30.63 on English-German newstest2014.

AB Cross-lingual embeddings (CLE) facilitate cross-lingual natural language processing and information retrieval. Recently, a wide variety of resource-lean projection-based models for inducing CLEs has been introduced, requiring limited or no bilingual supervision. Despite potential usefulness in downstream IR and NLP tasks, these CLE models have almost exclusively been evaluated on word translation tasks. In this work, we provide a comprehensive comparative evaluation of projection-based CLE models for both sentence-level and document-level cross-lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR). We show that in some settings resource-lean CLE-based CLIR models may outperform resource-intensive models using full-blown machine translation (MT). We hope our work serves as a guideline for choosing the right model for CLIR practitioners.

TI A parametric linguistics based approach for cross-lingual web querying
SO DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING
AB Developing efficient and meaningful search mechanisms for the Web is an active area of research in Information Management. With information explosion on the Internet, existing search engines encounter difficulty in accurate document positioning and retrieval. This situation is exacerbated by the language barrier for accessing web con tent provided in different languages. Sophisticated content-based search engines are needed for helping users find useful information quickly from multi-lingual knowledge sources on the Web. This paper presents a parametric linguistics based approach for flexible and scalable cross-lingual web querying with low complexity in query translation. The proposed methodology and the system architecture are discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Dynamics of tRNA dissociation in early and later cycles of translation
   elongation by the ribosome
SO BIOSYSTEMS
AB Deacylated tRNA dissociation from E site and aminoacyl-tRNA binding to the A site of the ribosome play a critical role in repetitive cycles of protein synthesis. Available experimental data showed that in the small range of aminoacyl-tRNA concentrations, during the first few cycles of translation elongation (initiation phase of translation) the E-sitet RNA can be dissociated either before or after the A-site tRNA binding, while during the later cycles of elongation (elongation phase) the E-site tRNA is mostly dissociated before the A-site tRNA binding. Here, based on our proposed model of translation elongation we study analytically the dynamics of the E-site tRNA dissociation and A-site tRNA binding, providing quantitative explanations of the available experimental data in both the initiation and elongation phases. In our model there exist two routes of state transitions within an elongation cycle in the initiation phase, with each route having stochastic E-site tRNA dissociation but with different dissociation rates. Thus, the E-site tRNA dissociation is governed by a stochastic competition between the tRNA dissociation and A-site tRNA association reactions, although in the small range of aminoacyltRNA concentrations used in the experiments it seems that such stochastic competition does not exist. Moreover, the detailed comparisons between the dynamics of tRNA dissociation in the initiation phase and that in the elongation phase are made.

SO BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB ATP binding cassette proteins are a large and diverse family of molecular machines and include transmembrane transporter, chromosome maintenance and DNA repair proteins, and translation factors. However, the function of the ABCE1, the only member of subfamily E of ABC proteins, remained mysterious for over a decade, even though it is perhaps the most conserved ABC protein in eukaryotes and archaea. Recent results have now identified ABCE1 as the ribosome-recycling factor of eukaryotes and archaea. Thus, two iron-sulfur clusters - the hallmark feature of ABCE1 - help catalyze an integral step of the translational cycle at the core of the protein synthesis machinery.

AB Predicting gene expression is one of the important tasks in molecular biology and genetics study. Studying the complex combinatorial code of gene expression could lead to a better understanding of gene regulation pattern i.e., how a gene increase or decrease specific gene products (protein and RNA) through translations. Such a pattern could be useful to study the origins of cancer, developing drugs for a certain disease, etc. In this study, we proposed to transform the Histone Modification data into one-dimensional space, and we predicted the gene expression by using Temporal Convolutional Networks. Previous studies proposed several methods ranging from classical machine learning approach (e.g., Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression), as well as the most recent machine learning techniques (e.g., DeepChrome and DeepNN). Experiment results reveal that our approach is superior in terms of AEC score, accuracy, precision, recall, f-score, and specificity against the state-of-the-art-method, and only slightly worst in terms of precision and specificity against Support Vector Machine.

AB To determine the relative pose between an object and a single camera using correspondences between 3D feature points of the object and their corresponding 2D projections in the image, this paper proposes a target's pose measurement algorithm based on the bundle adjustment method. This iterative algorithm can be divided into two steps: first, a reliable initial pose is computed by using only three non-collinear points; second, the optimal rotation and translation matrix of the target is estimated based on the bundle adjustment method. Experiments on simulated data and real data show that this method can get high precision with its rotation angles error within 20 arc-second and the translation error within 20 micron in ideal occasions.

TI Tenacious technophobes or nascent technophiles? A survey of the
   technological practices and needs of literary translators
SO PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATION THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB In a context of increasing investigation of technology use by translators of pragmatic texts, there appears to be an assumption that literary translation is a unique practice and that digital tools designed to improve the productivity of non-literary translators have few applications in the literary domain. The present study seeks to challenge that assumption and find out what tools and resources literary translators actually employ in practice; how they interact with source and target texts, manage terminology, and conduct linguistic research; and what their needs may be for training in this area. Members of the Literary Translators' Association of Canada were invited to complete an anonymous self-administered online questionnaire on their use of technology and digital resources. Results indicate that literary translators make extensive use of standard tools and electronic resources but little use of more specialized technology. However, it was also found that some respondents make 'creative' use of specialized technology and that literary translators have a broad range of needs, particularly for linguistic and cultural research, leading to a recommendation that future investigation in this area focus on the improvement of digital tools and resources to support literary translators in meeting their ad hoc needs.

TI Computer-Assisted Text Analysis for Comparative Politics
SO POLITICAL ANALYSIS
AB Recent advances in research tools for the systematic analysis of textual data are enabling exciting new research throughout the social sciences. For comparative politics, scholars who are often interested in non-English and possibly multilingual textual datasets, these advances may be difficult to access. This article discusses practical issues that arise in the processing, management, translation, and analysis of textual data with a particular focus on how procedures differ across languages. These procedures are combined in two applied examples of automated text analysis using the recently introduced Structural Topic Model. We also show how the model can be used to analyze data that have been translated into a single language via machine translation tools. All the methods we describe here are implemented in open-source software packages available from the authors.

AB Machine translation models have discrete vocabularies and commonly use subword segmentation techniques to achieve an 'open vocabulary.' This approach relies on consistent and correct underlying unicode sequences, and makes models susceptible to degradation from common types of noise and variation. Motivated by the robustness of human language processing, we propose the use of visual text representations, which dispense with a finite set of text embeddings in favor of continuous vocabularies created by processing visually rendered text with sliding windows. We show that models using visual text representations approach or match performance of traditional text models on small and larger datasets. More importantly, models with visual embeddings demonstrate significant robustness to varied types of noise, achieving e.g., 25.9 BLEU on a character permuted German-English task where subword models degrade to 1.9.

SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND BIOINFORMATICS
AB Biological data mining using kernel methods can be improved by a task-specific choice of the kernel function. Oligo kernels for genomic sequence analysis have proven to have a high discriminative power and to provide interpretable results. Oligo kernels that consider subsequences of different lengths can be combined and parameterized to increase their flexibility. For adapting these parameters efficiently, gradient-based optimization of the kernel-target alignment is proposed. The power of this new, general model selection procedure and the benefits of fitting kernels to problem classes are demonstrated by adapting oligo kernels for bacterial gene start detection.

AB Bilingual terminologies are important machine translation resources in the field of e-commerce, which are usually either manually translated or automatically extracted from parallel data. The human translation is costly and e-commerce parallel corpora is very scarce. However, the comparable data in different languages in the same commodity field is abundant. In this paper, we propose a novel framework of extracting e-commercial bilingual terminologies from comparable data. Benefiting from the cross-lingual pre-training in e-commerce, our framework can make full use of the deep semantic relationship between source-side terminology and target-side sentence to extract corresponding target terminology. Experimental results on various language pairs show that our approaches achieve significantly better performance than various strong baselines.

AB In a corruption of John Searle's famous AI thought experiment, the Chinese Room (Searle, 1980), we twist its original intent by enabling humans to translate text, e.g. from Uyghur to English, even if they don't have any prior knowledge of the source language. Our enabling tool, which we call the Chinese Room, is equipped with the same resources made available to a machine translation engine. We find that our superior language model and world knowledge allows us to create perfectly fluent and nearly adequate translations, with human expertise required only for the target language. The Chinese Room tool can be used to rapidly create small corpora of parallel data when bilingual translators are not readily available, in particular for low-resource languages.

AB We report on our experiments to train deep neural networks that automatically translate informalized LATEX-written Mizar texts into the formal Mizar language. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time when neural networks have been adopted in the formalization of mathematics. Using Luong et al.'s neural machine translation model (NMT), we tested our aligned informal-formal corpora against various hyperparameters and evaluated their results. Our experiments show that our best performing model configurations are able to generate correct Mizar statements on 65.73% of the inference data, with the union of all models covering 79.17%. These results indicate that formalization through artificial neural network is a promising approach for automated formalization of mathematics. We present several case studies to illustrate our results.

Given the same text in two different languages, the task is to decide which elements-paragraphs in case of paragraph alignment-in one text are translations of which elements of the other text. One of the applications is training training statistical machine translation algorithms. The task is not trivial unless detailed text understanding can be afforded. In our previous work we have presented a simple technique that relied on bilingual dictionaries but does not perform any syntactic analysis of the texts. In this paper we give a formal definition of the task and present an exact optimization algorithm for finding the best alignment.

AB Text simplification (TS) rephrases long sentences into simplified variants while preserving inherent semantics. Traditional sequence-to-sequence models heavily rely on the quantity and quality of parallel sentences, which limits their applicability in different languages and domains. This work investigates how to leverage large amounts of unpaired corpora in TS task. We adopt the back-translation architecture in unsupervised machine translation (NMT), including denoising autoencoders for language modeling and automatic generation of parallel data by iterative back-translation. However, it is non-trivial to generate appropriate complex-simple pair if we directly treat the set of simple and complex corpora as two different languages, since the two types of sentences are quite similar and it is hard for the model to capture the characteristics in different types of sentences. To tackle this problem, we propose asymmetric denoising methods for sentences with separate complexity. When modeling simple and complex sentences with autoencoders, we introduce different types of noise into the training process. Such a method can significantly improve the simplification performance. Our model can be trained in both unsupervised and semi-supervised manner. Automatic and human evaluations show that our unsupervised model outperforms the previous systems, and with limited supervision, our model can perform competitively with multiple state-of-the-art simplification systems.

AB Due to the increasing complexity of software systems, model-driven engineering has been introduced to shift the developer's focus from machine-centric program code to human-centric models of the software under development. In modeldriven approaches, program code in conventional programming languages (e. g., C++, Java) is commonly generated from models and then compiled or interpreted. Intermediate translation of models to program code raises two fundamental issues: 1) semantic inconsistency and information loss between an executable and its source model, and 2) suboptimality of executables, since compilers are unable to exploit model semantics. These issues are not tolerable in embedded real-time and safety-critical applications. To tame them, we propose direct compilation of models bypassing intermediate translations to conventional programming languages.

AB This paper describes monolingual, bilingual, and multilingual retrieval experiments using CLEF 2002 test collection. The paper presents a technique for incorporating blind relevance feedback into a document ranking formula based on logistic regression analysis. Both blind relevance feedback and decompounding in German or Dutch are shown to be effective in monolingual and bilingual retrieval. The amount of improvement of performance by decompounding varies from one set of topics to another. The simple raw-score merging strategy in multilingual retrieval can be effective if the individual ranked lists of documents, one for each document language, axe produced using the same retrieval system under similar conditions. The performance of English to French bilingual retrieval using a large parallel corpus as the translation resource is comparable to that using machine translation systems.

AB For CLEF 2002, Berkeley's Group One experimented with Russian, French and English as query languages, and investigated thesaurus-aided retrieval for the special CLEF collections GIRT and Amaryllis. Two techniques were used to locate source language topic terms within the controlled vocabulary and replace them with the document language thesaurus terms to form the query sent against the collection index. This form of controlled vocabulary-aided translation is called thesaurus matching. Results show that thesaurus-aided cross-language retrieval performs slightly worse than machine translation retrieval on average, but can yield decidedly better results for particular queries. In addition, Berkeley submitted runs to the monolingual and bilingual (French and German) CLEF main tasks. We found that bilingual retrieval sometimes outperforms monolingual retrieval and postulate reasons to explain this phenomenon.

AB Over the last 50years, the development of computer numerical controlled machines has seen a plethora of part programming languages being developed. The large majority of these languages are based on the ISO 6983 standard which is commonly known as G&M codes, but other languages from machine tool suppliers are also used for programming machine tools. These programming languages have provided major barriers for the interoperability of such information between computer numerical controlled machines and also from computer numerical controlled machines to computer-aided systems. Thus, the process knowledge in existing part programs cannot be recycled and reused easily, due to an inability to interpret these forms of data. In this article, a new meta-model of computer numerical controlled part programming languages has been proposed. The meta-model aims to abstract the characteristics of computer numerical controlled machine activities and interpret/represent process information within computer numerical controlled part programs written in different languages or dialects. Realising the translation between the meta-model and different part programming languages, it is possible to capture the shopfloor knowledge from computer numerical controlled machines without the need to develop individual interpreting interfaces for each programming language. The valuable process knowledge can thus be captured from the part programs and represented in a neutral presentation to facilitate the knowledge accumulation and management, which is vital for manufacturing companies to gain competitive advantages in the globalised market.

AB We discuss a restricted natural language understanding system and a proposed extension to it, which is a corpus of phrases. The Controlled English to Logic Translation (CELT) system allows users to make statements in a domain-independent, restricted English grammar that have a clear formal semantics and that are amenable to machine processing. CELT needs a large amount of linguistic and semantic knowledge. It is currently coupled with the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology, which has been mapped by hand to WordNet 1.6. We propose work on a new corpus of phrases (called PhraseBank) to be added to WordNet and linked to SUMO, which will catalog common English phrase forms, and their deep meaning in terms of the formal ontology. This addition should significantly expand the coverage and usefulness of CELT.

TI Role of 3 ' UTRs in the Translation of mRNAs Regulated by Oncogenic
   eIF4E-A Computational Inference
SO PLOS ONE
AB Eukaryotic cap-dependent mRNA translation is mediated by the initiation factor eIF4E, which binds mRNAs and stimulates efficient translation initiation. eIF4E is often overexpressed in human cancers. To elucidate the molecular signature of eIF4E target mRNAs, we analyzed sequence and structural properties of two independently derived polyribosome recruited mRNA datasets. These datasets originate from studies of mRNAs that are actively being translated in response to cells overexpressing eIF4E or cells with an activated oncogenic AKT: eIF4E signaling pathway, respectively. Comparison of eIF4E target mRNAs to mRNAs insensitive to eIF4E-regulation has revealed surprising features in mRNA secondary structure, length and microRNA-binding properties. Fold-changes (the relative change in recruitment of an mRNA to actively translating polyribosomal complexes in response to eIF4E overexpression or AKT upregulation) are positively correlated with mRNA G+C content and negatively correlated with total and 3'UTR length of the mRNAs. A machine learning approach for predicting the fold change was created. Interesting tendencies of secondary structure stability are found near the start codon and at the beginning of the 3'UTR region. Highly upregulated mRNAs show negative selection (site avoidance) for binding sites of several microRNAs. These results are consistent with the emerging model of regulation of mRNA translation through a dynamic balance between translation initiation at the 5'UTR and microRNA binding at the 3'UTR.

AB Nowadays, language barrier is getting lower, especially for the students. Most of them know at least one foreign language. Even that, translation through the cloud is getting popular. There are many machine translation services can be access easily via Internet. These services work accurately and support many languages. They are even embedded by default in web browser of users and in mobile devices. This is easiest way for a student to translate a sentence from any language, and of course easy for cross-language plagiarism too. It makes plagiarism is getting difficult to detect. In this paper, we exploited cloud services and cloud computing model for detecting cross-language plagiarism. We downloaded a translation of the article from a website of Vietnam and Vietnamese local news provider then used as a test dataset. These articles were first translated into the English using translation services on the Web. Again, each translated sentences were sent to the web search engine to find related articles. Then, we compared this sentence with each sentence in the related articles to find out its score of plagiarism. Finally, we computed the score of plagiarism of this article. Experiment results show that the accuracy of detection is slightly higher than 0.5.

TI Boundary-Free Ribosome Compartmentalization by Gene Expression on a
   Surface
SO ACS SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY
AB The design of artificial cell models based on minimal surface-bound transcription-translation reactions aims to mimic the compartmentalization facilitated by organelles and inner interfaces in living cells. Dense DNA brushes as localized sources of RNA and proteins serve as synthetic operons that have recently proven useful for the autonomous synthesis and assembly ization in a minimal gene-expression reaction on a surface in of cellular machines. Here, we studied ribosome compartmental- A contact with a macroscopic reservoir. We first observed the accumulation and colocalization of RNA polymerases, ribosomes, nascent RNAs and proteins, in dense DNA brushes using evanescent field fluorescence, showing transcription-translation coupling in the brush. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching showed that ribosomes engaged in translation in the brush had a 4-fold slower diffusion constant. In addition, ribosomes in the brush had over a 10-fold higher local concentration relative to free ribosomes, creating a boundary-free functional ribosome-rich compartment. To decouple translation from transcription, we immobilized dense phases of ribosomes next to DNA brushes. We demonstrated that immobilized ribosomes were capable of protein synthesis, forming 2D subcompartments of active ribosome patterns induced and regulated by DNA brush layout of coding and inhibitory genes. Localizing additional molecular components on the surface will further compartmentalize gene-expression reactions.

TI Testing post-editing guidelines: how translation trainees interpret them
   and how to tailor them for translator training purposes
SO INTERPRETER AND TRANSLATOR TRAINER
AB There is a growing interest in machine translation (MT) and post-editing (PE). MT has been around for decades, but the use of the technology has grown significantly in the language industry in recent years, while PE is still a relatively new task. Consequently, there are currently no standard PE guidelines to use in translator training programmes. Recently, the first set of publicly available industry-focused PE guidelines (for 'good enough' and 'publishable' quality) were developed by Translation Automation User Society (TAUS) in partnership with the Centre for Global Intelligent Content (CNGL), which can be used as a basis on which to instruct post-editors in professional environments. This paper reports on a qualitative study that investigates how trainee translators on an MA course, which is aimed at preparing the trainees for the translation industry, interpret these PE guidelines for publishable quality. The findings suggest trainees have difficulties interpreting the guidelines, primarily due to trainee competency gaps, but also due to the wording of the guidelines. Based on our findings we propose training measures to address these competency gaps. Furthermore, we provide post-editing guidelines that we plan to use for our own post-editing training.

TI Unsupervised Word Translation with Adversarial Autoencoder
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Crosslingual word embeddings learned from monolingual embeddings have a crucial role in many downstream tasks, ranging from machine translation to transfer learning. Adversarial training has shown impressive success in learning crosslingual embeddings and the associated word translation task without any parallel data by mapping monolingual embeddings to a shared space. However, recent work has shown superior performance for non-adversarial methods in more challenging language pairs. In this article, we investigate adversarial autoencoder for unsupervised word translation and propose two novel extensions to it that yield more stable training and improved results. Our method includes regularization terms to enforce cycle consistency and input reconstruction, and puts the target encoders as an adversary against the corresponding discriminator. We use two types of refinement procedures sequentially after obtaining the trained encoders and mappings from the adversarial training, namely, refinement with Procrustes solution and refinement with symmetric re-weighting. Extensive experimentations with high- and low-resource languages from two different data sets show that our method achieves better performance than existing adversarial and non-adversarial approaches and is also competitive with the supervised system. Along with performing comprehensive ablation studies to understand the contribution of different components of our adversarial model, we also conduct a thorough analysis of the refinement procedures to understand their effects.

TI Design, development and field evaluation of a Spanish into sign language
   translation system
SO PATTERN ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS
AB This paper describes the design, development and field evaluation of a machine translation system from Spanish to Spanish Sign Language (LSE: Lengua de Signos Espaola). The developed system focuses on helping Deaf people when they want to renew their Driver's License. The system is made up of a speech recognizer (for decoding the spoken utterance into a word sequence), a natural language translator (for converting a word sequence into a sequence of signs belonging to the sign language), and a 3D avatar animation module (for playing back the signs). For the natural language translator, three technological approaches have been implemented and evaluated: an example-based strategy, a rule-based translation method and a statistical translator. For the final version, the implemented language translator combines all the alternatives into a hierarchical structure. This paper includes a detailed description of the field evaluation. This evaluation was carried out in the Local Traffic Office in Toledo involving real government employees and Deaf people. The evaluation includes objective measurements from the system and subjective information from questionnaires. The paper details the main problems found and a discussion on how to solve them (some of them specific for LSE).

AB The development of power plants using the renewable energy sources is very rapid. Renewable energy sources used solar energy, wind energy, ocean wave energy and other energy. All of these renewable energy sources require a processing device or a change of motion system to become electrical energy. One processing device is a generator which have work principle of converting motion (mechanical) energy into electrical energy with rotary shaft, blade and other motion components. Generator consists of several types of rotation motion and linear motion (translational). The generator have components such as rotor, stator and anchor. In the rotor and stator having magnet and winding coil as an electric generating part of the electric motion force. Working principle of AC generator with linear motion (translation) also apply the principle of Faraday that is using magnetic induction which change iron magnet to produce magnetic flux. Magnetic flux is captured by the stator to be converted into electrical energy. Linear motion generators consist of linear induction machine, wound synchronous machine field, and permanent magnet synchronous [1]. Performance of synchronous generator of translation motion is influenced by magnet type, magnetic shape, coil winding, magnetic and coil spacing and others. In this paper focus on the neodymium magnet with varying shapes, number of coil windings and gap of magnetic distances. This generator work by using pneumatic mechanism (PLTGL) for power plants system. Result testing of performance AC generator translation motion obtained that maximum voltage, current and power are 63 Volt for diameter winding coil 0.15 mm, number of winding coil 13000 and distance of magnet 20 mm. For effect shape of magnet, maximum voltage happen on rectangle magnet 30x20x5 mm with 4.64 Volt. Voltage and power on effect of diameter winding coil is 14.63 V and 17.82 W at the diameter winding coil 0.7 and number of winding coil is 1260 with the distance of magnet 25 mm.

TI Reflections on the Russian Translation of A.M. Turing's Paper "On
   Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem"
SO VOPROSY FILOSOFII
AB We draw the readers' attention to reflections on the first Russian translation of Alan Turing's paper "On computable numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem" which became a classic paper on computability theory and artificial intelligence philosophy a long time ago. We highlight a longstanding tradition to incorrectly translate three pairs of terms (calculate/compute, define/ determine, and scan/observe) which play an important role for Turing. We show that the target tradition is justified by two factors: the logical and proof- computational aspects of the paper are dominant over its linguistic one and an ongoing development of Turing's ideas has been making obsolete Turing's original exposition and hence its traditional translations into Russian. By proposing our variants of translating for some of the above mentioned terms or by making comments on the traditional ones, we try to preserve the original Turing pathos in a Russian translation rather than break the said tradition down. We propose an additional argument in favor of the permanent relevance of the paper by translating the informal description of the problem P vs NP which is said to be one of the central problems in modern science.

AB In this paper, we present an automatic query translation in Arabic for information retrieval. This system, implements a method for lexical disambiguation of terms in a query. To choose the best sense, each term of the query is projected on the French EuroWordNet and we extract his related concepts in order to form a semantic network. In a second time using the same type of network, but by integrating LSI (Latent Semantic Index), and extraction of contextual hidden links between the concepts of the list (listSRF). This list extracted by the automatic alignment by Mkalign tool's, from the knowledge base defined by the Monde Diplomatic parallel corpus. This tool will allow us to map between the relevant sentences in Arabic identified in our previous work with French sentences to build a listSRF. This list forms the basis of the lexical disambiguation method. Finally, we propose a mechanism for selecting the best sense of the ambiguous term of the query, based on the matching between each network corresponds to a word in the query with the network listSRF to extract an adequate sense with the highest degree of similarity. An evaluation and comparison are conducted to measure the quality of our translation system.

AB Word sense disambiguation has sense division and sense selection as its two sub-problems. An appropriate solution to the sense division problem is usually dependent on the application being pursued. In the context of machine translation, picking the correct translation for a word among multiple candidates, is known as target word selection.
   The work in this paper uses the Web as the main knowledge source to address the difficulty of making a target word selection based on statistics, which are normally drawn from rather limited corpora. The proposed approach uses simple and easily accessible web statistics-search engine hits (number of document returned for a particular query) to demonstrate the great potential of the Web as a knowledge source for word sense disambiguation. Our experimental results so far are very encouraging.

AB the increasing availability of texts generated in many aria and online information has necessitated intensive research in the area of automatic text coherence identification within the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community. Over the past two decades, the problem has been addressed from many different perspectives, in varying domains and using various paradigms such as text summarization, text simplification, text generation and machine translation. This survey intends to investigate some of the most relevant approaches both in the areas of semantic and syntactic text coherence recognition methods, giving special emphasis to empirical methods and syntactic techniques. Special attention is devoted to categorize and classify of proposed methods, as future research on coherence and cohesion of texts is strongly dependent on progress in this area.

We claim that "patterns", comprised of words and higher order categories, generalize better in capturing the syntax and semantics of the domain. In this work, we present an approach to extract such patterns from a domain corpus and curate a high quality bilingual lexicon. We discuss several features of these patterns, that, define the "consensus" between their underlying multiwords. We incorporate the bilingual lexicon in a baseline SMT model and detailed experiments show that the resulting translation model performs much better than the baseline and other similar systems.

TI LOOP IIId of the HCV IRES is essential for the structural rearrangement
   of the 40S-HCV IRES complex
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB As obligatory intracellular parasites, viruses rely on cellular machines to complete their life cycle, and most importantly they recruit the host ribosomes to translate their mRNA. The Hepatitis C viral mRNA initiates translation by directly binding the 40S ribosomal subunit in such a way that the initiation codon is correctly positioned in the P site of the ribosome. Such a property is likely to be central for many viruses, therefore the description of host-pathogen interaction at the molecular level is instrumental to provide new therapeutic targets. In this study, we monitored the 40S ribosomal subunit and the viral RNA structural rearrangement induced upon the formation of the binary complex. We further took advantage of an IRES viral mutant mRNA deficient for translation to identify the interactions necessary to promote translation. Using a combination of structure probing in solution and molecular modeling we establish a whole atom model which appears to be very similar to the one obtained recently by cryoEM. Our model brings new information on the complex, and most importantly reveals some structural rearrangement within the ribosome. This study suggests that the formation of a ` kissing complex' between the viral RNA and the 18S ribosomal RNA locks the 40S ribosomal subunit in a conformation proficient for translation.

AB Users seeking information may not find relevant information pertaining to their information need in a specific language. But information may be available in a language different from their own, but users may not know that language. Thus users may experience difficulty in accessing the information present in different languages. Since the retrieval process depends on the translation of the user query, there are many issues in getting the right translation of the user query. For a pair of languages chosen by a user, resources, like incomplete dictionary, inaccurate machine translation system may exist. These resources may be insufficient to map the query terms in one language to its equivalent terms in another language. Also for a given query, there might exist multiple correct translations. The underlying corpus evidence may suggest a clue to select a probable set of translations that could eventually perform a better information retrieval. In this paper, we present a cross language information retrieval approach to effectively retrieve information present in a language other than the language of the user query using the corpus driven query suggestion approach. The idea is to utilize the corpus based evidence of one language to improve the retrieval and re-ranking of news documents in the another language. We use FIRE corpora - Tamil and English news collections - in our experiments and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed cross language information retrieval approach.

AB Deaf people face serious difficulties to access information. The fact is that they communicate naturally through sign languages, whereas, to most of them, the spoken languages are considered only a second language. When designed, Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) rarely take into account the barriers that deaf people face. It is common that application developers do not hire sign languages interpreters to provide an accessible version of their app/site to deaf people. Currently, there are tools for automatic translation from sign languages to spoken languages, but, unfortunately, they are not available to third parties. To reduce these problems, it would be interesting if any automatic translation tool/service could be publicly available. This is the main goal of this work: use a preconceived machine translation from Portuguese Language to Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS) (named VLIBRAS) and provide Deaf Accessibility as a Service (DAaaS) publicly. The idea is to abstract inherent problems in the translation process between the Portuguese Language and LIBRAS by providing a service that performs the automatic translation of multimedia content to LIBRAS. VLIBRAS was primarily deployed as a centralized system, and this conventional architecture has some disadvantages when compared to distributed architectures. In this paper we propose two distributed architectures in order to provide a scalable service and achieve fault tolerance. For conception and availability of this service, it will be used the cloud computing paradigm to incorporate the following additional benefits: transparency, high availability, and efficient use of resources.

AB With increasing deployment of virtual machines for cloud services and server applications, memory address translation overheads in virtualized environments have received great attention. In the radix-4 type of page tables used in x86 architectures, a TLB-miss necessitates up to 24 memory references for one guest to host translation. While dedicated page walk caches and such recent enhancements eliminate many of these memory references, our measurements on the Intel Skylake processors indicate that many programs in virtualized mode of execution still spend hundreds of cycles for translations that do not hit in the TLBs.
   This paper presents an innovative scheme to reduce the cost of address translations by using a very large Translation Lookaside Buffer that is part of memory, the POM-TLB. In the POM-TLB, only one access is required instead of up to 24 accesses required in commonly used 2D walks with radix-4 type of page tables. Even if many of the 24 accesses may hit in the page walk caches, the aggregated cost of the many hits plus the overhead of occasional misses from page walk caches still exceeds the cost of one access to the POM-TLB. Since the POM-TLB is part of the memory space, TLB entries (as opposed to multiple page table entries) can be cached in large L2 and L3 data caches, yielding significant benefits. Through detailed evaluation running SPEC, PARSEC and graph workloads, we demonstrate that the proposed POM-TLB improves performance by approximately 10% on average. The improvement is more than 16% for 5 of the benchmarks. It is further seen that a POM-TLB of 16MB size can eliminate nearly all TLB misses in 8-core systems.

AB Recent progress in communications technology has been very rapid. High-speed mobile Internet access and mobile devices have enabled the development of robust technologies such as machine translation, automated speech recognition, voice synthesis, and even speech-to-speech translation. Communication applications that support sign language recognition are also being introduced and upgraded. Nonetheless, people with speech, hearing, or mental impairment still require special communication assistance, especially for medical purposes; this makes their health and life dependent on other people. Automatic solutions for speech recognition or voice synthesis from the text are poor fits for communication in the medical domain because they are dependent on error-prone statistical models. Additionally, in emergency cases, rapid information exchange is essential. Systems dependent on manual text input are insufficient. Recently introduced systems for automatic sign language recognition are dependent on statistical models and image and gesture quality. Such systems remain in early development and are based mostly on minimal hand gestures unsuitable for medical purposes. Furthermore, Internet-dependent solutions cannot be used in most countries requiring humanitarian aid. We propose a high-speed, intuitive, Internet-free, voice-free, and text-free tool suited for emergency medical communication. Our solution is a pictogram-based communication application that provides easy communication means for individuals who are speech- or hearing-impaired, have mental health issues impairing communication, or non-natives who do not speak the local language. It provides support and clarification in communication with such people using intuitive icons and interactive symbols easy to find on a mobile device. Such pictogram-based communication can be quite effective and, ultimately, make some people's lives happier, easier, and safer. We have developed a conceptual prototype of a patient-physician communicator on a smartwatch that can be used for local as well as remote communication. (C) 2017 The Authors.

TI Specificities of the plant mitochondrial translation apparatus
SO MITOCHONDRION
AB Mitochondria are endosymbiotic organelles responsible for energy production in most eukaryotic cells. They host a genome and a fully functional gene expression machinery. In plants this machinery involves hundreds of pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins. Translation, the final step of mitochondrial gene expression is performed by mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes). The nature of these molecular machines remained elusive for a very long time. Because of their bacterial origin, it was expected that mitoribosomes would closely resemble bacterial ribosomes. However, recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy have revealed the extraordinary diversity of mitoribosome structure and composition. The plant mitoribosome was characterized for Arabidopsis. In plants, in contrast to other species such as mammals and kinetoplastids where rRNA has been largely reduced, the mitoribosome could be described as a protein/RNA-augmented bacterial ribosome. It has an oversized small subunit formed by expanded ribosomal RNAs and additional protein components when compared to bacterial ribosomes. The same holds true for the large subunit. The small subunit is characterized by a new elongated domain on the head. Among its additional proteins, several PPR proteins are core mitoribosome proteins. They mainly act at the structural level to stabilize and maintain the plant-specific ribosomal RNA expansions but could also be involved in translation initiation. Recent advances in plant mitoribosome composition and structure, its specialization for membrane protein synthesis, translation initiation, the regulation and dynamics of mitochondrial translation are reviewed here and put in perspective with the diversity of mitochondrial translation processes in the green lineage and in the wider context of eukaryote evolution.

AB Diet planning is a basic and regular human activity. Previous studies have considered diet planning a combinatorial optimization problem to generate solutions that satisfy a diet's nutritional requirements. However, this approach does not consider the composition of diets, which is critical for diet recipients' to accept and enjoy menus with high nutritional quality. Without this consideration, feasible solutions for diet planning could not be provided in practice. This suggests the necessity of diet planning with machine learning, which extracts implicit composition patterns from real diet data and applies these patterns when generating diets. This work is original research that defines diet planning as a machine learning problem; we describe diets as sequence data and solve a controllable sequence generation problem. Specifically, we develop the Teacher-forced REINFORCE algorithm to connect neural machine translation and reinforcement learning for composition compliance with nutrition enhancement in diet generation. Through a real-world application to diet planning for children, we validated the superiority of our work over the traditional combinatorial optimization and modern machine learning approaches, as well as human (i.e., professional dietitians) performance. In addition, we construct and open the databases of menus and diets to motivate and promote further research and development of diet planning with machine learning. We believe this work with data science will contribute to solving economic and social problems associated with diet planning.

TI A Coaxial Alignment Method for Large Flange Parts Assembly Using
   Multiple Local Images
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The large flange parts in aero-engines are usually manually assembled. Collision damage caused by assembly alignment error often occurs in the assembly process, which affects the assembly accuracy and product reliability. The machine vision-based alignment methods usually achieve the high-precision measurement of the parts by obtaining the high-resolution images of the whole parts with a combination of laser distance sensors. Hence, existing methods are high costly and inefficient. In this paper, a new alignment method based on the principle of coaxial alignment for large flange parts is proposed. The proposed method first obtains multiple high-precision image pairs from the local field of views at the fitting surfaces of flanges. The clearance and bolt holes in each image pair are then extracted via edge recognition and Hough Transformation. Two optimization models are built to calculate the translation adjustment and rotation adjustment. The optimization model 1 is built with the translation adjustments of the flange as the variables and the consistency of the clearances as the objective function. The algorithm to solve the model based on the gradient-descent method is proposed. The positions of the bolt holes in the images are subsequently adjusted based on the translation adjustment, and the rotation adjustment is calculated by solving the built optimization model 2. The experiments show that the proposed method can be applied to the assembly process of large flange parts, and the visual servo control model based on this method also has good stability.

Combining, the Zernike moments along with the 3D point clouds and the depth images, we succeed in tackling problems arising in facial expression recognition due to affine transformations of the data, such as translation, rotation and scaling which, in other approaches are considered very harmful in the overall accuracy of a facial expression recognition algorithm. Support vector machines are used in order to classify the previously extracted features. Results are drawn in two publicly available databases for 3D facial expression recognition.

The translation and rotation of the machine are taken into account to recalculate the swath's relative position every time step. With the help of a model of the harvester (derived in this paper), the desired wheel position is calculated in function of the desired bearing change. The desired wheel position is then transmitted over the CAN network of the harvester to the actuator. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Modulation of mammalian translation by a ribosome-associated tRNA half
SO RNA BIOLOGY
AB Originally considered futile degradation products, tRNA-derived RNA fragments (tdRs) have been shown over the recent past to be crucial players in orchestrating various cellular functions. Unlike other small non-coding RNA (ncRNA) classes, tdRs possess a multifaceted functional repertoire ranging from regulating transcription, apoptosis, RNA interference, ribosome biogenesis to controlling translation efficiency. A subset of the latter tdRs has been shown to directly target the ribosome, the central molecular machine of protein biosynthesis. Here we describe the function of the mammalian tRNA(Pro) 5MODIFIER LETTER PRIME half, a 35 residue long ncRNA associated with ribosomes and polysomes in several mammalian cell lines. Addition of tRNA(Pro) halves to mammalian in vitro translation systems results in global translation inhibition and concomitantly causes the upregulation of a specific low molecular weight translational product. This tRNA(Pro) 5MODIFIER LETTER PRIME half-dependent translation product consists of both RNA and amino acids. Transfection of the tRNA(Pro) half into HeLa cells leads to the formation of the same product in vivo. The migration of this product in acidic gels, the insensitivity to copper sulphate treatment, the resistance to 3MODIFIER LETTER PRIME polyadenylation, and the association with 80S monosomes indicate that the accumulated product is peptidyl-tRNA. Our data thus suggest that binding of the tRNA(Pro) 5MODIFIER LETTER PRIME half to the ribosome leads to ribosome stalling and to the formation of peptidyl-tRNA. Our findings revealed a so far unknown functional role of a tdR thus further enlarging the functional heterogeneity of this emerging class of ribo-regulators.

AB The lingual barrier limits the ability of millions of non-English speaking developers to make effective use of the tremendous knowledge in Stack Overflow, which is archived in English. For cross-lingual question retrieval, one may use translation-based methods that first translate the non-English queries into English and then perform monolingual question retrieval in English. However, translation-based methods suffer from semantic deviation due to inappropriate translation, especially for domain-specific terms, and lexical gap between queries and questions that share few words in common. To overcome the above issues, we propose a novel cross-lingual question retrieval based on word embeddings and convolutional neural network (CNN) which are the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to capture word-and sentence-level semantics. The CNN model is trained with large amounts of examples from Stack Overflow duplicate questions and their corresponding translation by machine, which guides the CNN to learn to capture informative word and sentence features to recognize and quantify semantic similarity in the presence of semantic deviations and lexical gaps. A uniqueness of our approach is that the trained CNN can map documents in two languages (e.g., Chinese queries and English questions) in a dual-language vector space, and thus reduce the cross-lingual question retrieval problem to a simple k-nearest neighbors search problem in the dual-language vector space, where no query or question translation is required. Our evaluation shows that our approach significantly outperforms the translation-based method, and can be extended to dual-language documents retrieval from different sources.

TI Modulation of efficiency of translation termination in Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae Turning nonsense into sense
SO PRION
AB Nonsense suppression is a readthrough of premature termination codons. It typically occurs either due to the recognition of stop codons by tRNAs with mutant anticodons, or due to a decrease in the fidelity of translation termination. In the latter case, suppressors usually promote the readthrough of different types of nonsense codons and are thus called omnipotent nonsense suppressors. Omnipotent nonsense suppressors were identified in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in 1960s, and most of subsequent studies were performed in this model organism. Initially, omnipotent suppressors were localized by genetic analysis to different protein-and RNA-encoding genes, mostly the components of translational machinery. Later, nonsense suppression was found to be caused not only by genomic mutations, but also by epigenetic elements, prions. Prions are self-perpetuating protein conformations usually manifested by infectious protein aggregates. Modulation of translational accuracy by prions reflects changes in the activity of their structural proteins involved in different aspects of protein synthesis. Overall, nonsense suppression can be seen as a "phenotypic mirror" of events affecting the accuracy of the translational machine. However, the range of proteins participating in the modulation of translation termination fidelity is not fully elucidated. Recently, the list has been expanded significantly by findings that revealed a number of weak genetic and epigenetic nonsense suppressors, the effect of which can be detected only in specific genetic backgrounds. This review summarizes the data on the nonsense suppressors decreasing the fidelity of translation termination in S. cerevisiae, and discusses the functional significance of the modulation of translational accuracy.

TI Robust cross-lingual knowledge base question answering via knowledge
   distillation
SO DATA TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS
AB Purpose Previous knowledge base question answering (KBQA) models only consider the monolingual scenario and cannot be directly extended to the cross-lingual scenario, in which the language of questions and that of knowledge base (KB) are different. Although a machine translation (MT) model can bridge the gap through translating questions to the language of KB, the noises of translated questions could accumulate and further sharply impair the final performance. Therefore, the authors propose a method to improve the robustness of KBQA models in the cross-lingual scenario. Design/methodology/approach The authors propose a knowledge distillation-based robustness enhancement (KDRE) method. Specifically, first a monolingual model (teacher) is trained by ground truth (GT) data. Then to imitate the practical noises, a noise-generating model is designed to inject two types of noise into questions: general noise and translation-aware noise. Finally, the noisy questions are input into the student model. Meanwhile, the student model is jointly trained by GT data and distilled data, which are derived from the teacher when feeding GT questions. Findings The experimental results demonstrate that KDRE can improve the performance of models in the cross-lingual scenario. The performance of each module in KBQA model is improved by KDRE. The knowledge distillation (KD) and noise-generating model in the method can complementarily boost the robustness of models. Originality/value The authors first extend KBQA models from monolingual to cross-lingual scenario. Also, the authors first implement KD for KBQA to develop robust cross-lingual models.

TI Fast in vitro translation system immobilized on a surface via specific
   biotinylation of the ribosome
SO BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The ribosome is the macromolecular machine responsible for translating the genetic code into polypeptide chains. Despite impressive structural and kinetic studies of the translation process, a number of challenges remain with respect to understanding the dynamic properties of the translation apparatus. Single-molecule techniques hold the potential of characterizing the structural and mechanical properties of macromolecules during their functional cycles in real time. These techniques often necessitate the specific coupling of biologically active molecules to a surface. Here, we describe a procedure for such coupling of functionally active ribosomes that permits single-molecule studies of protein synthesis. Oxidation with NalO(4) at the 3' end of 23S rRNA and subsequent reaction with a biotin hydrazide produces biotinylated 70S ribosomes, which can be immobilized on a streptavidin-coated surface. The surface-attached ribosomes are fully active in poly(U) translation in vitro, synthesizing poly(Phe) at a rate of 3-6 peptide bonds/s per active ribosome at 37 degrees C. Specificity of binding of biotinylated ribosomes to a streptavidin-coated quartz surface was confirmed by observation of individual fluorescently labeled, biotinylated 70S ribosomes, using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Functional interactions of the immobilized ribosomes with various components of the protein synthesis apparatus are shown by use of surface plasmon resonance.

CL VANCOUVER, CANADA
SP ACM
AB This paper describes split-stream dictionary (SSD) compression, a new technique for transforming programs into a compact, interpretable form. We define a compressed program as interpretable when it can be decompressed at basic-block granularity with reasonable efficiency. The granularity requirement enables interpreters or just-in-time (JIT) translators to decompress basic blocks incrementally during program execution. Our previous approach to interpretable compression, the Byte-coded RISC (BRISC) program format [1] achieved unprecedented decompression speed in excess of 5 megabytes per second on a 450MHz Pentium II while compressing benchmark programs to an average of three-fifths the size of their optimized x86 representation. SSD compression combines the kev idea behind BRISC with new observations about instruction re-use frequencies to yield four advantages over BRISC and other competing techniques. First, SSD is simple, requiring only a few pages of code for an effective implementation Second, SSD compresses programs more effectively than any interpretable program compression scheme known to us. For example, SSD compressed a set of programs including the spec95 benchmarks and Microsoft Word97 to less than half the size, on average, of their optimized x86 representation Third, SSD exceeds BRISC's decompression and JIT translation rates by over 50%. Finally, SSD's two-phased approach to JIT translation enables a virtual machine to provide graceful degradation of program execution time in the face of increasing RAM constraints For example, using SSD, we ran Word97 using a JIT-translation buffer one-third the size of Word97's optimized x86 code, yet incurred only 27% execution time overhead.

AB This paper presents a new four-degree-of-freedom parallel mechanism dedicated to the handling of heavy parts within a large workspace. These four degrees of freedom are three translations and one rotation about a given axis. Such a mechanism is rare; most common parallel mechanisms have three or six degrees of freedom. Firstly, a description of the mechanism is given. Then models are derived regarding velocity and force transformation as input-output relationships. Finally, internal forces models and a stiffness model are evaluated. All models are embedded in a software module aimed at helping with the preliminary design of machines based on this new architecture.

TI Radial styloidectomy: A biomechanical study on stability of the wrist
   joint
SO JOURNAL OF HAND SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME
AB We investigated the influence of radial styloidectomy on carpal alignment and examined translation of the wrist after sequentially increased styloidectomy of 8 cadaver wrists. The radial aspect of the scaphoid fossa of the distal radius was cut obliquely at 3, 6, and 10 mm from the radial styloid guided by real-time fluoroscopy. Radiographic analysis of the changes of carpal alignment was performed with the wrist in neutral position. Force-displacement curves from the neutral to the radioulnar and palmar-dorsal directions were obtained using a multi-axis testing machine. Results demonstrated no significant malalignment of the carpal bones after radial styloidectomy. Significantly increased radial translation (>40% reduction in stiffness), however, was observed due to the loss of radial articular contact after 6- and 10-mm radial styloidectomies. Significant ulnar and palmar carpal displacement also was noted after 6- and IO-mm radial styloidectomies, with 6 specimens demonstrating moderate ulnar and palmar translation and 2 demonstrating notable increased palmar and ulnar translations. We conclude that there is a definite risk of increased carpal instability with radial styloidectomy procedures. A styloidectomy of no more than 3 to 4 mm is recommended. (J Hand Surg 2001; 26A:85-93.

AB In this talk I will give an introduction into the field of machine learning and discuss why it is a crucial technology for Amazon.
   Machine learning is the science of automatically extracting patterns from data in order to make automated predictions of future data. One way to differentiate machine learning tasks is by the following two factors: (1) How much noise is contained in the data? and (2) How far into the future is the prediction task? The former presents a limit to the learnability of task regardless which learning algorithm is used whereas the latter has a crucial implication on the representation of the predictions: while most tasks in search and advertising typically only forecast minutes into the future, tasks in e-commerce can require predictions up to a year into the future. The further the forecast horizon, the more important it is to take account of uncertainty in both the learning algorithm and the representation of the predictions. I will discuss which learning frameworks are best suited for the various scenarios, that is, short-term predictions with little noise vs. long-term predictions with lots of noise, and present some ideas to combine representation learning with probabilistic methods.
   In the second half of the talk, I will give an overview of the applications of machine learning at Amazon ranging from demand forecasting, machine translation to automation of computer vision tasks and robotics. I will also discuss the importance of tools for data scientist and share learnings on bringing machine learning algorithms into products.

We compare the efficiency of three learning algorithms: Deep Neuronal Networks (DNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to detect the boundaries of sentences written in different types of dialect. The best model achieved an F-measure of 84.37% using CRF which is a popular formalism for structured prediction in NLP and it has been widely applied in text segmentation.

Many verbal languages will have many ambiguous words. The meaning of these ambiguous words differ per context. To choose the correct meaning of the word in the given context is known as WSD. In this article, the proposed work is to develop a WSD system using machine learning technique and knowledge-based approach for Telugu language. The knowledge resource used to develop the WSD system is Lexical Knowledge Base (LKB). The efficiency of WSD system is good when compared with other unsupervised approaches.

In these settings, cross-entropy is used as a loss function for neural network training. In this short note, we propose an extension of the concept of cross-entropy, referred to as multidimensional cross-entropy, and its application as a loss function for classification using neural networks. The presented computational experiments on a benchmark dataset suggest that the proposed approaches may have a potential for increasing the classification accuracy of neural network based algorithms.

As a consequence of their digital and sociotechnical nature, they increasingly exhibit autonomous and intelligent characteristics. This development puts prevailing assumptions about information systems at stake. In this paper, we specifically engage with a radical reframing of past conceptualizations of machine intelligence or agency. Based on our theorizing, we advance and substantiate a novel algorithmic agency perspective that centers around three key characteristics: algorithmic interpretation, data generativity, and input translation. These characteristics pave the way for a new wave of research in information systems. Our proposed research opportunities for data analytics of digital traces address conditions for, features of and approaches to algorithmic agency.

This is an important task for natural language understanding and a necessary component of machine translation systems, chat bots and assistants. Neural machine learning systems perform far from ideally in this task, reaching as low as 73% F1 scores on modern benchmark datasets. Moreover, they tend to perform better for masculine pronouns than for feminine ones. Thus, the problem is both challenging and important for NLP researchers and practitioners. In this project, we describe our BERT-based approach to solving the problem of gender-balanced pronoun resolution. We are able to reach 92% F1 score and a much lower gender bias on the benchmark dataset shared by Google AI Language team.

TI Light-weight kernel instrumentation framework using dynamic binary
   translation
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
AB Mobile platforms such as Android and iOS, which are based on typical operating systems, have been widely adopted in various computing devices from smart phones even to smart TVs. Along with this, the necessity of kernel instrumentation framework has also grown up for efficient development and debugging of a kernel itself and its components. Although the existing approaches are providing some information about the kernel state including physical register value and primitive memory map, it is hard for the developers to understand and exploit the information. Moreover, the excessive analysis overhead in the existing approach makes them impractical to be used in real systems. Meanwhile, there have been a few studies on analyzing the user-level applications using dynamic binary translation and they are now widely used. In this paper, by extending this idea of dynamic binary translation for user-level applications to the kernel, we propose a new dynamic kernel instrumentation framework. Our framework focuses on the modules such as device drivers, rather than the kernel itself, since the modules comprise a large portion of OS development. Because of the frequent execution of kernel modules, the dynamic kernel instrumentation framework should guarantee the quality of the translated target code. However, costly optimizations to achieve high execution performance are rather harmful to the overall performance. Therefore, in order to improve performance of both translations, we suggest light-weight translator based on pseudo-machine instruction representation and tabular-base translation instead of typical intermediate representation. We implement our framework on Linux system, and our experimental evaluations show that it could quite effectively instrument the target with nominal overhead.

AB Text classification in low-resource languages (e.g., Thai) is of great practical value for some information retrieval applications (e.g., sentiment-analysis-based restaurant recommendation). Due to lacking large-scale corpus for learning comprehensive text representation, bilingual text classification which borrows the linguistics knowledge from a rich-resource language becomes a promising solution. Despite the success of bilingual methods, they largely ignore another source of semantic information-the writing system. Noting that most low-resource languages are phonographic languages, we argue that a logographic language (e.g., Chinese) can provide helpful information for improving some phonographic languages' text classification, since a logographic character (i.e., logogram) could represent a sememe or a whole concept, not only a phoneme or a sound. In this paper, by using a phonographic labeled corpus and its machine-translated logographic corpus both, we devise a framework to explore the central theme of utilizing logograms as a "semantic detection assistant". Specifically, from a logographic labeled corpus, we first devise a statistical-significance-based module to pick out informative text pieces. To represent them and further reduce the effects of translation errors, our approach is equipped with Gaussian embedding whose covariances serve as reliable signals of translation errors. For a test document, all seeds' Gaussian representations are used to convolute the document and produce a logographic embedding, before being fused with its phonographic embedding for final prediction.

AB Named Entity Recognition ( NER) is an important task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), and its main goal is to extract the required entities from a given text and label the entity type. Not only is an important research topic, but its identification quality and efficiency also have an important impact on follow-up tasks (such as machine translation, intelligent question answering system, etc.). Current research methods are primarily based on Deep Learning (DL) models. In practical applications, such models often rely on a large number of labeled data, which will show a certain limitation in applications in specific domains. At the same time, due to the high uncertainty of human language and the openness involving problems, the DL model does not reach the point of complete replacement of humanity. Human-machine collaboration refers to that in the changing environment, human and machines perform tasks alternately, so that the task can achieve the best performance with a small amount of human participation. In this paper, we propose a Human-Machine Collaboration based Named Entity Recognition (HMCNER) model by utilizing the complex cognitive reasoning ability of human beings and combining with existingDL model. The extensive experimental results show that our model can efficiently complete the NER task based on the existing research results, and have practical application.

AB Neural end-to-end architectures for sequence-to-sequence learning represent the state of the art in machine translation (MT) and speech recognition (ASR). Their use is also promising for end-to-end spoken language translation (SLT), which combines the main challenges of ASR and MT. Exploiting existing neural architectures, however, requires task-specific adaptations. A network that has obtained state-of-the-art results in MT with reduced training time is Transformer. However, its direct application to speech input is hindered by two limitations of the self-attention network on which it is based: quadratic memory complexity and no explicit modeling of short-range dependencies between input features. High memory complexity poses constraints to the size of models trainable with a GPU, while the inadequate modeling of local dependencies harms final translation quality. This paper presents an adaptation of Transformer to end-to-end SLT that consists in: i) downsampling the input with convolutional neural networks to make the training process feasible on GPUs, ii) modeling the bidimensional nature of a spectrogram, and iii) adding a distance penalty to the attention, so to bias it towards local context. SLT experiments on 8 language directions show that, with our adaptation, Transformer outperforms a strong RNN-based baseline with a significant reduction in training time.

AB Multiword Expression (MWE) is an open challenging task in NLP because of its compositional behavior. In this paper, we have presented the classification of multiword expressions and also designed some MWE tags for annotation of Urdu corpora. If MWE annotation is proper then it can be accurately processed through parsing phase and can improve the accuracy of machine translator. For annotation of MWEs, initially extracted the compound type MWE on the basis of automatic approach and also extracted different type of MWEs using semiautomatic and manual approach. These extracted MWEs are pre-processed and after that got the correct multiword expressions. Using these MWEs, we have annotated the Urdu corpora of 50,000 sentences.

AB Understanding the dynamical and computational capabilities of neural models represents an issue of central importance. Here, we consider a model of first-order recurrent neural networks provided with the possibility to evolve over time and involved in a basic interactive and memory active computational paradigm. In this context, we prove that the so-called interactive evolving recurrent neural networks are computationally equivalent to interactive Turing machines with advice, hence capable of super-Turing potentialities. We further provide a precise characterisation of the w-translations realised by these networks. Therefore, the consideration of evolving capabilities in a first-order neural model provides the potentiality to break the Turing barrier.

TI Evaluation of machine learning algorithms performance for the prediction
   of early multiple sclerosis from resting-state FMRI connectivity data
SO BRAIN IMAGING AND BEHAVIOR
AB Machine Learning application on clinical data in order to support diagnosis and prognostic evaluation arouses growing interest in scientific community. However, choice of right algorithm to use was fundamental to perform reliable and robust classification. Our study aimed to explore if different kinds of Machine Learning technique could be effective to support early diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis and which of them presented best performance in distinguishing Multiple Sclerosis patients from control subjects. We selected following algorithms: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Naive-Bayes, K-nearest-neighbor and Artificial Neural Network. We applied the Independent Component Analysis to resting-state functional-MRI sequence to identify brain networks. We found 15 networks, from which we extracted the mean signals used into classification. We performed feature selection tasks in all algorithms to obtain the most important variables. We showed that best discriminant network between controls and early Multiple Sclerosis, was the sensori-motor I, according to early manifestation of motor/sensorial deficits in Multiple Sclerosis. Moreover, in classification performance, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine showed same 5-fold cross-validation accuracies (85.7%) using only this network, resulting to be best approaches. We believe that these findings could represent encouraging step toward the translation to clinical diagnosis and prognosis.

TI Optimizing data permutations in structured loads/stores translation and
   SIMD register mapping for a cross-ISA dynamic binary translator
SO JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE
AB More and more modern processors have been supporting non-contiguous SIMD data accesses. However, translating such instructions has been overlooked in the Dynamic Binary Translation (DBT) area. For example, in the popular QEMU dynamic binary translator, guest memory instructions with strides are emulated by a sequence of scalar instructions, leaving a significant room for performance improvement when the SIMD instructions are available on the host machines. Structured loads/stores, such as VLDn/VSTn in ARM NEON, are one type of strided SIMD data access instructions. They are widely used in signal processing, multimedia, mathematical, and 2D matrix transposition applications. Efficient translation of such structured loads/stores is a critical issue when migrating ARM executables to other ISAs. However, it is quite challenging since not only the translation of structured loads/stores is not trivial, but also the mapping of SIMD registers between guest and host is complicated. This paper presents the design of translating structured loads/stores in DBT, including target code generation, efficient SIMD register mapping, and optimizations for reducing data permutations. Our proposed register mapping mechanisms and optimizations are not limited to handle structured loads/stores, they can be extended to deal with normal SIMD instructions. This paper evaluates how different factors affect the translation performance and code size. These factors include guest SIMD register length, strides, and use cases for structured loads. On a set of OpenCV benchmarks, our QEMU-based system has achieved a maximum speedup of 5.03x, with an average improvement of 2.87x. On a set of BLAS benchmarks, our system has obtained a maximum speedup of 2.22x and an average improvement of 1.78x.

It provides a deterministic and non-intrusive debugging environment, allowing reproducible presentation of program time flow.
   The primary contribution of this paper is virtual machine translation, a technique necessary to debug applications in a simulated Unix system. We show how a virtual machine translator maps low-level data, provided by the simulator to data useful to a symbolic debugger The translator operates by parsing data structures in the target operating system and has been implemented for the GNU debugger and simulated Linux systems.

TI Automatic categorization for improving Spanish into Spanish Sign
   Language machine translation
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB This paper describes a preprocessing module for improving the performance of a Spanish into Spanish Sign Language (Lengua de Signos Espanola: LSE) translation system when dealing with sparse training data. This preprocessing module replaces Spanish words with associated tags. The list with Spanish words (vocabulary) and associated tags used by this module is computed automatically considering those signs that show the highest probability of being the translation of every Spanish word. This automatic tag extraction has been compared to a manual strategy achieving almost the same improvement. In this analysis. several alternatives for dealing with non-relevant words have been studied. Non-relevant words are Spanish words not assigned to any sign. The preprocessing module has been incorporated into two well-known statistical translation architectures: a phrase-based system and a Statistical Finite State Transducer (SFST). This system has been developed for a specific application domain: the renewal of Identity Documents and Driver's License. In order to evaluate the system a parallel corpus made up of 4080 Spanish sentences and their LSE translation has been used. The evaluation results revealed a significant performance improvement when including this preprocessing module. In the phrase-based system, the proposed module has given rise to an increase in BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) from 73.8% to 81.0% and an increase in the human evaluation score from 0.64 to 0.83. In the case of SFST. BLEU increased from 70.6% to 78.4% and the human evaluation score from 0.65 to 0.82. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Existing approaches, translating into the most probable resource-rich language such as English, suffer in the presence of translation and language gaps between different cultural area, which leads to the loss of causality. To overcome these challenges, our goal is thus to identify key techniques to construct a new causality network of cause-effect terms, targeted for the machine-translated English, but without any language-specific knowledge of resource-poor languages. In our evaluations with three languages, Korean, Chinese, and French, our proposed method consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving upto 69.0% reasoning accuracy, which is close to the state-of-the-art accuracy 70.2% achieved on English.

These phrases are often transliterated into another language with a different sound inventory and writing system. Named-entities found in free text are often not listed in bilingual dictionaries. Although it is possible to identify and translate named-entities on the fly without a list of proper names and transliterations, an extensive list of existing transliterations certainly will ensure high precision rate. We use a seed list of proper names and transliterations to train a Machine Transliteration Model. With the model it is possible to extract proper names and their transliterations in monolingual or parallel corpora with high precision and recall rates.

RNNs assisted speech recognition technology is providing services on subtitles for live streaming videos. In this survey, we will offer a historical perspective by walking through the early years of RNNs all the way to their modern forms, detailing their most popular architectural designs and, perhaps more importantly, demystify the mathematical aspect behind their memory behaviors.

TI Adversarial Stylometry: Circumventing Authorship Recognition to Preserve
   Privacy and Anonymity
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEM SECURITY
AB The use of stylometry, authorship recognition through purely linguistic means, has contributed to literary, historical, and criminal investigation breakthroughs. Existing stylometry research assumes that authors have not attempted to disguise their linguistic writing style. We challenge this basic assumption of existing stylometry methodologies and present a new area of research: adversarial stylometry. Adversaries have a devastating effect on the robustness of existing classification methods. Our work presents a framework for creating adversarial passages including obfuscation, where a subject attempts to hide her identity, and imitation, where a subject attempts to frame another subject by imitating his writing style, and translation where original passages are obfuscated with machine translation services. This research demonstrates that manual circumvention methods work very well while automated translation methods are not effective. The obfuscation method reduces the techniques' effectiveness to the level of random guessing and the imitation attempts succeed up to 67% of the time depending on the stylometry technique used. These results are more significant given the fact that experimental subjects were unfamiliar with stylometry, were not professional writers, and spent little time on the attacks. This article also contributes to the field by using human subjects to empirically validate the claim of high accuracy for four current techniques (without adversaries). We have also compiled and released two corpora of adversarial stylometry texts to promote research in this field with a total of 57 unique authors. We argue that this field is important to a multidisciplinary approach to privacy, security, and anonymity.

TI Towards Better Word Alignment in Transformer
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB While neural models based on the Transformer architecture achieve the State-of-the-Art translation performance, it is well known that the learned target-to-source attentions do not correlate well with word alignment. There is an increasing interest in inducing accurate word alignment in Transformer, due to its important role in practical applications such as dictionary-guided translation and interactive translation. In this article, we extend and improve the recent work on unsupervised learning of word alignment in Transformer on two dimensions: a) parameter initialization from a pre-trained cross-lingual language model to leverage large amounts of monolingual data for learning robust contextualized word representations, and b) regularization of the training objective to directly model characteristics of word alignments which results in favorable word alignments receiving more concentrated probabilities. Experiments on benchmark data sets of three language pairs show that the proposed methods can significantly reduce alignment error rate (AER) by at least 3.7 to 7.7 points on each language pair over two recent works on improving the Transformer's word alignment. Moreover, our methods can achieve better alignment results than GIZA++ on certain test sets.

TI Hybrid human-machine information systems: Challenges and opportunities
SO COMPUTER NETWORKS
AB Micro-task Crowdsourcing has been used for different purposes: creating training data for machine learning algorithms, relevance judgments for evaluation of information systems, sentiment analysis, language translation, etc. In this paper we focus on the use of crowdsourcing as core component of data-driven systems. The creation of hybrid human-machine systems is a highly promising direction as it allows leveraging both the scalability of machines over large amounts of data as well as keeping the quality of human intelligence in the loop to finally obtain both efficiency and effectiveness in data processing applications.
   Such a hybrid approach is a great opportunity to develop systems that are more powerful than purely machine-based ones. For example, it is possible to build systems that can understand sarcasm in text at scale. However, when designing such systems it is critical to take into account a number of dimensions related to human behavior as humans become a component of the overall process.
   In this paper, we overview existing hybrid human-machine systems presenting commonalities in the approaches taken by different research communities. We summarize the key challenges that one has to face in developing such systems as well the opportunities and the open research directions to make such approaches the best way to process data in the future.

TI A Mathematical Theory of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Feature
   Extraction
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have led to breakthrough results in numerous practical machine learning tasks, such as classification of images in the ImageNet data set, control-policy-learning to play Atari games or the board game Go, and image captioning. Many of these applications first perform feature extraction and then feed the results thereof into a classifier. The mathematical analysis of DCNNs for feature extraction was initiated by Mallat, 2012. Specifically, Mallat considered so-called scattering networks based on a wavelet transform followed by the modulus non-linearity in each network layer, and proved translation invariance (asymptotically in the wavelet scale parameter) and deformation stability of the corresponding feature extractor. This paper complements Mallat's results by developing a theory that encompasses general convolutional transforms, or in more technical parlance, general semi-discrete frames (including Weyl-Heisenberg filters, curvelets, shearlets, ridgelets, wavelets, and learned filters), general Lipschitz-continuous non-linearities (e.g., rectified linear units, shifted logistic sigmoids, hyperbolic tangents, and modulus functions), and general Lipschitz-continuous pooling operators emulating, e.g., sub-sampling and averaging. In addition, all of these elements can be different in different network layers. For the resulting feature extractor, we prove a translation invariance result of vertical nature in the sense of the features becoming progressively more translation-invariant with increasing network depth, and we establish deformation sensitivity bounds that apply to signal classes such as, e.g., band-limited functions, cartoon functions, and Lipschitz functions.

AB Machine learning systems are known to require large amounts of data to effectively generalize. When this data isn't available, synthetically generated data is often used in its place. With synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, the domain shift required to effectively transfer knowledge from simulated to measured imagery is non-trivial. We propose a pairing of convolutional networks (CNNs) with generative adversarial networks (GANs) to learn an effective mapping between the two domains. Classification networks are trained individually on measured and synthetic data, then a mapping between layers of the two CNNs is learned using a GAN. We compare this strategy to a traditional image-to-image translation GAN system.

TI Striving to translate shale physics across ten orders of magnitude: What
   have we learned?
SO EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB Shales will play an important role in the successful transition of energy from fossil-based resources to renewables in the coming decades. Aside from being a significant source of low-carbon intensity fuels, like natural gas, they also serve as geologic seals of subsurface formations that may be used to isolate nuclear waste, sequester CO2, or store intermittent energy (e.g., solar hydrogen). Despite their importance, shales pose significant engineering and environmental challenges due to their nanoporous structure and extreme heterogeneity that spans at least similar to 10 orders of magnitude in spatial scale. Two challenges inhibit a system-level understanding: (1) the physics of fluid flow and phase behavior in shales are poorly understood due to the dominant molecular interactions between minerals and fluids under confinement, and (2) the apparent lack of scale separation that prevents a reliable (closed) description of the physics at any single scale of observation. In this review, we focus on the latter issue and discuss scale translation, which in its broadest sense is transforming data or simulations from one spatiotemporal scale to another. While effective scale translation is not exclusive to shales, but all geologic porous media, the need for it is especially acute in shales given their high degree of heterogeneity. Classical theories like homogenization, while indispensable, fail when scales are not separated. Other methods, like numerical upscaling, scale-translate in only one direction: small to large, but not the reverse, called downscaling. However, the confluence of advances in three areas are bringing challenging problems such as shales within reach: increased computational power and scalable algorithms; high-resolution imaging and multi-modal data acquisition; and machine learning to process massive amounts of data. While these advances equip geoscientists with a wide array of experimental and computational tools, no individual tool can probe the entire gamut of heterogeneity in shales. Their effective use, therefore, requires an ability to bridge between various data types obtained at different scales. The aim of this review is to present a coherent account of computational and experimental methods that may be used to achieve just that, i.e., to perform scale translation. We provide a broader definition of scale translation, one that transcends classical homogenization and upscaling methods, but is consistent with them and accommodates notions like downscaling and data translation. After a brief introduction to homogenization, we review hybrid methods, numerical upscaling and its recent extensions, multiscale computing, highresolution imaging, and machine learning. We place particular emphasis on multiscale computing and propose an algorithmic framework to bridge between the pore (micro) and Darcy (macro) scales. Throughout the paper, we draw comparisons between the various methods and highlight their (often hidden) similarities, differences, benefits, and pitfalls. We finally conclude with two case studies on shales that exemplify some of the methods presented.

   MULTIPROCESSOR SYSTEMS
SO LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB This paper presents an object-oriented language interface as a basis for the programming of loosely-coupled multiprocessor systems and an algorithm for automatic translation into parallel programs. Starting with a sequential program written in a restricted subset of C++, the translator algorithm first generates a machine-independent communication graph and proceeds with the creation of the machine-specific parallel programs. The programmer uses object definitions and method invocations within a single sequential program instead of defining a set of parallel programs and programming explicitly with send/receive-primitives. The translator algorithm is demonstrated by the transformation of an example program into parallel programs for the Intel iPSC/2 hypercube and for transputer systems with HELIOS operating system.

TI An Approach for Chinese-Japanese Named Entity Equivalents Extraction
   Using Inductive Learning and Hanzi-Kanji Mapping Table
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB Named Entity Translation Equivalents extraction plays a critical role in machine translation (MT) and cross language information retrieval (CLIR). Traditional methods are often based on large-scale parallel or comparable corpora. However, the applicability of these studies is constrained, mainly because of the scarcity of parallel corpora of the required scale, especially for language pairs of Chinese and Japanese. In this paper, we propose a method considering the characteristics of Chinese and Japanese to automatically extract the Chinese-Japanese Named Entity (NE) translation equivalents based on inductive learning (IL) from monolingual corpora. The method adopts the Chinese Hanzi and Japanese Kanji Mapping Table (HKMT) to calculate the similarity of the NE instances between Japanese and Chinese. Then, we use IL to obtain partial translation rules for NEs by extracting the different parts from high similarity NE instances in Chinese and Japanese. In the end, the feedback processing updates the Chinese and Japanese NE entity similarity and rule sets. Experimental results show that our simple, efficient method, which overcomes the insufficiency of the traditional methods, which are severely dependent on bilingual resource. Compared with other methods, our method combines the language features of Chinese and Japanese with IL for automatically extracting NE pairs. Our use of a weak correlation bilingual text sets and minimal additional knowledge to extract NE pairs effectively reduces the cost of building the corpus and the need for additional knowledge. Our method may help to build a large-scale Chinese-Japanese NE translation dictionary using mono-lingual corpora.

TI Optimizing Indirect Branches in Dynamic Binary Translators
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ARCHITECTURE AND CODE OPTIMIZATION
AB Dynamic binary translation is a technology for transparently translating and modifying a program at the machine code level as it is running. A significant factor in the performance of a dynamic binary translator is its handling of indirect branches. Unlike direct branches, which have a known target at translation time, an indirect branch requires translating a source program counter address to a translated program counter address every time the branch is executed. This translation can impose a serious runtime penalty if it is not handled efficiently.
   MAMBO-X64, a dynamic binary translator that translates 32-bit ARM (AArch32) code to 64-bit ARM (AArch64) code, uses three novel techniques to improve the performance of indirect branch translation. Together, these techniques allow MAMBO-X64 to achieve a very low performance overhead of only 10% on average compared to native execution of 32-bit programs. Hardware-assisted function returns use a software return address stack to predict the targets of function returns, making use of several novel optimizations while also exploiting hardware return address prediction. This technique has a significant impact on most benchmarks, reducing binary translation overhead compared to native execution by 40% on average and by 90% on some benchmarks. Branch table inference, an algorithm for detecting and translating branch tables, can reduce the overhead of translated code by up to 40% on some SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks. The remaining indirect branches are handled using a fast atomic hash table, which is optimized to work with multiple threads. This last technique translates indirect branches using a single shared hash table while avoiding expensive synchronization in performance-critical lookup code. This allows the performance to be on par with thread-private hash tables while having superior memory scalability.

TI WearSign: Pushing the Limit of Sign Language Translation Using Inertial
   and EMGWearables
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON INTERACTIVE MOBILE WEARABLE AND UBIQUITOUS
   TECHNOLOGIES-IMWUT
AB Sign language translation (SLT) is considered as the core technology to break the communication barrier between the deaf and hearing people. However, most studies only focus on recognizing the sequence of sign gestures (sign language recognition (SLR)), ignoring the significant difference of linguistic structures between sign language and spoken language. In this paper, we approach SLT as a spatio-temporal machine translation task and propose a wearable-based system, WearSign, to enable direct translation from the sign-induced sensory signals into spoken texts. WearSign leverages a smartwatch and an armband of ElectroMyoGraphy (EMG) sensors to capture the sophisticated sign gestures. In the design of the translation network, considering the significant modality and linguistic gap between sensory signals and spoken language, we design a multi-task encoder-decoder framework which uses sign glosses (sign gesture labels) for intermediate supervision to guide the end-to-end training. In addition, due to the lack of sufficient training data, the performance of prior studies usually degrades drastically when it comes to sentences with complex structures or unseen in the training set. To tackle this, we borrow the idea of back-translation and leverage the much more available spoken language data to synthesize the paired sign language data. We include the synthetic pairs into the training process, which enables the network to learn better sequence-to-sequence mapping as well as generate more fluent spoken language sentences.
   We construct an American sign language (ASL) dataset consisting of 250 commonly used sentences gathered from 15 volunteers. WearSign achieves 4.7% and 8.6% word error rate (WER) in user-independent tests and unseen sentence tests respectively. We also implement a real-time version of WearSign which runs fully on the smartphone with a low latency and energy overhead.

TI From shallow to deep: some lessons learned from application of machine
   learning for recognition of functional genomic elements in human genome
SO HUMAN GENOMICS
AB Identification of genomic signals as indicators for functional genomic elements is one of the areas that received early and widespread application of machine learning methods. With time, the methods applied grew in variety and generally exhibited a tendency to improve their ability to identify some major genomic and transcriptomics signals. The evolution of machine learning in genomics followed a similar path to applications of machine learning in other fields. These were impacted in a major way by three dominant developments, namely an enormous increase in availability and quality of data, a significant increase in computational power available to machine learning applications, and finally, new machine learning paradigms, of which deep learning is the most well-known example. It is not easy in general to distinguish factors leading to improvements in results of applications of machine learning. This is even more so in the field of genomics, where the advent of next-generation sequencing and the increased ability to perform functional analysis of raw data have had a major effect on the applicability of machine learning in OMICS fields. In this paper, we survey the results from a subset of published work in application of machine learning in the recognition of genomic signals and regions in human genome and summarize some lessons learnt from this endeavor. There is no doubt that a significant progress has been made both in terms of accuracy and reliability of models. Questions remain however whether the progress has been sufficient and what these developments bring to the field of genomics in general and human genomics in particular. Improving usability, interpretability and accuracy of models remains an important open challenge for current and future research in application of machine learning and more generally of artificial intelligence methods in genomics.

TI An Empirical Comparison of Machine-Learning Methods on Bank Client
   Credit Assessments
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Machine learning and artificial intelligence have achieved a human-level performance in many application domains, including image classification, speech recognition and machine translation. However, in the financial domain expert-based credit risk models have still been dominating. Establishing meaningful benchmark and comparisons on machine-learning approaches and human expert-based models is a prerequisite in further introducing novel methods. Therefore, our main goal in this study is to establish a new benchmark using real consumer data and to provide machine-learning approaches that can serve as a baseline on this benchmark. We performed an extensive comparison between the machine-learning approaches and a human expert-based modelFICO credit scoring systemby using a Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) data. As the SCF data is non-synthetic and consists of a large number of real variables, we applied two variable-selection methods: the first method used hypothesis tests, correlation and random forest-based feature importance measures and the second method was only a random forest-based new approach (NAP), to select the best representative features for effective modelling and to compare them. We then built regression models based on various machine-learning algorithms ranging from logistic regression and support vector machines to an ensemble of gradient boosted trees and deep neural networks. Our results demonstrated that if lending institutions in the 2001s had used their own credit scoring model constructed by machine-learning methods explored in this study, their expected credit losses would have been lower, and they would be more sustainable.

AB We present SDS-200, a corpus of Swiss German dialectal speech with Standard German text translations, annotated with dialect, age, and gender information of the speakers. The dataset allows for training speech translation, dialect recognition, and speech synthesis systems, among others. The data was collected using a web recording tool that is open to the public. Each participant was given a text in Standard German and asked to translate it to their Swiss German dialect before recording it. To increase the corpus quality, recordings were validated by other participants. The data consists of 200 hours of speech by around 4000 different speakers and covers a large part of the Swiss German dialect landscape. We release SDS-200 alongside a baseline speech translation model, which achieves a word error rate (WER) of 30.3 and a BLEU score of 53.1 on the SDS-200 test set. Furthermore, we use SDS-200 to fine-tune a pre-trained XLS-R model, achieving 21.6 WER and 64.0 BLEU.

TI Diagnosis of Sensor Faults in Hypersonic Vehicles Using Wavelet Packet
   Translation Based Support Vector Regressive Classifier
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY
AB In this article, a fault diagnosis scheme based on the data-driven approach of hypersonic vehicles (HVs) is studied. First, the fault features are obtained by wavelet packet translation (WPT) processing. Second, an improved distance evaluation technique (DET) based on Spearman correlation analysis is used to select features and reduce dimensions. The designed enhanced WPT-DET (EWPT-DET) method can extract sensitive features based on self-defined attention coefficients. Third, the fault pattern recognition process is achieved by support vector regression (SVR) with genetic algorithm optimization. The SVR classifier with high dimensional linear fitting ability is very suitable for HVs' reaction control system with sensor faults. The method is further used in locating and diagnosing multisensor fusion faults. Moreover, the fault occurrence time of single sensor timing faults is judged. Finally, simulation studies are provided to illustrate the enhanced performance of the proposed approach.

TI Text corpora, professional translators and translator training
SO INTERPRETER AND TRANSLATOR TRAINER
AB Although machine translation software and CAT tools are commonly used both by professional translators and by those involved in the training of translators, the usefulness of electronic text corpora for these purposes is less widely known. Corpora of various types have become much easier to access during the last decade, and the main obstacle to their becoming a standard tool for translators is currently the inertia of both the industry and universities. Translator training in universities can play an important role in promoting new working methods. To study to what extent corpora are present in university translator training programmes, a survey was carried out. The responses show that corpora are indeed becoming part of curricula, at least in EU countries. However, the role of corpora in these programmes is often peripheral. For example, compiling Do-It-Yourself corpora - a very important skill for translators - is still taught in only a few university programmes. For the most part, corpora are used mainly as a research instrument rather than as a tool in practical translation work.

TI Engineered Ribosomes for Basic Science and Synthetic Biology
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF CHEMICAL AND BIOMOLECULAR ENGINEERING, VOL 9
SE Annual Review of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering
AB The ribosome is the cell's factory for protein synthesis. With protein synthesis rates of up to 20 amino acids per second and at an accuracy of 99.99%, the extraordinary catalytic capacity of the bacterial translation machinery has attracted extensive efforts to engineer, reconstruct, and repurpose it for biochemical studies and novel functions. Despite these efforts, the potential for harnessing the translation apparatus to manufacture bio-based products beyond natural limits remains underexploited, and fundamental constraints on the chemistry that the ribosome's RNA-based active site can carry out are unknown. This review aims to cover the past and present advances in ribosome design and engineering to understand the fundamental biology of the ribosome to facilitate the construction of synthetic manufacturing machines. The prospects for the development of engineered, or designer, ribosomes for novel polymer synthesis are reviewed, future challenges are considered, and promising advances in a variety of applications are discussed.

AB Virtualization has become much more important throughout the computer industry both to improve security and to support multiple workloads on the same hardware with effective isolation between those workloads. The most widely used chip architecture, the Intel and AMD x86 processors, have begun to support virtualization, but the initial implementations show some limitations. This paper examines the virtualization properties of the Alpha architecture with particular emphasis on features that improve performance and security. It shows how the Alpha's features of PALcode, address space numbers, software handling of translation buffer misses, lack of used and modified bits, and secure handling of unpredictable results all contribute to making virtualization of the Alpha particularly easy. The paper then compares the virtual architecture of the Alpha with Intel's and AMD's virtualization approaches for x86. It also comments briefly on Intel's virtualization technology for Itanium, IBM's zSeries and pSeries hypervisors and Sun's UltraSPARC virtualization. It particularly identifies some differences between translation buffers on x86 and translation buffers on VAX and Alpha that can have adverse performance consequences.

AB To address the need for researching the security of Chinese and Tibetan networks, the classification of public opinion of Chinese and Tibetan texts is proposed. First, web pages are collected. Second, preprocessing is conducted to extract the useful information from web pages. Third, a table of the Chinese and Tibetan public opinion key words is built. Finally, text similarity calculation is proposed to classify the text according to the table of public opinion words. A Chinese-Tibetan text-level alignment approach that is based on Chinese and Tibetan translation dictionary is proposed to match word frequency and position. Furthermore, sentence-level alignment algorithm is studied. The alignment performance is related to the Chinese and Tibetan translation dictionary. Text classification of public opinion and Chinese-Tibetan text alignment system is developed. After public opinion classification of Chinese text, the alignment software can discover the most similar Tibetan text and present it to the user. This research can effectively contribute to identifying Chinese and Tibetan public opinion text and is meaningful for information retrieval, text clustering, and Chinese and Tibetan machine translation.

AB Cross-lingual summarization (CLS) is the task to produce a summary in one particular language for a source document in a different language. Existing methods simply divide this task into two steps: summarization and translation, leading to the problem of error propagation. To handle that, we present an end-to-end CLS framework, which we refer to as Neural Cross-Lingual Summarization (NCLS), for the first time. Moreover, we propose to further improve NCLS by incorporating two related tasks, monolingual summarization and machine translation, into the training process of CLS under multi-task learning. Due to the lack of supervised CLS data, we propose a round-trip translation strategy to acquire two high-quality large-scale CLS datasets based on existing monolingual summarization datasets. Experimental results have shown that our NCLS achieves remarkable improvement over traditional pipeline methods on both English-to-Chinese and Chinese-toEnglish CLS human-corrected test sets. In addition, NCLS with multi-task learning can further significantly improve the quality of generated summaries. We make our dataset and code publicly available here: http://www. nlpr.ia.ac.cn/cip/dataset.htm.

AB The fifth Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC5) introduces a new cross-language dialog state tracking scenario, where the participants are asked to build their trackers based on the English training corpus, while evaluating them with the unlabeled Chinese corpus. Although the computer-generated translations for both English and Chinese corpus are provided in the dataset, these translations contain errors and careless use of them can easily hurt the performance of the built trackers. To address this problem, we propose a multichannel Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architecture, in which we treat English and Chinese language as different input channels of one single CNN model. In the evaluation of DSTC5, we found that such multichannel architecture can effectively improve the robustness against translation errors. Additionally, our method for DSTC5 is purely machine learning based and requires no prior knowledge about the target language. We consider this a desirable property for building a tracker in the cross-language context, as not every developer will be familiar with both languages.

AB Accurate translation initiation site (TIS) prediction is very important for genomic analysis. It is a common understanding that analyzing the large amount of genomic data by pure biological methods is impractical if not impossible. Therefore many approaches have been proposed which apply some machine learning technique to analyze a particular aspect of the data. We believe, however, that taking one single measure on the genomic data of intrinsically complicated nature will not yield a very comprehensive analysis. In this paper, we support this argument by showing how a particular biological measure is good for TIS prediction in certain sequences, but not others. We propose a novel approach which uses multiple agents, each of which investigates some distinct biological perspective. Since it is not always necessary to involve all the agents to analyze any given data set, we introduce a heuristic component to predict the most appropriate agent combination scheme for the data given. Experimental results on two benchmark data collections demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our proposed approach.

AB Nowadays official documents have to be made available in many languages, like for example in the EU with its 20 official languages. Therefore, the need for effective tools to aid the multitude of human translators in their work becomes easily apparent. An ASR system, enabling the human translator to speak his translation in an unrestricted manner, instead of typing it, constitutes such a tool. In this work we improve the recognition performance of such an ASR system on the target language of the human translator by taking advantage of an either written or spoken source language representation. To do so, machine translation techniques are used to translate between the different languages and then the involved ASR systems are biased towards the gained knowledge. We present an iterative approach for ASR improvement and outperform our baseline system by a relative word error rate reduction of 35.8% / 29.9% in the case of a written / spoken source language representation. Further, we show how multiple target languages, as for example provided by different simultaneous translators during European Parliament debates, can be incorporated into our system design for an improvement of all involved ASR systems.

SP ACM SIGPLAN
AB We present parametric higher-order abstract syntax (PHOAS), a new approach to formalizing the syntax of programming languages in computer proof assistants based on type theory. Like higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS), PHOAS uses the meta language's binding constructs to represent the object language's binding constructs. Unlike HOAS, PHOAS types are definable in general-purpose type theories that support traditional functional programming, like Coq's Calculus of Inductive Constructions. We walk through how Coq can be used to develop certified, executable program transformations over several statically-typed functional programming languages formalized with PHOAS; that is, each transformation has a machine-checked proof of type preservation and semantic preservation. Our examples include CPS translation and closure conversion for simply-typed lambda calculus, CPS translation for System F, and translation from a language with ML-style pattern matching to a simpler language with no variable-arity binding constructs. By avoiding the syntactic hassle associated with first-order representation techniques, we achieve a very high degree of proof automation.

AB Instruction scheduling hardware can be simplified and easily pipelined if pairs of dependent instructions are fused so they share a single instruction scheduling slot. We study an implementation of the x86 ISA that dynamically translates x86 code to an underlying ISA that supports instruction fusing. A microarchitecture that is co-designed with the fused instruction set completes the implementation.
   In this paper, we focus on the dynamic binary translator for such a co-designed x86 virtual machine. The dynamic binary translator first cracks x86 instructions belonging to hot superblocks into RISC-style micro-operations, anti then uses heuristics to fuse together pairs of dependent micro-operations. Experimental results with SPEC2000 integer benchmarks demonstrate that: (1) the fused ISA with dynamic binary translation reduces the number of scheduling decisions by about 30% versus a conventional implementation that uses hardware cracking into RISC micro-operations; (2) an instruction scheduling slot needs only hold two source register fields even though it may hold two instructions; (3) translations generated in the proposed ISA consume about 30% less storage than a corresponding fixed-length RISC-style ISA.

We chose to translate an Indonesian query set into English using a commercial machine translation tool called Transtool. We used an approach that combines the retrieval results of the query on text and on image. We used query expansion in our effort to improve the retrieval effectiveness. However, worse retrieval effectiveness was resulted.

TI tRNA tracking for direct measurements of protein synthesis kinetics in
   live cells
SO NATURE CHEMICAL BIOLOGY
AB Our ability to directly relate results from test-tube biochemical experiments to the kinetics in living cells is very limited. Here we present experimental and analytical tools to directly study the kinetics of fast biochemical reactions in live cells. Dye-labeled molecules are electroporated into bacterial cells and tracked using super-resolved single-molecule microscopy.Trajectories are analyzed by machine-learning algorithms to directly monitor transitions between bound and free states. In particular, we measure the dwell time of tRNAs on ribosomes, and hence achieve direct measurements of translation rates inside living cells at codon resolution. We find elongation rates with tRNA(Phe) that are in perfect agreement with previous indirect estimates, and once fMet-tRNA(fMet) has bound to the 30S ribosomal subunit, initiation of translation is surprisingly fast and does not limit the overall rate of protein synthesis. The experimental and analytical tools for direct kinetics measurements in live cells have applications far beyond bacterial protein synthesis.

AB Automatic dubbing (AD) addresses the problem of translating speech in a video with speech in another language while preserving the viewer experience. A most important requirement of AD is isochrony, i.e. dubbed speech has to closely match the timing of speech and pauses of the original audio. In our automatic dubbing system, isochrony is modeled by controlling the verbosity of machine translation; inserting pauses in the translations, a.k.a. prosodic alignment; and controlling the duration of text-to-speech (TTS) utterances. The latter two steps heavily rely on speech duration information, either to predict or control TTS duration. So far, duration prediction was based on a proxy method while duration control on linear warping of the TTS speech spectrogram. In this study, we propose novel duration models for neural TTS that can be lever-aged both to predict and control TTS duration. Experimental results show that compared to previous work, the new models improve or match the performance of prosodic alignment and significantly enhance neural TTS speech quality for both slow and fast speaking rates.

TI Nervous-Like Circuits in the Ribosome Facts, Hypotheses and Perspectives
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB In the past few decades, studies on translation have converged towards the metaphor of a ribosome nanomachine; they also revealed intriguing ribosome properties challenging this view. Many studies have shown that to perform an accurate protein synthesis in a fluctuating cellular environment, ribosomes sense, transfer information and even make decisions. This complex behaviour that goes far beyond the skills of a simple mechanical machine has suggested that the ribosomal protein networks could play a role equivalent to nervous circuits at a molecular scale to enable information transfer and processing during translation. We analyse here the significance of this analogy and establish a preliminary link between two fields: ribosome structure-function studies and the analysis of information processing systems. This cross-disciplinary analysis opens new perspectives about the mechanisms of information transfer and processing in ribosomes and may provide new conceptual frameworks for the understanding of the behaviours of unicellular organisms.

TI Sign Language Translation Systems: A Systematic Literature Review
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE SCIENCE AND COMPUTATIONAL
   INTELLIGENCE-IJSSCI
AB Sign language, often termed "dactylology," is a mode of communication for those who are hard of hearing. With over 2.5 billion people projected to have hearing loss by 2050, there are very few efficient real-time sign language translation (SLT) applications present today despite extensive research in the domain. The main purpose of the systematic literature review is to analyze existing research in SLT systems and obtain results that will help in building an efficient and improved SLT system. A total of 125 different research articles within the time frame of 2015-2022 were identified. The study analyzes each paper against nine main research questions. The results obtained show the unique strengths and weaknesses of the different methods used, and while the reviewed papers showed significant results, there is still room for improvement in the implementations. This systematic literature review helps in identifying suitable methods to develop an efficient SLT application, identifies research gaps in this domain, and simultaneously indicates recent trends in the field of SLT systems.

SO JOURNAL OF SPECIALISED TRANSLATION
AB This paper focuses on the impact of the organisational context on the translation activity of in-house translators working in small and medium-sized industrial enterprises. The aim is to answer the question of what the work content of in-house translators is when it is embedded in the whole industrial work process. The paper includes an introductory section that outlines the conceptual background of the sociology of work. The involvement of the translator as a central agent in the execution of the wider work process is analysed in a case study, based on data gathered in 2005 and 2006 using observational methods in a medium-sized Polish company producing ice cream machines. The results obtained are linked with those from other research projects carried out in Translation Studies. The paper concludes with the statement that the more complete the translator's view of the work process is, the better his understanding of his own activity is and therefore the greater his efficiency is.

AB EAST-ADL is an architectural description language dedicated to safety-critical automotive embedded system design. We have previously developed a translator, called A-BeTA, transforming timed behavioral constraints in EAST-ADL into the analyzable UPPAAL models. In this paper, we extend the previous work by including support for Stateflow, which is used to design event-driven systems via hierarchical state machines and flow charts. However, Stateflow provides limited support for formal analysis and often suffers from incomplete coverage issues since it was originally designed for the simulation of designs and as such does not provide a model amenable to formal verification. We tackle that shortcoming by transforming Stateflow models into verifiable UPPAAL models and integrating the translation with formal analysis techniques: a flattening strategy is proposed to facilitate the guarantee of translation. Furthermore, a set of mapping rules is presented to ensure the translation is correct, efficient, and applicable to real case studies. The analysis techniques, including the flattening and mapping strategy, are validated and demonstrated on two automotive case studies.

AB Networked. services, constituted by the structural and behavior arrangement of service components are considered. A service component is executed as a generic software component, denoted as an actor, which is able to download and execute different EFSM (Extended Finite State Machine) based functionality. The functionality of an actor is denoted as its role, while a role session is a projection of the role with respect to the interaction with one other actor. We propose an approach for verification of the services, based on interface verification techniques for the verification of the role sessions. The service component specifications used for actor execution are based on XML representations, while the verification of the role sessions is based on a behavior type language. This language has a sound theoretical basis, and is used to avoid "message-not-understood" errors. Rules are given for automatic translation from the XML manuscripts to this behavioral type language. This translation first makes projection to the role session, using hidden actions. Those hidden actions are then removed so a sound verification can take place.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) shape models have recently been used in various fields including machine designing, internet mall, and medical application. Therefore, efficient management and reuse of 3D shape models is becoming important with research on object searching of 3D shape models. 3D shape model searching requires taking into consideration rotation, scaling, and translation of models. This paper proposes a method to search 3D objects to include and account for the above conditions. The proposed method acquires 2D range images by rendering a 3D object from many viewpoints, and discretely approximating two of the three degrees of rotational freedom by a finite number of viewpoints. Using the phase correlation method on the range image one can estimate the rotation around one axis, include scaling and translation, and compare the similarities between the input with models in a dictionary. Experimental results show that whether models match or not match can be distinguished even when the supposed viewpoints are limited to a finite number.

   information retrieval
SO INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT
AB Interactive Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR), a process in which searcher and system collaborate to find documents that satisfy an information need regardless of the language in which those documents are written, calls for designs in which synergies between searcher and system can be leveraged so that the strengths of one can cover weaknesses of the other. This paper describes an approach that employs user-assisted query translation to help searchers better understand the system's operation. Supporting interaction and interface designs are introduced, and results from three user studies are presented. The results indicate that experienced searchers presented with this new system evolve new search strategies that make effective use of the new capabilities, that they achieve retrieval effectiveness comparable to results obtained using fully automatic techniques, and that reported satisfaction with support for cross-language searching increased. The paper concludes with a description of a freely available interactive CLIR system that incorporates lessons learned from this research. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The context encoding is undertaken by contextual parameters, trained on document-level data. In this work, we discuss the difficulty of training these parameters effectively, due to the sparsity of the words in need of context (i.e., the training signal), and their relevant context. We propose to pre-train the contextual parameters over split sentence pairs, which makes an efficient use of the available data for two reasons. Firstly, it increases the contextual training signal by breaking intra-sentential syntactic relations, and thus pushing the model to search the context for disambiguating clues more frequently. Secondly, it eases the retrieval of relevant context, since context segments become shorter. We propose four different splitting methods, and evaluate our approach with BLEU and contrastive test sets. Results show that it consistently improves learning of contextual parameters, both in low and high resource settings.

AB It is difficult for non-autoregressive translation (NAT) models to capture the multi-modal distribution of target translations due to their conditional independence assumption, which is known as the "multi-modality problem", including the lexical multi-modality and the syntactic multi-modality. While the first one has been well studied, the syntactic multi-modality brings severe challenge to the standard cross entropy (XE) loss in NAT and is under studied. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study on the syntactic multi-modality problem. Specifically, we decompose it into short- and longrange syntactic multi-modalities and evaluate several recent NAT algorithms with advanced loss functions on both carefully designed synthesized datasets and real datasets. We find that the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss and the Order-Agnostic Cross Entropy (OAXE) loss can better handle short- and long-range syntactic multi-modalities respectively. Furthermore, we take the best of both and design a new loss function to better handle the complicated syntactic multi-modality in real-world datasets. To facilitate practical usage, we provide a guide to use different loss functions for different kinds of syntactic multimodality.

AB Splitting compound words has proved to be useful in are-as such as Machine Translation, Speech Recognition or Information Retrieval (IR). In the case of IR systems, they usually have to cope with noisy data, as user queries are usually written quickly and submitted without review. This work attempts at improving the current approaches for German decompounding when applied to query keywords. The results show an increase of more than 10% in accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

AB In this paper, we present our research in the framework of the CATS project (Classified Ads through SMS). CATS is a system of management of small Arabic advertisements posted in SMS of buy and sale (cars, real estate...), currently deployed in Jordan by the FastLink operator. In order to evolve this system in width by adapting it to other languages (French, English) and in length by applying it to other sectors (employment, marriage, domestic machines, trade of mobile phone, pages yellow...), we are in the difficulty in finding or building SMS corpora functionally equivalent to a real, arab and natural corpus. A simple translation of this starting corpus gives it the same type of corpus (real, natural)? We present, in this paper, an answer to this question and a solution for a case of multilinguisation of sites of E-trade in SMS, initially in Arabic.

The usual parsing algorithms that have been previously defined cannot explore the complete search space. In this work, we propose important modifications that consider the whole search space. We formally prove the correctness of the new algorithm. Experimental work shows important improvements in the probabilistic estimation of the models when using the new algorithm.

AB A user written program goes through significant optimizing and parallelizing transformations, both (compiler) automated and human guided, before being mapped to an architecture. Formally verifying these transformations is crucial to ensure that they preserve the original behavioural specification. The PRES+ model (Petri net based Representation of Embedded Systems) encompassing data processing is used to model parallel behaviours more succinctly. Being value based with a natural capability of capturing parallelism, PRES+ models depict such data dependencies more vividly; accordingly, they are likely to be more convenient as the intermediate representations (IRs) of both source and transformed codes for translation validation than strictly sequential, variable-based IRs such as Finite State Machines with Data path (FSMDs) which are essentially sequential control and data flow graphs (CDFGs). This paper presents a scheme for verifying equivalence between two given PRES+ models for translation validation of optimizing and parallelizing code transformations; one of the two models represents the source code and the other represents its optimized and (or) parallelized version.

AB Concordancing, or the arranging of passages of a textual corpus in alphabetical order according to user-defined keywords, is one of the oldest and still most widely used forms of text analysis. It finds applications in areas such as lexicography, computational linguistics, translation studies and computer-assisted machine translation. Yet, the basic form of visualisation employed in the analysis of textual concordances has remained essentially the same since the keyword-in-context technique was introduced, over fifty years ago. This paper presents a generalisation of this technique as an analytical abstraction of concordances represented as undirected graphs, and then characterises keywords in terms of graph eccentricity properties. We illustrate this proposal with two distinct visual renderings: a mosaic (space-filling) display and a bi-directional hierarchical display. These displays can be used in isolation or in conjunction with traditional keyword-in-context components in an overview-plus-detail pattern, or as synchronised views. We discuss scenarios of use for these arrangements in lexicographical corpus analysis, in translation studies and in text comparison tasks.

The layers are specific to one language (as opposed to bilingual adapters) allowing to compose them and generalize to unseen language-pairs. In this zero-shot setting, they obtain a median improvement of +2.77 BLEU points over a strong 20-language multilingual Transformer baseline trained on TED talks.

AB The quality of automatic metrics for machine translation has been increasingly called into question, especially for high-quality systems. This paper demonstrates that, while choice of metric is important, the nature of the references is also critical. We study different methods to collect references and compare their value in automated evaluation by reporting correlation with human evaluation for a variety of systems and metrics. Motivated by the finding that typical references exhibit poor diversity, concentrating around translationese language, we develop a paraphrasing task for linguists to perform on existing reference translations, which counteracts this bias. Our method yields higher correlation with human judgment not only for the submissions of WMT 2019 English -> German, but also for Back-translation and APE augmented MT output, which have been shown to have low correlation with automatic metrics using standard references. We demonstrate that our methodology improves correlation with all modern evaluation metrics we look at, including embedding-based methods. To complete this picture, we reveal that multi-reference BLEU does not improve the correlation for high quality output, and present an alternative multi-reference formulation that is more effective.

AB Multi-modal learning relates information across observation modalities of the same physical phenomenon to leverage complementary information. Most multi-modal machine learning methods require that all the modalities used for training are also available for testing. This is a limitation when signals from some modalities are unavailable or severely degraded. To address this limitation, we aim to improve the testing performance of uni-modal systems using multiple modalities during training only. The proposed multi-modal training framework uses cross-modal translation and correlation-based latent space alignment to improve the representations of a worse performing (or weaker) modality. The translation from the weaker to the better performing (or stronger) modality generates a multi-modal intermediate encoding that is representative of both modalities. This encoding is then correlated with the stronger modality representation in a shared latent space. We validate the proposed framework on the AVEC 2016 dataset (RECOLA) for continuous emotion recognition and show the effectiveness of the framework that achieves state-of-the-art (uni-modal) performance for weaker modalities.

AB Today digital media such as social networks, chat rooms, and forums have gained much importance in human life for information sharing. Users will share their knowledge and emotions in their own languages. This will create a novel syntax to communicate their messages with as much as pithiness as possible. Noisy text is characterized by unusual forms such as abbreviations, phonetic translations, short forms etc. This led to the emergence of text normalization. Cleaning the noisy text has become an important factor for adequate development and deployment of NLP (Natural Language Processing) services such as text-to-speech and automatic translation. In this paper we introduce a channel based normalization model for cleaning the noisy texts. The normalization is based on the types of distortion such as grapheme distortion, abbreviation and phoneme distortion. The model will explore the type of distortion occurred in the noisy word and replace it by using the different channel list. Precursory evaluation shows that the channel model will normalize the noisy word to their standard peer with 96.43% accuracy.

AB We describe an unsupervised method to create pseudo-parallel corpora for machine translation (MT) from unaligned text. We use multilingual BERT to create source and target sentence embeddings for nearest-neighbor search and adapt the model via self-training. We validate our technique by extracting parallel sentence pairs on the BUCC 2017 bitext mining task and observe up to a 24.5 point increase (absolute) in F1 scores over previous unsupervised methods. We then improve an XLM-based unsupervised neural MT system pre-trained on Wikipedia by supplementing it with pseudo-parallel text mined from the same corpus, boosting unsupervised translation performance by up to 3.5 BLEU on the WMT' 14 French-English and WMT' 16 German-English tasks and outperforming the previous state-of-the-art. Finally, we enrich the IWSLT' 15 English-Vietnamese corpus with pseudo-parallel Wikipedia sentence pairs, yielding a 1.2 BLEU improvement on the low-resource MT task. We demonstrate that unsupervised bitext mining is an effective way of augmenting MT datasets and complements existing techniques like initializing with pre-trained contextual embeddings.

The method consists of two phases. First, a learning-based segmentation module is used to extract regions and sequences from the documents. Second, translation from region-marked documents to XML is done by a transformation-based learning (TBL) translator that is very effective even with a small set of training examples.

SO CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB The problem of 3D digital object invariability is encountered in image processing, especially in pattern classification/recognition. The 3D object should be correctly recognized regardless of its particular position and orientation in the scene. This paper proposes a new method to extract 3D Charlier moment invariants to translation and scaling (3DCMITS). These descriptors are extracted directly from discrete orthogonal Charlier polynomials without using 3D geometric moment invariants. This method is fast and does not require any numerical approximation compared to the indirect method based on 3D geometric moment invariants. The results show the proposed method's effectiveness in terms of speed with an improvement exceeding 99,97%. For validation purposes and as an illustration of the interest of 3DCMITS, this paper offers a classification system for 3D objects based on the proposed 3DCMITS and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The obtained results are verified with K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier and other existing works in the literature.

AB Multiple sensor modalities provide more accurate Human Activity Recognition (HAR) compared to using a single modality, yet the latter is preferred by consumers as it is more convenient and less intrusive. This presents a challenge to researchers, as a single modality is likely to pick up movement that is both relevant as well as extraneous to the human activity being tracked and lead to poorer performance. The goal of an optimal HAR solution is therefore to utilise the fewest sensors at deployment, while maintaining performance levels achievable using all available sensors. To this end, we introduce two translation approaches, capable of generating missing modalities from available modalities. These can be used to generate missing or "privileged" modalities at deployment to augment case representations and improve HAR. We evaluate the presented translators with k-NN classifiers on two HAR datasets and achieve up-to 5% performance improvements using representations augmented with privileged modalities. This suggests that non-intrusive modalities suited for deployment benefit from translation models that generates privileged modalities.

AB Training mixed-domain translation models is a complex task that demands tailored architectures and costly data preparation techniques. In this work, we leverage federated learning (FL) in order to tackle the problem. Our investigation demonstrates that with slight modifications in the training process, neural machine translation (NMT) engines can be easily adapted when an FL-based aggregation is applied to fuse different domains. Experimental results also show that engines built via FL are able to perform on par with state-of-the-art baselines that rely on centralized training techniques.
   We evaluate our hypothesis in the presence of five datasets with different sizes, from different domains, to translate from German into English and discuss how FL and NMT can mutually benefit from each other. In addition to providing benchmarking results on the union of FL and NMT, we also propose a novel technique to dynamically control the communication bandwidth by selecting impactful parameters during FL updates. This is a significant achievement considering the large size of NMT engines that need to be exchanged between FL parties.

AB Cross-lingual document alignment aims to identify pairs of documents in two distinct languages that are of comparable content or translations of each other. In this paper, we exploit the signals embedded in URLs to label web documents at scale with an average precision of 94.5% across different language pairs. We mine sixty-eight snapshots of the Common Crawl corpus and identify web document pairs that are translations of each other. We release a new web dataset consisting of over 392 million URL pairs from Common Crawl covering documents in 8144 language pairs of which 137 pairs include English. In addition to curating this massive dataset, we introduce baseline methods that leverage crosslingual representations to identify aligned documents based on their textual content. Finally, we demonstrate the value of this parallel documents dataset through a downstream task of mining parallel sentences and measuring the quality of machine translations from models trained on this mined data. Our objective in releasing this dataset is to foster new research in cross-lingual NLP across a variety of low, medium, and high-resource languages.

AB We present XCMRC, the first public cross-lingual language understanding (XLU) benchmark which aims to test machines on their cross-lingual reading comprehension ability. To be specific, XCMRC is a Cross-lingual Cloze-style Machine Reading Comprehension task which requires the reader to fill in a missing word (we additionally provide ten noun candidates) in a sentence written in target language (English/Chinese) by reading a given passage written in source language (Chinese/English). Chinese and English are rich-resource language pairs, in order to study low-resource cross-lingual machine reading comprehension (XMRC), besides defining the common XCMRC task which has no restrictions on use of external language resources, we also define the pseudo low-resource XCMRC task by limiting the language resources to be used. In addition, we provide two baselines for common XCMRC task and two for pseudo XCMRC task respectively. We also provide an upper bound baseline for both tasks. We found that for common XCMRC task, translation-based method and multilingual sentence encoder-based method can obtain reasonable performance but still have much room for improvement. As for pseudo low-resource XCMRC task, due to strict restrictions on the use of language resources, our two approaches are far below the upper bound so there are many challenges ahead.

AB Dynamic binary translator (DBT) is typically used for software migration or binary code optimization. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a multi-sources and multi-targets DBT-CrossBit, which aims at fast migrating existing executable source code from one platform to another alien target platform with lower cost. In order to support code translation among multi-sources and multi-targets better, a new intermediate instruction setVInst, which is independent of any specific machine instructions, has been introduced. Unlike many other existing DBTs which directly translate the binary code of one instruction set architecture (ISA) to another ISA, CrossBit first converts source binary code to VInst specifications, and then transforms them into target platform code, using a granularity of a basic block (BB) as the unit of translation. Additionally, to address the performance issue, we adopt several generic optimization methods to optimize the translated code. Finally, our experimental result indicates that, for the SPECint2000 benchmarks, CrossBit's performance is pleasant and can meet the design requirement.

AB We present parametric higher-order abstract syntax (PHOAS), a new approach to formalizing the syntax of programming languages in computer proof assistants based on type theory. Like higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS), PHOAS uses the meta language's binding constructs to represent the object language's binding constructs. Unlike HOAS, PHOAS types are definable in general-purpose type theories that support traditional functional programming, like Coq's Calculus of Inductive Constructions. We walk through how Coq can be used to develop certified, executable program transformations over several statically-typed functional programming languages formalized with PHOAS; that is, each transformation has a machine-checked proof of type preservation and semantic preservation. Our examples include CPS translation and closure conversion for simply-typed lambda calculus, CPS translation for System F, and translation from a language with ML-style pattern matching to a simpler language with no variable-arity binding constructs. By avoiding the syntactic hassle associated with first-order representation techniques, we achieve a very high degree of proof automation.

AB For mobile use, we are developing a multi-lingual example-sentence-driven speech translation system that has a multi-modal input interface to retrieve the sentence. This paper discusses the characteristics of each input mode, the synergistic effect obtained by combining the modes and the results of evaluations that show the difference between system performance in the laboratory and in the real world. As the evaluation criteria, we adopted the retrieval time and the retrieval precision of the sentence. When all of the modes were available, the precision within 30 seconds was 86.8% for a closed test set and 76.8% for an open test set. When the retrieval was completed with only one operation, the average time was 10.3 seconds for a closed set. The precision was 12.0% higher than the maximum precision obtained when only one of the modes was available. The results show that synergetic effect of the combined modes certainly exists and all the modes are necessary to improve the system's usability.

AB Rapid growth in internet technology lead to increase the usage of social media platforms which make communication between users easier. Through the communication users used their daily languages which considered as non-standard language. The non-slandered text contains lots of noise, such as abbreviations, slang which used more in English languages and dialect words which are widely used in Arabic language. These texts face challenging using any natural language processing tools. Therefore, these texts need to be treated and transferred to be similar to their standard form. According to that the normalization and translation approach have been used to transfer the informal text. However, using these approach need large label or parallel datasets. While high resource languages such as English have enough parallel datasets, low resource languages such as Arabic is lack of enough parallel dataset. Therefore, in this paper we focus on the Arabic and Arabic dialects as a low resource language in the era of transferring non-stander text using normalization and translation approach.

AB Markov random field (MRF) models are a powerful tool in machine vision applications. However, learning the model parameters is still a challenging problem and a burdensome task. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a locally adaptive learning framework. The proposed learning framework is simple and effective learning framework for translation-variant MRF models. The key idea is to use neighboring patches as a locally adaptive training set. We use multivariate Gaussian MRF models for local image prior models. Although the Gaussian MRF models are too simple for whole natural image priors, the locally adaptive framework enables to express the prior distributions of the every observed image. These locally adaptive learning framework and the multivariate Gaussian translation-variant MRF models simplify the learning procedures. This paper also includes other two contributions; a novel iteration framework by updating the prior information, and a simple and intuitive derivation of the well-known bilateral filter Experimental results of denoising applications demonstrate that the denoising based on the proposed locally adaptive learning framework outperforms existing high-performance denoising algorithms.

AB The research consists in the hand gestures are movements that convey information and thus complement oral communication or by themselves constitute a form of communication between people. The function of a hand gesture recognition system is to identify the type of movement, from a given set of movements, and the instant when that movement is performed. Gesture recognition systems have multiple applications including sign language translation, bionics, human-machine interaction, gamming, and virtual reality. For this reason, hand gesture recognition is a problem where many researchers have focused their attention too. In this context, in this paper, we present a systematic literature review for hand gesture recognition using ma-chine learning and infrared information. This work has been made because there is no work in the scientific literature that reviews gesture recognition systems based on machine learning and infrared information. In this work, we answer the research question: what is the architecture of the proposed models for hand gesture recognition based on machine learning and infrared information? For answering this research question, we used Kitchenham methodology. Finally, in this work, we also present trends and gaps with respect to the problem analyzed.

AB A new type of fatigue testing machine for micro-sized specimens for MEMS applications has been developed. This fatigue testing machine consists of a magnetostrictive actuator which is able to impart small displacements to a specimen upto 20 mum with resolution of 5 nm. The actuator is connected to a metal shaft and a diamond tip of 5 mum in radius is attached to the end of the shaft. Small displacements are applied to the specimen through the diamond tip. This makes it possible to construct a high stiffness loading fixture. The magnitude of load applied to the specimen is measured by a strain gauge type load cell with a load resolution of 10 muN. The specimen stage and load cell can be moved to adjust the loading position precisely by a stepping motor at a translation resolution of 0.1 mum. Cantilever beam type specimens with dimensions of 10 x 12 x 50 mum(3) were prepared from a Ni-P amorphous thin film by focused ion beam machining. Very small cyclic load (DeltaP = 0.1 - 40 mN) was able to be applied to the specimen successfully. This machine appears to be promising for evaluation of fatigue properties for micro-sized specimens for MEMS applications.

TI Recommendations and future directions for supervised machine learning in
   psychiatry
SO TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY
AB Machine learning methods hold promise for personalized care in psychiatry, demonstrating the potential to tailor treatment decisions and stratify patients into clinically meaningful taxonomies. Subsequently, publication counts applying machine learning methods have risen, with different data modalities, mathematically distinct models, and samples of varying size being used to train and test models with the promise of clinical translation. Consequently, and in part due to the preliminary nature of such works, many studies have reported largely varying degrees of accuracy, raising concerns over systematic overestimation and methodological inconsistencies. Furthermore, a lack of procedural evaluation guidelines for non-expert medical professionals and funding bodies leaves many in the field with no means to systematically evaluate the claims, maturity, and clinical readiness of a project. Given the potential of machine learning methods to transform patient care, albeit, contingent on the rigor of employed methods and their dissemination, we deem it necessary to provide a review of current methods, recommendations, and future directions for applied machine learning in psychiatry. In this review we will cover issues of best practice for model training and evaluation, sources of systematic error and overestimation, model explainability vs. trust, the clinical implementation of AI systems, and finally, future directions for our field.

AB The focus of automatic text summarization research has exhibited a gradual shift from extractive methods to abstractive methods in recent years, owing in part to advances in neural methods. Originally developed for machine translation, neural methods provide a viable framework for obtaining an abstract representation of the meaning of an input text and generating informative, fluent, and human-like summaries. This paper surveys existing approaches to abstractive summarization, focusing on the recently developed neural approaches.

AB Complex natural language applications such as speech translation or pivot translation traditionally rely on cascaded models. However, cascaded models are known to be prone to error propagation and model discrepancy problems. Furthermore, there is no possibility of using end-to-end training data in conventional cascaded systems, meaning that the training data most suited for the task cannot be used. Previous studies suggested several approaches for integrated end-to-end training to overcome those problems, however they mostly rely on (synthetic or natural) three-way data. We propose a cascaded model based on the non-autoregressive Transformer that enables endto-end training without the need for an explicit intermediate representation. This new architecture (i) avoids unnecessary early decisions that can cause errors which are then propagated throughout the cascaded models and (ii) utilizes the end-to-end training data directly. We conduct an evaluation on two pivot-based machine translation tasks, namely French -> German and German -> Czech. Our experimental results show that the proposed architecture yields an improvement of more than 2 BLEU for French -> German over the cascaded baseline.

AB Modern processors are often enhanced using SIMD instructions, such as the MMX, SSE, and AVX instructions set in the x86 architecture, or the NEON instruction set in the ARM architecture. Using these SIMD instructions could significantly increase application performance, hence in application binaries a significant proportion of instructions are likely to be SIMD instructions. However, Dynamic Binary Translation (DBT) has largely overlooked SIMD instruction translation. For example, in the popular QEMU system emulator, guest SIMD instructions are often emulated with a sequence of scalar instructions even when the host machines have SIMD instructions to support such parallel computation, leaving significant potential for performance enhancement. In this paper, we propose two approaches, one leveraging the existing helper function implementation in QEMU, and the other using a newly introduced vector IR (Intermediate Representation) to enhance the performance of SIMD instruction translation in DBT of QEMU. Both approaches were implemented in the QEMU to support ARM and IA32 frontend and x86-64 backend. Preliminary experiments show that adding vector IR can significantly enhance the performance of guest applications containing SIMD instructions for both ARM and IA32 architectures when running with QEMU on the x86-64 platform.

AB Smart technologies that can adapt, sense, infer, learn, anticipate and intervene offer possibilities for improving health care delivery. Continuous data collection afforded by smart technologies has the potential to enrich patients' clinical pictures by augmenting self-and informant-report data and testing data collected during an office visit. Smart technologies also offer possibilities for assisting in real-time with rehabilitation and proactive health interventions. This keynote will discuss issues of importance in creating technologies that can be translated into clinical practice. For example, improving clinical translation of smart technologies for use by health-care professionals will require demonstrating that developed health-related algorithms are reliable and valid, easily visualized and of value in clinical decision-making. The clinical translation of prompting interventions will require answers to questions regarding the best timing, content and delivery of prompts in addition to issues related to motivation and the changing clinical needs of patients. These points and others will be illustrated with examples from our research using sensor data and machine learning techniques to develop algorithms that recognize activities, provide insights on functional status and automate interventions.

AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is known to suffer from a beam-search problem: after a certain point, increasing beam size causes an overall drop in translation quality. This effect is especially pronounced for long sentences. While much work was done analyzing this phenomenon, primarily for autoregressive NMT models, there is still no consensus on its underlying cause. In this work, we analyze errors that cause major quality degradation with large beams in NMT and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). We show that a factor that strongly contributes to the quality degradation with large beams is dataset length-bias - NMT datasets are strongly biased towards short sentences. To mitigate this issue, we propose a new data augmentation technique - Multi-Sentence Resampling (MSR). This technique extends the training examples by concatenating several sentences from the original dataset to make a long training example. We demonstrate that MSR significantly reduces degradation with growing beam size and improves final translation quality on the IWSTL15 En-Vi, IWSTL17 En-Fr, and WMT14 En-De datasets.

AB Brazilian Sign Language (BSL-Libras) is the preferential language of Deaf communities in Brazil. The Human-Computer Interaction Architecture in Sign Language (HCI-SL) was proposed, which will offer user-system interaction in BSL. In 2015 this architecture had its formal model developed, together with the phonological sign decomposition. The work described here advanced proposing morphological rules. Differently from American Sign Language, Libras has a group of verbs that inflect, so translators need to represent this phenomena in the automatic generation process and reflect it in its output, the 3D Avatar. Related Portuguese-BSL translators available have not yet been able to generate correct BSL sentences with regard to these verbs. This paper presents the Lex-Libras modeling process. a set of rules in the form of a Context-Free Grammar capable of describing the morphosyntactic level of BSL. These rules compose the morphosyntactic model of architecture in the Brazilian Portuguese to Brazilian Sign Language semiautomatic translation process through an avatar.

AB Access to a text which is the best translation from one language to another is one of the most important requirements of information societies. In other word, there may be many translations of a source text in which the most convenient one should be selected. The Holy Koran is one of the well-known books in the world which has been descended in Arabic and most of peoples would like to understand more about this book. As a result, there are more than 100 translations of Koran from Arabic to English. In this paper a system has been designed to evaluate different English translations of Koran using tools and concepts such as pos-tagging, natural language processing, computational linguistic and machine learning. To do such an evaluation, each verb process type in translated text should be compared with it's of Koran text. The system uses Halliday Grammar, which is a useful theory for analyzing a formal text, to do this. It has been assumed that each verb in the text of Koran has been tagged manually. At the other hand, to detect each verb process type in translated English texts, a tagger is used to detect and tag each verb based on Halliday grammar. The best translation is one in which the number of similar verb process type in the source and translated text is maximum. This evaluation's been performed on 5 English translations of Holy Koran (Qaraei, Pickthal, Arberry, Progressive Muslims, Yusuf Ali) in scope of Bashir and Nadhir Ayahs of Baqarah and AleImran Surahs and the results show that Yusuf Ali translation is the best. In this paper, it has been tried to create not only a new way to analyze the quality of translating a text but also take a step to discover concepts and meanings of the Koran. Although it is seemed that some of Koran words are so meaningful that it is nearly impossible to put them in one class of verb process type.

TI Lesion-preserving unpaired image-to-image translation between MRI and CT
   from ischemic stroke patients
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY
AB Purpose Multiple medical imaging modalities are used for clinical follow-up ischemic stroke analysis. Mixed-modality datasets are challenging, both for clinical rating purposes and for training machine learning models. While image-to-image translation methods have been applied to harmonize stroke patient images to a single modality, they have only been used for paired data so far. In the more common unpaired scenario, the standard cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) method is not able to translate the stroke lesions properly. Thus, the aim of this work was to develop and evaluate a novel image-to-image translation regularization approach for unpaired 3D follow-up stroke patient datasets.Methods A modified CycleGAN was used to translate images between 238 non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) and 244 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI datasets, two of the most relevant follow-up modalities in clinical practice. We introduced an additional attention-guided mechanism to encourage an improved translation of the lesion and a gradient-consistency loss to preserve structural brain morphology.Results The proposed modifications were able to preserve the overall quality provided by the CycleGAN translation. This was confirmed by the FID score and gradient correlation results. Furthermore, the lesion preservation was significantly improved compared to a standard CycleGAN. This was evaluated for location and volume with segmentation models, which were trained on real datasets and applied to the translated test images. Here, the Dice score coefficient resulted in 0.81 and 0.62 for datasets translated to FLAIR and NCCT, respectively, compared to 0.57 and 0.50 for the corresponding datasets translated using a standard CycleGAN. Finally, an analysis of the distribution of mean lesion intensities showed substantial improvements.Conclusion The results of this work show that the proposed image-to-image translation method is effective at preserving stroke lesions in unpaired modality translation, supporting its potential as a tool for stroke image analysis in real-life scenarios.

AB The general trend in NLP is towards increasing model capacity and performance via deeper neural networks. However, simply stacking more layers of the popular Transformer architecture for machine translation results in poor convergence and high computational overhead. Our empirical analysis suggests that convergence is poor due to gradient vanishing caused by the interaction between residual connections and layer normalization. We propose depth-scaled initialization (DS-Init), which decreases parameter variance at the initialization stage, and reduces output variance of residual connections so as to ease gradient back-propagation through normalization layers. To address computational cost, we propose a merged attention sublayer (MAtt) which combines a simplified average-based self-attention sublayer and the encoderdecoder attention sublayer on the decoder side. Results on WMT and IWSLT translation tasks with five translation directions show that deep Transformers with DS-Init and MAtt can substantially outperform their base counterpart in terms of BLEU (+1.1 BLEU on average for 12-layer models), while matching the decoding speed of the baseline model thanks to the efficiency improvements of MAtt.(1)

TI Societal Responses to Adult Difficulties in L2 Acquisition: Toward an
   Evolutionary Perspective on Language Acquisition
SO LANGUAGE LEARNING
AB It is generally accepted that second language (L2) acquisition becomes more difficult as one grows older and that success in adult L2 acquisition is highly variable. Nevertheless, humans in language contact situations have to cope with intergroup communication. This article examines the ways society has responded to this challenge. It describes eleven strategies or workarounds that humans use to deal with this problem: developing lingua francas, forming Sprachbunds, practicing exogenous marriage, undergoing language shift, learning the target language imperfectly, developing a pidgin or creole, shifting the learning burden to children, relying on individual differences in aptitude among learners, developing the art and practice of translation, developing machine translation technology, and providing instruction. The eleven strategies can be understood as involving four broad societal responses to the burden of SLA: to simplify the learning task, to create a simpler language, to leave it to a special set of learners, and to provide special training. Finally, the article offers some speculations about the evolutionary reasons for the difficulties experienced in adult L2 acquisition.

AB Iteration space tiling and scheduling is an important technique for optimizing loops that constitute a large fraction of execution times in computation kernels of both scientific codes and embedded applications. While tiling has been studied extensively in the context of both uniprocessor and multiprocessor platforms, prior research has paid less attention to tile scheduling, especially when targeting multicore machines with deep on-chip cache hierarchies. In this paper, we propose a cache hierarchy-aware tile scheduling algorithm for multicore machines, with the purpose of maximizing both horizontal and vertical data reuses in on-chip caches, and balancing the workloads across different cores. This scheduling algorithm is one of the key components in a source-to-source translation tool that we developed for automatic loop parallelization and multithreaded code generation from sequential codes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort that develops a fully-automated tile scheduling strategy customized for on-chip cache topologies of multicore machines. The experimental results collected by executing twelve application programs on three commercial Intel machines (Nehalem, Dunnington, and Harpertown) reveal that our cache-aware tile scheduling brings about 27.9% reduction in cache misses, and on average, 13.5% improvement in execution times over an alternate method tested.

AB Modern Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) machines for grinding face-milled hypoid and spiral bevel gears have six axes and are able to perform complex motions with almost free-form ease-off topography correction capabilities. However, in the gear literature and in the common practice machine-settings, corrections are usually performed within the classical cradle-style framework. We believe that, working in the 6-axis framework, may have advantages with respect to correction performances, and numerical conditioning of the resulting optimization problem. However, since for historical and practical reasons basic kinematic settings are usually given within the cradle-style framework, an imperative intermediate step is the translation of the cradle-style kinematics into the 6-axis (minimal) layout.
   Therefore, in this paper the estimation of the continuous mappings from the cradle-style to the 6-axis kinematics is investigated. In particular, the performances of two methods are assessed: (i) an existing central difference method (CDM) approach, and (ii) an original Least Squares Method (LSM) approach. Numerical results show that the LSM approach presents some advantages over the CDM approach in terms of accuracy of the reconstructed surface, numerical stability, and ease of implementation.

TI Deep Kernel machines: a survey
SO PATTERN ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS
AB The emergence of deep learning frameworks paves the way for achieving higher-level data abstractions and possess the potential in consolidating both supervised and unsupervised learning paradigms. Researchers have made many successful explorations in the field of deep learning, with applications in the fields of face recognition, text mining, language translation, image prediction, and action recognition. Kernel machines act as a bridge between the linearity and nonlinearity for many machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines, extreme learning machines, and core vector machines. These Kernel machines play a vital role in mapping the data in the input space to a Kernel-induced high-dimensional feature space to obtain a better distribution of the data. In this Kernel-induced high-dimensional feature space, the distribution of data points will be more amenable to the classification problem under consideration. The Kernel trick facilitates in transforming the machine learning algorithms that require only inner product computations between the data vectors into a Kernel-based approach by selecting an appropriate Kernel function. In Kernel-based approaches, the Kernel functions can thus be utilized for accomplishing the inner product computations between the transformed data vectors in an implicitly defined Kernel-induced feature space. Unlike neural networks, the Kernel machines guarantee structural risk minimization and global optimal solutions. Also, the Kernel machines exhibit capabilities such as theoretical tractability and excellent performance in practical applications. These attempts motivated the researchers towards utilizing the emerging trends of deep learning with Kernel methods for building deep Kernel machines. Researchers integrate Kernel methods and deep learning networks for maintaining their advantages and make up their limitations, then apply the deep Kernel learning approaches for improving the performance of the learning algorithm in different applications. Different ways of building deep Kernel machines by integrating the Kernel methods and deep learning architectures include utilizing Kernel machines as the final classifier of deep learning networks, Kernelization in deep neural networks for better feature enrichment, and building deep Kernel machines by utilizing deep or multiple Kernels in different tasks. This survey attempts to provide an overview of different approaches in building several deep Kernel learning architectures for enhancing the learning algorithm properties and their performance in practical applications.

TI Reinforced Cross-Media Correlation Learning by Context-Aware
   Bidirectional Translation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS FOR VIDEO TECHNOLOGY
AB The heterogeneity gap leads to inconsistent distributions and representations between image and text, which rises a challenging task to measure their similarities and construct cross-media correlation between them. The existing works mainly model the cross-media correlation in a common subspace, which causes insufficient correlation modeling in such third-party subspace with intermediate unidirectional transformation. Inspired by the recent advances of neural machine translation, which aims to establish a corresponding relationship between two entirely different languages, we can naturally discover that it has striking common characteristic with cross-media correlation learning to consider image and text as bilingual pairs, where the image is treated as a special kind of language to provide visual description, so that bidirectional transformation can be conducted between image and text to effectively explore cross-media correlation in the feature space of each media type. Thus, we propose a reinforced cross-media bidirectional translation (RCBT) approach to model the correlation between visual and textual descriptions. First, cross-media bidirectional translation mechanism is proposed to conduct direct transformation between the bilingual pairs of visual and textual descriptions bidirectionally, where the cross-media correlation can be effectively captured in both feature spaces of image and text through bidirectional translation training. Second, cross-media context-aware network with residual attention is proposed to exploit the rich spatial and temporal context hints with cross-media convolutional recurrent neural network, which can lead to more precise correlation learning for promoting bidirectional translation process. Third, cross-media reinforcement learning is proposed to perform a two-agent communication game played as a round between image and text to boost the bidirectional translation process, and we further extract inter-media and intra-media reward signals to provide complementary clues for learning cross-media correlation. Extensive experiments are conducted on cross-media retrieval to verify the effectiveness of our proposed RCBT approach, compared with 11 state-of-the-art methods on three cross-media datasets.

AB A longstanding goal of virtual machines (VMs) isolation running on commercial Solid State Drives (SSDs) is to avoid performance degradation which could be quite severe in certain cases. However, it has been a challenge due to the limitations of the traditional flash translation layer (FTL). We propose OCVM, a novel storage stack that optimizes the isolation of VMs in a multiple VMs environment. By providing channel-granular and block-granular isolation for VMs, OCVM significantly reduces storage internal resource conflicts and eases the pressure of garbage collection (GC). To achieve good VM isolation as well as hardware utilization, OCVM applies a dynamic allocation mechanism for the underlying storage resources of the open-channel SSD (OCSSD). The evaluation results demonstrate that the average execution time of data-intensive applications on OCVM shortens by 28%, compared to those on a baseline system. In addition, OCVM achieves better GC efficiency by reducing the frequency of data migration.

AB Nowadays, computer science increasingly uses formal methods to enhance understanding of complex software systems and to reason about their behavior with respect to a formal specification. To let future generations of software developers and engineers profit from these exciting developments, however, it is necessary to adequately educate and train them in the basics of formal logic and formal language semantics. However, preciously few software tools do exist that substantially aid this educational process. Because the semantics is an integral part of a formal definition of a programming language, we have prepared a package of modules, that help us and to students to understand the most popular semantic method - structural operational semantics. The first module translates a program written in a programming language to abstract machine code, the second module makes reverse translation from code to program source text and the third one emulates stepwise execution of abstract machine code. Our package can be easily extended for other semantic methods.

AB Textual Entailment (TE) recognition is a task which consists in recognizing if a textual expression, the text T, entails another expression, the hypothesis H. Recently it is treated as a common solution for modeling language variability. Textual entailment captures a broad range of semantic oriented inferences needed for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, like Information Retrieval (IR), Question Answering (QA), Information Extraction (TE), text summarization and Machine Translation (NIT). Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) as one of the fundamental problems in those natural language processing applications has attracted increasing attention in recent years. This paper proposes a new method for textual entailment measure which is based on lexical, shallow syntactic analysis combined with fuzzy set theory. Further we model lexical and semantic features based on this method and perform textual entailment recognition using machine learning algorithm. The performance of our method on RTE challenge data resulted in an accuracy of 56%.

AB System-level Dynamic Binary Translation (DBT) provides the capability to boot an Operating System (OS) and execute programs compiled for an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) different to that of the host machine. Due to their performance-critical nature, system-level DBT frameworks are typically hand-coded and heavily optimized, both for their guest and host architectures. While this results in good performance of the DBT system, engineering costs for supporting a new, or extending an existing architecture are high. In this paper we develop a novel, retargetable DBT hypervisor, which includes guest specific modules generated from high-level guest machine specifications. Our system simplifies retargeting of the DBT, but it also delivers performance levels in excess of existing manually created DBT solutions. We achieve this by combining offline and online optimizations, and exploiting the freedom of a Just-in-time (JIT) compiler operating in a bare-metal environment provided by a Virtual Machine (VM) hypervisor. We evaluate our DBT using both targeted micro-benchmarks as well as standard application benchmarks, and we demonstrate its ability to outperform the de-facto standard QEMU DBT system. Our system delivers an average speedup of 2:21x over QEMU across SPEC CPU2006 integer benchmarks running in a full-system Linux OS environment, compiled for the 64-bit ARMv8-A ISA and hosted on an x86-64 platform. For floating-point applications the speedup is even higher, reaching 6:49 x on average. We demonstrate that our system-level DBT system significantly reduces the effort required to support a new ISA, while delivering outstanding performance.

TI PEDA: Comprehensive Damage Assessment for Production Environment Server
   Systems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY
AB Analyzing the intrusion to production servers is an onerous and error-prone work for system security technicians. Existing tools or techniques are quite limited. For instance, system events tracking lacks completeness of intrusion propagation, while dynamic taint tracking is not feasible to be deployed due to significant runtime overhead. Thus, we propose production environment damage assessment (PEDA), a systematic approach to do postmortem intrusion analysis for production workload servers. PEDA replays the "has-been-infected" execution with high fidelity on a separate analyzing instrumentation platform to conduct the heavy workload analysis. Though the replayed execution runs atop the instrumentation platform (i.e., binary-translation-based virtual machine), PEDA allows the first-run execution to run atop the hardware-assisted virtual machine to ensure minimum runtime overhead. Our evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of the PEDA system with a runtime overhead as low as 5%. The real-life intrusion studies show the advantage of PEDA intrusion analysis over existing techniques.

TI The design and implementation of RAP: A PDG-based register allocator
SO SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB This paper describes the design and implementation of a register allocator that performs the allocation over the Program Dependence Graph (PDG) representation of a routine. The PDG representation has been used successfully as the basis for various scalar optimizations, as well as for detecting and improving parallelization for vector machines, multiple processor machines, and architectures that exhibit instruction level parallelism. Variations of the PDG have also been used for debugging and integrating different versions of a program via program-slicing, and to enable translation of imperative programs for data-flow machines and demand-driven graph reducers. By basing register allocation on the PDG, the register allocation phase may be more easily integrated and intertwined with other optimization analyses and transformations. In addition, the advantages of a hierarchical approach to global register allocation can be attained without constructing an additional structure used solely for register allocation.

TI Artificial Intelligence in Pharmacovigilance: An Introduction to Terms,
   Concepts, Applications, and Limitations
SO DRUG SAFETY
AB The tools of artificial intelligence (AI) have enormous potential to enhance activities in pharmacovigilance. Pharmacovigilance experts need not be AI experts, but they should know enough about AI to explore the possibilities of collaboration with those who are. Modern concepts of AI date from Alan Turing's work, especially his paper on "the imitation game", in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Its scope today includes computational skills, including the formulation of mathematical proofs; visual perception, including facial recognition and virtual reality; decision making by expert systems; aspects of language, such as language processing, speech recognition, creative composition, and translation; and combinations of these, e.g. in self-driving vehicles. Machines can be programmed with the ability to learn, using neural networks that mimic cognitive actions of the human brain, leading to deep structural learning. Limitations of AI include difficulties with language, arising from the need to understand context and interpret ambiguities, which particularly affect translation, and inadequacies of databases, requiring careful preparation and curation. New techniques may cause unforeseen difficulties via unexpected malfunctioning. Relevant terms and concepts include different types of machine learning, neural networks, natural language programming, ontologies, and expert systems. Adoption of the tools of AI in pharmacovigilance has been slow. Machine learning, in conjunction with natural language processing and data mining, to study adverse drug reactions in databases such as those found in electronic health records, claims databases, and social media, has the potential to enhance the characterization of known adverse effects and reactions and detect new signals.

TI Multi-modal indicators for estimating perceived cognitive load in
   post-editing of machine translation
SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB In this paper, we develop a model that uses a wide range of physiological and behavioral sensor data to estimate perceived cognitive load (CL) during post-editing (PE) of machine translated (MT) text. By predicting the subjectively reported perceived CL, we aim to quantify the extent of demands placed on the mental resources available during PE. This could for example be used to better capture the usefulness of MT proposals for PE, including the mental effort required, in contrast to the mere closeness to a reference perspective that current MT evaluation focuses on. We compare the effectiveness of our physiological and behavioral features individually and in combination with each other and with the more traditional text and time features relevant to the task. Many of the physiological and behavioral features have not previously been applied to PE. Based on the data gathered from ten participants, we show that our multi-modal measurement approach outperforms all baseline measures in terms of predicting the perceived level of CL as measured by a psychological scale. Combinations of eye-, skin-, and heart-based indicators enhance the results over each individual measure. Additionally, adding PE time improves the regression results further. An investigation of correlations between the best performing features, including sensor features previously unexplored in PE, and the corresponding subjective ratings indicates that the multi-modal approach takes advantage of several weakly to moderately correlated features to combine them into a stronger model.

TI Fast femtosecond laser ablation for efficient cutting of sintered
   alumina substrates
SO OPTICS AND LASERS IN ENGINEERING
AB Fast, accurate cutting of technical ceramics is a significant technological challenge because of these materials' typical high mechanical strength and thermal resistance. Femtosecond pulsed lasers offer significant promise for meeting this challenge. Femtosecond pulses can machine nearly any material with small kerf and little to no collateral damage to the surrounding material. The main drawback to femtosecond laser machining of ceramics is slow processing speed. In this work we report on the improvement of femtosecond laser cutting of sintered alumina substrates through optimisation of laser processing parameters. The femtosecond laser ablation thresholds for sintered alumina were measured using the diagonal scan method. Incubation effects were found to fit a defect accumulation model, with F-th,F-1= 6.0 J/cm(2) ( +/- 0.3) and F-th,F-infinity=2.5 J/cm(2) ( +/- 0.2). The focal length and depth, laser power, number of passes, and material translation speed were optimised for ablation speed and high quality. Optimal conditions of 500 mW power, 100 mm focal length, 2000 mu m/s material translation speed, with 14 passes, produced complete cutting of the alumina substrate at an overall processing speed of 143 mu m/s - more than 4 times faster than the maximum reported overall processing speed previously achieved by Wang et al. [1]. This process significantly increases processing speeds of alumina substrates, thereby reducing costs, making femtosecond laser machining a more viable option for industrial users.

TI Machine Learning Approaches for the Frailty Screening: A Narrative
   Review
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Frailty characterizes a state of impairments that increases the risk of adverse health outcomes such as physical limitation, lower quality of life, and premature death. Frailty prevention, early screening, and management of potential existing conditions are essential and impact the elderly population positively and on society. Advanced machine learning (ML) processing methods are one of healthcare's fastest developing scientific and technical areas. Although research studies are being conducted in a controlled environment, their translation into the real world (clinical setting, which is often dynamic) is challenging. This paper presents a narrative review of the procedures for the frailty screening applied to the innovative tools, focusing on indicators and ML approaches. It results in six selected studies. Support vector machine was the most often used ML method. These methods apparently can identify several risk factors to predict pre-frail or frailty. Even so, there are some limitations (e.g., quality data), but they have enormous potential to detect frailty early.

From one aspect, it reflects whether the machine can have human thinking and creativity. We train the machine for specific tasks and then use it in natural language processing, which will help solve some sentence generation problems, especially for application scenarios such as summary generation, machine translation, and automatic question answering. The OpenAI GPT-2 and BERT models are currently widely used language models for text generation and prediction. There have been many experiments to verify the outstanding performance of these two models in the field of text generation. This paper will use two new corpora to train OpenAI GPT-2 model, used to generate long sentences and articles, and finally perform a comparative analysis. At the same time, we will use the BERT model to complete the task of predicting intermediate words based on the context.

TI Water lubricates hydrogen-bonded molecular machines
SO NATURE CHEMISTRY
AB The mechanical behaviour of molecular machines differs greatly from that of their macroscopic counterparts. This applies particularly when considering concepts such as friction and lubrication, which are key to optimizing the operation of macroscopic machinery. Here, using time-resolved vibrational spectroscopy and NMR-lineshape analysis, we show that for molecular machinery consisting of hydrogen-bonded components the relative motion of the components is accelerated strongly by adding small amounts of water. The translation of a macrocycle along a thread and the rotation of a molecular wheel around an axle both accelerate significantly on the addition of water, whereas other protic liquids have much weaker or opposite effects. We tentatively assign the superior accelerating effect of water to its ability to form a three-dimensional hydrogen-bond network between the moving parts of the molecular machine. These results may indicate a more general phenomenon that helps explain the function of water as the 'lubricant of life'.

AB We attack an inexplicably under-explored language genre of spoken language lyrics in music via completely unsupervised induction of an SMT-style stochastic transduction grammar for hip hop lyrics, yielding a fully-automatically learned challenge-response system that produces rhyming lyrics given an input. Unlike previous efforts, we choose the domain of hip hop lyrics, which is particularly unstructured and noisy. A novel feature of our approach is that it is completely unsupervised and requires no a priori linguistic or phonetic knowledge. In spite of the level of difficulty of the challenge, the model nevertheless produces fluent output as judged by human evaluators, and performs significantly better than widely used phrase-based SMT models upon the same task.

AB Parallel texts, i.e., texts in one language and their translations to other languages, are very useful nowadays for many applications such as machine translation and multilingual information retrieval. If these texts are aligned in a sentence or lexical level their relevance increases considerably. In this paper we describe some experiments that have being carried out with Brazilian Portuguese and English parallel texts by the use of well known alignment methods: five methods for sentence alignment and two methods for lexical alignment. Some linguistic resources were built for these tasks and they are also described here. The results have shown that sentence alignment methods achieved 85.89% to 100% precision and word alignment methods, 51.84% to 95.61% on corpora from different genres.

AB In the Matlab Simulink environment, systems can be modelled using Simulink block diagrams and Stateflow state charts. While stateful logic is more naturally modelled using Stateflow, in practice complex block diagrams are often used instead, resulting in models that are hard to understand and maintain. In order to improve the maintainability and understandability of large industrial models, this paper presents a strategy for refactoring Simulink block diagrams implementing stateful logic into functionally equivalent Stateflow state charts that more naturally represent the intended behaviour. To bridge the gap between the syntax of block diagrams and state charts, Mealy machines represented by tabular expressions are used as an intermediate representation. The compositional language of block diagrams is used to combine tables modelling individual blocks into a table for the entire block diagram which describes the high level state machine encoded in the Simulink subsystem. A prototype tool that performs the translation from Simulink to Stateflow automatically is discussed.

AB Network Address Translation (NAT) is used for various reasons on the Internet and hides the IP address and number of nodes behind the NAT device. Although many applications benefit from the knowledge of number of active nodes behind a NAT device, existing schemes are limited. In this paper, we use TCP timestamp option to count the number of active nodes. Timestamp option includes current timestamp of the machine in the TCP packet. We propose an efficient scheme that counts the number of machines using clustering of timestamps. We use least-squares line fit of timestamp values and convex hulls to efficiently maintain the crucial information about existing clusters. Proposed scheme is online and requires minimal resources. We have investigated various aspects of the scheme to improve its performance. Using a developed tool to send packets, we have observed that the proposed scheme approximates the number of machines that send more than threshold number of packets well. Real experiments validate the proposed scheme.

AB Community Question Answering (CQA) is a form of question answering that is getting increasingly popular as a research direction recently. Given a question posted in an online community forum and the thread of answers to it, a common formulation of the task is to rank automatically the answers, so that the good ones are ranked higher than the bad ones. Despite the vast research in CQA for English, very little attention has been paid to other languages. To bridge this gap, here we present our method for Community Question Answering in Bulgarian. We create annotated training and testing datasets for Bulgarian, and we further explore the applicability of machine translation for reusing English CQA data for building a Bulgarian system. The evaluation results show improvement over the baseline and can serve as a basis for further research.

AB In this technical report, we describe the fine-tuned(1) ASR-MT pipeline used for the IWSLT shared task. We remove less useful speech samples by checking WER with an ASR model, and further train a wav2vec and Transformers-based ASR module based on the filtered data. In addition, we cleanse the errata that can interfere with the machine translation process and use it for Transformer-based MT module training. Finally, in the actual inference phase, we use a sentence boundary detection model trained with constrained data to properly merge fragment ASR outputs into full sentences. The merged sentences are post-processed using part of speech. The final result is yielded by the trained MT module. The performance using the dev set displays BLEU 20.37, and this model records the performance of BLEU 20.9 with the test set.

MOUNTAIN uses statistical machine translation techniques and natural corpora to generate human-like language from a structured internal language, such as a representation of the dialog state. We briefly describe the training process for the MOUNTAIN approach, and show results of automatic evaluation in a standard language generation domain: the METE weather forecasting corpus. Further, we compare output from the MOUNTAIN system to several other NLG systems in the same domain, using both automatic and human-based evaluation metrics; our results show our approach is comparable in quality to other advanced approaches. Finally, we discuss potential extensions, improvements, and other planned tests.

AB Recently, CPUs with an identical ISA tend to have different microarchitectures, different computation resources, and special instructions. To achieve efficient program execution on such hardware, compilers have machine-dependent code optimization. However software vendors cannot adopt this optimization for software production, since the software would be widely distributed and therefore it must be executable on any machine with the same ISA. On the other hand, there is a significant gap between processor's operational speed and memory access speed, and currently the gap is increasing. In this paper we introduce several special prefetch instructions that are suited for memory access patterns that frequently appear in program execution. However, such special instructions are utilized only by compiler's machine-dependent code optimization, and therefore software vendors do not utilize such instructions. To increase opportunities for effectively exploiting the instructions for optimization, we propose dynamic optimization techniques that consist of dynamic code modification and analysis methods of memory references. We evaluate the techniques by using SPEC2000 benchmarks.

AB We propose a new approach to recognize objects and scenes in news videos motivated by the availability of large video collections. This approach considers the recognition problem as the translation of visual elements to words. The correspondences between visual elements and words are learned using the methods adapted from statistical machine translation and used to predict words for particular image regions (region naming), for entire images (auto-annotation), or to associate the automatically generated speech transcript text with the correct video frames (video alignment). Experimental results are presented on TRECVID 2004 data set, which consists of about 150 hours of news videos associated with manual annotations and speech transcript text. The results show that the retrieval performance can be improved by associating visual and textual elements. Also, extensive analysis of features are provided and a method to combine features are proposed.

AB The phenomenon of big data is described using five Vs: Volume, Variety, Velocity, Variability and Veracity. In this paper, we are interested by analyzing and pre-processing tweets for NLP and machine learning applications such as machine translation and classification. Collected contents from twitter (tweets) are considered as unstructured, highly noisy and short (140 characters) texts. Overcoming these complex challenges will help learn from such data and apply traditional NLP and machine learning techniques. In this paper, we propose a pre-processing pipeline for tweets consisting of filtering part-of-speech, named entities recognition, hashtag segmentation and disambiguation. Our proposed approach is also based on the graph theory and group words of tweets using semantic relations of WordNet and the idea of connected components. Evaluations on the task of classification showed promising results when using this proposed preprocessing pipeline, with an increase in the accuracy of the classification up to 87.6%.

AB Machine transliteration has received significant attention as a supporting tool for machine translation and cross-language information retrieval. During the last decade, four kinds of transliteration model have been studied - grapheme-based model, phoneme-based model, hybrid model, and correspondence-based model. These models are classified in terms of the information sources for transliteration or the units to be transliterated - source graphemes, source phonemes, both source graphemes and source phonemes, and the correspondence between source graphemes and phonemes, respectively. Although each transliteration model has shown relatively good performance, one model alone has limitations on handling complex transliteration behaviors. To address the problem, we combined different transliteration models with a "generating transliterations followed by their validation" strategy. The strategy makes it possible to consider complex transliteration behaviors using the strengths of each model and to improve transliteration performance by validating transliterations. Our method makes use of web-based and transliteration model-based validation for transliteration validation. Experiments showed that our method outperforms both the individual transliteration models and previous work.

AB Code motion based optimizations are used quite often in electronic design automation (EDA) tools to improve the quality of synthesis results. Ensuring the correctness of such transformation is necessary for reliability of EDA tools. A value propagation (VP) based equivalence checking method of finite state machine with datapaths (FSMD) was proposed in [1] to specifically verify code motion across loops. In this work, we identify some scenarios involving loop invariant code motion where the VP based equivalence checking method fails to establish the equivalence between two actually equivalent FSMDs. We propose an enhancement over the VP based equivalence checking method [1] to overcome this limitation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can handle the scenario where the VP based equivalence checking method fails.

   spherical parallel mechanism
SO SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES E-TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB A novel reconfigurable 5-DOF hybrid manipulator-TriVariant-B is composed of a 2-DOF spherical parallel mechanism which is serially connected with a 3-DOF open-loop kinematic chain undergoing one translation and two rotations by a prismatic joint. The merit of this design is that a relatively large workspace/limb-stroke ratio can be achieved thanks to the decomposition of the fixed point rotation and the relative translation. In this paper, on the basis of inverse dynamic formulation of the 2-DOF spherical parallel mechanism, an approach is proposed for estimating the servomotor parameters including moment of inertia, rated speed and the maximum torque in a quick manner. The approach has been employed for the development of a prototype for frame cutting process.

AB A growing area of research in the information retrieval (IR) field concerns cross-language information retrieval. Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) consists of providing a query in one language and searching document collections in one or more different languages. Recently, Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) has been widely studied, but they are not often applied to and evaluated for Web applications. In this paper, the research on developing a Translingual German-English-Chinese Web portal in the business domain will be expatiated on. An approach, which combines machine translation methods with dictionary base terminology, has been adopted. In the terminology module, phrasal translation, query expansion and human interaction have been used to improve the performance. To handle information written in Chinese and German correctly and simultaneously, the Char sets and Encoding methods have been discussed in detail.

Wethen review recent research that uses these tools to develop social insight by exploring (a) collective attention and reasoning through the content of communication; (b) social relationships through the process of communication; and (c) social states, roles, and moves identified through heterogeneous signals within communication. Wehighlight social questions for which these advances could offer powerful new insight.

AB In traditional Online Examination System, only objective type questions are assessed and according to that marks are given to the student. However, this technique lacks the capability of evaluating descriptive answers. In university examinations, there are many types of question included for evaluation of the students. Therefore, the automated system must be capable of evaluating the descriptive answers. The online examination system checks the student answer by matching the answer with predefined set of answer. The predefined answers are saved on the server and evaluation is done automatically using the automatic assessment tools. Here the machine learning approach is used to solve this problem using text mining. Measuring the similarity between, sentences, words, documents and paragraphs is an important component in various tasks such as text summarization, information retrieval, automatic essay scoring, document clustering, and machine translation and word-sense disambiguation. In this system JSON is used for transferring data between web application and server, serving as an alternative to XML.

TI Conformational polymorphism in a heteromolecular single crystal leads to
   concerted movement akin to collective rack-and-pinion gears at the
   molecular level
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB We describe a heteromolecular single crystal that exhibits three reversible and concerted reorganizations upon heating and cooling. The products of the reorganizations are conformational polymorphs. The reorganizations are postulated to proceed through three motions: (i) alkyl translations, (ii) olefin rotations, and (iii) rotational tilts. The motions are akin to rack-and-pinion gears at the molecular level. The rack-like movement is based on expansions and compressions of alkyl chains that are coupled with pinion-like 180 degrees rotations of olefins. To accommodate the movements, phenol and thiophene components undergo rotational tilts about intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The movements are collective, being propagated in close-packed repeating units. This discovery marks a step to understanding how organic solids can support the development of crystalline molecular machines and devices through correlated and collective movements.

TI Automatic text detection and removal in video sequences
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS
AB This paper proposes an approach for automatic text detection and removal in video sequences based on support vector machines (SVMs) and spatiotemporal restoration. Given two consecutive frames, first, text regions in the current frame are detected by an SVM-based texture classifier. Second, two stages are performed for the restoration of the regions occluded by the detected text regions: temporal restoration in consecutive frames and spatial restoration in the current frame. Utilizing text motion and background difference, an input video sequence is classified and a different temporal restoration scheme is applied to the sequence. Such a combination of temporal restoration and spatial restoration shows great potential for automatic detection and removal of objects of interest in various kinds of video sequences, and is applicable to many applications such as translation of captions and replacement of indirect advertisements in videos.

TI Transient two-dimensional vibrational spectroscopy of an operating
   molecular machine
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Synthetic molecular machines are promising building blocks for future nanoscopic devices. However, the details of their mechanical behaviour are in many cases still largely unknown. A deeper understanding of mechanics at the molecular level is essential for the design and construction of complex nanodevices. Here, we show that transient two-dimensional infrared (T2DIR) spectroscopy makes it possible to monitor the conformational changes of a translational molecular machine during its operation. Translation of a macrocyclic ring from one station to another on a molecular thread is initiated by a UV pulse. The arrival of the shuttling macrocycle at the final station is visible from a newly appearing cross peak between these two moieties. To eliminate spectral congestion in the T2DIR spectra, we use a subtraction method applicable to many other complex molecular systems. The T2DIR spectra indicate that the macrocycle adopts a boat-like conformation at the final station, which contrasts with the chair-like conformation at the initial station.

TI Automatic RadLex coding of Chinese structured radiology reports based on
   text similarity ensemble
SO BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING
AB Background: Standardized coding of plays an important role in radiology reports' secondary use such as data analytics, data-driven decision support, and personalized medicine. RadLex, a standard radiological lexicon, can reduce subjective variability and improve clarity in radiology reports. RadLex coding of radiology reports is widely used in many countries, but translation and localization of RadLex in China are far from being established. Although automatic RadLex coding is a common way for non-standard radiology reports, the high-accuracy cross-language RadLex coding is hardly achieved due to the limitation of up-to-date auto-translation and text similarity algorithms and still requires further research.
   Methods: We present an effective approach that combines a hybrid translation and a Multilayer Perceptron weighting text similarity ensemble algorithm for automatic RadLex coding of Chinese structured radiology reports. Firstly, a hybrid way to integrate Google neural machine translation and dictionary translation helps to optimize the translation of Chinese radiology phrases to English. The dictionary is made up of 21,863 Chinese-English radiological term pairs extracted from several free medical dictionaries. Secondly, four typical text similarity algorithms are introduced, which are Levenshtein distance, Jaccard similarity coefficient, Word2vec Continuous bag-of-words model, and WordNet Wup similarity algorithms. Lastly, the Multilayer Perceptron model has been used to synthesize the contextual, lexical, character and syntactical information of four text similarity algorithms to promote precision, in which four similarity scores of two terms are taken as input and the output presents whether the two terms are synonyms.
   Results: The results show the effectiveness of the approach with an F1-score of 90.15%, a precision of 91.78% and a recall of 88.59%. The hybrid translation algorithm has no negative effect on the final coding, F1-score has increased by 21.44% and 8.12% compared with the GNMT algorithm and dictionary translation. Compared with the single similarity, the result of the MLP weighting similarity algorithm is satisfactory that has a 4.48% increase compared with the best single similarity algorithm, WordNet Wup.
   Conclusions: The paper proposed an innovative automatic cross-language RadLex coding approach to solve the standardization of Chinese structured radiology reports, that can be taken as a reference to automatic cross-language coding.

AB We describe a machine learning approach to translate physiological signals from one representation to another, with application to the electrocardiogram (ECG). A neural network architecture is presented to transform the raw ECG measurements provided by a novel 11-channel contactless capacitive sensor mat into the standard 12-channel wet electrode ECG. To do this, an adapted version of the CycleGAN model, a bidirectional derivative of the generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture, is developed and evaluated with 31 parallel recordings of cardiac activity using the capacitive mat and a standard wet electrode set up. The mean quadratic error between the standard 12-lead ECG derivations and the corresponding translated mat signals by the proposed CycleGAN model and three other neural network architectures used for comparison shows the method's effectiveness.

The corpus contains about 30,000 sentence pairs, and is structured as a collection of subsets from different sources, further split into training, development and test sets. A sample of sentences from the test set was manually annotated by native speakers in order to incorporate meta-linguistic annotations about the Guarani dialects present in the corpus and also the correctness of the alignment and translation. We also present some baseline MT experiments and analyze the results in terms of the subsets. We hope this corpus can be used as a benchmark for testing Guarani-Spanish MT systems, and aim to expand and improve the quality of the corpus in future iterations.

SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB The paper defines weighted head transducers,finite-state machines that perform middle-out st ring transduction. These transducers are strictly more expressive than the special case of standard left-to-right finite-state transducers. Dependency transduction models are then defined as collections of weighted head transducers that are applied hierarchically A dynamic programming search algorithm is described for finding the optimal transduction of an input string with respect to a dependency transduction model. A method for automatically training a dependency transduction model from a set of input-output example strings is presented. The method first searches for hierarchical alignments of the training examples guided by correlation statistics, and then constructs the transitions of head transducers that are consistent with these alignments. Experimental results are given for applying the training method to translation from English to Spanish and Japanese.

However, its development is hindered by the datasets which have limitations on scale and automatic evaluation methods. We construct two large-scale, multiple-reference datasets for low-resource stylized S2S, the Machine Translation Formality Corpus (MTFC) that is easy to evaluate and the Twitter Conversation Formality Corpus (TCFC) that tackles an important problem in chatbots. These datasets contain context to source style parallel data, source style to target parallel data, and non-parallel sentences in the target style to enable the semi-supervised learning. We provide three baselines, the pivot-based method, the teacher-student method, and the back-translation method. We find that the pivot-based method is the worst, and the other two methods achieve the best score on different metrics.

The multilanguage blended learning system (MBLS) is an integrated LMS technology with translation technology. The MBLS was designed for students who were restricted by an English language barrier in acquiring new knowledge. The purpose of MBLS was to assist students in improving students' learning through the use of multilanguage blended learning environment (MBLE). Freeware software which included Moodle 2.7, Google Chrome web browser, Google Dictionary Chrome 4.0.2 and Imtranslator, has been used for designing MBLS. It is expected that the MBLE may facilitate, engage, and motivate students in learning content from the English medium instruction. The MBLS can also be extended to deliver content in languages other than English.

TI TRANSLATION OF VHDL FOR LOGIC SYNTHESIS
SO MICROPROCESSORS AND MICROSYSTEMS
AB Logic synthesis can be achieved from the majority of VHDL, but some constructs have to be restricted. The techniques used in the TransGATE system to synthesize VHDL are explained. These ideas will be useful for those who wish to understand the process of designing hardware from VHDL models. It should be noted that the semantic completeness of VHDL extends only to constrain simulation tools and not to synthesis. Thus, techniques for hardware implementation described here will not necessarily be the same as other synthesis tools use. The main consideration for users of synthesis tools is to develop the design using a synchronous design methodology since there is no capability as yet for asynchronous circuit synthesis. With this restriction, synthesis can be used in the design of combinational logic processes, registered logic processes or finite state machines.

AB Recently many efforts have been devoted to interpreting the black-box NMT models, but little progress has been made on metrics to evaluate explanation methods. Word Alignment Error Rate can be used as such a metric that matches human understanding, however, it can not measure explanation methods on those target words that are not aligned to any source word. This paper thereby makes an initial attempt to evaluate explanation methods from an alternative viewpoint. To this end, it proposes a principled metric based on fidelity in regard to the predictive behavior of the NMT model. As the exact computation for this metric is intractable, we employ an efficient approach as its approximation. On six standard translation tasks, we quantitatively evaluate several explanation methods in terms of the proposed metric and we reveal some valuable findings for these explanation methods in our experiments.

SO ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY
AB RNA editing process like Adenosine to Intosine (A-to-I) often influences basic functions like splicing stability and most importantly the translation. Thus knowledge about editing sites is of great importance in molecular biology. With the growth of known editing sites, machine learning or data centric approaches are now being applied to solve this problem of prediction of RNA editing sites. In this paper, we propose EPAI-NC, a novel method for prediction of RNA editing sites. We have used l-mer composition and n-gapped l-mer composition as features and used Pearson Correlation Coefficient to select features according to Pareto Principle. Locally deep support vector machines were used to train the classification model of EPAI-NC.

TI The equivalence of bottom-up and top-down tree-to-graph transducers
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER AND SYSTEM SCIENCES
AB We introduce the bottom-up tree-to-graph transducer, which is very similar to the usual (total deterministic) bottom-up tree transducer except that it translates trees into hypergraphs rather than trees, using hypergraph substitution instead of tree substitution. If every output hypergraph of the transducer is a jungle, i.e., a hypergraph that can be unfolded into a tree, then the tree-to-graph transducer is said to be tree-generating and naturally defines a tree-to-tree translation. We prove that bottom-up tree-to-graph transducers define the same tree-to-tree translations as the previously introduced top-down tree-to-graph transducers. This is in contrast with the well-known incomparability of the usual bottom-up and top-down tree transducers. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

AB After being located on a machine bed or a fixture, a workpiece will be actuated by gravity, cutting and inertia force during the machining operation. In order to keep the locating precision as well as the production safety, it is necessary to maintain the workpiece stability during the entire machining process. However, insufficient clamping forces cannot prevent the workpiece from translation and rotations whereas excessive clamping forces may cause strongly the improper workpiece deformations. Therefore, analysis and characterization of clamping forces are important in the fixture design task. This paper presents a mechanistic model for optimally determining the clamping forces. The fixture and workpiece are considered to be rigid bodies, and the model solution is proposed as a constrained quadratic optimization by applying the minimum norm principle. In order to efficiently compute the clamping forces, the constrained quadratic optimization is feasibly slacked into the constrained linear programming problem. The presented approach is conceptually simple and computationally efficient. It is particularly useful in the early stages of fixture design and process planning.

TI Machine learning approaches used to analyze auditory evoked responses
   from the human auditory brainstem: A systematic review
SO COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE
AB Background: The application of machine learning algorithms for assessing the auditory brainstem re-sponse has gained interest over recent years with a considerable number of publications in the literature. In this systematic review, we explore how machine learning has been used to develop algorithms to as-sess auditory brainstem responses. A clear and comprehensive overview is provided to allow clinicians and researchers to explore the domain and the potential translation to clinical care.Methods: The systematic review was performed based on PRISMA guidelines. A search was conducted of PubMed, IEEE-Xplore, and Scopus databases focusing on human studies that have used machine learning to assess auditory brainstem responses. The duration of the search was from January 1, 1990, to April 3, 2021. The Covidence systematic review platform ( www.covidence.org ) was used throughout the process.Results: A total of 5812 studies were found through the database search and 451 duplicates were re-moved. The title and abstract screening process further reduced the article count to 89 and in the pro-ceeding full-text screening, 34 articles met our full inclusion criteria.Conclusion: Three categories of applications were found, namely neurologic diagnosis, hearing threshold estimation, and other (does not relate to neurologic or hearing threshold estimation). Neural networks and support vector machines were the most commonly used machine learning algorithms in all three categories. Only one study had conducted a clinical trial to evaluate the algorithm after development. Challenges remain in the amount of data required to train machine learning models. Suggestions for future research avenues are mentioned with recommended reporting methods for researchers.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO LINGUISTICA ANTVERPIENSIA NEW SERIES-THEMES IN TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB Post-editing (PE) machine translations (MT) has become an increasingly common practice in the translation field in recent years. Research has investigated, among other issues, the types of error corrected by post-editors, but less emphasis has been placed on the corrections themselves and how they reflect MT errors. This article presents a pilot study analysing the edits made by five student post-editors in an English-Finnish post-editing task. We analyse the correctness and necessity of the edits. Our results show that, whereas most edits performed in the task are correct, a significant number of them (34%) are unnecessary. The findings suggest that specific types of edit, such as word-order changes and deletions of personal pronouns, are generally unnecessary for this language pair, which may have implications for post-editing practice and training.

AB Active learning (AL) for resource-poor SMT is an efficient and feasible way to acquire a number of high-quality parallel data to improve translation quality. This paper firstly studies two mainstream sentence selection algorithms that are Geom-phrase and Geom n-gram, and then proposes a sentence perplexity based selection method. Some important findings, such as the impact of sentence length on the AL performance, are observed in the comparison experiments conducted on Chinese-English NIST data. Accordingly, a preprocessing strategy is presented to filter the original monolingual corpus for the purpose of obtaining higher-information sentences. Experimental results on preprocessed data show that the the performance of three selection algorithms is significantly improved compared to the results on the original data.

TI Structural basis of mRNA maturation: Time to put it together
SO CURRENT OPINION IN STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY
AB In eukaryotes, the expression of genetic information begins in the cell nucleus with precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) transcription and processing into mature mRNA. The mRNA is subsequently recognized and packaged by proteins into an mRNA ribonucleoprotein complex (mRNP) and exported to the cytoplasm for translation. Each of the nuclear mRNA maturation steps is carried out by a dedicated molecular machine. Here, we highlight recent structural and mechanistic insights into how these machines function, including the capping enzyme, the spliceosome, the 3'-end processing machinery, and the transcriptionexport complex. While we increasingly understand individual steps of nuclear gene expression, many questions remain. For example, we are only beginning to reveal how mature mRNAs are recognized and packaged for nuclear export and how mRNA maturation events are coupled to transcription and to each other. Advances in the preparation of recombinant and endogenous protein-nucleic acid complexes, cryo-electron microscopy, and machine learning promise exciting insights into the mechanisms of nuclear gene expression and its spatial organization.

SO ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS
AB This article presents a new comprehensive design procedure for longitudinal flux flat linear switched reluctance motors. The design process comprises all the steps from detailing the specifications to sizing the prototype to validating the design, and it can be applied to three types of flux flat linear switched reluctance motors: single sided, double sided, and modified double sided. The design is based on an analytical formulation of the average translation force determined using a simplified non-linear energy conversion loop. Special emphasis is devoted to the calculation of the number of turns per phase. A two-dimensional finite-element analysis, corrected to take into account end effects, and a lumped parameter thermal analysis were used to refine and/or validate the design. Finally, a linear switched reluctance motor prototype was built following the proposed design and was verified by experimental measurements.

AB Advances in computer science have transformed the way artificial intelligence is employed in academia, with Machine Learning (ML) methods easily available to researchers from diverse areas thanks to intuitive frameworks that yield extraordinary results. Notwithstanding, current trends in the mainstream ML community tend to emphasise wins over knowledge, putting the scientific method aside, and focusing on maximising metrics of interest. Methodological flaws lead to poor justification of method choice, which in turn leads to disregard the limitations of the methods employed, ultimately putting at risk the translation of solutions into real-world clinical settings. This work exemplifies the impact of the problem of induction in medical research, studying the methodological issues of recent solutions for computer-aided diagnosis of COVID-19 from chest X-Ray images.

SO TRENDS IN BIOCHEMICAL SCIENCES
AB Eukaryotic ribosomes are significantly larger and more complex than their prokaryotic counterparts. This parallels the increased complexity of the associated cellular machinery responsible for translation initiation, ribosome assembly, and the regulation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. The recently determined crystal structures of the small (40S) and large (60S) ribosomal subunits and the 80S ribosome now provide an atomic description of this essential molecular machine and reveal its eukaryote-specific features. In this review, we discuss the common structural principles underlying the evolution of both ribosomal subunits. The recently obtained structural information provides a framework for further genetic, biochemical and structural studies of eukaryotic ribosomes. At the same time, it facilitates a direct comparison between prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomal features.

TI Towards Sentiment Analysis for Romanian Twitter Content
SO ALGORITHMS
AB With the increased popularity of social media platforms such as Twitter or Facebook, sentiment analysis (SA) over the microblogging content becomes of crucial importance. The literature reports good results for well-resourced languages such as English, Spanish or German, but open research space still exists for underrepresented languages such as Romanian, where there is a lack of public training datasets or pretrained word embeddings. The majority of research on Romanian SA tackles the issue in a binary classification manner (positive vs. negative), using a single public dataset which consists of product reviews. In this paper, we respond to the need for a media surveillance project to possess a custom multinomial SA classifier for usage in a restrictive and specific production setup. We describe in detail how such a classifier was built, with the help of an English dataset (containing around 15,000 tweets) translated to Romanian with a public translation service. We test the most popular classification methods that could be applied to SA, including standard machine learning, deep learning and BERT. As we could not find any results for multinomial sentiment classification (positive, negative and neutral) in Romanian, we set two benchmark accuracies of approximate to 78% using standard machine learning and approximate to 81% using BERT. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the automatic translation service does not downgrade the learning performance by comparing the accuracies achieved by the models trained on the original dataset with the models trained on the translated data.

TI Equivalence analysis of simulation data and operation data of nuclear
   power plant based on machine learning
SO ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY
AB As an effective data pattern extraction method, machine learning is widely used in the field of nuclear power industry control, and has a great application. In order to solve the problem that there is a serious lack of operation data set for analyzing various variable conditions or accident conditions, this paper uses the maximum likelihood estimation and the least square estimation to prove that, when the simulation data of nuclear power plant and the operation data with different noise terms are used as the training data samples to train the machine learning algorithm models respectively, the difference between the two algorithms at each moment is only related to the mean of noise distribution. Especially when the mean of noise distribution is 0, they are equivalent. The conclusion shows that when the machine learning algorithm model is trained, the simulation data can supplement the operation data set. When the algorithm models are trained with the supplementary data set, the supplementary data will not change the calculations of the original algorithm model. Therefore, the simulation data can be used to expand the operation data set of variable conditions or accident conditions to improve the calculation accuracy of the algorithm models. In order to verify the conclusion, this paper uses simulation data and operation data with different noise terms to train the neural network algorithm models with L2 regularization term, and uses the algorithm models to calculate the steam mass flow rate at the outlet of main steam pipe of steam generator and the water temperature at the bottom of pressurizer. It is further proved that the calculations of thermal hydraulic transient operation parameters of the algorithm models trained by the operation data set with different noise terms are only equivalent to the translation of the calculations of the algorithm models trained by the simulation data set. And the value of translation is the mean of the noise distribution, which proves that the conclusion is effective. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This study was conducted with the aim of identifying the interrelationships among topics based on the understanding of various bodies of knowledge and to provide a foundation for topic compositions to construct an academic body of knowledge of AI. To this end, machine learning-based sentence similarity measurement models used in machine translation, chatbots, and document summarization were applied to the body of knowledge of AI. Consequently, several similar topics related to agent designing in AI, such as algorithm complexity, discrete structures, fundamentals of software development, and parallel and distributed computing were identified.

AB Multimodal machine learning is a core research area spanning the language, visual and acoustic modalities. The central challenge in multimodal learning involves learning representations that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. In this paper, we propose two methods for unsupervised learning of joint multimodal representations using sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) methods: a Seq2Seq Modality Translation Model and a Hierarchical Seq2Seq Modality Translation Model. We also explore multiple different variations on the multimodal inputs and outputs of these seq2seq models. Our experiments on multimodal sentiment analysis using the CMU-MOSI dataset indicate that our methods learn informative multimodal representations that outperform the baselines and achieve improved performance on multimodal sentiment analysis, specifically in the Bimodal case where our model is able to improve F1 Score by twelve points. We also discuss future directions for multimodal Seq2Seq methods.

TI Learning using privileged information for HRRP-based radar target
   recognition
SO IET SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB A novel machine learning method named extended support vector data description with negative examples (ESVDD-neg) is developed to classify the fast Fourier transform-magnitude feature of complex high-resolution range profile (HRRP), motivated by the problem of radar automatic target recognition. The proposed method not only inherits the close non-linear boundary advantage of support vector data description with negative examples model but also incorporates a new learning paradigm named learning using privileged information into the model. It leads to the appealing application with no assumptions regarding the distribution of data and needs less training samples and prior information. Besides, the second order central moment is selected as privileged information for better recognition performance, weakening the effect of translation sensitivity, and the normalisation contributes to eliminating the amplitude sensitivity. Hence, there will be a remarkable improvement of recognition accuracy not only with small training dataset but also under the condition of low signal-to-noise ratio. Numerical experiments based on two publicly UCI datasets and HRRPs of four aircrafts demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method. The noise robust ESVDD-neg is ideal for HRRP-based radar target recognition.

AB Parallel corpora are key to developing good machine translation systems. However, abundant parallel data are hard to come by, especially for languages with a low number of speakers. When rich morphology exacerbates the data sparsity problem, it is imperative to have accurate alignment and filtering methods that can help make the most of what is available by maximising the number of correctly translated segments in a corpus and minimising noise by removing incorrect translations and segments containing extraneous data. This paper sets out a research plan for improving alignment and filtering methods for parallel texts in low-resource settings. We propose an effective unsupervised alignment method to tackle the alignment problem. Moreover, we propose a strategy to supplement state-of-the-art models with automatically extracted information using basic NLP tools to effectively handle rich morphology.

The Chinese scripts were translated into English by Google Translate (GT) and compared with the scripts written in English. Sentences in the two sets of passages that were clearly parallel in meaning were then extracted and compared for accuracy, vocabulary, substance, and length. Findings revealed that in some cases the GT versions (i.e., those originally written in the native tongue) displayed language that was significantly better that what the students produced when writing in English. Patterns of improvement are analyzed and discussed.

AB Programs are often subjected to significant optimizing and parallelizing transformations. It is therefore important to model parallel behaviours and formally verify the equivalence of their functionalities. In this work, the untimed PRES+ model (Petri net based Representation of Embedded Systems) encompassing data processing is used to model parallel behaviours. Being value based with inherent scope of capturing parallelism, PRES+ models depict such data dependencies more directly; accordingly. they are likely to be more convenient as the intermediate representations (IRs) of both the source and the transformed codes for translation validation than strictly sequential variable-based IRs like Finite State Machines with Datapath (FSMDs) (which are essentially sequential control data-flow graphs (CMGs)). In this work, a path based equivalence checking method for PRES+ models is presented.

TI Ballistic nanofriction
SO NATURE MATERIALS
AB Sliding parts in nanosystems such as nanoelectromechanical systems and nanomotors(1-9) increasingly involve large speeds, and rotations as well as translations of the moving surfaces; yet, the physics of high-speed nanoscale friction is so far unexplored. Here, by simulating the motion of drifting and of kicked Au clusters on graphite-a workhorse system of experimental relevance(10-13)-we demonstrate and characterize a new 'ballistic' friction regime at high speed, separate from drift at low speed. The temperature dependence of the cluster slip distance and time, measuring friction, is opposite in these two regimes, consistent with theory. Crucial to both regimes is the interplay of rotations and translations, shown to be correlated in slow drift but anticorrelated in fast sliding. Despite these differences, we find the velocity dependence of ballistic friction to be, like drift, viscous.

TI Static analysis of cloud elasticity
SO SCIENCE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING
AB We propose a static analysis technique that computes upper bounds of virtual machine usages in a concurrent language with explicit acquire and release operations of virtual machines. In our language it is possible to delegate other (ad-hoc or third party) concurrent code to release virtual machines (by passing them as arguments of invocations). Our technique is modular and consists of (i) a type system associating programs with behavioural types that record relevant information for resource usage (creations, releases, and concurrent operations), (ii) a translation function that takes behavioural types and returns cost equations, and (iii) an automatic off-the-shelf solver for the cost equations. A soundness proof of the type system establishes the correctness of our technique with respect to the cost equations. We have experimentally evaluated our technique using a cost analysis solver and we report some results. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Previous work on neural noisy channel modeling relied on latent variable models that incrementally process the source and target sentence. This makes decoding decisions based on partial source prefixes even though the full source is available. We pursue an alternative approach based on standard sequence to sequence models which utilize the entire source. These models perform remarkably well as channel models, even though they have neither been trained on, nor designed to factor over incomplete target sentences. Experiments with neural language models trained on billions of words show that noisy channel models can outperform a direct model by up to 3.2 BLEU on WMT'17 German-English translation. We evaluate on four language-pairs and our channel models consistently outperform strong alternatives such right-to-left reranking models and ensembles of direct models.(1)

TI Artificial Aesthetics and Aesthetic Machine Attention
SO AM JOURNAL OF ART AND MEDIA STUDIES
AB The aesthetics of artificial intelligence is often viewed in relation to the qualities of their generated expressions. However, aesthetics could have a broader role in developing machine perception. One of the main areas of expertise in aesthetics is the understanding of feature-based information, which involves how the aesthetics of sensory features can cause affective changes in the perceiver, and the other way around - how affective states can give rise to certain kinds of aesthetic features. This two-way link between aesthetic features and affects is not yet well-established in the interdisciplinary discussion; however, according to perceptual psychology, it fundamentally constructs the human experience. Machine attention is an emerging technique in machine learning that is most often used in tasks like object detection, visual question answering, and language translation. Modern use of technology most often focuses on creating object-based attention through linguistic catego-ries, although the models could also be utilized for nonverbal attention. This paper proposes the following perceptual conditions for aesthetic machine attention: 1) acknowledging that something appears (aesthetic detection); 2) suspension of judgment (aesthetic recognition); and 3) making the incident explicit with expression (aesthetic identification and amplifica-tion). These aspects are developed through an interdisciplinary reflection of literature from the fields of aesthetics, perceptual psychology, and machine learning. The paper does not aim to give a general account of aesthetic perception but to expand the interdisciplinary theory of aesthetics and specify the role of aesthetics among other disciplines at the heart of the techno-logical development of the human future.

TI Physical modeling of catchment area by rapid prototyping using GIS data
SO RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL
AB Purpose - The purpose of the present work is to develop a methodology for making physical models of catchment areas and terrains by rapid prototyping (RP) using geographic information systems (GIS) data. It is also intended to reduce data loss by minimising intermediate data translations.
   Design/methodology/approach - The GIS data of a catchment area or a terrain were directly translated to an stereo lithography (STL) file. The STL surface was then manipulated in Magics-RP to obtain a solid STL pan, which can then be downloaded to a RP machine to obtain a physical model or representation of a terrain or catchtment area.
   Findings - Intricate geometries of landforms were created with ease and great accuracy in RP machines. Terrain models were created in less time and lower cost than with conventional methods.
   Research limitations/implications - DEM ASCII XYZ (digital elevation model) data were used to input the required GIS data of specific terrains. Software can be developed for translation and manipulation of DEM, STL and other relevant file formats. This will eliminate any data loss associated with intermediate file transfer.
   Practical implications - Terrain models were created with ease and great accuracy in RP machines. it takes less time and can be done more cost-effectively. Terrain models have intricate geometries and for complex models, it may take months to make using conventional methods.
   Originality/value - STL surfaces were obtained directly from GIS data for terrain modeling. This work fulfils the need of terrain modeling for catchment management, town-planning, road-transport planning, architecture, military applications, geological education, etc.

AB Aligned parallel corpora are very important linguistic resources useful in many text processing tasks such as machine translation, word sense disambiguation, dictionary compilation, etc. Nevertheless, there are few available linguistic resources of this type, especially for fiction texts, due to the difficulties in collecting the texts and high cost of manual alignment. In this paper, we describe an automatically aligned English-Spanish parallel corpus of fiction texts and evaluate our method of alignment that uses linguistic data-namely, on the usage of existing bilingual dictionaries-to calculate word similarity. The method is based on the simple idea: if a meaningful word is present in the source text then one of its dictionary translations should be present in the target text. Experimental results of alignment at paragraph level are described.

AB A new error modelling and identification method based on the cross grid encoder is proposed in this paper. Generally, there are 21 error components in the geometric error of the 3 axis NC machine. tools. However according our theoretical analysis, the squareness error among different, guide ways affects not only the translation error component, but also the rotational ones. Therefore, a revised synthetic error model is developed. And the mapping relationship between the error component and radial motion error of round workpiece manufactured on the NC machine tools are deduced. This mapping relationship shows that the radial error of circular motion is the comprehensive function result of all the error components of link, worktable, sliding table and main spindle block. Aiming to overcome the solution singularity shortcoming of traditional error component identification method, a new multi-step identification method of error component by using the Cross Grid Encoder measurement technology is proposed based on the kinematic error model of NC machine tool. Firstly, the 12 translational error components of the NC machine tool are measured and identified by using the least square method (LSM) when the NC machine tools go linear motion in the three orthogonal planes: XOY plane, XOZ plane and YOZ plane. Secondly, the circular error tracks are measured when the NC machine tools go circular motion in the same above orthogonal planes by using the cross grid encoder Heidenhain KGM 182. Therefore 9 rotational errors can be identified by using LSM. Finally the experimental validation of the above modelling theory and identification method is carried out in the 3 axis CNC vertical machining centre Cincinnati 750 Arrow. The entire 21 error components have been successfully measured out by the above method, Research shows the multi-step modelling and identification method is very suitable for 'on machine measurement'.

AB A compiler is a program that translates source code written in a particular language into another language. Internally, the whole process is typically split into multiple stages that handle one particular aspect of this translation. One of these consists of translating the high-level representation of the program, typically an abstract syntax tree, into a simpler form that is suitable for analysis, optimizations, and code generation. This tutorial paper focuses on this process, and uses LLVM to compile programs into optimized machine code. LLVM is a language-agnostic compiler toolchain that handles program optimization and code generation. It is based on its own internal representation, called LLVM IR, which is then transformed into machine code.
   We give a brief introduction to LLVM IR, and describe a few patterns to translate high-level language constructs expressed as abstract syntax trees. We implement these patterns in a compiler for a toy programming language, named Cocodol, which supports dynamic typing, unbounded loops, and higher-order functions.

AB Petri nets are often used as a design tool amenable to model specification, simulation, and verification. They are typically used in the design phase often with no clear connection to the requirements phase, including requirements specification. This paper shows how a class of non-autonomous Petri Nets can be used as an executable model for the design and implementation of machine domains in the context of the Problem Frames approach. This provides a requirements-design connection together with model simulation and verification. More specifically, Problem Frames are used to support requirements, problem and machine specifications amenable to a direct translation to IOPT nets, a class of non-autonomous Petri nets especially adapted for controller specifications. To that end, we propose a set of semi-formal rules for machine specifications in problem frames, which take advantage of the concepts available in IOPT nets, namely input and output signals and events, states, and a net composition operation. We illustrate the approach using an example.

TI A Retargetable Static Binary Translator for the ARM Architecture
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ARCHITECTURE AND CODE OPTIMIZATION
AB Machines designed with new but incompatible Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) may lack proper applications. Binary translation can address this incompatibility by migrating applications from one legacy ISA to a new one, although binary translation has problems such as code discovery for variable-length ISA and code location issues for handling indirect branches. Dynamic Binary Translation (DBT) has been widely adopted for migrating applications since it avoids those problems. Static Binary Translation (SBT) is a less general solution and has not been actively researched. However, SBT performs more aggressive optimizations, which could yield more compact code and better code quality. Applications translated by SBT can consume less memory, processor cycles, and power than DBT and can be started more quickly. These advantages are even more critical for embedded systems than for general systems.
   In this article, we designed and implemented a new SBT tool, called LLBT, which translates ARM instructions into LLVM IRs and then retargets the LLVM IRs to various ISAs, including x86, x86-64, ARM, and MIPS. LLBT leverages two important functionalities from LLVM: comprehensive optimizations and retargetability. More importantly, LLBT solves the code discovery problem for ARM/Thumb binaries without resorting to interpretation. LLBT also effectively reduced the size of the address mapping table, making SBT a viable solution for embedded systems. Our experiments based on the EEMBC benchmark suite show that the LLBT-generated code can run more than 6x and 2.3x faster on average than emulation with QEMU and HQEMU, respectively.

AB Over the past few decades of computer aided engineering growth there has been much more progress in increasing the power and capability of function specific engineering tools (e. g., optical design, finite element analysis, etc.) than in the integration of and communication between these tools. With only a few notable exceptions, such as FEA being imbedded into solid modeling, the communication method between the function specific tools continues to be dominated by translation to neutral data formats (e. g., IGES, STEP) and file transfer. There are a number of problems with this approach. The translation is a serial process where an engineer has to stop at some point in the design, make the neutral file, send that file to the next function, and wait for feedback. The translation through a neutral format is typically one way so the whole translation process has to be repeated when changes are required. Revision tracking of multiple files for each design iteration is both critical and a likely source of errors. Also, as with any translation, some information is always lost or corrupted in the process.
   This paper describes some progress that has been made in more tightly integrating optical design, mechanical design, fabrication, and testing of optical systems. Tools have been developed that connect CODE V (R)([1]) to SolidWorks (R)([2]) (bidirectional), compensation of diamond turning CNC from interferometric data, slope analysis from interferometer and profilometer data, and other tools for wavefront error compensation, and electronic nulls. Design, machining, testing and inspection efficiency gains are achieved through tools that consume mechanical solid models in their native format.

AB Low-resource languages often suffer from a lack of high-coverage lexical resources. In this paper, we propose a method to generate cognate tables by clustering words from existing lexical resources. We then employ character-based machine translation methods in solving the task of cognate chain completion by inducing missing word translations from lower-coverage dictionaries to fill gaps in the cognate chain, finding improvements over single language pair baselines when employing simple but novel multi-language system combination on the Romance and Turkic language families. For the Romance family, we show that system combination using the results of clustering outperforms weights derived from the historical-linguistic scholarship on language phylogenies. Our approach is applicable to any language family and has not been previously performed at such scale. The cognate tables are released to the research community.

TI Mechanized pivot shift test achieves greater accuracy than manual pivot
   shift test
SO KNEE SURGERY SPORTS TRAUMATOLOGY ARTHROSCOPY
AB The objective of this study was to design a navigated mechanized pivot shift test setup and evaluate its repeatability in the ACL-deficient knee. It was hypothesized that translations and rotations measured with the mechanized pivot shift would be more repeatable when compared to those obtained with a manual pivot shift. Twelve fresh frozen cadaveric hip-to-toe whole lower extremities were used for this study. A manual pivot shift test was performed in the intact knee and in the ACL-deficient knee and was repeated three times. A navigation system simultaneously recorded tibial translation and rotation. The mechanized pivot shift test consists of a modified continuous passive motion (CPM) machine and a custom-made foot holder to allow for the application of internal rotation moments at the knee. Valgus moments were achieved by a 45A degrees tilt of the CPM machine with respect to the supine position and a Velcro strap secured across the proximal tibia. The mechanized pivot shift was repeated three times. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare manual and mechanized pivot shift testing. An intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to determine variability within each knee at each testing condition. In the ACL-deficient knee, translation with manual pivot shift testing (11.7 +/- A 2.6 mm) was significantly higher than with mechanized pivot shift testing (7.4 +/- A 2.5 mm; p < 0.05). Rotation with the manual pivot shift testing (18.6 +/- A 5.4A degrees) was also significantly higher than with mechanized pivot shift testing (11.0 +/- A 2.3A degrees; p < 0.05). The intra-class ICC for translations was 0.76 for manual pivot shift and 0.92 for the mechanized pivot shift test. The intra-class ICC for rotations was 0.89 for manual pivot shift and 0.82 for the mechanized pivot shift test. This study introduced a modified CPM for mechanized pivot shift testing. Although recorded translations and rotations with the mechanized pivot shift test were lower than with manual testing, the clinical advantage of mechanized pivot shift testing is a more repeatable measurement of ATT when compared to manual pivot shift testing. This setup may increase consistency of clinical grading of the pivot shift test.

In this paper, we present PARADISE (PARAllel & Denoising Integration in SEquence-to-sequence models), which extends the conventional denoising objective used to train these models by (i) replacing words in the noised sequence according to a multilingual dictionary, and (ii) predicting the reference translation according to a parallel corpus instead of recovering the original sequence. Our experiments on machine translation and cross-lingual natural language inference show an average improvement of 2.0 BLEU points and 6.7 accuracy points from integrating parallel data into pretraining, respectively, obtaining results that are competitive with several popular models at a fraction of their computational cost.(1)

AB Nowadays, metaphor interpretation becomes one of the important issues in natural language processing. Many researchers are attention on the topic of metaphor in natural language processing area. In machine translation, metaphors are important to be aware of what they mean. But metaphors are difficult to comprehend and these are one of the reasons for increasing translation errors. Myanmar Language is a low resources language and some resources for Myanmar Language are not perfect and ready to use. For Myanmar Language, no research has been done on metaphor. This paper presents nominal metaphor identification using Myanmar WordNet (MMWN). English-Myanmar Bilingual Dictionaries and wn2sql are also used to solve the issues found in this work. General discussion about the issues and explanations are also described in this paper.

TI Automated Discovery of Properties of Rough Sets
SO FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE
AB The computer certification of rough sets (the translation in a way understandable by machines) seems to be far beyond the test phase. To assure the feasibility of the approach, we try to encode selected problems within rough set theory and as the testbed of already developed foundations - and in the same time as a payoff of the established framework - we shed some new light on the well-known question of generalization of rough sets and the axiomatization of approximation operators in terms of (various types of) binary relations. We show how much the human work can be enhanced with the use of automatic tools, without loosing too much time for the translation. Although the syntax is understandable by the computer, it offers relative flexibility and expressive power of the formal language.

TI Evolutionary optimization of sequence kernels for detection of bacterial
   gene starts
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS
AB Oligo kernels for biological sequence classification have a high discriminative power. A new parameterization for the K-mer oligo kernel is presented, where all oligomers of length K are weighted individually. The task specific choice of these parameters increases the classification performance and reveals information about discriminative features. For adapting the multiple kernel parameters based on cross-validation the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy is proposed. It is applied to optimize the trimer oligo kernels for the detection of bacterial gene starts. The resulting kernels lead to higher classification rates, and the adapted parameters reveal the importance of particular triplets for classification, for example of those occurring in the Shine-Dalgarno Sequence.

The two target languages, although both belonging to the Indo-European language family, show significant differences in morphology, syntax and word order. We describe how TectoMT, a successful framework for analysis and generation of language, can be used as preprocessor for a phrase-based MT system. We compare the two language pairs and the optimal sets of source-language transformations applied to them. The following transformations are examples of possible preprocessing steps: lemmatization; retokenization, compound splitting; removing/adding words lacking counterparts in the other language; phrase reordering to resemble the target word order; marking syntactic functions. TectoMT, as well as all other tools and data sets we use, are freely available on the Web.

TI Fully automatic multi-language translation with a catalogue of phrases:
   successful employment for the Swiss avalanche bulletin
SO LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
AB The Swiss avalanche bulletin is produced twice a day in four languages. Due to the lack of time available for manual translation, a fully automated translation system is employed, based on a catalogue of predefined phrases and predetermined rules of how these phrases can be combined to produce sentences. Because this catalogue of phrases is limited to a small sublanguage, the system is able to automatically translate such sentences from German into the target languages French, Italian and English without subsequent proofreading or correction. Having been operational for two winter seasons, we assess here the quality of the produced texts based on two different surveys where participants rated texts from real avalanche bulletins from both origins, the catalogue of phrases versus manually written and translated texts. With a mean recognition rate of 55 %, users can hardly distinguish between the two types of texts, and give very similar ratings with respect to their language quality. Overall, the output from the catalogue system can be considered virtually equivalent to a text written by avalanche forecasters and then manually translated by professional translators. Furthermore, forecasters declared that all relevant situations were captured by the system with sufficient accuracy. Forecaster's working load did not change with the introduction of the catalogue: the extra time to find matching sentences is compensated by the fact that they no longer need to double-check manually translated texts. The reduction of daily translation costs is expected to offset the initial development costs within a few years.

TI Towards Energy-Preserving Natural Language Understanding With Spiking
   Neural Networks
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB neural networks have shown promising results in a variety of natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. Despite their successes, conventional neural-based NLU models are criticized for high energy consumption, making them laborious to be widely applied in low-power electronics, such as smartphones and intelligent terminals. In this paper, we introduce a potential direction to alleviate this bottleneck by proposing a spiking encoder. The core of our model is bi-directional spiking neural network (SNN) which transforms numeric values into discrete spiking signals and replaces massive multiplications with much cheaper additive operations. We examine our model on sentiment classification and machine translation tasks. Experimental results reveal that our model achieves comparable classification and translation accuracy to advanced TRANSFORMER baseline, whereas significantly reduces the required computational energy to 0.82%.

The English source text is manually translated into 11 European and BRIC languages using the CrowdFlower platform. During the process several challenges arose which mainly involved the in-domain text genre, the large text volume, the idiosyncrasies of each target language, the limitations of the crowdsourcing platform, as well as the quality assurance and workflow issues of the crowdsourcing process. The corpus constitutes a product of the EU-funded TraMOOC project and is utilised in the project in order to train, tune and test machine translation engines.

The UNL is an Artificial Language, which not only facilitates the translation stratagem between all the Natural Languages across the world, but also proffers the unification of those Natural Languages as well. DeConverter is the core software contrivance in a UNL system. The paper also focuses on the Linguistic Analysis of Bangla Language for the DeConversion process. A set of DeConversion rules have been burgeoned for converting UNL expression to Bangla. Experimental result shows that these rules successfully generate correct Bangla text from UNL expressions. These rules can currently produce basic and simple Bangla sentences; however, it is being aggrandized to superintend advanced and complex sentences.

TI Resuscitation of Ischemic Donor Livers with Normothermic Machine
   Perfusion: A Metabolic Flux Analysis of Treatment in Rats
SO PLOS ONE
AB Normothermic machine perfusion has previously been demonstrated to restore damaged warm ischemic livers to transplantable condition in animal models. However, the mechanisms of recovery are unclear, preventing rational optimization of perfusion systems and slowing clinical translation of machine perfusion. In this study, organ recovery time and major perfusate shortcomings were evaluated using a comprehensive metabolic analysis of organ function in perfusion prior to successful transplantation. Two groups, Fresh livers and livers subjected to 1 hr of warm ischemia (WI) received perfusion for a total preservation time of 6 hrs, followed by successful transplantation. 24 metabolic fluxes were directly measured and 38 stoichiometrically-related fluxes were estimated via a mass balance model of the major pathways of energy metabolism. This analysis revealed stable metabolism in Fresh livers throughout perfusion while identifying two distinct metabolic states in WI livers, separated at t = 2 hrs, coinciding with recovery of oxygen uptake rates to Fresh liver values. This finding strongly suggests successful organ resuscitation within 2 hrs of perfusion. Overall perfused livers regulated metabolism of perfusate substrates according to their metabolic needs, despite supraphysiological levels of some metabolites. This study establishes the first integrative metabolic basis for the dynamics of recovery during perfusion treatment of marginal livers. Our initial findings support enhanced oxygen delivery for both timely recovery and long-term sustenance. These results are expected to lead the optimization of the treatment protocols and perfusion media from a metabolic perspective, facilitating translation to clinical use.

TI Machine learning models for the secondary Bjerknes force between two
   insonated bubbles
SO ACTA MECHANICA SINICA
AB The secondary Bjerknes force plays a significant role in the evolution of bubble clusters. However, due to the complex dependence of the force on multiple parameters, it is highly non-trivial to include its effects in the simulations of bubble clusters. In this paper, machine learning is used to develop a data-driven model for the secondary Bjerknes force between two insonated bubbles as a function of the equilibrium radii of the bubbles, the distance between the bubbles, the amplitude and the center frequency of the ultrasound wave. The sign of the force may change with the phase difference between the oscillating bubbles. Meanwhile, the magnitude of the force varies over several orders of magnitude, which poses a serious challenge for the usual machine learning models. To overcome this difficulty, the magnitudes and the signs of the force are separated and modelled separately. A nonlinear regression is obtained with a feed-forward network model for the logarithm of the magnitude, whereas the sign is modelled by a support-vector machine model. The principle, the practical aspects related to the training and validation of the machine models are introduced. The predictions from the models are checked against the values computed from the Keller-Miksis equations. The results show that the models are extremely efficient while providing accurate estimate of the force. The models make it computationally feasible for the future simulations of the bubble clusters to include the effects of the secondary Bjerknes force. Graphic abstract

CL Houston, TX
AB Superblock compilation techniques such as control flow graph (CFG) or trace compilation have become a widely adopted approach to increase the performance of dynamically compiling virtual machines even further. While this was shown to be successful for many conventional virtual machines, it did not result in a higher performance for Java-based DBT1 machine emulators so far. These emulators dynamically translate application binaries of a target machine into Java bytecode, which is then eventually compiled into the native code of the emulating host by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Successful superblock compilation techniques for this class of emulators must consider the special requirements that result from the two-stage translation as well as the characteristics of the JVM, such as the inability of most Java JIT compilers to handle large bytecode methods efficiently.
   In this paper, we present a superblock compilation approach for a Java-based DBT machine emulator that generates a performance increase of up to 90 percent and of 32 percent on average. The key idea of our design is to provide a large scope over the control flow of target applications across basic block boundaries for the JVM, while still keeping small bytecode methods for the execution units.
   In addition, we also present two further optimizations - interpreter context elimination and program counter elimination - which increase the emulation performance by 16 percent again. In total, the optimization techniques discussed in this paper provide an average performance gain of 48 percent for the surveyed emulator.

AB This paper adopts the algorithm of the deep neural network to conduct in-depth research and analysis on the factors associated with the improvement of English translation ability. This study focuses on text complexity, adding discourse complexity features in addition to focusing on lexical and syntactic dimensions, exploring the application of neural network algorithm in the construction of text complexity grading model based on feature optimization, and examining the performance and generalization ability of the model. The rationality of the grading of the material is verified. After determining the model input features and training corpus, different classification algorithms were used to build the models and compare their performance. Meanwhile, compared with the models constructed based on common traditional readability formulas and other single-dimensional features, the models constructed based on the feature set of this study have significant advantages, with 20 to 30 percentage points higher in each performance evaluation index. The pseudo-parallel corpus is constructed, back translation is performed after obtaining the pseudo-parallel corpus, and finally, the data migration effect is measured and recorded on the low-resource Chinese-English parallel corpus and Tibetan-Chinese parallel corpus, and the cycle continues until the model performance is no longer improved. The low-resource neural machine translation model based on model migration learning improved 3.97 and 2.64 BLEU values in the low-resource English translation task, respectively, and reduced the training time; based on this, the data migration learning method further improved 2.26 and 2.52 BLEU values.

The structure of these models allows for high dimensional inputs while retaining expressibility, as is the case with convolutional neural networks. We present applications of graph convolutional Gaussian processes to images and triangular meshes, demonstrating their versatility and effectiveness, comparing favorably to existing methods, despite being relatively simple models.

AB We present a trusted source translator that transforms total functions defined in the specification language of the HOL theorem prover to simple intermediate code. This translator eliminates polymorphism by code specification, removes higher-order functions through closure conversion, interprets pattern matching as conditional expressions, etc. The target intermediate language can be further translated by proof to a simple imperative language. Each transformation is proven to be correct automatically. The formalization, implementation and mechanical verification of all transformations are done in HOL-4.

AB The paper presents a generic approach to the supervised sentiment analysis of social media content in foreign languages. The method proposes translating documents from the original language to English with Google's Neural Translation Model. The resulted texts are then converted to vectors by averaging the vectorial representation of words derived from a pretrained Word2Vec English model. Testing the approach with several machine learning methods on Polish, Slovenian and Croatian Twitter corpora returns up to 86 % of classification accuracy on the out-of-sample data.

Before resolution of ambiguities, their identification is an essential task. This research paper is about the classification and identification of syntactic ambiguities in Pashto text. Here, the identification is based on the parse trees build by the parser for the ambiguous phrases. An algorithm is proposed which correctly identifies syntactic ambiguities with a success rate of 64.3%.

In this paper, low order Hu moments and other four shape features are combined together to classify different kinds of knives and guns with the support vector machine in the application of millimeter wave security imaging. Experimental results show that the combined features have better invariance and differences than other invariant moments.

AB More and more modern processors have been supporting non-contiguous SIMD data accesses. However, translating such instructions has been overlooked in the Dynamic Binary Translation (DBT) area. For example, in the popular QEMU dynamic binary translator, guest memory instructions with strides are emulated by a sequence of scalar instructions, leaving a significant room for performance improvement when the host machines have SIMD instructions available. Structured loads/stores, such as VLDn/VSTn in ARM NEON, are one type of strided SIMD data access instructions. They are widely used in signal processing, multimedia, mathematical and 2D matrix transposition applications. Efficient translation of such structured loads/stores is a critical issue when migrating ARM executables to other ISAs. However, it is quite challenging since not only the translation of structured loads/stores is not trivial, but also the difference between guest and host register configurations must be taken into consideration. In this work, we present the design and implementation of translating structured loads/stores in DBT, including target code generation as well as efficient SIMD register mapping. Our proposed register mapping mechanisms are not limited to handling structured loads/stores, they can be extended to deal with normal SIMD instructions. On a set of OpenCV benchmarks, our QEMU-based system has achieved a maximum speedup of 5.41x, with an average improvement of 2.93x. On a set of BLAS benchmarks, our system has also obtained a maximum speedup of 2.19x and an average improvement of 1.63x.

In this paper a computational approach for resolving these pronouns is proposed and an algorithm is developed. This algorithm is the combination of two sub-algorithms that resolves these pronouns. The algorithm has been tested on real world text taken from novels and stories which showed 78% accuracy.

Given sentence-aligned bitext, it cannot only use bilingual word alignment's information to guide resolving word segmentation ambiguities, but also avoid the errors of word segmentation from being transferred into word alignment. Experimental result shows that it distinctly improves accuracy of both word segmentation and alignment.

AB Software developers often make use of the 'online forums such as StackOverflow (SO) to learn how to use software libraries and their APIs. However, the code snippets in such a forum often contain undeclared, ambiguous, or largely unqualified external references. Such declaration ambiguity and external reference ambiguity present challenges for developers in learning to correctly use the APIs. In this paper, we propose STATTYPE, a statistical approach to resolve the fully qualified names (FQNs) for the API elements in such code snippets. Unlike existing approaches that are based on heuristics, STATTYPE has two well-integrated factors. We first learn from a large training code corpus the FQNs that often co-occur. Then, to derive the FQN for an API name in a code snippet, we use that knowledge and also leverage the context consisting of neighboring API names. To realize those factors, we treat the problem as statistical machine translation from source code with partially qualified names to source code with FQNs of the APIs. Our empirical evaluation on real-world code and StackOverflow posts shows that STATTYPE achieves very high accuracy with 97.6% precision and 96.7% recall, which is 16.5% relatively higher than the state-of-the-art approach.

TI Interpolating bit-vector formulas using uninterpreted predicates and
   Presburger arithmetic
SO FORMAL METHODS IN SYSTEM DESIGN
AB The inference of program invariants over machine arithmetic, commonly called bit-vector arithmetic, is an important problem in verification. Techniques that have been successful for unbounded arithmetic, in particular Craig interpolation, have turned out to be difficult to generalise to machine arithmetic: existing bit-vector interpolation approaches are based either on eager translation from bit-vectors to unbounded arithmetic, resulting in complicated constraints that are hard to solve and interpolate, or on bit-blasting to propositional logic, in the process losing all arithmetic structure. We present a new approach to bit-vector interpolation, as well as bit-vector quantifier elimination (QE), that works by lazy translation of bit-vector constraints to unbounded arithmetic. Laziness enables us to fully utilise the information available during proof search (implied by decisions and propagation) in the encoding, and this way produce constraints that can be handled relatively easily by existing interpolation and QE procedures for Presburger arithmetic. The lazy encoding is complemented with a set of native proof rules for bit-vector equations and non-linear (polynomial) constraints, this way minimising the number of cases a solver has to consider. We also incorporate a method for handling concatenations and extractions of bit-vector efficiently.

From machine translation and speech technology, machine learning tools are now also in use for spellchecking and grammar checking, with a blurry distinction between the two. We unmask the myth of effortless big data by illuminating the efforts and time that lay behind building a multi-purpose corpus with regard to collecting, marking up and building from scratch. We also discuss what kind of language technology tools minority language communities actually need, and to what extent the dominating paradigm has been able to deliver these tools. In this context we present our alternative to corpus-based language technology - knowledge-based language technology - and we show how this approach can provide language technology solutions for languages being outside the reach of machine learning procedures. We present a stable and mature infrastructure (GiellaLT) containing more than hundred languages and building a number of language technology tools that are useful for language communities.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) opens new perspectives for the Machine-To-Machine communications, as it brings to settings with a large and heterogeneous set of devices. This makes integration of such diverse technologies a challenging task. A typical solution to this problem is represented by universal gateways, which provide internal semantics for protocol translation. However such approach is bound to be challenged in future IoT scenarios, as it brings substantial performance impairments in settings with very large number of devices and of technologies. We address these limitations, by proposing two novel approaches. A first is based on distributing the management of the different technologies among gateways. A second approach makes use of Web Service delegation, with gateways acting only as a connecting point between the entities and some service that can interpret the information exchanged. We implement and validate experimentally these approaches, showing that they both scale sensibly better than the traditional approach, guaranteeing acceptable performance even with a high degree of heterogeneity. Moreover, we identify the criteria which should be considered when choosing between the two proposed approaches. Our results establish a set of guidelines for integration in large and heterogeneous IoT scenarios.

Here we demonstrate mathematically that many less well understood, larger-scale features of ribosomes-such as why a few ribosomal RNA molecules dominate the mass and why the ribosomal protein content is divided into 55-80 small, similarly sized segments-speed up their autocatalytic production.

AB Automated methods for identifying whether sentences are grammatical have various potential applications (e.g., machine translation, automated essay scoring, computer-assisted language learning). In this work, we construct a statistical model of grammaticality using various linguistic features (e.g., misspelling counts, parser outputs, n-gram language model scores). We also present a new publicly available dataset of learner sentences judged for grammaticality on an ordinal scale. In evaluations, we compare our system to the one from Post (2011) and find that our approach yields state-of-the-art performance.

Based on this corpus, we develop a Chinese sentence compression system and study various measures for evaluation of Chinese sentence compression. We find that 1) using multi-references is very helpful for automatic evaluation in Chinese sentence compression; and 2) besides relational F1, some machine translation evaluation measures are correlated well with human judgments and thus are very promising for future use in this task.

The method is independent of stroke-order, -number, and -direction, as well as invariant to scaling, translation, rotation and reflection of symbols. Zernike moment descriptors are used to represent symbols and three different classification techniques are compared: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Minimum Mean Distance (MMD), and Nearest Neighbor (NN). We have obtained a 97% recognition accuracy rate on a dataset consisting of 7,410 sketched symbols using Zernike moment features and a SVM classifier.

AB Although the proper use of idioms can enhance the elegance of writing, the active use of various expressions is a challenge because remembering idioms is difficult. In this study, we address the problem of idiom recommendation by leveraging a neural machine translation framework, in which we suppose that idioms are written in one pseudo target language. Two types of real-life datasets are collected to support this study. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves promising performance compared with other baseline methods.

The programming interface consists of a restricted subset of the object-oriented language C++.  The user formulates parallelism explicitly at the abstract level of objects and method invocations within a single C++ program.  The translator algorithm first generates a machine-independent communication graph and proceeds with the creation of the parallel programs.

AB Reversible post-translational modification (PTM) plays an important role in increasing the functional diversity of proteins and has a significant influence on the regulation of protein function in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. PTM acts as an important molecular regulatory mechanism used to regulate various cellular processes. Nevertheless, the most studied PTMs can mainly be named after protein types with phosphorylation and important roles in many biological processes. Disturbances in this modification can be caused by a variety of diseases, including neurological disorders and cancer. It is therefore necessary to predict the phosphorylation of target residues in uncharacterized amino acid sequences. Most experimental techniques for predicting phosphorylation are time-consuming, expensive, and errorprone. Various calculation methods have emerged. A very effective and recently developed machine learning method. In general, these methods fall into two categories: conventional machine learning methods and deep learning methods. We have given an overview of both. This review summarizes the research progress in this area. We hope the review could provide important guide for further computational study on protein phosphorylation sites.

AB Machine tool structures contain a number of joints which provide for rotation or translation of connected structural elements. These joints add significant nonlinearity to the system thus making overall performance difficult to predict. Linear guides have been identified as a particular connection which exhibit significant nonlinearity. Linear guides are thus very difficult to accurately model into a dynamic simulation. Linear guideways have predominantly replaced box ways in industrial machinery to facilitate linear directional motion. As opposed to box ways which are scraped to obtain the most contact area possible, linear guides depend on theoretical contact patches between the guide, rail, and rolling element train. Linear guides exhibit complicated dynamics, the accurate prediction of which is necessary for a high-fidelity model of a machine tool. A fixture was developed to study linear guides. This paper highlights some of the properties of linear guides and begins the process of creating a model by studying the form of the nonlinearity using the Acceleration Surface Method (ASM). Future work will involve the comparison of the derived model against other popular linear guide models and the parameterization of the model found here.

TI Rapid Measurement and Identification Method for the Geometric Errors of
   CNC Machine Tools
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Error compensation technology offers a significant means for improving the geometric accuracy of CNC machine tools (MTs) as well as extending their service life. Measurement and identification are important prerequisites for error compensation. In this study, a measurement system, mainly composed of a self-developed micro-angle sensor and an L-shape standard piece, is proposed. Meanwhile, a stepwise identification method, based on an integrated error model, is established. In one measurement, four degrees-of-freedom errors, including two-dimensional displacement and two-dimensional angle of a linear guideway, can be obtained. Furthermore, in accordance with the stepwise identification method, the L-shape standard piece is placed in three different planes, so that the measurement and identification of all 21 geometric errors can be implemented. An experiment is carried out on a coordinate measuring machine (CMM) to verify the system. The residual error of the angle error, translation error and squareness error are 1.5 '', 2 mu m and 3.37 '', respectively, and these are compared to the values detected by a Renishaw laser interferometer.

Designs are translated into finite state machines which are optimized and then verified by symbolic model checking. To express requirement specifications the visual formalism of symbolic timing diagrams is used. Their semantics is given by translation into temporal logic. If the model checker generates a counterexample, it is retranslated into either a symbolic timing diagram or a stimulus for the STATEMATE simulator.

AB [Context:] Model-based testing is an instrument for automated generation of test cases. It requires identifying requirements in documents, understanding them syntactically and semantically, and then translating them into a test model. One light-weight language for these test models are Cause-Effect-Graphs (CEG) that can be used to derive test cases. [Problem:] The creation of test models is laborious and we lack an automated solution that covers the entire process from requirement detection to test model creation. In addition, the majority of requirements is expressed in natural language (NL), which is hard to translate to test models automatically. [Principal Idea:] We build on the fact that not all NL requirements are equally unstructured. We found that 14% of the lines in requirements documents of our industry partner contain "pseudo-code"-like descriptions of business rules. We apply Machine Learning to identify such semi-structured requirements descriptions and propose a rule-based approach for their translation into CEGs. [Contribution:] We make three contributions: (1) an algorithm for the automatic detection of semi-structured requirements descriptions in documents, (2) an algorithm for the automatic translation of the identified requirements into a CEG and (3) a study demonstrating that our proposed solution leads to 86% time savings for test model creation without loss of quality.

AB Noun plays important role in construction of sentence, acts as subject. Through study of noun from computational linguistics point of view is important. We describe here an exhaustive version of the morphological analyzer tool for nouns using FST. Morphological analyzer/generator are designed to interface with a knowledge-based machine translation(MT) system. Our system uses a hierarchy (tree) structure to relate various morphological features. The system reads the input and pushes it through the hierarchical structure, containing the feature structure and, if the match is successful, applies operators to the string to analyze a transformed string. The non-concatenative morphology typical of Dravidian language has spurred the development of sophisticated formalisms and computational engines. In this paper we show how the relatively straightforward formalism used can be extended in simple ways to produce an elegant treatment of Kannada morphology that captures the inflectional regularities as well as derivational regularities of the language. Morphological analyzer/generator for morphologically complex and agglutinative language like Kannada is highly challenging. The major types of morphological process like inflection, derivation, and compounding are handled in this system. A robust analyzer is useful for language learning as well as for machine translation applications. The tool is tested against 3500 words and has 92% recognition success rate.

TI XEPA - Autonomous Intelligent Light and Sound Sculptures That Improvise
   Group Performances
SO LEONARDO
AB XEPA anticipates a future where machines form their own societies. Going beyond mere generative art, machines will exhibit artistic creativity with the addition of artistic judgment via computational aesthetic evaluation. In such a future our notions of aesthetics will undergo a radical translation. The XEPA intelligent sculptures create animated light and sound sequences. Each sculpture "watches" the others and modifies its own aesthetic behavior to create a collaborative, improvisational performance. No coordination information or commands are used. Each XEPA independently evaluates the aesthetics of the other sculptures, infers a theme or mood being attempted, and then modifies its own aesthetics to better reinforce that theme. Each performance is unique and widely varied. XEPA is an ever-evolving artwork, intended as a platform for ongoing experiments in computational aesthetic evaluation.

TI FINDING SMALL ROTATIONS AND TRANSLATIONS IN IMPERFECT PART AND DIE
   MODELS
SO JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS
AB Automatic verification of part and die models can be hampered by the presence of rigid-motion deviations of a model from its baseline coordinates, in addition to imperfections in the model. A coordinate measuring machine (CMM) searches for a physical point in a specified neighborhood. If it finds a point at the location where nominal data indicates a point, the model is verified at that point; otherwise, a measured deviation is given. One problem is that the physical point on the model whose coordinates are measured may not be the same as the prescribed point whose coordinates are given in nominal data. This report includes a procedure for detecting rigid-motion deviations from nominal in a model-verification environment.

We give a detailed description of algorithms for application of cascades of weighted tree transducers to weighted tree acceptors, connecting formal theory with actual practice. Additionally, we present novel on-the-fly variants of these algorithms, and compare their performance on a syntax machine translation cascade based on (Yamada and Knight, 2001).

AB Word Error Rate is a standard measure of quality for different tasks such as Speech Recognition, OCR or Machine Translation. As such, it is important to compute it together with confidence intervals. Previous works in the literature employ Monte Carlo methods in order to compute those intervals. We show how to compute them without simulations. We also adapt a method that compares two systems over the same test data so that it can be used without simulations.

CHP semantics, initially given in terms of Petri Nets, are reformulated as labeled transition systems. Circuit specifications are translated into an intermediate format (IF) based on communicating extended finite state machines. They are then validated using the IF environment, which provides model checking and bi-simulation tools. The direct translation must be optimized to delay state explosion. Performance studies are reported.

AB This paper proposes an effective incremental parsing method for such interactive natural language processing systems as real-time dialogue systems, simultaneous machine interpreting systems, etc. This method produces the analysis of the input while it is being received. It can efficiently deal with not only the normal input, which is piecemeal addition to the input from left to right, but also such changes of the input as insertion and deletion. For such changes of the input, this method exploits the parts of the previous analyses. We implemented this method on the workstation and made a experiment. We have confirmed that the method can be expected to be useful for an on-line language processing system.

AB The UML dynamic model is described using notions like state, event or active object that current object-oriented languages don't support. When the implementation is not done using a state machine interpreter, these notions had to he translated into the target language. This work aims to study how to translate as automatically as possible UML stare diagrams into current object-oriented languages (OOLs), distinguishing sequential and concurrent execution. This translation requires to map UML notions onto OOLs ones, to adapt the abstract state machine, and to add information to state diagrams. Behavior inheritance is a key problem, and both theoretical and practical solutions are examined to ensure behavior substitutability. Then, two main ways for stale representation are compared from the inheritance point of view, and automatic code generation is discussed.

SO BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY-COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE AND NEUROIMAGING
AB Combining advanced neuroimaging with novel computational methods in network science and machine learning has led to increasingly meaningful descriptions of structure and function in both the normal and the abnormal brain, thereby contributing significantly to our understanding of psychiatric disorders as circuit dysfunctions. Despite its marked potential for psychiatric care, this approach has not yet extended beyond the research setting to any clinically useful applications. Here we review current developments in the study of neuroimaging data using network models and machine learning methods, with a focus on their promise in offering a framework for clinical translation. We discuss 3 potential contributions of these methods to psychiatric care: 1) a better understanding of psychopathology beyond current diagnostic boundaries; 2) individualized prediction of treatment response and prognosis; and 3) formal theories to guide the development of novel interventions. Finally, we highlight current obstacles and sketch a forward-looking perspective of how the application of machine learning and network modeling methods should proceed to accelerate their potential transformation of clinically useful tools.

AB In recent years, with the increasing usage of digital media and advancements in deep learning architectures, most of the paper-based documents have been revolutionized into digital versions. These advancements have helped state-of-the-art information extraction and digital mailroom technologies become progressively efficient. Even though many efficient post-Information Extraction (IE) error rectification methods have been introduced in the recent past to improve the quality of digitized documents. They are still imperfect and they demand improvements in the area of context-based error correction, specifically when we are dealing with the documents involving sensitive information such as invoices. This paper describes a self-correction approach based on the sequence to sequence Neural Machine Translation (NMT) as applied to rectify the incorrectness in the results of any information extraction approach such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR). We accomplished this approach by exploiting the concepts of sequence learning with the help of feedback provided during each cycle of training. Finally, we have compared state-of-the-art post-OCR error correction methods with our feedback learning approach. Our empirical results have outperformed state-of-the-art post-OCR error correction methods.

AB Automatic post-editing (APE) can be reduced to a machine translation (MT) task, where the source is the output of a specific MT system and the target is its post-edited variant. However, this approach does not consider context information that can be found in the original source of the MT system. Thus a better approach is to employ multi-source MT, where two input sequences are considered - the original source and the MT output.
   Extra context information can be introduced in the form of extra tokens that identify certain global properties of a group of segments, added as a prefix or a suffix to each segment. Successfully applied in domain adaptation of MT as well as on APE, this technique deserves further attention. In this work we investigate multi-source neural APE (or NPE) systems with training data which has been augmented with two types of extra context tokens. We experiment with authentic and synthetic data provided by WMT 2019 and submit our results to the APE shared task. We also experiment with using statistical machine translation (SMT) methods for APE. While our systems score bellow the baseline, we consider this work a step towards understanding the added value of extra context in the case of APE.

AB Text-to-voice conversion is the core technology of intelligent translation system and intelligent teaching system, which is of great significance to English teaching and expansion. However, there are certain problems with the characteristics of factors in the current text-to- voice conversion. In order to improve the efficiency of text-to- voice conversion, this study improves the traditional machine learning algorithm and proposes an improved model that combines statistical language, factor analysis, and support vector machines. Moreover, the model is constructed as a training module and a testing module. The model combines statistical methods and rule methods in a unified framework to make full use of English language features to achieve automatic conversion of letter strings and phonetic features. In addition, in order to meet the needs of English text-to- voice conversion, this study builds a framework model, this study analyzes the performance of the model, and designs a control experiment to compare the performance of the model. The research results show that the method proposed in this paper has a certain effect.

TI Scale-, Shift-, and Rotation-Invariant Diffractive Optical Networks
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Recent research efforts in optical computing have gravitated toward developing optical neural networks that aim to benefit from the processing speed and parallelism of optics/photonics in machine learning applications. Among these endeavors, Diffractive Deep Neural Networks (D(2)NNs) harness light-matter interaction over a series of trainable surfaces, designed using deep learning, to compute a desired statistical inference task as the light waves propagate from the input plane to the output field-of-view. Although earlier studies have demonstrated the generalization capability of diffractive optical networks to unseen data, achieving, e.g., >98% image classification accuracy for handwritten digits, these previous designs are in general sensitive to the spatial scaling, translation, and rotation of the input objects. Here, we demonstrate a new training strategy for diffractive networks that introduces input object translation, rotation, and/or scaling during the training phase as uniformly distributed random variables to build resilience in their blind inference performance against such object transformations. This training strategy successfully guides the evolution of the diffractive optical network design toward a solution that is scale-, shift-, and rotation-invariant, which is especially important and useful for dynamic machine vision applications in, e.g., autonomous cars, in vivo imaging of biomedical specimen, among others.

TI Annotating a Low-Resource Language with LLOD Technology: Sumerian

SO INFORMATION
AB This paper describes work on the morphological and syntactic annotation of Sumerian cuneiform as a model for low resource languages in general. Cuneiform texts are invaluable sources for the study of history, languages, economy, and cultures of Ancient Mesopotamia and its surrounding regions. Assyriology, the discipline dedicated to their study, has vast research potential, but lacks the modern means for computational processing and analysis. Our project, Machine Translation and Automated Analysis of Cuneiform Languages, aims to fill this gap by bringing together corpus data, lexical data, linguistic annotations and object metadata. The project's main goal is to build a pipeline for machine translation and annotation of Sumerian Ur III administrative texts. The rich and structured data is then to be made accessible in the form of (Linguistic) Linked Open Data (LLOD), which should open them to a larger research community. Our contribution is two-fold: in terms of language technology, our work represents the first attempt to develop an integrative infrastructure for the annotation of morphology and syntax on the basis of RDF technologies and LLOD resources. With respect to Assyriology, we work towards producing the first syntactically annotated corpus of Sumerian.

The availability of large resources and the development of statistical machine learning methods have increased the studies in the field of SRL. One of the widely-used semantic resources applied for multiple languages is PropBank. In this paper, PropBanks applied for Turkish are compared by checking semantic roles in the frame files of matched verb senses. As this integrated lexical resource for Turkish is aimed to be used in a multilingual resource along with English, creation of an inclusive lexical resource for Turkish is of great importance.

AB Some natural language processing systems, e.g. machine translation, require to have a knowledge base with conceptual representations reflecting the structure of human beings' cognitive system. In some other systems, e.g. automatic indexing or information extraction, surface semantics could be sufficient, but the construction of a robust knowledge base guarantees its use in most natural language processing tasks, consolidating thus the concept of resource reuse. This paper describes how meaning postulates can be built through FunGramKB, resulting in a knowledge base which provides deep semantics.

AB This paper presents the architecture and operation of a PC-based software program (Six-In) that allows a standard QWERTY keyboard to be used as a Braille keyboard translating the (contracted) Braille to text. It is aimed at people learning Braille and users who prefer to use a Braille rather than a QWERTY keyboard. The system is multilingual (if appropriate Braille-to-text translation tables are constructed for a language). The system works on most PCs, but fails on machines that do not support multiple key rollover.

We present a method for using part of speech tag information to improve alignment accuracy, and an approach to modeling fertility and correspondence to the empty word in an HMM alignment model. We present accuracy results from evaluating Viterbi alignments against human-judged alignments on the Canadian Hansards corpus, as compared to a bigram HMM, and IBM model 4. The results show up to 16% alignment error reduction.

TI BARTSCORE: Evaluating Generated Text as Text Generation

AB A wide variety of NLP applications, such as machine translation, summarization, and dialog, involve text generation. One major challenge for these applications is how to evaluate whether such generated texts are actually fluent, accurate, or effective. In this work, we conceptualize the evaluation of generated text as a text generation problem, modeled using pre-trained sequence-to-sequence models. The general idea is that models trained to convert the generated text to/from a reference output or the source text will achieve higher scores when the generated text is better. We operationalize this idea using BART [32], an encoder-decoder based pre-trained model, and propose a metric BARTSCORE with a number of variants that can be flexibly applied in an unsupervised fashion to evaluation of text from different perspectives (e.g. informativeness, fluency, or factuality). BARTSCORE is conceptually simple and empirically effective. It can outperform existing top-scoring metrics in 16 of 22 test settings, covering evaluation of 16 datasets (e.g., machine translation, text summarization) and 7 different perspectives (e.g., informativeness, factuality). Code to calculate BARTScore is available at https://github.com/neulab/BARTScore, and we have released an interactive leaderboard for meta-evaluation at http: //explainaboard.nlpedia.ai/leaderboard/task- meval/ on the EXPLAINABOARD platform [38], which allows us to interactively understand the strengths, weaknesses, and complementarity of each metric.

AB Highly sophisticated methods for detection and classification of signals and images are available. However, most of these methods are not robust to nonstationary variations such as imposed by Doppler effects or other forms of warping. Fourier methods handle time-shift or frequency shift variations in signals or spatial shifts in images. A number of methods have been developed to overcome these problems. In this paper we discuss some specific approaches that have been motivated by time-frequency analysis. Methodologies developed for images can often be profitably used for fime-frequency analysis as well, since these representations are essentially images. The scale transform introduced by Cohen can join Fourier transforms in providing robust representations. Scale changes are common in many signal and image scenarios. We call the representation which results from appropriate transformations of the object of interest the Scale and Translation Invariant Representation or STIR. The STIR method is summarized and results from machine diagnosis, radar, marine mammal sounds, TMJ sounds, speech and word spotting are discussed. Some of the limitations and variations of the method are discussed to provide a rationale for selection of particular elements of the method.

TI RPLP1 and RPLP2 Are Essential Flavivirus Host Factors That Promote Early
   Viral Protein Accumulation
SO JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
AB The Flavivirus genus contains several arthropod-borne viruses that pose global health threats, including dengue viruses (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). In order to understand how these viruses replicate in human cells, we previously conducted genome-scale RNA interference screens to identify candidate host factors. In these screens, we identified ribosomal proteins RPLP1 and RPLP2 (RPLP1/2) to be among the most crucial putative host factors required for DENV and YFV infection. RPLP1/2 are phosphoproteins that bind the ribosome through interaction with another ribosomal protein, RPLP0, to form a structure termed the ribosomal stalk. RPLP1/2 were validated as essential host factors for DENV, YFV, and ZIKV infection in two human cell lines: A549 lung adenocarcinoma and HuH-7 hepatoma cells, and for productive DENV infection of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Depletion of RPLP1/2 caused moderate cell-line-specific effects on global protein synthesis, as determined by metabolic labeling. In A549 cells, global translation was increased, while in HuH-7 cells it was reduced, albeit both of these effects were modest. In contrast, RPLP1/2 knockdown strongly reduced early DENV protein accumulation, suggesting a requirement for RPLP1/2 in viral translation. Furthermore, knockdown of RPLP1/2 reduced levels of DENV structural proteins expressed from an exogenous transgene. We postulate that these ribosomal proteins are required for efficient translation elongation through the viral open reading frame. In summary, this work identifies RPLP1/2 as critical flaviviral host factors required for translation.
   IMPORTANCE Flaviviruses cause important diseases in humans. Examples of mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses include dengue, yellow fever and Zika viruses. Viruses require a plethora of cellular factors to infect cells, and the ribosome plays an essential role in all viral infections. The ribosome is a complex macromolecular machine composed of RNA and proteins and it is responsible for protein synthesis. We identified two specific ribosomal proteins that are strictly required for flavivirus infection of human cells and mosquitoes: RPLP1 and RPLP2 (RPLP1/2). These proteins are part of a structure known as the ribosomal stalk and help orchestrate the elongation phase of translation. We show that flaviviruses are particularly dependent on the function of RPLP1/2. Our findings suggest that ribosome composition is an important factor for virus translation and may represent a regulatory layer for translation of specific cellular mRNAs.

TI Machine learning approaches to optimize small-molecule inhibitors for
   RNA targeting
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS
AB In the era of data science, data-driven algorithms have emerged as powerful platforms that can consolidate bioisosteric rules for preferential modifications on small molecules with a common molecular scaffold. Here we present complementary data-driven algorithms to minimize the search in chemical space for phenylthiazole-containing molecules that bind the RNA hairpin within the ribosomal peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Our results indicate visual, geometrical, and chemical features that enhance the binding to the targeted RNA. Functional validation was conducted after synthesizing 10 small molecules pinpointed computationally. Four of the 10 were found to be potent inhibitors that target hairpin 91 in the ribosomal PTC of M. tuberculosis and, as a result, stop translation.

AB As computers have become efficient at understanding visual information and transforming it into a written representation, research interest in tasks like automatic image captioning has seen a significant leap over the last few years. While most of the research attention is given to the English language in a monolingual setting, resource-constrained languages like Bangla remain out of focus, predominantly due to a lack of standard datasets. Addressing this issue, we present a new dataset BAN-Cap following the widely used Flickr8k dataset, where we collect Bangla captions of the images provided by qualified annotators. Our dataset represents a wider variety of image caption styles annotated by trained people from different backgrounds. We present a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the dataset and the baseline evaluation of the recent models in Bangla image captioning. We investigate the effect of text augmentation and demonstrate that an adaptive attention-based model combined with text augmentation using Contextualized Word Replacement (CWR) outperforms all state-of-the-art models for Bangla image captioning. We also present this dataset's multipurpose nature, especially on machine translation for Bangla-English and English-Bangla. This dataset and all the models will be useful for further research.

TI Phonology-Augmented Statistical Framework for Machine Transliteration
   Using Limited Linguistic Resources
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Transliteration converts words in a source language (e.g., English) into words in a target language (e.g., Vietnamese). This conversion considers the phonological structure of the target language, as the transliterated output needs to be pronounceable in the target language. For example, a word in Vietnamese that begins with a consonant cluster is phonologically invalid and thus would be an incorrect output of a transliteration system. Most statistical transliteration approaches, albeit being widely adopted, do not explicitly model the target language's phonology, which often results in invalid outputs. The problem is compounded by the limited linguistic resources available when converting foreign words to transliterated words in the target language. In this paper, we present a phonology-augmented statistical framework suitable for transliteration, especially when only limited linguistic resources are available. We propose the concept of pseudo-syllables as structures representing how segments of a foreign word are organized according to the syllables of the target language's phonology. We performed transliteration experiments on Vietnamese and Cantonese. We show that the proposed framework outperforms the statistical baseline by up to 44.68% relative, when there are limited training examples (587 entries).

AB An analysis of possible associations between speech recognition performance and three cognitive states that arise in dialogues mediated by a speech-to-speech machine translation system is reported. This analysis is based on a new corpus of inter lingual interactions in a map task which includes precisely synchronised speech, video, and physiological data streams (blood volume pulse, skin conductance, electroencephalogram, and eye movements). While no evidence is found that cognitive states occurring prior to utterances sent to the speech recogniser affect the speech recognition performance, the onset of cognitive states especially frustration is found to be clearly associated with speech recognition performance. Given this association, methods for automatic detection of these cognitive states were explored by using features of the two physiological signals, features of the speech signal, and combinations of speech and physiological features. Combined biosignals yields detection performance well above the baseline (71% accuracy) when the time window is restricted to the perceived duration of the state. Extending the window to the end of the utterance following the cognitive state yields poor detection on biosignals alone, but improves considerably when features of the speech signal are added, thus showing the potential usefulness of speech features as a biosignal.
