AB Bilingual models that capture the semantics of sentences are typically only evaluated on cross-lingual transfer tasks such as cross-lingual document categorization or machine translation. In this work, we evaluate the quality of the monolingual representations learned with a variant of the bilingual compositional model of Hermann and Blunsom (2014), when viewing translations in a second language as a semantic annotation as the original language text. We show that compositional objectives based on phrase translation pairs outperform compositional objectives based on bilingual sentences and on monolingual paraphrases.

TI A Comparative Study on the Effort of Human Translation and Post-Editing
   in Relation to Text Types: An Eye-Tracking and Key-Logging Experiment
SO SAGE OPEN
AB With the increasing utilization of Machine Translation, it is worth exploring in what areas it actually reduces translators' effort. This study focuses on the English-Chinese language pair and compares the effort of human translation (HT) and that of post-editing (PE) in relation to text types, covering advertising, news, legal, and literary texts, via an eye-tracking and key-logging experiment and a follow-up questionnaire survey. It refers to Krings' framework and explores effort in terms of temporal, cognitive, and technical dimensions. Data were obtained from 33 Chinese student translators, and data analyses lead to the following conclusions. First, PE involves less effort than HT, and PE increases productivity and improves translation quality. Second, the tendency that PE involves less effort is seen in the advertising, news, and literary text types, but the measures of effort show variation for the legal text. Third, the objective measures, including Seconds per Target Word, Edits per Target Word, Pause Count per Target Word, Pause Duration per Target Word, Source Fixation Duration per Source Word, and Source Fixation Count per Source Word, are reliable and well correlated with subjective measures.

TI Advances and future challenges in binary translation and optimization
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE
AB Binary translation and optimization have achieved a high profile in recent years with projects such as the IBM DAISY open-source project, Transmeta Crusoe, HP Dynamo, Java JIT compilers such as LaTTe, and many others. Binary, translation has several potential attractions: Architecture can become a layer of software, which allows the implementation of complex legacy architecture(s) through simple hardware and the introduction of novel new architecture and microarchitecture concepts without forcing any soft-ware changes. Secondly, binary translation enables significant software optimizations of the kind that would push the complexity boundaries if done with hardware alone. While still in its early stages, could binary translation offer a new way to design processors, i.e., is it a disruptive technology, the term popularized by Prof. Clayton Christensen? This paper discusses this interesting question, examines some exciting future possibilities for binary translation, and then gives an overview of selected projects (DAISY Crusoe, Dynamo, and LaTTe). One future possibility for binary translation is the Virtual IT Shop. Companies such as Loudcloud currently provide computational resources as sen,ices over the Web, These seri,ices are typically implemented through large and secure server farms. If a variety of customers are to be supported, a variety of architectures (x86, PowerPC, Sparc, etc.) must be present in the fat-in. of necessity, the number of machines from each architecture is statically determined at present, thus limiting utilization and increasing cost. Binary translation offers a possible solution for better utilization: architecture as a layer of software, and hence dynamic configuration of the number of machines from each architecture in such farms. Vie Internet is radically changing the soft-ti,are landscape, and is fostering platform independence and interoperability, with paradigms such as XML, SOAP, and Java. Along the lines of software convergence, recent advances in binary JIT optimizations also present the future possibility of a convergence virtual machine (CVM). CVM is similar to the Jam Virtual Machine (JVM) in that both seek to facilitate a write-once, run-anywhere model of software development. However, the JVM suffers front the drawback that existing C/C++ applications and existing operating Systems do not run on it. CVM aims to address the remaining research challenges in allowing the same standard OS and application object code to run on different hardware platforms, through state-of-the-art JIT compilation and virtual dei,ice emulation.

AB Document-level contextual information has shown benefits to text-based machine translation, but whether and how context helps end-to-end (E2E) speech translation (ST) is still under-studied. We fill this gap through extensive experiments using a simple concatenationbased context-aware ST model, paired with adaptive feature selection on speech encodings for computational efficiency. We investigate several decoding approaches, and introduce inmodel ensemble decoding which jointly performs document- and sentence-level translation using the same model. Our results on the MuST-C benchmark with Transformer demonstrate the effectiveness of context to E2E ST. Compared to sentence-level ST, context-aware ST obtains better translation quality (+0.182.61 BLEU), improves pronoun and homophone translation, shows better robustness to (artificial) audio segmentation errors, and reduces latency and flicker to deliver higher quality for simultaneous translation.1

AB Lysine malonylation is a recently identified post-translation modification type with known effects on type 2 diabetes. Several machine learning algorithms have been used to predict lysine malonylation sites using various features of protein. We proposed a novel spatial feature that captures rich structure information in a succinct form. The dimension of this feature is much lower than that of other sequence and structural features that were used in previous studies. When the proposed feature was used to predict lysine malonylation sites, it achieved performance comparable to other state-of- the-art methods that had much higher dimension. The low dimensionality of the proposed feature would be very helpful for building interpretable predictors for various applications involving protein structures.

The technique is based on constructing a table that maps function address to its name, and generating a search function to search the function name in the table according to its address at the position of indirect call instruction in a procedure. The presented technique has been tested on IA-64 code generated by C compilers. Our tests show that it implemented effectively. The technique was adopted in our static binary translator ITA, which can automatically translate the IA-64 binary code to C programs and compile C programs in the target machine of Alpha architecture. It has the advantage of code running faster in the target machine than using interpreter.

TI TLSPG: Transfer learning-based semi-supervised pseudo-corpus generation
   approach for zero-shot translation
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Machine Translation (MT) has come a long way in recent years, but it still suffers from data scarcity issue due to lack of parallel corpora for low (or sometimes zero) resource languages. However, Transfer Learning (TL) is one of the directions widely used for low-resource machine translation systems to overcome this issue. Creating parallel corpus for such languages is another way of dealing with data scarcity, yet costly, time-consuming and laborious task. In order to avoid the above listed limitations of parallel corpus formation, we present a TL-based Semi-supervised Pseudo-corpus Generation (TLSPG) approach for zero-shot MT systems. It generates the pseudo corpus by exploiting the relatedness between low resource language pairs and zero-resource language pairs via TL approach. It is further empirically ascertained in our experiments that such relatedness helps improve the performance of zero-shot MT systems. Experiments on zero-resource language pairs show that our approach effectively outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models, yielding improvement of +15:56; +8:13; +3:98 and +2 BLEU points for Bhojpuri!Hindi, Magahi!Hindi, Hindi!Bhojpuri and Hindi!Magahi, respectively.

AB Recently recurrent neural networks based encoder-decoder model is a popular approach to sequence to sequence mapping problems, such as machine translation. However, it is time-consuming to train the model since symbols in a sequence can not be processed parallelly by recurrent neural networks because of the temporal dependency restriction. In this paper we present a sequence to sequence model by replacing the recurrent neural networks with feedforward sequential memory networks in both encoder and decoder, which enables the new architecture to encode the entire source sentence simultaneously. We also modify the attention module to make the decoder generate outputs simultaneously during training. We achieve comparable results in WMT'14 English-to-French translation task with 1.4 to 2 times faster during training because of temporal independency in feedforward sequential memory networks based encoder and decoder.

AB Phrase-based statistical models constitute one of the most competitive pattern-recognition approaches to machine translation. In this case, the source sentence is fragmented into phrases, then, each phrase is translated by using a stochastic dictionary. One shortcoming of this phrase-based model is that it does not have an adequate generalization capability. If a sequence of words has not been seen in training, it cannot be translated as a whole phrase. In this paper we try to overcome this drawback. The basic idea is that if a source phrase is not in our dictionary (has not been seen in training), we look for the most similar in our dictionary and try to adapt its translation to the source phrase. We are using the well known edit distance as a measure of similarity. We present results from an English-Spanish task (XRCE).

AB In this paper, we present a modern reformulation of the Dialectica interpretation based on the linearized version of de Paiva. Contrarily to Godel's original translation which translated HA into system T, our presentation applies on untyped lambda-terms and features nicer proof-theoretical properties.
   In the Curry-Howard perspective, we show that the computational behaviour of this translation can be accurately described by the explicit stack manipulation of the Krivine abstract machine, thus giving it a direct-style operational explanation.
   Finally, we give direct evidence that supports the fact our presentation is quite relevant, by showing that we can apply it to the dependently-typed calculus of constructions with universes CC omega almost without any adaptation. This answers the question of the validity of Dialectica-like constructions in a dependent setting.

We confirmed the performance improvement by applying the rejection technique to a dialog speech translation system from Japanese to English. We conducted two kinds of performance evaluation. One is a ranking evaluation of translation output by human evaluators. The other is to measure the machine output against human results by a paired-comparison method. Both of them yield significant improvements.

AB Hardware bytecode translation is a technique to improve the performance of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), especially on the portable devices for which dynamic compilation is infeasible. However, since the translation is done on a single bytecode basis, it is likely to generate frequent memory accesses for local variables which can be a performance bottleneck.
   In this paper, we propose to add a small register file to the datapath of the hardware-translation based JVM and use it as a local variable cache. We evaluate the effectiveness of the local variable cache against the size of the local variable cache which determines the chip area overhead and the operating speed. We also discuss the mechanisms for the efficient parameter passing and the on-the-fly profiling.
   With two types of exceptions, a 16-entry local variable cache achieved hit ratios of 60 to 98 %. The first type of exceptions is represented by the FFT, which accesses more than 16 local variables. In this case, on-the-fly profiling was effective. The hit ratio of 16-entry cache for the FFT was increased from 44 to 83 %. The second type of exception is represented by the SAXON XSLT processor for which cold misses were significant. The proposed parameter passing mechanism turned 6.4 to 13.3 % of total accesses from miss to hit to the local variable cache.

AB Word alignment is a key task in statistical machine translation (SMT). This paper presents a novel model for this task. In this model, word alignment is considered as a multiobjective optimization problem and solved based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), which is one of the best multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA). There are two advantages of the proposed model based on NSGA-II. First, it could be easily extended through incorporating new objective functions. Secondly, it does not need any hand-aligned word-level alignment data to determine the weight of each objective function.

AB This paper describes the current status of development of an open-source shallow-transfer machine translation (MT) system for the [European] Portuguese <-> Spanish language pair, developed using the OpenTrad Apertium NIT toolbox (www.apertium.org). Apertium uses finite-state transducers for lexical processing, hidden Markov models for part-of-speech tagging, and finite-state-based chunking for structural transfer, and is based on a simple rationale: to produce fast, reasonably intelligible and easily correctable translations between related languages, it suffices to use a MT strategy which uses shallow parsing techniques to refine word-for-word MT. This paper briefly describes the NIT engine, the formats it uses for linguistic data, and the compilers that convert these data into an efficient format used by the engine, and then goes on to describe in more detail the pilot Portuguese <-> Spanish linguistic data.

TI Russian Speech Conversion Algorithm Based on a Parallel Corpus and
   Machine Translation
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
AB The phonetic conversion technology is crucial in the resource construction of Russian phonetic information processing. This paper explains how to build a corpus and the key algorithms that are used, as well as how to design auxiliary translation software and implement the key algorithms. This paper focuses on the "parallel corpus" method of problem solving and the indispensable role of a parallel corpus in Russian learning. This paper examines the foundations, motivations, and methods for using parallel corpora in translation instruction. The main way of using a parallel corpus in the classroom environment is to present data, so that learners can be exposed to a large amount of easily screened bilingual data, and translation skills and specific language item translation can be taught in a concentrated and focused manner. Among them, the creation of a large-scale Russian-Chinese parallel corpus will play an important role not only in improving the translation quality of Russian-Chinese machine translation systems but also in Chinese and Russian teaching as well as other branches of linguistics and translation studies, all of which should be given sufficient attention. This paper proposes the use of automatic speech analysis technology to assist Russian pronunciation learning and designs a Russian word pronunciation learning assistant system with demonstration, scoring, and feedback functions, in response to the shortcomings of pronunciation teaching in Russian teaching in China. It can provide corpus support for gathering a large number of parallel corpora and, in the future, enabling online translation. This system is used for corpus automatic construction, and future corpus automatic construction systems could be built on top of it. The proper application of parallel corpus data will aid in the development of a high-quality autonomous learning and translation teaching environment.

AB To reduce the operational load of virtual-network operation in data centers that contain server virtualization platforms and network switches provided by multiple vendors, it would become the challenge to ease management of configurations which are different among server-virtualization environments. This paper proposes a new data-model translation method to unify data-model among multiple configurations of server-virtualization platforms. As the result of evaluation with 24 virtual machines, data-model translation overhead was less than 10% of the time to acquire virtual-machine configuration, and the network management system took 80.5 s to generate configuration information for the overall system. These results indicate that the proposed method is effective to improve the efficiency of configuration management of virtual networks.

AB Word alignment plays a critical role in statistical machine translation (SMT) and cross-language information retrieval. Until now, most existing methods get the word alignment within the whole range of the sentence length. The alignment quality is unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to word alignment based on multi-grain model (WAMG). We split a parallel sentence pair into blocks in different grain and get the word alignments within each corresponding block. Our approach is able to restrict the search space of word alignment in the relatively accurate local range and reduce the mapping error. The experiments have shown that our approach outperforms the traditional word alignment algorithm relatively by about 12% in AER and improves the performance of Chinese-to-English translation system relatively by about 2.8% in BLEU.

AB While end-to-end neural machine translation (NMT) has made remarkable progress recently, NMT systems only rely on parallel corpora for parameter estimation. Since parallel corpora are usually limited in quantity, quality, and coverage, especially for low-resource languages, it is appealing to exploit monolingual corpora to improve NMT. We propose a semi-supervised approach for training NMT models on the concatenation of labeled (parallel corpora) and unlabeled (monolingual corpora) data. The central idea is to reconstruct the monolingual corpora using an autoencoder, in which the source-to-target and target-to-source translation models serve as the encoder and decoder, respectively. Our approach can not only exploit the monolingual corpora of the target language, but also of the source language. Experiments on the Chinese-English dataset show that our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art SMT and NMT systems.

AB Standard decoders for neural machine translation autoregressively generate a single target token per time step, which slows inference especially for long outputs. While architectural advances such as the Transformer fully parallelize the decoder computations at training time, inference still proceeds sequentially. Recent developments in non- and semi-autoregressive decoding produce multiple tokens per time step independently of the others, which improves inference speed but deteriorates translation quality. In this work, we propose the syntactically supervised Transformer (SynST), which first autoregressively predicts a chunked parse tree before generating all of the target tokens in one shot conditioned on the predicted parse. A series of controlled experiments demonstrates that SynST decodes sentences similar to 5 x faster than the baseline autoregressive Transformer while achieving higher BLEU scores than most competing methods on En-De and En-Fr datasets.

AB Many document-level neural machine translation (NMT) systems have explored the utility of context-aware architecture, usually requiring an increasing number of parameters and computational complexity. However, few attention is paid to the baseline model. In this paper, we research extensively the pros and cons of the standard transformer in document-level translation, and find that the auto-regressive property can simultaneously bring both the advantage of the consistency and the disadvantage of error accumulation. Therefore, we propose a surprisingly simple long-short term masking self-attention on top of the standard transformer to both effectively capture the long-range dependence and reduce the propagation of errors. We examine our approach on the two publicly available document-level datasets. We can achieve a strong result in BLEU and capture discourse phenomena.

SO EVOLUTIONARY INTELLIGENCE
AB The requirements for translation ability are improved to meet the needs of the era of big data. Since translation work involves many fields, and each field examines the different translation abilities of translators, they can adapt to the development of this era only by constantly improving their work abilities. Using the English machine translation system is not only low-cost, and the work quality and efficiency are greatly improved. In this paper, we propose an English translation model based on the LSMT model and the attention mechanism to provide fast and accurate translation. First, we use a set of multiple vectors instead of fixed dimensions to represent source language sequences. Second, in the process of generating the target sequence, by dynamically selecting the background vector, the translation model pays more attention to the parts with high correlation with the source language during the translation process, thereby improving the translation performance of the model. Third, we design a multi-feature fusion method for automatic identification of English translation errors to improve translation quality. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that the translation model proposed in this paper has good performance.

TI Transforming machine translation: a deep learning system reaches news
   translation quality comparable to human professionals
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The quality of human translation was long thought to be unattainable for computer translation systems. In this study, we present a deep-learning system, CUBBITT, which challenges this view. In a context-aware blind evaluation by human judges, CUBBITT significantly outperformed professional-agency English-to-Czech news translation in preserving text meaning (translation adequacy). While human translation is still rated as more fluent, CUBBITT is shown to be substantially more fluent than previous state-of-the-art systems. Moreover, most participants of a Translation Turing test struggle to distinguish CUBBITT translations from human translations. This work approaches the quality of human translation and even surpasses it in adequacy in certain circumstances.This suggests that deep learning may have the potential to replace humans in applications where conservation of meaning is the primary aim. The quality of human language translation has been thought to be unattainable by computer translation systems. Here the authors present CUBBITT, a deep learning system that outperforms professional human translators in retaining text meaning in English-to-Czech news translation, and validate the system on English-French and English-Polish language pairs.

It has mostly been relying on scoring functions for selection and it is typically independent of intended applications such as machine translation. In this paper, we present a novel domain adaptation approach that is directly motivated by the need of translation engine. We first identify interesting phrases by examining phrase translation tables, and then use those phrases as anchors to select useful and relevant sentences from general domain data, with the goal of improving domain coverage or providing additional contextual information. The experimental results on Farsi to English translation in military force protection domain and Chinese to English translation in travel domain show statistical significant gain using the reinforced language models over the baseline.

AB The localization of speech recognition for large-scale spoken dialog systems can be a tremendous exercise. Usually, all involved grammars have to be translated by a language expert, and new data has to be collected, transcribed, and annotated for statistical utterance classifiers resulting in a time-consuming and expensive undertaking. Often though, a vast number of transcribed and annotated utterances exists for the source language. In this paper, we propose to use such data and translate it into the target language using machine translation. The translated utterances and their associated (original) annotations are then used to train statistical grammars for all contexts of the target system. As an example, we localize an English spoken dialog system for Internet troubleshooting to Spanish by translating more than 4 million source utterances without any human intervention. In an application of the localized system to more than 10,000 utterances collected on a similar Spanish Internet troubleshooting system, we show that the overall accuracy was only 5.7% worse than that of the English source system.

TI Machine translation for Arabic dialects (survey)
SO INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT
AB Arabic dialects also called colloquial Arabic or vernaculars are spoken varieties of Standard Arabic. These dialects have mixed form with many variations due to the influence of ancient local tongues and other languages like European ones. Many of these dialects are mutually incomprehensible. Arabic dialects were not written until recently and were used only in a speech form. Nowadays, with the advent of the internet and mobile telephony technologies, these dialects are increasingly used in a written form. Indeed, this kind of communication brought everyday conversations to a written format. This allows Arab people to use their dialects, which are their actual native languages for expressing their opinion on social media, for chatting, texting, etc. This growing use opens new research direction for Arabic natural language processing (NLP). We focus, in this paper, on machine translation in the context of Arabic dialects. We provide a survey of recent research in this area. We report for each study a detailed description of the adopted approach and we give its most relevant contribution. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Second, we leverage these NMT models to produce English translations of Greek text as input for our NLP pipeline, to which we apply a series of pre-processing and triple extraction tasks. Finally, we back-translate the extracted triples to Greek. We conduct an evaluation of both our NMT and OIE methods on benchmark datasets and demonstrate that our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art for the Greek natural language.

AB Shallow-transfer rule is the main component of shallow-transfer machine translation that matches the pattern of source language and then performs required action to translate them into the target language. However, high development cost is required to build it because it needs much of linguistic knowledge. This paper focuses on the process to automatically generate the shallow-transfer rule for Indonesian-to-English that is followed with manual postediting to improve the quality of automatic rule. The result shows that the automatic transfer rule can improve the performance of the word-forword translation. Furthermore, manual postediting process was also shown to increase the quality of automatic transfer rule. According to this result, using automatic approach is an effective way to build shallow-transfer rule at starting point that can be further enhanced by performing rule post-editing.

AB Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of machine learning in solving artificial intelligence (AI) tasks in many domains, including translation, speech, image, etc. Within these domains, AI tasks are usually not independent. As a specific type of relationship, structural duality does exist between many pairs of AI tasks, such as translation from one language to another vs. its opposite direction, speech recognition vs. speech synthetization, image classification vs. image generation, etc. The importance of such duality has been magnified by some recent studies, which revealed that it can boost the learning of two tasks in the dual form. However, there has been little investigation on how to leverage this invaluable relationship into the inference stage of AI tasks. In this paper, we propose a general framework of dual inference which can take advantage of both existing models from two dual tasks, without re-training, to conduct inference for one individual task. Empirical studies on three pairs of specific dual tasks, including machine translation, sentiment analysis, and image processing have illustrated that dual inference can significantly improve the performance of each of individual tasks.

AB Static Single Assignment form is an intermediate representation that uses Phi instructions to merge values at each confluent point of the control flow graph. Phi instructions are not machine instructions and must be renamed back to move instructions when translating out of SSA form. Without a coalescing algorithm, the out of SSA translation generates many move instructions. Leung and George [8] use a SSA form for programs represented as native machine instructions, including the use of machine dedicated registers. For this purpose, they handle renaming constraints thanks to a pinning mechanism. Pinning Phi arguments and their corresponding definition to a common resource is also a very attractive technique for coalescing variables. In this paper, extending this idea, we propose a method to reduce the Phi-related copies during the out of SSA translation, thanks to a pinning-based coalescing algorithm that is aware of renaming constraints. We implemented our algorithm in the STMicro-electronics Linear Assembly Optimizer [5]. Our experiments show interesting results when comparing to the existing approaches of Leung and George [8], Sreedhar et al. [11], and Appel and George for register coalescing [7].

TI Joint morphological-lexical language modeling for processing
   morphologically rich languages with application to dialectal Arabic
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Language modeling for an inflected language such as Arabic poses new challenges for speech recognition and machine translation due to its rich morphology. Rich morphology results in large increases in out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate and poor language model parameter estimation in the absence of large quantities of data. In this study, we present a joint morphological-lexical language model (JMLLM) that takes advantage of Arabic morphology. JMLLM combines morphological segments with the underlying lexical items and additional available information sources with regards to morphological segments and lexical items in a single joint model. Joint representation and modeling of morphological and lexical items reduces the OOV rate and provides smooth probability estimates while keeping the predictive power of whole words. Speech recognition and machine translation experiments in dialectal-Arabic show improvements over word and morpheme based trigram language models. We also show that as the tightness of integration between different information sources increases, both speech recognition and machine translation performances improve.

AB On social networks, the storage, usage, and sharing of users data is usually regulated by privacy policies: natural language terms, in which specific actions are authorised, obliged, or denied, under some contextual conditions. Although guaranteeing degrees of readability and clarity, policies in natural language are not machine readable, thus preventing automatic controls on how the data are actually going to be used and processed by the entities that operate on them. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based approach for automatic translation of privacy statements, from natural language to a controlled natural one, to facilitate machine-readable processing. We provide a prototype implementation of the software-based translation tool, showing its effectiveness on a set of Facebook data policies.

This initial deployment, treated as a global experiment, has become a tremendous success. Through this service, machine translation (MT) technology has been pushed to the forefront of worldwide awareness. Besides growing media coverage, user response during the first five months has been overwhelming. This paper is a study of the user feedback from the MT developer's perspective, addressing such questions as: Who are the users? What are their needs? What is their acceptance of MT? What types of texts are being translated? What suggestions do users offer? Finally, this paper outlines our view on opportunities and challenges, and on how to use this feedback to guide future development priorities.

AB Document alignment is the process of identifying documents that have the same content in different languages. Document alignment is a very useful prerequisite for creating parallel corpora to be used in Machine Translation (MT). Hybrid document alignment techniques are commonly used, where a set of heuristics are used along with an existing MT system. In these systems, first all the target documents are translated into source language using an existing MT system. Candidate pairs are identified using a heuristics such as web domain or published date. Similarity of these candidate pairs is calculated using a similarity calculation algorithm. Heuristics are used either to reduce the candidate pair count or to improve the accuracy of alignment. However, the considered heuristics are dependent on the selected document sources. In this paper, we present a hybrid document alignment system for Sinhala and English, where a set of source -independent heuristics is used on the output of an MT system. In addition, we demonstrate how transliteration between Sinhala and English is exploited to improve the performance of the document alignment process.

AB We present the initial results of our experiments on document alignment for the online news domain. Specifically, as apposed to cross-site comparable news alignment, we focus on the identification of parallel documents from within the same multilingual websites. In such a setting parallel news stories oftentimes turn out to be direct translations of each other with a tendency of sharing common media and displaying proximity in publication date. We leverage this domain-specific property of the data and propose a straightforward yet competitive heuristic that performs on par with a machine learning-based method in terms of precision, and outperforms a widely used bitext extraction system on a range of metrics. Moreover, this heuristic has allowed us to identify comparable documents overlooked by a human annotator.
   Although both rule-and learning-based methods that we present are language independent, we specifically focus on the Russian-Kazakh language pair as the present study is one of the initial steps towards a greater objective of building a corresponding parallel corpus and a machine translation system.

TI Optimizing Instance Selection for Statistical Machine Translation with
   Feature Decay Algorithms
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB We introduce FDA5 for efficient parameterization, optimization, and implementation of feature decay algorithms (FDA), a class of instance selection algorithms that use feature decay. FDA increase the diversity of the selected training set by devaluing features (i.e., n-grams) that have already been included. FDA5 decides which instances to select based on three functions used for initializing and decaying feature values and scaling sentence scores controlled with five parameters. We present optimization techniques that allow FDA5 to adapt these functions to in-domain and out-of-domain translation tasks for different language pairs. In a transductive learning setting, selection of training instances relevant to the test set can improve the final translation quality. In machine translation experiments performed on the 2 million sentence English-German section of the Europarl corpus, we show that a subset of the training set selected by FDA5 can gain up to 3.22 BLEU points compared to a randomly selected subset of the same size, can gain up to 0.41 BLEU points compared to using all of the available training data using only 15% of it, and can reach within 0.5 BLEU points to the full training set result by using only 2.7% of the full training data. FDA5 peaks at around 8M words or 15% of the full training set. In an active learning setting, FDA5 minimizes the human effort by identifying the most informative sentences for translation and FDA gains up to 0.45 BLEU points using 3/5 of the available training data compared to using all of it and 1.12 BLEU points compared to random training set. In translation tasks involving English and Turkish, a morphologically rich language, FDA5 can gain up to 11.52 BLEU points compared to a randomly selected subset of the same size, can achieve the same BLEU score using as little as 4% of the data compared to random instance selection, and can exceed the full dataset result by 0.78 BLEU points. FDA5 is able to reduce the time to build a statistical machine translation system to about half with 1M words using only 3% of the space for the phrase table and 8% of the overall space when compared with a baseline system using all of the training data available yet still obtain only 0.58 BLEU points difference with the baseline system in out-of-domain translation.

TI The moveable feast: translation, ecology and food
SO TRANSLATOR
AB Food production and translation have in common a long relationship with different forms of technology. As societies and economies in many parts of the world are faced with dramatic changes as a result of advances in computing power and software development, changes that are directly affecting translation itself, it is argued that responses to the technologisation of food production are instructive for the future direction of translation both as a profession and as a domain of research. More specifically, analysing dimensions to the practice of food translation points up the emergence of a political ecology of translation. These dimensions include translational productivity, the role of the local or place and the fractal properties of language in translation. This emergent ecology draws on key concepts from social anthropology such as wayfaring' and meshwork' to reconceptualise the potential agency of the translator in what is increasingly referred to as the Second Machine Age. A crucial component of this new ecology of translation is an attention to inter-species communication and how the translation paradigm is an inescapable part of human-animal relationships.

TI EDITOR: An Edit-Based Transformer with Repositioning for Neural Machine
   Translation with Soft Lexical Constraints
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB We introduce an Edit-Based TransfOrmer with Repositioning (EDITOR), which makes sequence generation flexible by seamlessly allowing users to specify preferences in output lexical choice. Building on recent models for non-autoregressive sequence generation (Gu et al., 2019), EDITOR generates new sequences by iteratively editing hypotheses. It relies on a novel reposition operation designed to disentangle lexical choice from word positioning decisions, while enabling efficient oracles for imitation learning and parallel edits at decoding time. Empirically, EDITOR uses soft lexical constraints more effectively than the Levenshtein Transformer (Gu et al., 2019) while speeding up decoding dramatically compared to constrained beam search (Post and Vilar, 2018). EDITOR also achieves comparable or better translation quality with faster decoding speed than the Levenshtein Transformer on standard Romanian-English, English-German, and English-Japanese machine translation tasks.

AB Curriculum learning has improved the quality of neural machine translation, where only source-side features are considered in the metrics to determine the difficulty of translation. In this study, we apply curriculum learning to paraphrase generation for the first time. Different from machine translation, paraphrase generation allows a certain level of discrepancy in semantics between source and target, which results in diverse transformations from lexical substitution to reordering of clauses. Hence, the difficulty of transformations requires considering both source and target contexts. We propose an edit distance between a paraphrased sentence pair as a difficulty metric in curriculum learning. Experiments on formality transfer using GYAFC showed that our curriculum learning with edit distance improves the quality of paraphrase generation. Additionally, the proposed method improves the quality of difficult samples, which was not possible for previous methods.

AB In this paper we investigate the punctuated transcription of multi-genre broadcast media. We examine four systems, three of which are based on lexical features, the fourth of which uses acoustic features by integrating punctuation into the speech recognition acoustic models. We also explore the combination of these component systems using voting and log-linear interpolation. We performed experiments on the English language MGB Challenge data, which comprises about 1,600h of BBC television recordings. Our results indicate that a lexical system, based on a neural machine translation approach is significantly better than other systems achieving an F-Measure of 62.6% on reference text, with a relative degradation of 19% on ASR output. Our analysis of the results in terms of specific punctuation indicated that using longer context improves the prediction of question marks and acoustic information improves prediction of exclamation marks. Finally, we show that even though the systems are complementary, their straightforward combination does not yield better F-measures than a single system using neural machine translation.

AB In this work, we present an empirical study of generation order for machine translation. Building on recent advances in insertion-based modeling, we first introduce a soft orderreward framework that enables us to train models to follow arbitrary oracle generation policies. We then make use of this framework to explore a large variety of generation orders, including uninformed orders, locationbased orders, frequency-based orders, contentbased orders, and model-based orders. Curiously, we find that for the WMT'14 English ! German and WMT'18 English ! Chinese translation tasks, order does not have a substantial impact on output quality. Moreover, for English ! German, we even discover that unintuitive orderings such as alphabetical and shortest-first can match the performance of a standard Transformer, suggesting that traditional left-to-right generation may not be necessary to achieve high performance.

AB Since the last two decades' Arabic natural language processing (ANLP) has become increasingly much more important. One of the key issues related to ANLP is ambiguity. In Arabic language different pronunciation of one word may have a different meaning. Furthermore, ambiguity also has an impact on the effectiveness and efficiency of Machine Translation (MT). The issue of ambiguity has limited the usefulness and accuracy of the translation from Arabic to English. The lack of Arabic resources makes ambiguity problem more complicated. Additionally, the orthographic level of representation cannot specify the exact meaning of the word. This paper looked at the diacritics of Arabic language and used them to disambiguate an ambiguous word. The proposed approach of word sense disambiguation used Diacritizer application to Diacritize Arabic text. Then find the most accurate sense of an ambiguous word using Naive Bayes Classifier. Our system gets 91% precision, and 12.11% error rate. This experimental study proves that using Arabic Diacritics with Naive Bayes Classifier enhances the accuracy of choosing the appropriate sense for ambiguous Arabic words.

AB Two of the most popular Machine Translation (MT) paradigms are rule based (RBMT) and corpus based, which include the statistical systems (SMT). When scarce parallel corpus is available, RBMT becomes particularly attractive. This is the case of the Chinese-Spanish language pair.
   This article presents the first RBMT system for Chinese to Spanish. We describe a hybrid method for constructing this system taking advantage of available resources such as parallel corpora that are used to extract dictionaries and lexical and structural transfer rules.
   The final system is freely available online and open source. Although performance lags behind standard SMT systems for an in-domain test set, the results show that the RBMT's coverage is competitive and it outperforms the SMT system in an out-of-domain test set. This RBMT system is available to the general public, it can be further enhanced, and it opens up the possibility of creating future hybrid MT systems.

AB GPT-2 and BERT demonstrate the effectiveness of using pre-trained language models (LMs) on various natural language processing tasks. However, LM fine-tuning often suffers from catastrophic forgetting when applied to resource-rich tasks. In this work, we introduce a concerted training framework (CTNMT) that is the key to integrate the pre-trained LMs to neural machine translation (NMT). Our proposed CTNMT consists of three techniques: a) asymptotic distillation to ensure that the NMT model can retain the previous pre-trained knowledge; b) a dynamic switching gate to avoid catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained knowledge; and c) a strategy to adjust the learning paces according to a scheduled policy. Our experiments in machine translation show CTNMT gains of up to 3 BLEU score on the WMT14 English-German language pair which even surpasses the previous state-of-the-art pre-training aided NMT by 1.4 BLEU score. While for the large WMT14 English-French task with 40 millions of sentence-pairs, our base model still significantly improves upon the state-of-the-art Transformer big model by more than 1 BLEU score.

AB Parallel texts are essential resources in linguistics, natural language processing, and multilingual information retrieval. Many studies attempt to extract parallel text from existing resources, particularly from comparable texts. The approaches to extract parallel text from comparable text can be divided into sentence-level approach and fragment-level approach. In this paper, an approach that combines sentence-level approach and fragment-level approach is proposed. The study was evaluated using statistical machine translation (SMT) and neural machine translation (NMT). The experiment results show a very significant improvement in the BLEU scores of SMT and NMT. The BLEU scores for SMT for the test in computer science domain and news domain increase from 17.45 and 41.45 to 18.56 and 48.65 respectively. On the other hand, the BLEU scores for NMT in the computer science domain and news domain increase from 14.42 and 19.39 to 21.17 and 41.75 respectively. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB Neural networks tend to gradually forget the previously learned knowledge when learning multiple tasks sequentially from dynamic data distributions. This problem is called catastrophic forgetting, which is a fundamental challenge in the continual learning of neural networks. In this work, we observe that catastrophic forgetting not only occurs in continual learning but also affects the traditional static training. Neural networks, especially neural machine translation models, suffer from catastrophic forgetting even if they learn from a static training set. To be specific, the final model pays imbalanced attention to training samples, where recently exposed samples attract more attention than earlier samples. The underlying cause is that training samples do not get balanced training in each model update, so we name this problem imbalanced training. To alleviate this problem, we propose Complementary Online Knowledge Distillation (COKD), which uses dynamically updated teacher models trained on specific data orders to iteratively provide complementary knowledge to the student model. Experimental results on multiple machine translation tasks show that our method successfully alleviates the problem of imbalanced training and achieves substantial improvements over strong baseline systems.

TI Inference of finite-state transducers from regular languages
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION
AB Finite-state transducers are models that are being used in different areas of pattern recognition and computational linguistics. One of these areas is machine translation, where the approaches that are based on building models automatically from training examples are becoming more and more attractive. Finite-state transducers are very adequate to be used in constrained tasks where training samples of pairs of sentences are available. A technique to infer finite-state transducers is proposed in this work. This technique is based on formal relations between finite-state transducers and finite-state grammars. Given a training corpus of input-output pairs of sentences, the proposed approach uses statistical alignment methods to produce a set of conventional strings from which a stochastic finite-state grammar is inferred. This grammar is finally transformed into a resulting finite-state transducer. The proposed methods are assessed through series of machine translation experiments within the framework of the EUTRANS project. (c) 2005 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In sequence-to-sequence learning, models based on the self-attention mechanism dominate the network structures used for neural machine translation. Recently, convolutional networks have been demonstrated to perform excellently on various translation tasks. Despite the fact that self-attention and convolution have different strengths in modeling sequences, few efforts have been devoted to combining them. In this work, we propose a hybrid model that benefits from both mechanisms. We combine a self-attention module and a dynamic convolution module by taking a weighted sum of their outputs where the weights can be dynamically learned by the model during training. Experimental results show that our hybrid model outperforms baseline models built solely on either of these two mechanisms. And we produce new state-of-the-art results on IWSLT'15 English-German dataset.

AB Machine translation (MT) platforms have gained increasing attention in the educational linguistics community. The current article extends past research on instructor beliefs about MT by way of an ecological theoretical framework. The study reports on a large-scale survey (n=165) of FL universitylevel instructors in the U.S. Findings indicate strong lines being drawn around acceptable MT use (e.g., in relation to text length and skill, policies), an acknowledgement of widespread student use driven by diverse motivations, and the Janus-faced nature of MT's potential threat to the profession. These findings reveal several salient tensions in how MT mediates relationships in language education (e.g., constructions of students, the nature of language and language learning, goals of the profession) that shed new light on the impact of MT technologies on the field. Implications for future research and the development of pedagogical practices anchored in digital literacies conclude the piece.

AB Ugarit is a public web-based tool for manual annotation of parallel texts for generating word-level translation alignment. We aimed to develop a user-friendly interactive interface to visualize aligned texts and collect training data in the form of translation pairs to be used later, (i) for training an automatic translation alignment system for historical languages at the word/phrase level, (ii) as a gold standard to evaluate automatic alignment and machine translation systems. Ugarit is now widely used for learning new languages, especially historical languages, and as a reading environment for parallel texts. In the following sections, we present the related works and similar projects; then, we give an overview of the visualization techniques used to present the alignment results. Further, we explain how we could derive the translation graph from the aligned translation pairs. Finally, we discuss the usage limitations of Ugarit, possible improvements, and future development plans.

AB The feature recognition of spoken Japanese is an effective carrier for Sino-Japanese communication. At present, most of the existing intelligent translation equipment only have equipment that converts English into other languages, and some Japanese translation systems have problems with accuracy and real-time translation. Based on this, based on support vector machines, this research studies and recognizes the input features of spoken Japanese, and improves traditional algorithms to adapt to the needs of spoken language recognition. Moreover, this study uses improved spectral subtraction based on spectral entropy for enhancement processing, modifies Mel filter bank, and introduces several improved MFCC feature parameters. In addition, this study selects an improved feature recognition algorithm suitable for this research system and conducts experimental analysis of input feature recognition of spoken Japanese on the basis of this research model. The research results show that this research model has improved the recognition speed and recognition accuracy, and this research model meets the system requirements, which can provide a reference for subsequent related research.

We perform a detailed analysis of the types of corrections performed by human stenographers when creating clean transcripts, and propose a model that is able to handle the majority of the most common corrections. In particular, the proposed model uses a framework of monotonic statistical machine translation to perform not only the deletion of disfluencies and insertion of punctuation, but also correction of colloquial expressions, insertions of omitted words, and other transformations. We provide a detailed description of the model implementation in the weighted finite state transducer (WFST) framework. An evaluation of the proposed model on both faithful transcripts and speech recognition results of parliamentary and lecture speech demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model in performing the wide variety of corrections necessary for creating clean transcripts.

AB A vast amount of biomedical information is available in the form of scientific literature and government-authored patient information documents. While English is the most widely used language in many of these sources, there is a need to provide access to health information in languages other than English. Parallel corpora can be leveraged to implement cross-lingual information retrieval or machine translation tools. Herein, we review the extent of parallel corpus coverage in the biomedical domain. Specifically, we perform a scoping review of existing resources and we describe the recent development of new datasets for scientific literature (the EDP dataset and an extension of the Scielo corpus) and clinical trials (the ReBEC corpus). These corpora are currently being used in the biomedical task in the Conference on Machine Translation (WMT'16 and WMT'17), which illustrates their potential for improving and evaluating biomedical machine translation systems. Furthermore, we suggest additional applications for multilingual natural language processing using these resources, and plan to extend resource coverage to additional text genres and language pairs.

AB Recent work in multilingual translation advances translation quality surpassing bilingual baselines using deep transformer models with increased capacity. However, the extra latency and memory costs introduced by this approach may make it unacceptable for efficiency-constrained applications. It has recently been shown for bilingual translation that using a deep encoder and shallow decoder (DESD) can reduce inference latency while maintaining translation quality, so we study similar speed-accuracy trade-offs for multilingual translation. We find that for many-toone translation we can indeed increase decoder speed without sacrificing quality using this approach, but for one-to-many translation, shallow decoders cause a clear quality drop. To ameliorate this drop, we propose a deep encoder with multiple shallow decoders (DEMSD) where each shallow decoder is responsible for a disjoint subset of target languages. Specifically, the DEMSD model with 2-layer decoders is able to obtain a 1.8x speedup on average compared to a standard transformer model with no drop in translation quality.

AB The field of knowledge translation and exchange is growing, particularly in the area of health services. Programs that advance "bench-to-bedside" approaches have found success in leveraging new research into a number of medical fields through knowledge translation strategies. However, knowledge translation remains an understudied area in the realm of occupational health, a factor that is interesting because workplace health research is often directly applicable to risk reduction activities. This research project investigated knowledge translation in one occupational setting, small machine shops, where workers are exposed to Metal Working Fluids (MWF) which are well established dermal and respiratory irritants. Using the mental models approach, influence diagrams were developed for both scientists and were compared with qualitative interview data from workers. Initial results indicated that the sphere Of influence diagrams would benefit from the inclusion of earlier stakeholders, namely policy makers and product representatives. Overall, findings from this research suggest that there is only minimal transfer of scientific knowledge regarding the health effects of metal working to those at the machine shop level. A majority of workers did not perceive metal working fluids to be hazardous to their health. Of note was the finding that MWF product representatives were rated highly as key Sources of risk information. The translation of scientific knowledge to this occupational setting was poor, which may be due to varying perceptions and prioritizations of risk between stakeholders, lack of avenues through which communication could occur, an absence of accessible risk information and the small size of the workplaces. The mental models approach proved successful for eliciting information in this occupational context.

AB Terminological resources have proven necessary in many organizations and institutions to ensure communication between experts. However, the maintenance of these resources is a very time-consuming and expensive process. Therefore, the work described in this contribution aims to automate the maintenance process of such resources. As an example, we demonstrate enriching the RDF version of IATE with new terms in the languages for which no translation was available, as well as with domain-disambiguated sentences and information about usage frequency. This is achieved by relying on machine translation trained on parallel corpora that contains the terms in question and multilingual word sense disambiguation performed on the context provided by the sentences. Our results show that for most languages translating the terms within a disambiguated context significantly outperforms the approach with randomly selected sentences.

SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB Logographic and alphabetic languages (e.g., Chinese vs. English) have different writing systems linguistically. Languages belonging to the same writing system usually exhibit more sharing information, which can be used to facilitate natural language processing tasks such as neural machine translation (NMT). This article takes advantage of the logographic characters in Chinese and Japanese by decomposing them into smaller units, thus more optimally utilizing the information these characters share in the training of NMT systems in both encoding and decoding processes. Experiments show that the proposed method can robustly improve the NMT performance of both "logographic" language pairs (JA-ZH) and "logographic + alphabetic" (JA-EN and ZH-EN) language pairs in both supervised and unsupervised NMT scenarios. Moreover, as the decomposed sequences are usually very long, extra position features for the transformer encoder can help with the modeling of these long sequences. The results also indicate that, theoretically, linguistic features can be manipulated to obtain higher share token rates and further improve the performance of natural language processing systems.

AB The recent advent of more powerful machine translation (MT) tools has significant implications for foreign language teaching and learning. While current research and pedagogical guidelines on MT in the foreign and second language classroom have focused primarily on survey data, less is known about how students actually use MT tools. The current article chronicles a computer tracking study of novice learners of French as a Foreign Language (n=26) as a way to inform this field of research. Drawing on diverse data sources (screen-recorded observations, retrospective recalls, post-interviews) and a Critical Incident Technique analytical approach, the article showcases the actions and cognitive processes related to MT that both supported and hindered student participants in their foreign language writing. Supportive behaviors and mindsets centered on a specific awareness of MT tool limitations paired with appropriate action while detrimental behaviors and mindsets centered on inappropriate input, lack of output analysis, and time. Suggestions for how these use-based findings might inform how MT is discussed in the language classroom conclude the article.

We present mBART-a sequence-to-sequence denoising auto-encoder pre-trained on large-scale monolingual corpora in many languages using the BART objective (Lewis et al., 2019). mBART is the first method for pre-training a complete sequence-to-sequencemodel by denoising full texts in multiple languages, whereas previous approaches have focused only on the encoder, decoder, or reconstructing parts of the text. Pre-training a complete model allows it to be directly fine-tuned for supervised (both sentence-level and document-level) and unsupervised machine translation, with no task-specific modifications. We demonstrate that adding mBART initialization produces performance gains in all but the highest-resource settings, including up to 12 BLEU points for low resource MT and over 5 BLEU points for many document-level and unsupervised models. We also show that it enables transfer to language pairs with no bi-text or that were not in the pre-training corpus, and present extensive analysis of which factors contribute the most to effective pre-training.

TI Temporal Sequences Quantify the Contributions of Individual Fixations in
   Complex Perceptual Matching Tasks
SO COGNITIVE SCIENCE
AB Perceptual tasks such as object matching, mammogram interpretation, mental rotation, and satellite imagery change detection often require the assignment of correspondences to fuse information across views. We apply techniques developed for machine translation to the gaze data recorded from a complex perceptual matching task modeled after fingerprint examinations. The gaze data provide temporal sequences that the machine translation algorithm uses to estimate the subjects' assumptions of corresponding regions. Our results show that experts and novices have similar surface behavior, such as the number of fixations made or the duration of fixations. However, the approach applied to data from experts is able to identify more corresponding areas between two prints. The fixations that are associated with clusters that map with high probability to corresponding locations on the other print are likely to have greater utility in a visual matching task. These techniques address a fundamental problem in eye tracking research with perceptual matching tasks: Given that the eyes always point somewhere, which fixations are the most informative and therefore are likely to be relevant for the comparison task?

AB This paper proposed a flattened syntactical phrase-based translation model for Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) learned from bilingual parallel parsed texts. The flattened syntactical phrases are sets of ordered leaf nodes with their father nodes of single syntax trees or forests ignoring the inner structure, containing lexicalized terminals and non-terminals as variable nodes. Constraints over the variable nodes in target side guarantee correct syntactical structures of translations in accordant to the syntactical knowledge learned from parallel texts. The experiments based on Chinese-to-English translation show us a predictable result that our model achieves 1.87% and 4.76% relative improvements, over Pharaoh, the state-of-art phrase-based translation system, and the system of traditional tree-to-tree model based on STSG.

This paper deals with query translation and document translation in a Chinese-English information retrieval system called MTIR. Bilingual dictionary and monolingual corpus-based approaches are adopted to select suitable translated query terms. A machine transliteration algorithm is introduced to resolve proper name searching. We consider several design issues for document translation, including which material is translated, what roles the HTML tags play in translation, what the tradeoff is between the speed performance and the translation performance, and what form the translated result is presented in. About 100,000 Web pages translated in the last four months of 1997 are used for quantitative study of online and real-time Web page translation.

AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has drawn much attention due to its promising translation performance in recent years. However, the under-translation problem still remains a big challenge. In this paper, we focus on the under-translation problem and attempt to find out what kinds of source words are more likely to be ignored. Through analysis, we observe that a source word with a large translation entropy is more inclined to be dropped. To address this problem, we propose a coarse-to-fine framework. In coarse-grained phase, we introduce a simple strategy to reduce the entropy of high entropy words through constructing the pseudo target sentences. In fine-grained phase, we propose three methods, including pre-training method, multitask method and two-pass method, to encourage the neural model to correctly translate these high-entropy words. Experimental results on various translation tasks show that our method can significantly improve the translation quality and substantially reduce the under-translation cases of high-entropy words.

TI Embedding Web-based statistical translation models in cross-language
   information retrieval
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Although more and more language pairs are covered by machine translation (MT) services, there are still many pairs that lack translation resources. Cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) is an application that needs translation functionality of a relatively low level of sophistication, since current models for information retrieval (IR) are still based on a bag of words. The Web provides a vast resource for the automatic construction of parallel corpora that can be used to train statistical translation models automatically. The resulting translation models can be embedded in several ways in a retrieval model. In this article, we will investigate the problem of automatically mining parallel texts from the Web and different ways of integrating the translation models within the retrieval process. Our experiments on standard test collections for CUR show that the Web-based translation models can surpass commercial MT systems in CUR tasks. These results open the perspective of constructing a fully automatic query translation device for CUR at a very low cost.

AB Theoretical work in morphological typology offers the possibility of measuring morphological diversity on a continuous scale. However, literature in Natural Language Processing (NLP) typically labels a whole language with a strict type of morphology, e.g. fusional or agglutinative. In this work, we propose to reduce the rigidity of such claims, by quantifying morphological typology at the word and segment level. We consider Payne (2017)'s approach to classify morphology using two indices: synthesis (e.g. analytic to polysynthetic) and fusion (agglutinative to fusional). For computing synthesis, we test unsupervised and supervised morphological segmentation methods for English, German and Turkish, whereas for fusion, we propose a semi-automatic method using Spanish as a case study. Then, we analyse the relationship between machine translation quality and the degree of synthesis and fusion at word (nouns and verbs for English-Turkish, and verbs in English-Spanish) and segment level (previous language pairs plus English-German in both directions). We complement the word-level analysis with human evaluation, and overall, we observe a consistent impact of both indexes on machine translation quality.

TI Why go the extra mile? How different degrees of post-editing affect
   perceptions of texts, senders and products among end users
SO JOURNAL OF SPECIALISED TRANSLATION
AB In recent decades, post-editing has received its fair share of attention in the industry as well as in academic circles. What has attracted by far the most attention is the question of quality: together, machine translation and post-editing defy long-standing and commonplace notions of quality. In this paper, we try to observe quality from the vantage point of end users, who are believed to have the final say on a text's fitness for purpose. We will report on an experiment in which end users were asked to pass judgment on manipulated machine translations with different degrees of post-editing. Our findings demonstrate that the additional effort associated with higher degrees of post-editing does not necessarily lead to more positive judgments about text quality. The evidence suggests that text quality is context-dependent and is, therefore, subject to a somewhat opaque process of constant (re)negotiation.

SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Entity highlight refers to a short, concise, and characteristic description for an entity, which can be applied to various applications. In this article, we study the problem of automatically generating entity highlights from the descriptive sentences of entities. Specifically, we develop two computational approaches, one is inspired by the statistical machine translation (SMT) and another is a sequence-to-sequence learning (Seq2Seq) approach, which has been successfully applied in neural machine translation and neural summarization. In the Seq2Seq approach, we use attention mechanism, copy mechanism, and coverage mechanism. To generate entity-specific highlights, we also incorporate entity name into the Seq2Seq model to guide the decoding process. We automatically collect large-scale instances as training data without any manual annotation, and ask annotators to create a test set. We compare with several strong baseline methods, and evaluate the approaches with both automatic evaluation and manual evaluation. Experimental results show that the entity enhanced Seq2Seq model with attention, copy, and coverage mechanisms significantly outperforms all other approaches in terms of multiple evaluation metrics.(1)

AB The prediction of Translation Initiation Site (TIS) from a mRNA (Ribonucleic Acid Messenger) is a relevant and latent problem of molecular biology, which has benefited from the evolution of computational techniques of machine learning (ML). There are some machine learning scenarios where the dataset either does not have enough classified sequences to train a precise model, or it does not have an upstream region, such as Caenorhabditis elegans. In this article, we compare the inductive and transductive approaches for TIS prediction, using a methodology that disregards the upstream region. With the proposed methodology, we achieved 95% training accuracy, using only 2.5% of sequences belonging to the Caenorhabditis elegans class, which has many available sequences but does not have the upstream region, and 75% for the Rattus norvegicus class, which has fewer sequences available, using a transductive approach. Our results demonstrate the viability of the transductive approach for scenarios with fewer sequences, a common situation for organisms with incomplete gene sequencing.

AB Following their monolingual counterparts, bilingual word embeddings are also on the rise. As a major application task, word translation has been relying on the nearest neighbor to connect embeddings cross-lingually. However, the nearest neighbor strategy suffers from its inherently local nature and fails to cope with variations in realistic bilingual word embeddings. Furthermore, it lacks a mechanism to deal with many-to-many mappings that often show up across languages. We introduce Earth Mover's Distance to this task by providing a natural formulation that translates words in a holistic fashion, addressing the limitations of the nearest neighbor. We further extend the formulation to a new task of identifying parallel sentences, which is useful for statistical machine translation systems, thereby expanding the application realm of bilingual word embeddings. We show encouraging performance on both tasks.

AB Several mechanisms to focus attention of a neural network on selected parts of its input or memory have been used successfully in deep learning models in recent years. Attention has improved image classification, image captioning, speech recognition, generative models, and learning algorithmic tasks, but it had probably the largest impact on neural machine translation.
   Recently, similar improvements have been obtained using alternative mechanisms that do not focus on a single part of a memory but operate on all of it in parallel, in a uniform way. Such mechanism, which we call active memory, improved over attention in algorithmic tasks, image processing, and in generative modelling.
   So far, however, active memory has not improved over attention for most natural language processing tasks, in particular for machine translation. We analyze this shortcoming in this paper and propose an extended model of active memory that matches existing attention models on neural machine translation and generalizes better to longer sentences. We investigate this model and explain why previous active memory models did not succeed. Finally, we discuss when active memory brings most benefits and where attention can be a better choice.

AB This paper focuses on the study of a product experience's perception. It is then discussed how automotive Human-Machine Interfaces, as interactive products, are singular in their design process, perception, and evaluation. As essential products for a satisfactory user onboard experience, it is necessary for experts to have access to a translation of the non-expert perception, in a research and development perspective. Arguments about the benefits of using a sensory evaluation method, adapted to this kind of complex product, are provided. In this study, a sorting task evaluation is performed on naive people, to quantify and qualify the perception of a large number of stimuli. The paper proposes a statistical analysis methodology for processing data from a complex product evaluation. The analysis offers several levels of perception interpretation in order to provide a translation at different levels as well. An application example is given for three attributes that are different in nature and interpretation.

AB How to learn a better speech representation for end-to-end speech-to-text translation (ST) with limited labeled data? Existing techniques often attempt to transfer powerful machine translation (MT) capabilities to ST, but neglect the representation discrepancy across modalities. In this paper, we propose the Speech-TExt Manifold Mixup (STEMM) method to calibrate such discrepancy. Specifically, we mix up the representation sequences of different modalities, and take both unimodal speech sequences and multimodal mixed sequences as input to the translation model in parallel, and regularize their output predictions with a self-learning framework. Experiments on MuST-C speech translation benchmark and further analysis show that our method effectively alleviates the cross-modal representation discrepancy, and achieves significant improvements over a strong baseline on eight translation directions.

AB Automatic translation of out of vocabulary (OOV) terms has been extensively studied in the past, but multi-translatable OOV terms have received little attention. Multi-translatable OOV terms are OOV terms with some possible OOV synonyms, thus they have more than one correct translations. Traditional methods usually ignore such problem and neither identify/extract multi-translatable OOV terms nor translate them. This paper proposes a web-based OOV term translation method by utilizing a novel automatic multi-translatable OOV term identification and extraction approach. This approach integrates synonymous features and pattern matching to solve multi-translatable OOV term problems. A combined translation method is proposed for extracting translation candidates. To achieve high translation selection quality, we conducted statistical feature extraction, an artificial neural network combined with backward feature selection, and evolutionary parameter optimization is trained for selecting correct translations. Our method outperforms existing method with an accuracy of 82.61%.

This system uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Encodings. Encode embedded RNNs generate a set of numbers from the input sentence, where the second RNNs generate the output from these sets of numbers. Three popular datasets of SOV structured language i.e., EMILLE corpus, Prothom-Alo corpus and Punjabi Monolingual Text Corpus ILCI-II are used as two different case-study to validate. In our experimental case-study 1, for the EMILLE corpus and Prothom-Alo corpus dataset, we have achieved 0.742, 4.11 and 0.18, respectively as Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU), NIST (metric) and tertiary entrance rank scores. Another case-study for Punjabi Monolingual Text Corpus ILCI-II dataset achieved a BLEU score of 0.75. Our results can be compared with the state-of-the-art results.

TI Transliterating Nom Scripts into Vietnamese National Scripts using
   Statistical Machine Translation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB Nom scripts were used as the Vietnamese writing system from the 10th century to the early 20th century. During this period, Nom scripts were the means to record a broad range of historical events, literary works, medical knowledge, as well as wisdom of many other domains. Unfortunately, since hardly any native Vietnamese speaker can read Nom scripts nowadays, these valuable documents have not been fully harnessed. To address this gap, it is necessary to build an automatic transliteration system that can support us in decoding the ancient scripts and gaining knowledge of our Vietnamese ancestors. This study focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on the Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) approaches to transliterate Nom scripts into Vietnamese national scripts. In this paper, we discuss the differences between Nom scripts and Vietnamese national scripts, systematically compare SMT models in transliterating Nom scripts into Vietnamese national scripts, as well as having a thorough outlook on several promising research directions.

AB The growing internationalization of business and social interactions poses significant challenges in implementing multilingual information systems. For applications requiring retrieval, clustering, and categorization of multilingual document collections, cross-lingual application of latent semantic indexing (LSI) has a number of characteristics that make it potentially attractive. However, this technique is dependent upon the availability of applicable parallel corpora. Historically, such corpora have been quite limited in size and scope. In this paper, we provide new results regarding implementation of cross-lingual LSI text processing systems employing parallel corpora produced using modern machine translation (MT) products. We present measurements using the Reuters 21578 test set to demonstrate three key points regarding this combined LSI/modern MT approach: (1) for some languages, this approach can create parallel corpora of sufficient fidelity to support effective multilingual and cross-lingual LSI applications, (2) the technique is not particularly sensitive to details of LSI parameters, and (3) multiple languages can be represented in a single LSI space with little degradation in performance.

AB With the recent advancements in Machine Learning based Natural Language Processing (NLP), language dependency has always been a limiting factor for a majority of NLP applications. Typically, models are trained for the English language due to the availability of very large labeled and unlabeled datasets, which also allow to fine tune models for that language. Contradiction Detection is one such problem that has found many practical applications in NLP and up to this point has only been studied in the context of English language. The scope of this paper is to examine a set of baseline methods for the Contradiction Detection task on German text. For this purpose, the well-known Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) data set (110,000 sentence pairs) is machine-translated from English to German. We train and evaluate four classifiers on both the original and the translated data, using state-of-the-art textual data representations. Our main contribution is the first large-scale assessment for this problem in German, and a validation of machine translation as a data generation method. We also present a novel approach to learn sentence embeddings by exploiting the hidden states of an encoder-decoder Sequence-To-Sequence RNN trained for autoencoding or translation.

AB Neural translation models have proven to be effective in capturing sufficient information from a source sentence and generating a high-quality target sentence. However, it is not easy to get the best effect for bidirectional translation, i.e., both source-to-target and target-to-source translation using a single model. If we exclude some pioneering attempts, such as multilingual systems, all other bidirectional translation approaches are required to train two individual models. This paper proposes to build a single end-to-end bidirectional translation model using a two-dimensional grid, where the left-to-right decoding generates source-to-target, and the bottom-to-up decoding creates target-to-source output. Instead of training two models independently, our approach encourages a single network to jointly learn to translate in both directions. Experiments on theWMT2018 German <-> English and Turkish <-> English translation tasks show that the proposed model is capable of generating a good translation quality and has sufficient potential to direct the research.

AB Speech processing is considered to be one of the most important application area of digital signal processing. Speech recognition and translation systems have consisted into two main systems, the first system represents an ASR system that contains two levels which are level one the feature extraction level As well as, level two the classification technique level using Data Time Wrapping (DTW), Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN). The second system is the Machine Translation (MT) system that mainly can be achieved by using three approaches which are (A) the statistical-based approach, (B) rule -approach, and (C) hybrid-based approach. In this study, we made a comparative study between classification techniques from ASR point of view, as well as, the translation approaches from MT point of view. The recognition rate was used in the ASR level and the error rate was used to evaluate the accuracy of the translated sentences. Furthermore, we classified the sample text audio files into four categories which were news, conversational, scientific phrases, and control categories.

TI Evolution of replication machines
SO CRITICAL REVIEWS IN BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB The machines that decode and regulate genetic information require the translation, transcription and replication pathways essential to all living cells. Thus, it might be expected that all cells share the same basic machinery for these pathways that were inherited from the primordial ancestor cell from which they evolved. A clear example of this is found in the translation machinery that converts RNA sequence to protein. The translation process requires numerous structural and catalytic RNAs and proteins, the central factors of which are homologous in all three domains of life, bacteria, archaea and eukarya. Likewise, the central actor in transcription, RNA polymerase, shows homology among the catalytic subunits in bacteria, archaea and eukarya. In contrast, while some "gears" of the genome replication machinery are homologous in all domains of life, most components of the replication machine appear to be unrelated between bacteria and those of archaea and eukarya. This review will compare and contrast the central proteins of the "replisome" machines that duplicate DNA in bacteria, archaea and eukarya, with an eye to understanding the issues surrounding the evolution of the DNA replication apparatus.

TI SMT-based ASR domain adaptation methods for under-resourced languages:
   Application to Romanian
SO SPEECH COMMUNICATION
AB This study investigates the possibility of using statistical machine translation to create domain-specific language resources. We propose a methodology that aims to create a domain-specific automatic speech recognition (ASR) system for a low-resourced language when in-domain text corpora are available only in a high-resourced language. Several translation scenarios (both unsupervised and semi-supervised) are used to obtain domain-specific textual data. Moreover this paper shows that a small amount of manually post-edited text is enough to develop other natural language processing systems that, in turn, can be used to automatically improve the machine translated text, leading to a significant boost in ASR performance. An in-depth analysis, to explain why and how the machine translated text improves the performance of the domain-specific ASR, is also made at the end of this paper. As bi-products of this core domain-adaptation methodology, this paper also presents the first large vocabulary continuous speech recognition system for Romanian, and introduces a diacritics restoration module to process the Romanian text corpora, as well as an automatic phonetization module needed to extend the Romanian pronunciation dictionary.

AB Cross-lingual transfer learning without labeled target language data or parallel text has been surprisingly effective in zero-shot cross-lingual classification, question answering, unsupervised machine translation, etc. However, some recent publications have claimed that domain mismatch prevents cross-lingual transfer, and their results show that unsupervised bilingual lexicon induction (UBLI) and unsupervised neural machine translation (UNMT) do not work well when the underlying monolingual corpora come from different domains (e.g., French text from Wikipedia but English text from UN proceedings). In this work, we show that a simple initialization regimen can overcome much of the effect of domain mismatch in cross-lingual transfer. We pre-train word and contextual embeddings on the concatenated domain-mismatched corpora, and use these as initializations for three tasks: MUSE UBLI, UN Parallel UNMT, and the SemEval 2017 cross-lingual word similarity task. In all cases, our results challenge the conclusions of prior work by showing that proper initialization can recover a large portion of the losses incurred by domain mismatch.

AB Current approaches to machine translation (MT) either translate sentences in isolation, disregarding the context they appear in, or model context at the level of the full document, without a notion of any internal structure the document may have. In this work we consider the fact that documents are rarely homogeneous blocks of text, but rather consist of parts covering different topics. Some documents, such as biographies and encyclopedia entries, have highly predictable, regular structures in which sections are characterised by different topics. We draw inspiration from Louis and Webber (2014) who use this information to improve statistical MT and transfer their proposal into the framework of neural MT. We compare two different methods of including information about the topic of the section within which each sentence is found: one using side constraints and the other using a cache-based model. We create and release the data on which we run our experiments - parallel corpora for three language pairs (Chinese-English, French-English, Bulgarian-English) from Wikipedia biographies, which we extract automatically, preserving the boundaries of sections within the articles.

AB Lexically constrained neural machine translation (NMT), which leverages pre-specified translation to constrain NMT, has practical significance in interactive translation and NMT domain adaptation. Previous works either modify the decoding algorithm or train the model on augmented datasets. These methods suffer from either high computational overheads or low copying success rates. In this paper, we investigate ATT-INPUT and ATT-OUTPUT, two alignment-based constrained decoding methods. These two methods revise the target tokens during decoding based on word alignments derived from encoder-decoder attention weights. Our study shows that ATT-INPUT translates better while ATT-OUTPUT is more computationally efficient. Capitalizing on both strengths, we further propose EAM-OUTPUT by introducing an explicit alignment module (EAM) to a pretrained Transformer. It decodes similarly as ATT-OUTPUT, except using alignments derived from the EAM. We leverage the word alignments induced from ATT-INPUT as labels and train the EAM while keeping the parameters of the Transformer frozen. Experiments on WMT16 De-En and WMT16 RoEn show the effectiveness of our approaches on constrained NMT. In particular, the proposed EAM-OUTPUT method consistently outperforms previous approaches in translation quality, with light computational overheads over unconstrained baseline.

AB Translating third person singular pronouns from English to Yoruba is yet to receive research attention. The issue can be understood if the translation is speech to speech. In the literature, the authors translate sentence without considering the gender of the author or doer as it is in the English (source language) sentence. This does pose a problem to the reader of English to Yoruba translated sentences. We envisaged that there is need to represent she/he/it differently unlike the way we are translating it now. Presently, she/he/it are translated as O. We proposed ways of representing the three third person singular pronouns; binrin, kunrin and unkan. Feminine (She) is bunrin, masculine (he) is kunrin and non-human (it) is unkan. We developed English to Yoruba machine translation (IFEMT1) system that can translate simple English sentence text to Yoruba sentence text using the existing and proposed third person singular pronouns translation processes. We used rule based approach and python programming language to implement the IFEMT1 system. The system graphical user interface (GUI) can display the English sentences (to be translated), translated Yoruba sentences for the existing and our proposed translations.

SO PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATION THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB Although central in translation practice, and increasing in volume as well as impact due to the growing globalisation and explosion of financial transactions and increasing business activity, economic translation -including business and financial translation - has been little researched and discussed over the years. Yet it constitutes a fascinating and robust area that grows hand-in-hand with the evolution of human civilisation and the development of societies or the developing world. In this global village, the concept of economics' in translation has become even more relevant lately, due to the ever-increasing technicalisation of the profession and the alteration of the translation habitus in Bourdieu's terms, which unavoidably affects the translation profession, not least with respect to the diminishing rates and deteriorating working conditions. This special issue aims to explore the specificities and particularities of economic translation as it has been practised over the years and as it is being currently practised around the globe, and also investigate new research trends that appear in the field. At the same time, it wishes to cast some light on the economics of the profession and the changing habitus of the translator.

In this paper, an efficient modified interpolation technique is developed for fast evaluation of translation operators. Different form other efficient techniques for translation operators in which only the evaluation of multiple angles is performed, the space-distance interpolation is implemented by introducing a modified factor. Two-dimensional Lagrange interpolation technique is used to realize fast computation of the operators in case of multiple space-distance and angles at a given level. Low computer storage for translation operators is required. The present technique is suitable for distributed memory machines.

TI Automatic normalization of short texts by combining statistical and
   rule-based techniques
SO LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
AB Short texts are typically composed of small number of words, most of which are abbreviations, typos and other kinds of noise. This makes the noise to signal ratio relatively high for this specific category of text. A high proportion of noise in the data is undesirable for analysis procedures as well as machine learning applications. Text normalization techniques are used to reduce the noise and improve the quality of text for processing and analysis purposes. In this work, we propose a combination of statistical and rule-based techniques to normalize short texts. More specifically, we focus our attention on SMS messages. We base our normalization approach on a statistical machine translation system which translates from noisy data to clean data. This system is trained on a small manually annotated set. Then, we study several automatic methods to extract more general rules from the normalizations generated with the statistical machine translation system. We illustrate the proposed methodology by conducting some experiments with a SMS Haitian-Cr,ole data collection. In order to evaluate the performance of our methodology we use several Haitian-Cr,ole dictionaries, the well-known perplexity criteria and the achieved reduction of vocabulary.

TI Beyond the Transformer: A Novel Polynomial Inherent Attention (PIA)
   Model and Its Great Impact on Neural Machine Translation
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB This paper describes a novel polynomial inherent attention (PIA) model that outperforms all state-of-the-art transformer models on neural machine translation (NMT) by a wide margin. PIA is based on the simple idea that natural language sentences can be transformed into a special type of binary attention context vectors that accurately capture the semantic context and the relative dependencies between words in a sentence. The transformation is performed using a simple power-of-two polynomial transformation that maintains strict consistent positioning of words in the resulting vectors. It is shown how this transformation reduces the neural machine translation process to a simple neural polynomial regression model that provides excellent solutions to the alignment and positioning problems haunting transformer models. The test BELU scores obtained on the WMT-2014 data set are 75.07 BELU for the EN-FR data set and 66.35 BELU for the EN-DE data set-well above accuracies achieved by state-of-the-art transformer models for the same data sets. The improvements are, respectively, 65.7% and 87.42%.

TI Eye-tracking and translation memory matches
SO PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATION THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB Eye-tracking has been used as a methodology for some time in various disciplines, but it has not been applied to date in translation studies. This paper presents results from a preliminary investigation which seeks to answer two questions: Firstly, is eye-tracking, in general, a useful research methodology for investigating translators' interaction with Translation Memory tools? Secondly, what can eye-tracking data tell us about cognitive load when translators deal with different match types in Translation Memories? The results demonstrate that eye-tracking data, including pupil dilation measurements and gaze replays, in association with retrospective protocols promise to be a very effective methodology for future research into translation processes. The results also suggest that the cognitive load for exact matches in Translation Memory tools is much lower than for other match types, that cognitive load for machine translation matches is close to fuzzy matches of between 80-90% value, and that "no matches" require the highest level of cognitive load.

AB Artificial-intelligence-powered neural machine translation might soon resuscitate endangered languages by empowering new speakers to communicate in real time using sentences quantifiably closer to the literary norm than those of native speakers, and starting from day one of their language reclamation journey. While Silicon Valley has been investing enormous resources into neural translation technology capable of superhuman speed and accuracy for the world's most widely used languages, 98% have been left behind, for want of corpora: neural machine translation models train on millions of words of bilingual text, which simply do not exist for most languages, and cost upwards of a hundred thousand United States dollars per tongue to assemble.
   For low-resource languages, there is a more resourceful approach, if not a more effective one: transfer learning, which enables lower-resource languages to benefit from achievements among higher-resource ones. In this experiment, Google's English-Polish neural translation service was coupled with my classical, rule-based engine to translate from English into the endangered, low-resource, East Slavic language of Lemko. The system achieved a bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) quality score of 6.28, several times better than Google Translate's English to Standard Ukrainian (BLEU 2.17), Russian (BLEU 1.10), and Polish (BLEU 1.70) services. Finally, the fruit of this experiment, the world's first English to Lemko translation service, was made available at the web address www.LemkoTran.com to empower new speakers to revitalize their language.
   New speakers are key to language revitalization, and the power to "say it right" in Lemko is now at their fingertips.

TI Reproducible and Efficient Benchmarks for Hyperparameter Optimization of
   Neural Machine Translation Systems
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Hyperparameter selection is a crucial part of building neural machine translation (NMT) systems across both academia and industry. Fine-grained adjustments to a model's architecture or training recipe can mean the difference between a positive and negative research result or between a state-of-the-art and underperforming system. While recent literature has proposed methods for automatic hyperparameter optimization (HPO), there has been limited work on applying these methods to neural machine translation (NMT), due in part to the high costs associated with experiments that train large numbers of model variants. To facilitate research in this space, we introduce a lookup-based approach that uses a library of pre-trained models for fast, low cost HPO experimentation. Our contributions include (1) the release of a large collection of trained NMT models covering a wide range of hyperparameters, (2) the proposal of targeted metrics for evaluating HPO methods on NMT, and (3) a reproducible benchmark of several HPO methods against our model library, including novel graph-based and multiobjective methods.

AB During the last decade, several automatic ontology matching systems were developed to address the problem of ontology heterogeneity. Aligning cross-lingual ontologies is among the current challenging issues in the field of ontology matching. The majority of the existing approaches rely on machine translation to deal with this problem. However, inherent problems of machine translation are imprecision and ambiguity. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the cross-lingual ontology matching task, relying on the large multilingual semantic network BabelNet as a source of background knowledge to assist the matching process. We have designed and tested a novel orchestration of the components of the matching workflow. Our approach is implemented under the form of a prototype named LYAM++ (Yet Another Matcher-Light)-a fully automatic cross-lingual ontology matching system that does not rely on machine translation. We report the results of our experiments that show that LYAM++ outperforms considerably the best techniques in the state-of-the-art according to the obtained results on the MultiFarm datasets of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative 2014.

TI Construction of English Translation Model Based on Improved Fuzzy
   Semantic Optimal Control of GLR Algorithm
SO SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
AB Data point overlap exists in the model translation recognition results of generalized maximum likelihood ratio detection (GLR) algorithm. A fuzzy semantic optimal control intelligent recognition model for English translation based on improved GLR algorithm is proposed. This algorithm is used to create a phrase corpus for marking tens of thousands of English and Chinese words, so that phrases can be searched automatically. The algorithm builds a phrase corpus of about 710,000 Chinese and English words. Phrase structure is constructed through phrase centers. Partial speech recognition results can be obtained. According to the syntactic function of analytic linear list, the ambiguity of Chinese and English structures in part of speech recognition results is corrected. Finally get the content of the identifier on the basis of comprehensive evaluation. The recognition accuracy based on the improved algorithm is more than 95%. The overall score was 92.3. This algorithm overcomes the disadvantages of GLR. Compared with statistical algorithm and dynamic memory algorithm, the algorithm improves the operation speed and processing performance and is more suitable for machine translation tasks. It provides a new idea in the field of machine translation.

AB Evaluation of cross-lingual encoders is usually performed either via zero-shot cross-lingual transfer in supervised downstream tasks or via unsupervised cross-lingual textual similarity. In this paper, we concern ourselves with reference-free machine translation (MT) evaluation where we directly compare source texts to (sometimes low-quality) system translations, which represents a natural adversarial setup for multilingual encoders. Reference-free evaluation holds the promise of web-scale comparison of MT systems. We systematically investigate a range of metrics based on state-of-the-art cross-lingual semantic representations obtained with pretrained M-BERT and LASER. We find that they perform poorly as semantic encoders for reference-free MT evaluation and identify their two key limitations, namely, (a) a semantic mismatch between representations of mutual translations and, more prominently, (b) the inability to punish "translationese", i.e., low-quality literal translations. We propose two partial remedies: (1) post-hoc re-alignment of the vector spaces and (2) coupling of semantic-similarity based metrics with target-side language modeling. In segment-level MT evaluation, our best metric surpasses reference-based BLEU by 5.7 correlation points. We make our MT evaluation code available.

AB Mining terminology translation from a large amount of Web data can be applied in many fields such as reading/writing assistant, machine translation and cross-language information retrieval. How to find more comprehensive results from the Web and obtain the boundary of candidate translations, and how to remove irrelevant noises and rank the remained candidates are the challenging issues. In this paper, after reviewing and analyzing all possible methods of acquiring translations, a feasible statistics-based method is proposed to mine terminology translation from the Web. In the proposed method, on the basis of an analysis of different forms of term translation distributions, character-based string frequency estimation is presented to construct term translation candidates for exploring more translations and their boundaries, and then sort-based subset deletion and mutual information methods are respectively proposed to deal with subset redundancy information and prefix/suffix redundancy information formed in the process of estimation. Extensive experiments on two test sets of 401 and 3511 English terms validate that our system has better performance.

TI A unified framework and models for integrating translation memory into
   phrase-based statistical machine translation
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB Since statistical machine translation (SMT) and translation memory (TM) complement each other in TM matched and unmatched regions, a unified framework for integrating TM into phrase-based SMT is proposed in this paper. Unlike previous two-stage pipeline approaches, which directly merge TM results into the input sentences and subsequently let the SMT only translates those unmatched regions, the proposed framework refers to the corresponding TM information associated with each phrase at the SMT decoding. Under this unified framework, several integrated models are proposed to incorporate different types of information extracted from TM to guide the SMT decoding. We thus let SMT implicitly and indirectly utilize global context with a local dependency model. Furthermore, the SMT phrase table is dynamically enhanced with TM phrase pairs when the TM database and the SMT training set are different.
   On a Chinese-English TM database, our experiments show that the proposed Model-I significantly improves over both SMT and TM when the SMT training set is also adopted as the TM database and when the fuzzy match score is over 0.4 (overall 3.5 BLEU points improvement and 2.6 TER points reduction). In addition, the proposed Model-II is significantly better than the TM and the SMT systems when the SMT training set and the TM database are different. Furthermore, the proposed Model-III outperforms both the TM and the SMT systems even when the SMT training set and the TM database are from different domains. Additionally, the proposed Model-IV further achieves significant improvements with the help of Top-N TM sentence pairs. Lastly, all our models significantly outperform those state-of-the-art approaches under all test conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Bilingual Continuous-Space Language Model Growing for Statistical
   Machine Translation
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Larger-gram language models (LMs) perform better in statistical machine translation (SMT). However, the existing approaches have two main drawbacks for constructing larger LMs: 1) it is not convenient to obtain larger corpora in the same domain as the bilingual parallel corpora in SMT; 2) most of the previous studies focus on monolingual information from the target corpora only, and redundant-grams have not been fully utilized in SMT. Nowadays, continuous-space language model (CSLM), especially neural network language model (NNLM), has been shown great improvement in the estimation accuracies of the probabilities for predicting the target words. However, most of these CSLM and NNLM approaches still consider monolingual information only or require additional corpus. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network based bilingual LM growing method. Compared to the existing approaches, the proposed method enables us to use bilingual parallel corpus for LM growing in SMT. The results show that our new method outperforms the existing approaches on both SMT performance and computational efficiency significantly.

AB This paper proposes a new pre-training method, called Code-Switching Pre-training (CSP for short) for Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Unlike traditional pre-training method which randomly masks some fragments of the input sentence, the proposed CSP randomly replaces some words in the source sentence with their translation words in the target language. Specifically, we firstly perform lexicon induction with unsupervised word embedding mapping between the source and target languages, and then randomly replace some words in the input sentence with their translation words according to the extracted translation lexicons. CSP adopts the encoderdecoder framework: its encoder takes the codemixed sentence as input, and its decoder predicts the replaced fragment of the input sentence. In this way, CSP is able to pre-train the NMT model by explicitly making the most of the cross-lingual alignment information extracted from the source and target monolingual corpus. Additionally, we relieve the pretrainfinetune discrepancy caused by the artificial symbols like [mask]. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on unsupervised and supervised NMT. Experimental results show that CSP achieves significant improvements over baselines without pre-training or with other pre-training methods.

TI SSA Translation Is an Abstract Interpretation
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Static single assignment (SSA) form is a popular intermediate representation that helps implement useful static analyses, including global value numbering (GVN), sparse dataflow analyses, or SMT-based abstract interpretation or model checking. However, the precision of the SSA translation itself depends on static analyses, and a priori static analysis is even indispensable in the case of low-level input languages like machine code. To solve this chicken-and-egg problem, we propose to turn the SSA translation into a standard static analysis based on abstract interpretation. This allows the SSA translation to be combined with other static analyses in a single pass, taking advantage of the fact that it is more precise to combine analyses than applying passes in sequence. We illustrate the practicality of these results by writing a simple dataflow analysis that performs SSA translation, optimistic global value numbering, sparse conditional constant propagation, and loop-invariant code motion in a single small pass; and by presenting a multi-language static analyzer for both C and machine code that uses the SSA abstract domain as its main intermediate representation.

TI Translator attribution for Arabic using machine learning
SO DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP IN THE HUMANITIES
AB Given a set of target language documents and their translators, the translator attribution task aims at identifying which translator translated which documents. The attribution and the identification of the translator's style could contribute to fields including translation studies, digital humanities, and forensic linguistics. To conduct this investigation, firstly, we develop a new corpus containing the translations of world-famous books into Arabic. We then pre-process the books in our corpus which mainly involves cleaning irrelevant material, morphological segmentation analysis of words, and devocalization. After pre-processing the books, we propose to use 100 most frequent words and/or morphologically segmented function words as writing style markers of the translators (i.e. stylometric features) to differentiate between translations of different translators. After the completion of features extraction process, we applied several supervised and unsupervised machine-learning algorithms along with our novel cluster-to-author index to perform this task. We found that the translators are not invisible, and morphological analysis may not be more useful than just using the 100 most frequent words as features. The support vector machine linear kernel algorithm reported 99% classification accuracy. Similar findings were reported by the unsupervised machine-learning methods, namely, K-mean clustering and hierarchical clustering.

AB This research proposed a new method Latent Semantic Indexing to overcome semantic problem on image retrieval based on automatic image annotation. Statistical machine translation used to automatically annotates the image. This approach considers image annotation as the translation of image regions to words, similar to the translation of text from one language to another. The "lexicon" for the translation is learned from large annotated image collections, which consist of images that are associated with text. Images are segmented into regions with grid segmentation. A pre-specified feature vector represents each region. The regions then clustered into a finite set of blobs. The correspondences between the blobs and the words are learned using Expectation Maximization algorithm. These correspondences are used to predict words associated with whole images (auto-annotation). The auto-annotation performance is evaluated using Normalized Score (ENs) algorithm. The experimental results show that the average precision of clause queries achieved best result than word queries, 0.544 and 0.251 for clause queries and word queries respectively. The proposed method of latent semantic indexing succeeds to exploit semantic value of automatic-annotation-based image retrieval.

AB We have paid attention to the favors of Machine Translation (MT) users for a few years, and found that. most users prefer that the system is fast, inexpensive, easy to control, and easy to update. This means that some times we do not need to aim a MT system with high fluency of the translations. At fact, usually we call not build such MT system which can get a high fluency of the translations. According the viewpoint, we have proposed a new MT paradigm called Super-Function Based Machine Translation(SFBMT) to try to address the MT users' requests. SFBMT uses Super Function(SF) to translate without thorough syntactic and semantic analysis as most MT systems usually do. The SF is a function that shows the correspondence between original language sentence patterns and target language sentence patterns. One key point for building a. SFBMT system is how to acquire the SF from the practical natural language phenomenon. In this paper, we present a method for aiding human to acquire the SF from parallel corpus, and describe the TOOL called MKSF. MKSF has been constructed in JAVA. A experimental MT system based on proposed method has been built using JAVA and some translation experiments have carried out.

AB Generative models have become adept at producing artifacts such as images, videos, and prose at human-like levels of proficiency. New generative techniques, such as unsupervised neural machine translation (NMT), have recently been applied to the task of generating source code, translating it from one programming language to another. The artifacts produced in this way may contain imperfections, such as compilation or logical errors. We examine the extent to which software engineers would tolerate such imperfections and explore ways to aid the detection and correction of those errors. Using a design scenario approach, we interviewed 11 software engineers to understand their reactions to the use of an NMT model in the context of application modernization, focusing on the task of translating source code from one language to another. Our threes-tage scenario sparked discussions about the utility and desirability of working with an imperfect AI system, how acceptance of that system's outputs would be established, and future opportunities for generative AI in application modernization. Our study highlights how UI features such as confidence highlighting and alternate translations help software engineers work with and better understand generative NMT models.

AB Machine Translation (MT) has been one of the classic AI tasks from the early days of the field. Portuguese and Chinese are languages with a very large number of native speakers, though this does not carry through to the amount of literature on their processing, or to the amount of resources available to be used, in particular when compared with English. In this paper, we address the feasibility of creating a MT system for Portuguese-Chinese, using only freely available resources, by experimenting with various approaches to pairing source and target parallel data during training. These approaches are (i) using a model for each source-target language pair, (ii) using an intermediate pivot language, and (iii) using a single model that can translate from any language seen in the source side to any language seen on the target side. We find approaches whose performance is higher than that of the strong baseline consisting of an MT service provided by an IT industry giant for the pair Portuguese-Chinese.

AB Machine Transliteration is to transcribe a word written in a script with approximate phonetic equivalence in another language. It is useful for machine translation, cross-lingual information retrieval, multilingual text and speech processing. Punjabi Machine Transliteration (PMT) is a special case of machine transliteration and is a process of converting a word from Shahmukhi (based on Arabic script) to Gurmukhi (derivation of Landa, Shardha and Takri, old scripts of Indian subcontinent), two scripts of Punjabi, irrespective of the type of word.
   The Punjabi Machine Transliteration System uses transliteration rules (character mappings and dependency rules) for transliteration of Shahmukhi words into Gurmukhi. The PMT system can transliterate every word written in Shahmukhi.

SO INTERPRETER AND TRANSLATOR TRAINER
AB Though students are taught translation technology, when confronted with real-life translation tasks, they frequently fail to use technologies flexibly and properly. To address this issue, this study first highlighted the concept of translation technological thinking competence (TTTC) and its significance. Then it proposed the Knowing-Acting Translation Curriculum (KATC), characterised by integrating knowledge-based design, problem-oriented learning, in-class interactive modelling and near-authentic translation projects. Further, the study investigated: 1) Is KATC an effective approach to developing students' TTTC? 2) How does TTTC influence translation performance? To answer the questions, a quasi-experimental/empirical study was conducted with two groups of comparable translation students, one group given the KATC-based teaching intervention. The results show that: 1) KATC is an effective approach in improving students' TTTC, measured by enhanced performance in solving real-life translation technological problems; 2) TTTC is positively correlated with overall translation quality. Therefore, we argue that the ultimate goal of translation technology teaching is to help students become technological thinkers with high TTTC, who can maximise the power of technology to act professionally and technologically, particularly in solving translation problems that require discretionary judgment and action.

AB The authors of this paper wish to present a dynamical-machine-parts calculation algorithm which will be used in the choice of the motors for the translation and rotation modules from the mechanical structure of the studied robot, without bringing any changes to the structure of the already designed modules. The algorithm will focus on the robot's movement differential equations deduced with the help of the Lagrange formalism, and then these equations will be equalled to the machine-parts equations used in the design of the translation and rotation modules which are part of the industrial robot type TRTRR.
   Following the application of the algorithm, the expressions of the motor moments will be deduced, and then using numeric values from catalogues the direct current servomotors will be chosen which will drive the mobile equipments of the studied robot. In this paper the authors will present the concept and the design of the translation modules MTV-Sil and MT-Sil, as well as those of the 2 degree of freedom robot orientation module MO-Mih.

TI Deep Learning-based Roman-Urdu to Urdu Transliteration
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Attention-based encoder-decoder models have superseded conventional techniques due to their unmatched performance on many neural machine translation problems. Usually, the encoders and decoders are two recurrent neural networks where the decoder is directed to focus on relevant parts of the source language using attention mechanism. This data-driven approach leads to generic and scalable solutions with no reliance on manual hand-crafted features. To the best of our knowledge, none of the modern machine translation approaches has been applied to address the research problem of Urdu machine transliteration. Ours is the first attempt to apply the deep neural network-based encoder-decoder using attention mechanism to address the aforementioned problem using Roman-Urdu and Urdu parallel corpus. To this end, we present (i) the first ever Roman-Urdu to Urdu parallel corpus of 1.1 million sentences, (ii) three state of the art encoder-decoder models, and (iii) a detailed empirical analysis of these three models on the Roman-Urdu to Urdu parallel corpus. Overall, attention-based model gives state-of-the-art performance with the benchmark of 70 BLEU score. Our qualitative experimental evaluation shows that our models generate coherent transliterations which are grammatically and logically correct.

AB Machine translation services available on the Web are becoming increasingly popular. However, a pivot translation service is required to realize translations between non-English languages by cascading different translation services via English. As a result, the meaning of words often drifts due to the inconsistency, asymmetry and intransitivity of word selections among translation services. In this paper, we propose context-based coordination to maintain the consistency of word meanings during pivot translation services. First, we propose a method to automatically generate multilingual equivalent terms based on bilingual dictionaries and use generated terms to propagate context among combined translation services. Second, we show a multiagent architecture as one way of implementation, wherein a coordinator agent gathers and propagates context from/to a translation agent. We generated trilingual equivalent noun terms and implemented a Japanese-to-German-and-back translation, cascading into four translation services. The evaluation results showed that the generated terms can cover over 58% of all nouns. The translation quality was improved by 40% for all sentences, and the quality rating for all sentences increased by an average of 0.47 points on a five-point scale. These results indicate that we can realize consistent pivot translation services through context-based coordination based on existing services.

TI TEACHING MACHINE TRANSLATION TO THE STUDENTS MAJORING IN THE HUMANITIES
SO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND LEARNING TOOLS
AB Problems of machine translation (MT) are currently the most topical vectors determining the development of translators' proficiency content, which is reflected in the diversity of approaches to improving the algorithms of knowledge applications in this field. We recognize the urgency of theoretical substantiation of the students' training quality (we mean the training of the future philologists and translators) in terms of using ICT, since their proficiency in the designated sphere might facilitate their natural and rapid adaptation to professional activity and competitiveness in the labour market. The analysis of professional literature showed the importance of using computer technology while training future translators in machine translation and proved that not all the reserves for its effective provision have been used. The urgency of the problem and lack of its proper development stipulated the purpose of the article. to analyse and develop educational tools that contribute to the formation of a system of knowledge and skills related to the use of modern computer technologies in the process of professional activity (on the material of the English, Chinese and Ukrainian languages). A spectrum of the MT programs classified based on human's involvement in the process of converting the original text into a target text (FAMT, HAMT, MAHT) has been represented in the article. The criteria (professional competency of the future translators in the field of the English-Ukrainian MT, professional competency of the future translators in the Chinese-Ukrainian MT), indicators (content-significant, procedural-technological and lexicographic search-oriented) and levels (high, sufficient, satisfactory, low) specifying the degree of students' proficiency (knowledge, skills and abilities) in using modern computer technology within the framework of profession-oriented activities have been elaborated. The proposed authors' teaching techniques included the use of the competence-oriented and context-based approaches to the educational process, the integration of traditional and new interactive methods / forms of learning, the combination of classroom and extra-class activities involving ICT. We see the prospects of our research in the further study of educational aspects of machine translation grounded on the latest developments in the fields of comparative linguistics and general theory of translation (theory of regular correspondences, methods of representing knowledge, optimizing and improving linguistic algorithms, in particular).

AB Syntax has been demonstrated highly effective in neural machine translation (NMT). Previous NMT models integrate syntax by representing 1-best tree outputs from a well-trained parsing system, e.g., the representative Tree-RNN and Tree-Linearization methods, which may suffer from error propagation. In this work, we propose a novel method to integrate source-side syntax implicitly for NMT. The basic idea is to use the intermediate hidden representations of a well-trained end-to-end dependency parser, which are referred to as syntax-aware word representations (SAWRs). Then, we simply concatenate such SAWRs with ordinary word embeddings to enhance basic NMT models. The method can be straightforwardly integrated into the widely-used sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) NMT models. We start with a representative RNN-based Seq2Seq baseline system, and test the effectiveness of our proposed method on two benchmark datasets of the Chinese-English and English-Vietnamese translation tasks, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to bring significant BLEU score improvements on the two datasets compared with the baseline, 1.74 points for Chinese-English translation and 0.80 point for English-Vietnamese translation, respectively. In addition, the approach also outperforms the explicit Tree-RNN and Tree-Linearization methods.

SO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND LEARNING TOOLS
AB The article deals with exploring the potential of IT in the process of English as a language of speciality (English for special purposes, ESP) teaching. The authors presented the results of the pedagogical research carried out at the National Aviation University, Ukraine. To increase the efficiency of teaching Aviation English, a new approach was applied, which was based on students' ability to be engaged in online activities and use digital tools naturally. The approach is characterized by the guided use of the machine translator Google Translate and Multitran online dictionary in the process of learning English as a language of speciality to develop students' skills in the correct application of online lexicographic materials. To test the effectiveness of the new approach, the research was conducted, in which students of the experimental group were taught with the use of the mentioned online reference tools under the teacher's guidance. The results of the research provide information about the positive influence of the approach on the development of the experimental group students' professional English competence compared with the students from the control group. It proves that properly designed and purposefully introduced complex language learning activities involving online reference tools (online machine translator and online dictionary) made a positive influence on the students' level of knowledge and can be employed in the process of language learning in non-linguistic universities. The conclusion was made that online dictionaries and translation machines are valid tools for improving the foreign language skills of students of non-linguistic universities. Benefits and disadvantages of using online dictionaries and machine translators in the ESP learning process were explored and it was concluded that online dictionaries (OD) and machine translation (MT) tools make it possible to check the meaning of a word, provide a wealth of important information about lexical elements, technical terms and idiomatic expressions. In the paper, some examples of students' educational activities in Aviation English teaching with the use of online reference tools are given.

TI Examining translation behaviour of Turkish student translators in
   scientific text translation with think-aloud protocols
SO META
AB The process of translation has been dramatically influenced by the latest developments in technology. Students' behaviours during the translation process have also changed as they try to seek information and use different resources. This study aims to investigate the translation behaviour of students in an English translation department. For this purpose, 11 students were recruited. The students were asked to translate a scientific text from English into Turkish. For the analysis of their translation behaviour, Think-Aloud Protocols (TAPs) and their translated texts were used. Monologue Protocol was used to see what goes on in a prospective translator's mind. The students were audio-recorded while translating. Then, the translations were scored and the transcriptions of the recordings were coded. The results were presented under three main themes: (i) Recruiting translation tools: when and how, (ii) Following a pattern of translation process, and (iii) Challenges: language(s), context and more. All in all, the present study highlights the importance of guiding students in the use of the appropriate tools for the translation of specialised texts, and also suggests that student translators should be more critical of Machine Translation outputs and should practice post-editing procedures in their courses.

The objective of the research is to determine the worldwide advances in language learning using ML in order to support and encourage researchers to undertake further experimental research in this area. The amount of research on language learning and ML requires a systematic review of the literature, limiting the review years between 2016 and 2021. The sources consulted are: Taylor & Francis, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, ARDI y ERIC. The studies initially found were 55237, after applying rigorous exclusion criteria 82 papers were obtained. The results of the review conclude that the most used technique for language learning using ML is support vector machine (SVM), followed by K-means (K-M) and the way the concepts have evolved tend to learning automation. The review gives us an approach to the trends in language learning with ML. In addition, the keywords that present more co-occurrence in the research are "machine learning", "natural language processing" and "machine translation".

AB Speech-to-text translation (ST), which directly translates the source language speech to the target language text, has attracted intensive attention recently. However, the combination of speech recognition and machine translation in a single model poses a heavy burden on the direct cross-modal cross-lingual mapping. To reduce the learning difficulty, we propose COnSecutive Transcription and Translation (COSTT), an integral approach for speech-to-text translation. The key idea is to generate source transcript and target translation text with a single decoder. It benefits the model training so that additional large parallel text corpus can be fully exploited to enhance the speech translation training. Our method is verified on three mainstream datasets, including Augmented LibriSpeech English-French dataset, TED English-German dataset, and TED English-Chinese dataset. Experiments show that our proposed COSTT outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/ dqqcasia/st.

AB AppTek and RWTH Aachen University team together to participate in the offline and simultaneous speech translation tracks of IWSLT 2020. For the offline task, we create both cascaded and end-to-end speech translation systems, paying attention to careful data selection and weighting. In the cascaded approach, we combine high-quality hybrid automatic speech recognition (ASR) with the Transformer-based neural machine translation (NMT). Our end-to-end direct speech translation systems benefit from pretraining of adapted encoder and decoder components, as well as synthetic data and fine-tuning and thus are able to compete with cascaded systems in terms of MT quality. For simultaneous translation, we utilize a novel architecture that makes dynamic decisions, learned from parallel data, to determine when to continue feeding on input or generate output words. Experiments with speech and text input show that even at low latency this architecture leads to superior translation results.

AB In recent years, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has been proven to get impressive results. While some additional linguistic features of input words improve word level NMT, any additional character features have not been used to improve character-level NMT so far. In this paper, we show that the radicals of Chinese characters (or kanji), as a character feature information, can be easily provide further improvements in the character-level NMT. In experiments on WAT2016 Japanese-Chinese scientific paper excerpt corpus (ASPEC-JP), we find that the proposed method improves the translation quality according to two aspects: perplexity and BLEU. The character-level NMT with the radical input feature's model got a state-of-the-art result of 40.61 BLEU points in the test set, which is an improvement of about 8.6 BLEU points over the best system on the WAT2016 Japanese to -Chinese translation subtask with AS PEC-JP. The improvements over the character-level NMT with no additional input feature are up to about 1.5 and 1.4 BLEU points in the development-test set and the test set of the corpus, respectively.

TI Challenges in the construction of automatic translators for indigenous
   languages of Mexico
SO DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP IN THE HUMANITIES
AB Machine translation is a tool that, even with its limitations, allows access to ideas and information between languages. Its adoption for the indigenous languages of Mexico could revalue them in the eyes of speakers who face the situation of which digital systems do not use them in their interfaces. In this paper we present results of the first translators of five indigenous languages: Mexicanero, Nahuatl, Purepecha, Wixarika and Yorem Nokki, with Spanish; but more importantly we present a reflection on the lessons learned during this effort and the challenges to be able to make functional machine translation systems for the indigenous languages of Mexico.

Based on the investigated displacement and inverse kinematics, the system stiffness of the parallel manipulator is conducted. Then in order to observe the highest system stiffness single and multi objective optimizations are performed in terms of rotation angles about x and y axis and translation displacement along z axe. Finally, a case study of tool path planning is presented to demonstrate the application of stiffness mapping.

AB Parallel corpora available for building machine translation (MT) models for dialectal Arabic (DA) are rather limited. The scarcity of resources has prompted the use of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) abundant resources to complement the limited dialectal resource. However, clitics often differ between MSA and DA. This paper compares morphology-aware DA word segmentation to other word segmentation approaches like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and Sub-word Regularization (SR). A set of experiments conducted on Egyptian Arabic (EA), Levantine Arabic (LA), and Gulf Arabic (GA) show that a sufficiently accurate morphology-aware segmentation used in conjunction with BPE or SR outperforms the other word segmentation approaches.

AB Most of the existing Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models focus on the conversion of sequential data and do not directly use syntactic information. We propose a novel end-to-end syntactic NMT model, extending a sequence-to-sequence model with the source-side phrase structure. Our model has an attention mechanism that enables the decoder to generate a translated word while softly aligning it with phrases as well as words of the source sentence. Experimental results on the WAT'15 English-to-Japanese dataset demonstrate that our proposed model considerably outperforms sequence-to-sequence attentional NMT models and compares favorably with the state-of-the-art tree-to-string SMT system.

EU competitiveness is analyzed in comparison to North America and Asia. The study focuses on seven dimensions (research, innovations, investments, market dominance, industry, infrastructure, and Open Data) that have been selected to characterize the language technology market. The study concludes that while Europe still has strong positions in Research and Innovation, it lags behind North America and Asia in scaling innovations and conquering market share.

This system collects, organizes and visualizes data such as problems of foreign visitors in a city, thereby allowing city officials use that information for making decisions on various city policies. Furthermore, foreigners can be supported by the volunteers from city officials through exchanges of posts and comments in the application. One major problem is that many volunteers are not good at English. To alleviate this language barrier, we adopt a machine translation service and verified whether the service can serve as a communication method between application users.

AB We consider three sub-logics of the logic (+/-HP)*[FO(s)] (introduced in [Ste90]) and show that these sub-logics capture the complexity classes obtained by considering logspace deterministic oracle Turing machines with oracles in NP where the number of oracle calls is unrestricted and constant, respectively; that is, the classes L(NP) and L(NP)[O(1)]. We conclude that if certain logics are of the same expressibility then the Polynomial Hierarchy collapses. We also exhibit some new complete problems for the complexity class L(NP) via projection translations (the first to be discovered: projection translations are extremely weak logical reductions between problems).

The goal of ParaCrawl is to get parallel data that is good for machine translation. To prove so, both, automatic (extrinsic) and human (intrinsic and extrinsic) evaluation tasks have been included as part of the quality assessment activity of the project. We sum up the various methods followed to address these evaluation tasks for the web-crawled corpora produced and their results. We review their advantages and disadvantages for the final goal of the ParaCrawl project and the related ongoing project MaCoCu.

AB We experiment with unsupervised methods for deriving and clustering symbolic representations of speech, working towards speech-to-speech translation for languages without regular (or any) written representations. We consider five low-resource African languages, and we produce three different segmental representations of text data for comparisons against four different segmental representations derived solely from acoustic data for each language. The text and speech data for each language comes from the CMU Wilderness dataset introduced in [1], where speakers read a version of the New Testament in their language. Our goal is to evaluate the translation performance not only of acoustically derived units but also of discovered sequences or "words" made from these units, with the intuition that such representations will encode more meaning than phones alone. We train statistical machine translation models for each representation and evaluate their outputs on the basis of BLEU-1 scores to determine their efficacy. Our experiments produce encouraging results: as we cluster our atomic phonetic representations into more word-like units, the amount information retained generally approaches that of the actual words themselves.

TI Fully Attentional Network for Low-Resource Academic Machine Translation

SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB English is accepted as an academic language in the world. This necessitates the use of English in their academic studies for speakers of other languages. Even when these researchers are competent in the use of the English language, some mistakes may occur while writing an academic article. To solve this problem, academicians tend to use automatic translation programs or get assistance from people with an advanced level of English. This study offers an expert system to enable assistance to the researchers throughout their academic article writing process. In this study, Turkish which is considered among low-resource languages is used as the source language. The proposed model combines the transformer encoder-decoder architecture model with the pre-trained Sci-BERT language model via the shallow fusion method. The model uses a Fully Attentional Network Layer instead of a Feed-Forward Network Layer in the known shallow fusion method. In this way, a higher success rate could be achieved by increasing the attention at the word level. Different metrics were used to evaluate the created model. The model created as a result of the experiments reached 45.1 BLEU and 73.2 METEOR scores. In addition, the proposed model achieved 20.12 and 20.56 scores, respectively, with the zero-shot translation method in the World Machine Translation (2017-2018) test datasets. The proposed method could inspire other low-resource languages to include the language model in the translation system. In this study, a corpus composed entirely of academic sentences is also introduced to be used in the translation system. The corpus consists of 1.2 million parallel sentences. The proposed model and corpus are made available to researchers on our GitHub page.

AB Generalization and reliability of multilingual translation often highly depend on the amount of available parallel data for each language pair of interest. In this paper, we focus on zero-shot generalization-a challenging setup that tests models on translation directions they have not been optimized for at training time. To solve the problem, we (i) reformulate multilingual translation as probabilistic inference, (ii) define the notion of zero-shot consistency and show why standard training often results in models unsuitable for zero-shot tasks, and (iii) introduce a consistent agreement-based training method that encourages the model to produce equivalent translations of parallel sentences in auxiliary languages. We test our multilingual NMT models on multiple public zero-shot translation benchmarks (IWSLT17, UN corpus, Europarl) and show that agreement-based learning often results in 2-3 BLEU zeroshot improvement over strong baselines without any loss in performance on supervised translation directions.

AB In order to extract the best possible performance from asynchronous stochastic gradient descent one must increase the mini-batch size and scale the learning rate accordingly. In order to achieve further speedup we introduce a technique that delays gradient updates effectively increasing the mini-batch size. Unfortunately with the increase of mini-batch size we worsen the stale gradient problem in asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (SGD) which makes the model convergence poor. We introduce local optimizers which mitigate the stale gradient problem and together with fine tuning our momentum we are able to train a shallow machine translation system 27% faster than an optimized baseline with negligible penalty in BLEU.

The transcriptions also include annotations for code-switching and non-standard pronunciations. We also provide baseline results on three core NLP tasks: speech recognition, speech synthesis, and machine translation between Spanish and Mapudungun. We further explore other applications for which the corpus will be suitable, including the study of code-switching, historical orthography change, linguistic structure, and sociological and anthropological studies.

AB We describe our submission to the IWSLT 2021 shared task1 on simultaneous text-to-text English-German translation. Our system is based on the re-translation approach where the agent re-translates the whole source pre-fix each time it receives a new source token. This approach has the advantage of being able to use a standard neural machine translation (NMT) inference engine with beam search, however, there is a risk that incompatibility between successive re-translations will degrade the output. To improve the quality of the translations, we experiment with various approaches: we use a fixed size wait at the beginning of the sentence, we use a language model score to detect translatable units, and we apply dynamic masking to determine when the translation is unstable. We find that a combination of dynamic masking and language model score obtains the best latency-quality trade-off.

AB Metaphoric expressions are widespread in natural language, posing a significant challenge for various natural language processing tasks such as Machine Translation. Current word embedding based metaphor identification models cannot identify the exact metaphorical words within a sentence. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning method that identifies and interprets metaphors at word-level without any preprocessing, outperforming strong baselines in the metaphor identification task. Our model extends to interpret the identified metaphors, paraphrasing them into their literal counterparts, so that they can be better translated by machines. We evaluated this with two popular translation systems for English to Chinese, showing that our model improved the systems significantly.

The statistics reveals that probability of clause complex level errors is relatively high and that the occurrence of errors is different across genres and positively related to the length of clause complex. It is hoped that the study could bring enlightenment for MT systems to process inter-clausal relationship in clause complexes.

TI High Quality Rather than High Model Probability: Minimum Bayes Risk
   Decoding with Neural Metrics
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB In Neural Machine Translation, it is typically assumed that the sentence with the highest estimated probability should also be the translation with the highest quality as measured by humans. In this work, we question this assumption and show that model estimates and translation quality only vaguely correlate. We apply Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding on unbiased samples to optimize diverse automated metrics of translation quality as an alternative inference strategy to beam search. Instead of targeting the hypotheses with the highest model probability, MBR decoding extracts the hypotheses with the highest estimated quality. Our experiments show that the combination of a neural translation model with a neural reference-based metric, Bleurt, results in significant improvement in human evaluations. This improvement is obtained with translations different from classical beam-search output: These translations have much lower model likelihood and are less favored by surface metrics like Bleu.

N-grams are relevant words of text document that can be applied for a range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. The candidate paraphrases are generated based on trigrams approach. The reference paraphrases (keyphrases) are the set of relevant paraphrases, which acts like training data set for generating candidate paraphrases. The task of paraphrase generation is similar to machine translation; hence we used machine translation evaluation metrics. R-precision evaluation metric is used to find the number of common words between candidate and reference paraphrases.

AB In this paper, we introduce a system built for the Duolingo Simultaneous Translation And Paraphrase for Language Education (STA-PLE) shared task at the 4th Workshop on Neural Generation and Translation (WNGT 2020). We participated in the English-to-Japanese track with a Transformer model pretrained on the JParaCrawl corpus and fine-tuned in two steps on the JESC corpus and then the (smaller) Duolingo training corpus. First, during training, we find it is essential to deliberately expose the model to higher-quality translations more often during training for optimal translation performance. For inference, encouraging a small amount of diversity with Diverse Beam Search to improve translation coverage yielded marginal improvement over regular Beam Search. Finally, using an auxiliary filtering model to filter out unlikely candidates from Beam Search improves performance further. We achieve a weighted F1 score of 27.56% on our own test set, outperforming the STAPLE AWS translations baseline score of 4.31%.

SO TRANSLATION SPACES
AB This article argues that researchers in Translation Studies may proactively aim to understand the consequences of an envisaged merger between targeted advertising and automated translation. Functional translation software is widely available online, and several platforms now perform instant translation, sometimes without asking the user whether this is required. Indeed, the user's main language is known to various applications, which keep track of this information along with other settings and preferences. Data tracking is commonly used to produce targeted advertising: people receive commercial information about products they are likely to be interested in. If text can instantly be altered according to a user's linguistic preferences, it can also be altered according to aesthetic, commercial, or political preferences. The article discusses theoretical and ideological aspects of the sociotechnical evolution towards the production and consumption of personalised content, highlighting the role translation may come to play.

AB This paper presents a phrase-based speech translation system that combines phrasal lexicon, language, and acoustic model features in a loglinear model. Automatic speech recognition and machine translation are coupled by using large word lattices as the input for translation. For the first time, all features are directly integrated into the decoding process. The feature weights are iteratively optimized for an objective error measure. We prove that acoustic recognition scores of the recognized words in the lattices together with a source language model score positively and significantly affect the translation quality. We show the advantage of using loglinear model combination for a robust optimization of scaling factors. We report consistent improvements compared with translations of single best recognition output on an Italian-to-English translation task. First encouraging results were also obtained on a large vocabulary task of translating European parliamentary speeches.

AB The SIBI gesture translation framework by Rakun was built using a series of machine learning technologies: MobileNetV2 for feature extraction, Conditional Random Field for finding the epenthesis movement frame, and Long Short-Term Memory for word classification. This high computational translation system was previously implemented on a personal computer system, which lacks portability and accessibility. This study implemented the system on a smartphone using an on-device inference method: the translation process is embedded into the smartphone to provide lower latency and zero data usage. The system was then improved using a parallel multi-inference method, which reduced the average translation time by 25%. The final mobile SIBI gesture-to-text translation system achieved a word accuracy of 90.560%, a sentence accuracy of 64%, and an average translation time of 20 seconds.

TI Exploring Multi-Stage Information Interactions for Multi-Source Neural
   Machine Translation
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Existing studies for multi-source neural machine translation (NMT) either separately model different source sentences or resort to the conventional single-source NMT by simply concatenating all source sentences. However, there exist two drawbacks in these approaches. First, they ignore the explicit word-level semantic interactions between source sentences, which have been shown effective in the embeddings of multilingual texts. Second, multiple source sentences are simultaneously encoded by an NMT model, which is unable to fully exploit the semantic information of each source sentence. In this paper, we explore multi-stage information interactions for multi-source NMT. Specifically, we first propose a multi-source NMT model that performs information interactions at the encoding stage. Its encoder contains multiple semantic interaction layers, each of which sequentially consists of (1) monolingual semantic interaction sub-layer, which is based on the self-attention mechanism and used to learn word-level monolingual contextual representations of source sentences, and (2) cross-lingual semantic interaction sub-layer, which leverages word alignments to perform fine-grained semantic transitions among hidden states of different source sentences. Furthermore, at the training stage, we introduce a mutual distillation based training framework, where single-source models and ours perform information interactions. Such framework can fully exploit the semantic information of each source sentence to enhance our model. Extensive experimental results on the WMT14 English-German-French dataset show our method exhibits significant improvements upon competitive baselines.

TI The translator's visibility: Detecting translatorial fingerprints in
   contemporaneous parallel translations
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB We detail the results of experiments towards a fine-grained stylometric analysis, the identification of distinguishing features between contemporaneous literary translations, both parallel works and also translations of non-parallel sets of works by the same author. We examine translations of plays by the Norwegian dramatist Henrik Ibsen with the initial point of focus being the Ibsen drama Ghosts, for which there exists comparable contemporaneous translations by R. Farqhuarson Sharp and William Archer. Consequently, a number of prose translations of Russian author Anton Chekhov by Marian Fell and Constance Garnett are examined in order to validate hypotheses formed from the results of the Ibsen study and investigate possible particularities in translator' s style which may vary according to genre.
   By carrying out an analysis of these texts using a variety of machine learning approaches such as Support Vector Machines, Simple Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree classifiers, a number of distinguishing textual features are obtained, and the relative frequency of these features in the texts are compared to their frequencies in reference corpora in order to establish which features can be attributed to stylistic choices by the translators themselves and which features may be due to influence from the source language or the topic or genre of a text. We also use the popular Delta metric from authorship attribution studies to investigate the clustering of texts based on most frequent words and a list of discriminatory terms learned in the supervised machine learning experiments.
   We find that common word unigrams and bigrams are the most salient features for translator fingerprinting across our two authors and four translators examined and are ultimately successful in our goal of classifying which text originated from a particular translator with accuracy measurements of over 90% on average.

AB We speed up Neural Machine Translation (NMT) decoding by shrinking run-time target vocabulary. We experiment with two shrinking approaches: Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and word alignments. Using the latter method, we get a 2x overall speed-up over a highly-optimized GPU implementation, without hurting BLEU. On certain low-resource language pairs, the same methods improve BLEU by 0.5 points. We also report a negative result for LSH on GPUs, due to relatively large overhead, though it was successful on CPUs. Compared with Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), decoding with word alignments is GPU-friendly, orthogonal to existing speedup methods and more robust across language pairs.

Although the LEP population in the US is growing and federal regulations require availability of translated health promotion materials, availability of these materials is lacking, partially due to the costs and time required to produce high quality translations. We conducted semistructured interviews with employees involved in the translation process at three local health districts (LHDs) in Washington State to explore the potential for novel technologies to assist in the creation of multilingual health promotion materials. We generated a translation workflow diagram and analyzed key themes that affected the translation process. We also explored employees' opinions regarding electronic document exchange and machine translation technology (MT). Overall, public health employees were open to the incorporation of information technologies to speed the translation and dissemination of multilingual public health materials if quality could be assured.

TI An Evaluation of the Accuracy of the Machine Translation Systems of
   Social Media Language: Google's Arabic-English Translation as an Example
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB In this age of information technology, it has become possible for people all over the world to communicate in different languages through social media platforms with the help of machine translation (MT) systems. As far as the Arabic-English language pair is concerned, most studies have been conducted on evaluating the MT output for the standard varieties of Arabic, with fewer studies focusing on the vernacular or colloquial varieties. This study attempts to address this gap through presenting an evaluation of the performance of MT output for vernacular or colloquial Arabic in the social media domain. As it is currently the most widely used MT system, Google Translate (GT) has been chosen for evaluating the reliability of its output in the context of translating the Arabic colloquial language (i.e., Egyptian/Cairene Arabic variety) used in social media into English. With this goal in mind, a corpus consisting of Egyptian dialectal Arabic sentences were collected from social media networks, i.e., Facebook and Twitter, and then fed into GT system. The GT output was then evaluated by three human translators to assess their accuracy of translation in terms of adequacy and fluency. The results of the study show that several translation problems have been spotted for GT output. These problems are mainly concerned with wrong equivalents, inappropriate additions and deletions, and transliteration for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, which are mostly due to the literal translation of the Arabic vernacular sentences into English. This can be due to the fact that Arabic vernacular varieties are different from the standard language for which MT systems have been basically developed. This, consequently, necessitates the need to upgrade such MT systems to deal with the vernacular varieties.

These experiments were performed on forty-six healthy subjects; twenty-six young and twenty elderly. Subjects stood on a machine specifically designed to test balance after forward translations of the body. As to forward translation stimuli, the time took 0.15 [s], and the distance of its displacements were classified into six; 3.75, 7.50, 10.00, 15.00, 20.00, 30.00 [mm], In the translation displacement from 3.75 to 15.00[mm], sway of COP showed a tendency to increase. These results indicated that the individual ability of posture control might be amenable to assessment by means of measuring sway of the center of gravity after translation stimuli.

AB One of the most important issues in machine translations is deducing unknown rules from pairs of input-output sentences. Since the translations are expressed by elementary formal systems (EFS's, for short), we formalize learning translations as the process of guessing an unknown EFS from pairs of input-output sentences. In this paper, we propose a class of EFS's called linearly-moded EFS's by introducing local variables and linear predicate inequalities based on mode information, which can express translations of context-sensitive languages. We show that, for: a given input sentence, the set of all output sentences is finite and computable in a translation defined by a linearly-moded EFS. Finally, we show that the class of translations defined by linearly-moded EFS's is learnable under the condition that the number of clauses in an EFS and the length of the clause are bounded by some constant.

In particular, we first use a graph-based model to output the most semantic similarity languages; then, a random forest model is built which integrates features such as data size, language family, word formation, morpheme overlap, word order, POS tag and syntax similarity together to predict the final target language(s). Experimental results on several datasets show that our method achieves consistent improvements over existing approaches both on language selection and multilingual NMT.

AB Compared with ordinary text, patent text in Chinese often has more complex sentence structure and more ambiguity of multiple verbs, which brings more difficulties in patent machine translation. To deal with these problems, this paper presents an improved dependency tree and a method to recognize the root of this tree for Chinese-English patent machine translation. Based on the theory of Hierarchical Network of Concepts (the HNC theory), some semantic features are used in the recognition. Experiments show that the precision of the recognition is close to 85%.

AB Viterbi Alignment and Decoding are two fundamental search problems in Statistical Machine Translation. Both the problems are known to be NP-hard and therefore, it is unlikely that there exists an optimal polynomial time algorithm for either of these search problems. In this paper we characterize exponentially large subspaces in the solution space of Viterbi Alignment and Decoding. Each of these subspaces admits polynomial time optimal search algorithms. We propose a local search heuristic using a neighbourhood relation on these subspaces. Experimental results show that our algorithms produce better solutions taking substantially less time than the previously known algorithms for these problems.

Our architecture features neural machine translation generating output of preferred length, prosodic alignment of the translation with the original speech segments, neural text-to-speech with fine tuning of the duration of each utterance, and, finally, audio rendering to enriches text-to-speech output with background noise and reverberation extracted from the original audio. We report and discuss results of a first subjective evaluation of automatic dubbing of excerpts of TED Talks from English into Italian, which measures the perceived naturalness of automatic dubbing and the relative importance of each proposed enhancement.

AB In spoken language translation, integration of the ASR and MT components is critical for good performance. In this paper, we consider the recognition setting where a text translation of each utterance is also available. We present experiments with different ASR system adaptation techniques to exploit MT system outputs. In particular, N -best MT outputs are represented as an utterance-specific language model, which are then used to rescore ASR lattices. We show that this method improves significantly over ASR alone, resulting in an absolute WER reduction of more than 6 % for both indomain and out-of-domain acoustic models.

AB To enable knowledge access across languages, ontologies, mostly represented only in English, need to be translated into different languages. The main challenge in translating ontologies with machine translation is to disambiguate an ontology label with respect to the domain modelled by the ontology itself; however, a crucial requirement is to have translations validated by experts before the ontologies are deployed. Real-world applications have to implement a support system addressing this task to help experts in validating automatically generated translations. In this paper, we present ESSOT, an Expert Supporting System for Ontology Translation. The peculiarity of this system is to exploit the semantic information of the label's context to improve the quality of label translations. The system has been tested within the Organic. Lingua project by translating the modelled ontology in three languages, whereby the results are compared with translations provided by the Microsoft Translator API. The provided results demonstrate the viability of our proposed approach.

TI Algorithms for statistical translation of spoken language
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SPEECH AND AUDIO PROCESSING
AB In this paper, we describe three approaches to statistical translation and present experimental results. The statistical translation approach uses two types of information: a translation model and a language model. The language model used is a bigram or general m-gram model. The translation model is decomposed into a lexical model and an alignment model. There are three approaches that are presented and tested in detail: the quasimonotone alignment approach, the inverted alignment approach, and the alignment template approach. For each of these three approaches, a suitable search method is presented. The system has been tested on a Limited-domain spoken-language task for which a bilingual corpus is available: the Verbmobil task (German-English, 7000-word vocabulary). We present experimental results for each of the three approaches. The experimental tests were performed on both the text transcription and the speech recognizer output.

AB We combined the mutual information score and TFxIDF score (IR score) in order to select the best keyword translation in our transitive translation. The transitive translation used bilingual dictionaries to translate Indonesian query into Japanese keywords. The Japanese keywords are then used as the input to retrieve Japanese documents. The keyword selection is done in two steps, The first step is to sort translation candidates according to their mutual information scores calculated from a monolingual target language corpus. The second step is to select the best candidate set among 5 top mutual information scores based on their TFxIDF scores. The experiment against NTCIR-3 Web Retrieval Task data shows that the keyword selection based on this combination achieved higher IR score than a direct translation method using original Indonesian-Japanese dictionary and also higher than the machine translation result using Kataku (Indonesian-English) and Babelfish (English-Japanese) engines.

AB Machine translation of user-generated codemixed inputs to English is of crucial importance in applications like web search and targeted advertising. We address the scarcity of parallel training data for training such models by designing a strategy of converting existing non-code-mixed parallel data sources to codemixed parallel data. We present an mBERT based procedure whose core learnable component is a ternary sequence labeling model, that can be trained with a limited code-mixed corpus alone. We show a 5.8 point increase in BLEU on heavily code-mixed sentences by training a translation model using our data augmentation strategy on an Hindi-English codemixed translation task.

AB We should check whether there are any existing patent documents whose claims fall foul of our idea or innovation before we submit own idea or innovation as a patent. We need a lot of resource to do it, because there are a lot of existing patent documents. These days, we can submit the patent documents by a computer and the number of patent documents is increasing quickly. Therefore, people need a system to support this task. In order to meet this demand, I propose a framework of a system to classify patent documents in this paper. This system uses machine translation to deal with synonym and Rough Set theory to classify patent documents. First, it extracts decision rules by Rough Set Theory from labeled patent documents translated by machine translation. Then, it classifies unlabeled patent documents by estimating labels based on the weight of the matched rules. In this approach, the satisfactory index (SI), the coverage index (CI) and the Lift value are used as the weight of rules and they are compared with the maximum number, the total number and the Mahalanobis distance. I evaluated this idea by classifying Japanese patent documents using a prototype system based on this idea. In the evaluation, the accuracy was about 0.40 and the accuracy has not reached the practical level. Therefore I will apply this approach to other document classification task and improve it based on the analysis result of them.

AB Machine translation (MT) technology has facilitated our daily tasks by providing accessible shortcuts for gathering, processing, and communicating information. However, it can suffer from biases that harm users and society at large. As a relatively new field of inquiry, studies of gender bias in MT still lack cohesion. This advocates for a unified framework to ease future research. To this end, we: i) critically review current conceptualizations of bias in light of theoretical insights from related disciplines, ii) summarize previous analyses aimed at assessing gender bias in MT, iii) discuss the mitigating strategies proposed so far, and iv) point toward potential directions for future work.

AB Noise and domain are important aspects of data quality for neural machine translation. Existing research focus separately on domain-data selection, clean-data selection, or their static combination, leaving the dynamic interaction across them not explicitly examined. This paper introduces a "co-curricular learning" method to compose dynamic domain-data selection with dynamic clean-data selection, for transfer learning across both capabilities. We apply an EM-style optimization procedure to further refine the "co-curriculum". Experiment results and analysis with two domains demonstrate the effectiveness of the method and the properties of data scheduled by the co-curriculum.

This method performs better than traditional approaches because of their orthogonal base and rotation invariance of the defined features on them, which is verified by experiments on Zernike moments and Fourier descriptors.

AB To globally share Japanese legal information, we translate the Outlines of Japanese statutes. These outlines are the official summaries of Japanese statutes and are useful to quickly understand their contents. In a previous statistical machine translation system for the outlines, we found that the training corpus consisted of both statutes and their outlines, including many long sentences that reduced the translation quality. To solve this problem, we shortened the length of sentences and focused on parenthesized expressions. In this paper, we propose a translation method that splits off parenthesized expressions from the sentences. Experimental result shows the effectiveness of our method.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB In this paper, we propose a new approach for automatically acquiring translation templates from unannotated bilingual spoken language corpora. Two basic algorithms are adopted: a grammar induction algorithm, and an alignment algorithm using bracketing transduction grammar. The approach is unsupervised, statistical, and data-driven, and employs no parsing procedure. The acquisition procedure consists of two steps. First, semantic groups and phrase structure groups are extracted from both the source language and the target language. Second, an alignment algorithm based on bracketing transduction grammar aligns the phrase structure groups. The aligned phrase structure groups are post-processed, yielding, translation templates. Preliminary experimental results show that the algorithm is effective.

AB Due to the unparallelizable nature of the autoregressive factorization, AutoRegressive Translation (ART) models have to generate tokens sequentially during decoding and thus suffer from high inference latency. Non-AutoRegressive Translation (NART) models were proposed to reduce the inference time, but could only achieve inferior translation accuracy. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach to leveraging the hints from hidden states and word alignments to help the training of NART models. The results achieve significant improvement over previous NART models for the WMT14 En-De and De-En datasets and are even comparable to a strong LSTM-based ART baseline but one order of magnitude faster in inference.

AB Reference-free evaluation has the potential to make machine translation evaluation substantially more scalable, allowing us to pivot easily to new languages or domains. It has been recently shown that the probabilities given by a large, multilingual model can achieve state of the art results when used as a reference-free metric. We experiment with various modifications to this model, and demonstrate that by scaling it up we can match the performance of BLEU. We analyze various potential weaknesses of the approach, and find that it is surprisingly robust and likely to offer reasonable performance across a broad spectrum of domains and different system qualities.

AB We present a phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) system for Bang la to English that incorporates a novel transliteration module, and a specialized component for handling prepositions and Bang la compound words. We evaluate our components through their impact on the BLEU score for the phrase-based SMT system. According to the experimental results, the transliteration component has the most significant impact on the BLEU score. We also provide a new test set with multiple references between Bang la and English for MT evaluation purposes. Finally we propose a new manual evaluation approach for the MT community and evaluate our components using the new manual evaluation approach.

TI Engineering support vector machine kernels that recognize translation
   initiation sites
SO BIOINFORMATICS
AB Motivation: In order to extract protein sequences from nucleotide sequences, it is an important step to recognize points at which regions start that code for proteins. These points are called translation initiation sites (TIS).
   Results: The task of finding TIS can be modeled as a classification problem. We demonstrate the applicability of support vector machines for this task, and show how to incorporate prior biological knowledge by engineering an appropriate kernel function. With the described techniques the recognition performance can be improved by 26% over leading existing approaches. We provide evidence that existing related methods (e.g. ESTScan) could profit from advanced TIS recognition.

TI Adoption of Wireless Network and Artificial Intelligence Algorithm in
   Chinese-English Tense Translation
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB In order to solve the problem of tense consistency in Chinese-English neural machine translation (NMT) system, a Chinese verb tense annotation model is proposed. Firstly, a neural network is used to build a Chinese tense annotation model. During the translation process, the source tense is passed to the target side through the alignment matrix of the traditional Attention mechanism. The probability of the candidate words inconsistent with the corresponding tense of source words in the candidate translation word set is also reduced. Then, the Chinese-English temporal annotation algorithm is integrated into the MT model, so as to build a Chinese-English translation system with temporal processing function. The essence of the system is that, in the process of translation, Chinese-English temporal annotation algorithm is used to obtain temporal information from Chinese sentences and transfer it to the corresponding English sentences, so as to realize the temporal processing of English sentences and obtain the English sentences corresponding to the tenses of the original Chinese sentences. The experimental results show that the Chinese tense annotation model of bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) is more accurate for the prediction of Chinese verb tense, so the improvement effect of NMT model is also the most obvious, especially on the NIST06 test set, where the BLEU value is increased by 1.07%. As the mainstream translation model, the transformer model contains multihead Attention mechanism, which can pay attention to some temporal information and has a certain processing ability for temporal translation. It solves the tense problems encountered in the process of MT and improves the credibility of Chinese-English machine translation (MT).

AB This paper tackles the sparsity problem in estimating phrase translation probabilities by learning continuous phrase representations, whose distributed nature enables the sharing of related phrases in their representations. A pair of source and target phrases are projected into continuous-valued vector representations in a low-dimensional latent space, where their translation score is computed by the distance between the pair in this new space. The projection is performed by a neural network whose weights are learned on parallel training data. Experimental evaluation has been performed on two WMT translation tasks. Our best result improves the performance of a state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical machine translation system trained on WMT 2012 French-English data by up to 1.3 BLEU points.

We describe the basic notion of linguistic representation usiner relational tables in SQL and we specify a set of operators on these tables for parsing, and translation. The framework provides a flexible mechanism for modeling cross linguistic information about different languages in terms of relations and attributes. We are applying the model for parsing and translation of French sentences into English. In our work all the grammatical relations are specified as relations in SQL and constraints on word order are also defined in terms of relations. The work suggests a flexible multi-lingual approach to grammatical modeling and parsing.

Our neural model of APE (NNAPE) is based on a bidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN) model and consists of an encoder that encodes an MT output into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder provides a post-edited (PE) translation. APE translations produced by NNAPE show statistically significant improvements of 3.96, 2.68 and 1.35 BLEU points absolute over the original MT, phrase-based APE and hierarchical APE outputs, respectively. Furthermore, human evaluation shows that the NNAPE generated PE translations are much better than the original MT output.

AB While neural machine translation (NMT) achieves remarkable performance on clean, in-domain text, performance is known to degrade drastically when facing text which is full of typos, grammatical errors and other varieties of noise. In this work, we propose a multitask learning algorithm for transformer-based MT systems that is more resilient to this noise. We describe our submission to the WMT 2019 Robustness shared task (Li et al., 2019) based on this method. Our model achieves a BLEU score of 32.8 on the shared task French to English dataset, which is 7.1 BLEU points higher than the baseline vanilla transformer trained with clean text(1).

The Annotated Disjunct (ADJ) technique available in the LG formalism is utilized to map English sentences into equivalent Indonesian sentences. The ADJ is a promising technique to deal with target languages that do not have grammar formalism, parser, and corpus available like Indonesian language. An experimental evaluation shows that the applicability of LG for Indonesian language worked as expected. We have also discussed some significant issues to be considered in future development.

AB In this paper, we address the topic of how to estimate phrase-based models from very large corpora and apply them in statistical machine translation. The great number of sentence pairs contained in recent corpora like the well-known Europarl corpus have enormously increased the memory requirements to train phrase-based models and to apply them within a decoding process. We propose a general framework that deals with this problem without introducing significant time overhead by means of the combination of different scaling techniques. This new framework is based on the use of counts instead of probabilities, and on the concept of cache memory.

AB Emulation of Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) is necessary for a wide variety of use cases, such as providing the compatibility to execute programs compiled for a different ISA. This issue is usually solved using Dynamic Binary Translation (DBT), where guest machine code is translated to host ISA on runtime and Just-in-time (JIT) compilation is performed to achieve high-performance emulation. QEMU, a famous emulator, is developed to solve this issue, where Tiny Code Generator (TCG) is constructed to translate guest binary code to TCG Intermediate Representation (IR), and then generate target ISA machine code from TCG IR. Due to the limitations of TCG, some extensions, such as HQEMU, use LLVM as the backend to optimize programs and generate high-performance machine code. However, HQEMU is limited by its underlying implementation. That is, HQEMU still translates guest binary code to TCG IR at first. In this paper, we develop a novel, LLVM-based emulator, where guest machine code is directly lifted to LLVM IR to reduce the extra overhead and produce high-quality machine code. We evaluate our DBT emulator using BYTEmark benchmark and demonstrating its ability to outperform the de facto standard QEMU DBT system. The evaluation results confirm that our emulator delivers an average speedup of 3.3x over QEMU across BYTEmark benchmark compiled for x86-64 running on an ARMv8 platform, meanwhile, demonstrate that our user-level DBT emulator can significantly reduce the overhead to run a program on a cross-ISA system.

AB This paper proposes a simple and effective algorithm for incorporating lexical constraints in neural machine translation. Previous work either required re-training existing models with the lexical constraints or incorporating them during beam search decoding with significantly higher computational overheads. Leveraging the flexibility and speed of a recently proposed Levenshtein Transformer model (Gu et al., 2019), our method injects terminology constraints at inference time without any impact on decoding speed. Our method does not require any modification to the training procedure and can be easily applied at runtime with custom dictionaries. Experiments on English -German WMT datasets show that our approach improves an unconstrained baseline and previous approaches.

Systems/devices often use different communication protocols, standards, and data representation languages, which create interoperability challenges. This paper proposes a set of annotation rules for systems meta-data, to support the translation of data exchanged between heterogeneous systems. These rules must be followed to ensure the validity of systems meta-data (XML Schemas annotated with semantic annotations and group identifiers). The meta-data can then be used as input in tools to analyze data and semantic compatibility and generate translators.

AB Multiple target translations are due to several meanings of source words, and various target word equivalents depending on the context of the source word. Thus, an automated approach is presented for resolving target-word selection, based on "word-to-sense" and "sense-to-word" source-translation relationships, using syntactic relationships (subject-verb, verb-object, adjective-noun). Translation selection proceeds from sense disambiguation of source words based on knowledge from a bilingual dictionary with sense profiles and word similarity measures from WordNet, and selection of a target word using statistics from a target corpus Test results using English to Tagalog translations showed an overall 64% accuracy for selecting word translation with a standardized precision of at least 80% for generating expected translations using 200 sentences with ambiguous words (an average of 4 senses) in three categories: nouns, verbs, and adjectives, using 145,746 word pairs in syntactic relationships, extracted from target corpora (317,113 words).

AB This paper focuses on the Web-based Chinese-English Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) term translation pattern, and emphasizes on the translation selection based on multiple feature fusion and the ranking based on Ranking Support Vector Machine (Ranking SVM). By utilizing the SIGHAN2005 corpus for the Chinese Named Entity Recognition (NER) task and selected new terms, the experiments based on different data sources show the consistent results. From the experimental results for combining our model with Chinese-English Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) on the data sets of TREC, it can be found that the obvious performance improvements for both query translation and CLIR are obtained.

AB In hierarchical phrase-based translation systems, the grammars (SCFG rules) have over-generation problem because we can replace the non-terminal X with almost everything without knowing the syntactic or semantic role of X. In this paper, we present an approach that uses topic models to learn the distributions for non-terminals in each SCFG rule, based on which we further derive static features for the discriminative framework of statistical machine translation. Experimental results on three corpora show that we can obtain some gains in BLEU by using these features derived from topic models to alleviate the over-generation problem in hierarchical phrase-based translation.

AB In automatic sign language translation, one of the main problems is the usage of spatial information in sign language and its proper representation and translation, e.g. the handling of spatial reference points in the signing space. Such locations are encoded at static points in signing space as spatial references for motion events.
   We present a new approach starting from a large vocabulary speech recognition system which is able to recognize sentences of continuous sign language speaker independently. The manual features obtained from the tracking are passed to the statistical machine translation system to improve its accuracy. On a publicly available benchmark database, we achieve a competitive recognition performance and can similarly improve the translation performance by integrating the tracking features.

AB The quality of statistical machine translation performed with phrase based approaches can be increased by permuting the words in the source sentences in an order which resembles that of the target language. We propose a class of recurrent neural models which exploit source-side dependency syntax features to reorder the words into a target-like order. We evaluate these models on the German-to-English and Italian-to-English language pairs, showing significant improvements over a phrase-based Moses baseline. We also compare with state of the art German-to-English pre-reordering rules, showing that our method obtains similar or better results.

TI Improving Language Translation Using the Hidden Markov Model
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Translation software has become an important tool for communication between different languages. People's requirements for translation are higher and higher, mainly reflected in people's desire for barrier free cultural exchange. With a large corpus, the performance of statistical machine translation based on words and phrases is limited due to the small size of modeling units. Previous statistical methods rely primarily on the size of corpus and number of its statistical results to avoid ambiguity in translation, ignoring context. To support the ongoing improvement of translation methods built upon deep learning, we propose a translation algorithm based on the Hidden Markov Model to improve the use of context in the process of translation. During translation, our Hidden Markov Model prediction chain selects a number of phrases with the highest result probability to form a sentence. The collection of all of the generated sentences forms a topic sequence. Using probabilities and article sequences determined from the training set, our method again applies the Hidden Markov Model to form the final translation to improve the context relevance in the process of translation. This algorithm improves the accuracy of translation, avoids the combination of invalid words, and enhances the readability and meaning of the resulting translation.

TI An Automatic and a Machine-assisted Method to Clean Bilingual Corpus

   PROCESSING
AB Two different methods of corpus cleaning are presented in this article. One is a machine-assisted technique, which is good to clean small-sized parallel corpus, and the other is an automatic method, which is suitable for cleaning large-sized parallel corpus. A baseline SMT (MOSES) system is used to evaluate these methods. The machine-assisted technique used two features: word alignment and length of the source and target language sentence. These features are used to detect mistranslations in the corpus, which are then handled by a human translator. Experiments of this method are conducted on the English-to-Indian Language Machine Translation (EILMT) corpus (English-Hindi). The Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score is improved by 0.47% for the clean corpus. Automatic method of corpus cleaning uses a combination of two features. One feature is length of source and target language sentence and the second feature is Viterbi alignment score generated by Hidden Markov Model for each sentence pair. Two different threshold values are used for these two features. These values are decided by using a small-sized manually annotated parallel corpus of 206 sentence pairs. Experiments of this method are conducted on the HindEnCorp corpus, released in the workshop of the Association of Computational Linguistics (ACL 2014). The BLEU score is improved by 0.6% on clean corpus. A comparison of the two methods is also presented on EILMT corpus.

AB In machine translation, vocabulary manipulation is a way to reduce the target vocabulary based on the source sentence and the word dictionary, which is effective to lower latency during inference for text translation in industrial application. But vocabulary manipulation is hard to apply to the end-to-end speech-text translation, because neither source text nor speech-to-target mapping is available. We introduce a method that avoids this dependence. Through learning the projection between sentence-level speech encoder output and final target vocabulary, the proposed method allows self-contained vocabulary manipulation without knowing source speech transcripts or dictionaries. Experimental results show that the proposed method speed up about 20% while keep the comparable translation quality.

TI Myth or reality? Some directions on translation universals in recent
   corpus based case studies
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB This paper contributes to the ongoing debate on the existence of translation universals (TUs) by mapping the theoretical literature on the TUs and evaluating selected corpus-based studies which investigate a swath of hypothesized universals. Based on a review of empirical research carried out over recent years in translation studies, this paper attempts to develop a holistic picture of the evidence on TUs pertaining to multiple aspects of translation. We found that although some evidence for certain hypothesized universals exists, it cannot be definitively claimed that TUs comprise an indisputable reality. Based on review of the studies surveyed, the present study concluded that several universal claims within research, over the period of time, proved to have been falsified at a universal level, while being proved right as lower-level translation modes or determined generalizations for particular types. Thus as the hypotheses regarding universals have been worked upon on a very small range of languages or pair of languages, it is imprudent to declare them as translation universals.

The user can customize the rule base by simply correcting translation results. In addition, it is possible to display token lists, parse trees, and transfer rules, which makes our system also a very useful tool for language students. The system has been implemented in Amzi!

AB This paper proposes a new method for word translation disambiguation using a machine learning technique called 'Bilingual Bootstrapping'. Bilingual Bootstrapping makes use of, in learning, a small number of classified data and a large number of unclassified data in the source and the target languages in translation. It constructs classifiers in the two languages in parallel and repeatedly boosts the performances of the classifiers by further classifying data in each of the two languages and by exchanging between the two languages information regarding the classified data. Experimental results indicate that word translation disambiguation based on Bilingual Bootstrapping consistently and significantly outperforms the existing methods based on 'Monolingual Bootstrapping'.

The model in this paper is used to predict the compounds produced under known reactants and reagents. The author uses fairseq framework of python to construct a neural machine translation model based on SMILES strings of chemical reactants, reagents and products. The molecular formula of the products of the reactions can be well predicted. After training, the loss and the ppl of the model are 0.435 and 1.35. The final two bleu ontest part are 12.71 and 12.60 respectively. Fairseq performs well in molecular prediction, which shows that the cross domain traditional neural machine translation method has broad prospects in chemistry, and the use of artificial intelligence method to assist traditional research has strong practicality.

TI Translation and technocracy in development: defining the potentials and
   limitations of translation technology for Maya inclusion in Guatemalan
   development
SO LINGUISTICA ANTVERPIENSIA NEW SERIES-THEMES IN TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB This article attempts to determine the role that translation technology might play in effective, indigenous-led development practices. It uses the Maya in Guatemala as an example. Guatemala has seen the growth of a robust non-governmental organization (NGO) sector that implements technocratic, neoliberal development strategies and has historically excluded Maya input (Raxche', 1996). Mayan languages are a key focus in Maya efforts to assert their autonomy in Guatemala (French, 2010, p. 5). Language barriers still render vital resources inaccessible to the Maya (Fischer-Mackey et al., 2020, p. 906), and few Guatemalan NGOs emphasize Mayan languages in their work (Henderson et al., 2014, p. 80). Translation, therefore, is an essential component of effective and inclusive development practices. Whereas best practices in commercial translation are becoming increasingly intertwined with technology (Rico Perez, 2019, p. 116), translation technology remains largely absent from humanitarian work (p. 119). Despite the opportunity this gap presents, the implementation of information and communication technology (ICT) such as neural machine translation (NMT) may exacerbate existing power imbalances between technocratic development planners and their intended beneficiaries (Chipidza & Leidner, 2019, p. 153). This article uses a meta-analytical approach in assessing existing research on the subject to illustrate the ways in which language and translation are integral to three key development areas: intercommunity meetings, the health sector, and environmental and social impact assessments (ESIAs). It uses Chipidza and Leidner's (2019, p. 160) theory of power parity in the implementation of ICT to propose ways in which NMT may serve alternative, more inclusive development strategies in these specific contexts. The article details possible solutions to the anticipated practical challenges of implementing NMT in these contexts; and it highlights the limitations of each NMT application. It serves as a roadmap for implementing translation technology in inclusive development strategies for indigenous communities.

Non-canonical text normalization provides a way to exploit this as a practical source of training data for language processing systems. The state of the art in Turkish text normalization is composed of a token-level pipeline of modules, heavily dependent on external linguistic resources and manually-defined rules. Instead, we propose a fully-automated, context-aware machine translation approach with fewer stages of processing.

AB In many Natural Language Processing problems the combination of machine learning and optimization techniques is essential. One of these problems is estimating the effort required to improve, under direct human supervision, a text that has been translated using a machine translation method. Recent developments in this area have shown that Gaussian Processes can be accurate for post-editing effort prediction. However, the Gaussian Process kernel has to be chosen in advance, and this choice influences the quality of the prediction. In this paper, we propose a Genetic Programming algorithm to evolve kernels for Gaussian Processes. We show that the combination of evolutionary optimization and Gaussian Processes removes the need for a-priori specification of the kernel choice, and achieves predictions that, in many cases, outperform those obtained with fixed kernels.

TI Under pressure: translation in times of austerity
SO PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATION THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB The profession of translation is undergoing enormous change, expedited by the global recession that began in 2007-2008. Government policies and an intensive focus on cost has resulted in a large scale move to freelance or contingent work, leaving the worker in a precarious position with regard to rights and undermining his or her agency. This shift is exemplified particularly by the vendor model widespread in specialised translation work. Related to the downward pressure on costs and productivity is the technologisation of translation, with translation tools becoming a necessity and new use cases being found for post-edited and raw machine translation.Despite the recession, continued growth has been reported for the language industry, and the outlook for employment in translation is positive. This paper looks at the background to the economic and technological changes to translation, attempts to put them into a wider context, and looks to the options available to translators to maximise their agency within the global value chain'. Translators have little option but to embrace new competences, but also need to focus on their expertise to maximise leverage and agency.

We propose a method for labeling lattice word hypotheses with position information derived from a confusion network (CN). This information is effectively used in the statistical phrase-based machine translation (MT) search to reduce its complexity. which makes even long-range reordering possible. The proposed method has the benefits of the CN-based MT without having its theoretical drawbacks.
   We compare our novel search with the search based on single-best recognition output and on confusion networks. We obtain significant improvements on two translation tasks over the single-best search and gain over the CN search on a task requiring heavy reordering.

SO ISOKINETICS AND EXERCISE SCIENCE
AB Sagittal translation of the tibia was examined in a static test with 90 N force at 20 degrees of knee flexion and dynamically during knee extension in a Biodex machine using increasing quadriceps torque in six healthy volunteers. The translation increased in a non-linear fashion with increasing torque. Similar relative increases in quadriceps torque caused similar relative increases in translation in the different individuals. The dynamic translation at the individual maximum quadriceps torque was equal to the static 90-N translation. There was a negative correlation between the maximum quadriceps torque and the static 90-N translation. The results indicate that the quadriceps torque is related to the amount of translation in the knee joint possibly by some feed back mechanism from the ligaments preventing abnormal translation. The findings also imply that a limitation of quadriceps torque around 80% of maximum would limit the strain in an injured ligament to a level not higher than what is caused by normal laxity measurements.

AB Unsupervised neural machine translation (NMT) has attracted a lot of attention recently. While state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised translation usually perform well between similar languages (e.g., English-German translation), they perform poorly between distant languages, because unsupervised alignment does not work well for distant languages. In this work, we introduce unsupervised pivot translation for distant languages, which translates a language to a distant language through multiple hops, and the unsupervised translation on each hop is relatively easier than the original direct translation. We propose a learning to route (LTR) method to choose the translation path between the source and target languages. LTR is trained on language pairs whose best translation path is available and is applied to the unseen language pairs for path selection. Experiments on 20 languages and 294 distant language pairs demonstrate the advantages of the unsupervised pivot translation for distant languages, as well as the effectiveness of the proposed LTR for path selection. Specifically, in the best case, LTR achieves an improvement of 5.58 BLEU points over the conventional direct unsupervised method.

TI Image Translation by Ad CycleGAN for COVID-19 X-Ray Images: A New
   Approach for Controllable GAN
SO SENSORS
AB We propose a new generative model named adaptive cycle-consistent generative adversarial network, or Ad CycleGAN to perform image translation between normal and COVID-19 positive chest X-ray images. An independent pre-trained criterion is added to the conventional Cycle GAN architecture to exert adaptive control on image translation. The performance of Ad CycleGAN is compared with the Cycle GAN without the external criterion. The quality of the synthetic images is evaluated by quantitative metrics including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Universal Image Quality Index (UIQI), visual information fidelity (VIF), Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and translation accuracy. The experimental results indicate that the synthetic images generated either by the Cycle GAN or by the Ad CycleGAN have lower MSE and RMSE, and higher scores in PSNR, UIQI, and VIF in homogenous image translation (i.e., Y -> Y) compared to the heterogenous image translation process (i.e., X -> Y). The synthetic images by Ad CycleGAN through the heterogeneous image translation have significantly higher FID score compared to Cycle GAN (p < 0.01). The image translation accuracy of Ad CycleGAN is higher than that of Cycle GAN when normal images are converted to COVID-19 positive images (p < 0.01). Therefore, we conclude that the Ad CycleGAN with the independent criterion can improve the accuracy of GAN image translation. The new architecture has more control on image synthesis and can help address the common class imbalance issue in machine learning methods and artificial intelligence applications with medical images.

AB We describe a multi-task learning approach to train a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model with a Relevance-based Auxiliary Task (RAT) for search query translation. The translation process for Cross-lingual Information Retrieval (CUR) task is usually treated as a black box and it is performed as an independent step. However, an NMT model trained on sentence-level parallel data is not aware of the vocabulary distribution of the retrieval corpus. We address this problem with our multitask learning architecture that achieves 16% improvement over a strong NMT baseline on Italian-English query-document dataset. We show using both quantitative and qualitative analysis that our model generates balanced and precise translations with the regularization effect it achieves from multi-task learning paradigm.

It has also been used in kernel profiling/tracing and security applications. In this paper, we discuss multiple DBT strategies that were implemented during the development of a type-II hypervisor for Cavium Octeon MIPS64 based systems, along with their pros and cons. Poor timing performance of virtualized system was the major reason for re-factoring different design strategies. Our current block-level dynamic binary translation has proven to be better among the others.

TI A Pragmatic Assessment of Google Translate for Emergency Department
   Instructions
SO JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB Background Because many hospitals have no mechanism for written translation, ED providers resort to the use of automated translation software, such as Google Translate (GT) for patient instructions. A recent study of discharge instructions in Spanish and Chinese suggested that accuracy rates of Google Translate (GT) were high. Study Objective To perform a pragmatic assessment of GT for the written translation of commonly used ED discharge instructions in seven commonly spoken languages. Methods A prospective assessment of the accuracy of GT for 20 commonly used ED discharge instruction phrases, as evaluated by a convenience sample of native speakers of seven commonly spoken languages (Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Korean, Armenian, and Farsi). Translations were evaluated using a previously validated matrix for scoring machine translation, containing 5-point Likert scales for fluency, adequacy, meaning, and severity, in addition to a dichotomous assessment of retention of the overall meaning. Results Twenty volunteers evaluated 400 google translated discharge statements. Volunteers were 50% female and spoke Spanish (5), Armenian (2), Chinese (3), Tagalog (4), Korean (2), and Farsi (2). The overall meaning was retained for 82.5% (330/400) of the translations. Spanish had the highest accuracy rate (94%), followed by Tagalog (90%), Korean (82.5%), Chinese (81.7%), Farsi (67.5%), and Armenian (55%). Mean Likert scores (on a 5-point scale) were high for fluency (4.2), adequacy (4.4), meaning (4.3), and severity (4.3) but also varied. Conclusion GT for discharge instructions in the ED is inconsistent between languages and should not be relied on for patient instructions.

   REFINEMENT EFFORTS, AND STUDENTS' PERCPETIONS
SO CURRENT TRENDS IN TRANSLATION TEACHING AND LEARNING E
AB The current study positioned Google Translate as a facilitative tool used to help its users to accomplish a translation task. Guided by reflexive pedagogy (Cope & Kalantzis, 2015), a pedagogical unit was implemented to help a group of Taiwanese English-as-a-Foreign-Language (EFL) learners to experience, conceptualize, and analyze the nuances of translating between English and Chinese before they worked as volunteer translators to translate a NGO's community development stories. Data for this study were collected from students' translation portfolios and end-of-semester questionnaires. It was found that GT was used mostly for paragraph and whole-text translation. Students also used a variety of tools to help them refine the translation drafts. Data also indicated that most participants perceived the GT-assisted translation process quite positively. This study calls for more efforts on investigating the use of MT tools in pedagogical settings as well as the integration of meaningful and contextualized activities to help students develop their linguistic and translation expertise.

TI Learning molecular energies using localized graph kernels
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Recent machine learning methods make it possible to model potential energy of atomic configurations with chemical-level accuracy (as calculated from ab initio calculations) and at speeds suitable for molecular dynamics simulation. Best performance is achieved when the known physical constraints are encoded in the machine learning models. For example, the atomic energy is invariant under global translations and rotations; it is also invariant to permutations of same-species atoms. Although simple to state, these symmetries are complicated to encode into machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach based on graph theory that naturally incorporates translation, rotation, and permutation symmetries. Specifically, we use a random walk graph kernel to measure the similarity of two adjacency matrices, each of which represents a local atomic environment. This Graph Approximated Energy (GRAPE) approach is flexible and admits many possible extensions. We benchmark a simple version of GRAPE by predicting atomization energies on a standard dataset of organic molecules. Published by AIP Publishing.

TI The Forgetting and Rediscovery of Soviet Machine Translation
SO CRITICAL INQUIRY
AB This paper takes three distinct passes through the history of Machine Translation (MT) in the Soviet Union, which is typically understood as concentrating in a single boom period that lasted from roughly 1955 to 1965. In both the Soviet Union and the United States-in explicit competition with each other-there was a tremendous wave of investment in adapting computers to nonnumerical tasks that has only recently drawn the attention of historians, primarily focusing on the American example. The Soviet Union, however, quickly came to assume prominence in the field both in terms of scale and diversity of approaches. At the same moment, Soviet linguists excavated a forgotten precursor, P. P. Smirnov-Troianskii, who had designed a translating machine in the early 1930s. Juxtaposing the multiple contexts in which Smirnov-Troianskii's machine was reconceptualized and reappropriated for various ends, the article demonstrates the fundamental embodying of the algorithm in the early days of MT and also how the proliferation of narratives about Soviet MT exposes fault lines in contemporary historiography.

TI Heavyweight Statistical Alignment to Guide Neural Translation
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB Transformer neural models with multihead attentions outperform all existing translation models. Nevertheless, some features of traditional statistical models, such as prior alignment between source and target words, prove useful in training the state-of-the-art Transformer models. It has been reported that lightweight prior alignment can effectively guide a head in the multihead cross-attention sublayer responsible for the alignment of Transformer models. In this work, we make a step further by applying heavyweight prior alignments to guide all heads. Specifically, we use the weight of 0.5 for the alignment cost added to the token cost in formulating the overall cost of training a Transformer model, where the alignment cost is defined as the deviation of the attention probability from the prior alignments. Moreover, we increase the role of prior alignment, computing the attention probability by averaging all heads of the multihead attention sublayer within the penultimate layer of Transformer model. Experimental results on an English-Vietnamese translation task show that our proposed approach helps train superior Transformer-based translation models. Our Transformer model (25.71) outperforms the baseline model (21.34) by the large 4.37 BLEU. Case studies by native speakers on some translation results validate the machine judgment. The results so far encourage the use of heavyweight prior alignments to improve Transformer-based translation models. This work contributes to the literature on the machine translation, especially, for unpopular language pairs. Since the proposal in this work is language-independent, it can be applied to different language pairs, including Slavic languages.

AB This paper describes Octanove Labs' submission to the IWSLT 2020 open domain translation challenge. In order to build a high-quality Japanese-Chinese neural machine translation (NMT) system, we use a combination of 1) parallel corpus filtering and 2) back translation. We have shown that, by using heuristic rules and learned classifiers, the size of the parallel data can be reduced by 70% to 90% without much impact on the final MT performance. We have also shown that including the artificially generated parallel data through back-translation further boosts the metric by 17% to 27%, while self-training contributes little. Aside from a small number of parallel sentences annotated for filtering, no external resources have been used to build our system.

AB We propose a system for helping individuals who follow a medical diet maintain this diet while visiting countries where a foreign language is spoken. Our focus is on diets where certain foods must either be restricted (e. g., metabolic diseases), avoided (e. g., food intolerance or allergies), or preferably consumed for medical reasons. However, our framework can be used to manage other diets (e. g., vegan) as well. The system is based on the use of a hand-held multimedia device such as a PDA or mobile telephone to analyze and/or disambiguate the content of foods offered on restaurant menus and interpret them in the context of specific diets. The system also provides the option to communicate diet-related instructions or information to a local person (e. g., a waiter) as well as obtain clarifications through dialogue. All computations are performed within the device and do not require a network connection. Real-time text translation is a challenge. We address this challenge with a light-weight, context-specific machine translation method. This method builds on a modification of existing open source Machine Translation (MT) software to obtain a fast and accurate translation. In particular, we describe a method we call n-gram consolidation that joins words in a language pair and increases the accuracy of the translation. We developed and implemented this system on the iPod Touch for English speakers traveling in Spain. Our tests indicate that our translation method yields the correct translation more often than general purpose translation engines such as Google Translate, and does so almost instantaneously. The memory requirements of the application, including the database of picture, are also well within the limits of the device.

The first method proposed exploits the possible translation probabilities latent in Machine Readable Dictionaries (MRD). The second method is more robust, and exploits context similarity-based techniques in order to estimate word translation probabilities using the Internet as a bilingual comparable corpus. The experiments show a statistically significant improvement over non weighted structured queries in terms of MAP by using the replacement probabilities obtained with the proposed methods. The context similarity-based method is the one that yields the most significant improvement.

AB Machine vision system has been widely used for a variety of applications in industrial testing and measurements. However, image distortion caused by optical system and system re-positioning will bring errors to the machine vision detection system. This paper addresses on three types of image distortions including optical distortion and perspective deformation, image translation and rotation, and image scale change. To rectify optical distortion and perspective deformation, a black and white grid pattern is used as a standard template for finding the multiple matching points between distorted image points and ideal image points, and then a polynomial mathematical model simulating the geometric distortion is established. The distortion coefficients are calculated from the least square method. Image translation and rotation are compensated by using a floating fixture origin as the reference point. Image scale change is remedied by using a standard scale factor to shrink or enlarge an actual image to its standard size. The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach proposed.

TI Ambient intelligence framework for real-time speech-to-sign translation
SO ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY
AB Sign language can be used to facilitate communication with and between deaf or hard of hearing (Deaf/HH). With the advent of video streaming applications in smart TVs and mobile devices, it is now possible to use sign language to communicate over worldwide networks. In this article, we develop a prototype assistive device for real-time speech-to-sign translation. The proposed device aims at enabling Deaf/HH people to access and understand materials delivered in mobile streaming videos through the applications of pipelined and parallel processing for real-time translation, and the application of eye-tracking based user-satisfaction detection to support dynamic learning to improve speech-to-signing translation. We conduct two experiments to evaluate the performance and usability of the proposed assistive device. Nine deaf people participated in these experiments. Our real-time performance evaluation shows the addition of viewer's attention-based feedback reduced translation error rates by 16% (per the sign error rate [SER] metric) and increased translation accuracy by 5.4% (per the bilingual evaluation understudy [BLEU] metric) when compared to a non-real-time baseline system without these features. The usability study results indicate that our assistive device was also pleasant and satisfying to deaf users, and it may contribute to greater engagement of deaf people in day-to-day activities.

TI Improving Search-Based Automatic Program Repair With Neural Machine
   Translation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The challenge of automatically repairing bugs in programs to reduce debugging expenses and increase program quality is known as automated program repair. To overcome this issue, test-suite-based repair techniques use a specified test suite as an oracle and alter the input faulty program to pass the full test suite. GenProg is a well-known example of this kind of repair, in which genetic programming is used to reorder the statements already present in the faulty program. However, recent practical experiments suggest that GenProg's performance, notably for Java, is not sufficient. Improved program dependability necessitates the use of automatic program repair techniques. Template-based program repair techniques have recently been combined with search-based techniques to solve program issues automatically. Although intriguing, it has two fundamental drawbacks: Its search space often lacks the correct solution, and the technique disregards program expertise, such as precise code language. Compared with the template-based program repair approach, existing neural-machine-translation-based approaches are not limited by these constraints due to their ability to learn and generate new solutions. We propose an approach that combines a search-based automatic program repair technique with a neural-machine-translation-based approach. More specifically, we use both redundancy assumption and sequence-to-sequence learning of correct patches as the source for potential fix statements that feed into a multiobjective evolutionary search algorithm to find test-suite-adequate patches. In this work, a novel framework called ARJANMT is introduced for automatically repairing Java programs. Two sets of controlled experiments are conducted on 410 bugs from two benchmarks to investigate the repairability and correctness of our proposed framework. A comparison between state-of-the-art automatic program repair frameworks is made. The experimental results indicate that combining those two types of repair techniques (search-based and neural-machine-translation-based) produces better results or fixes bugs that they previously were unable to fix individually.

AB Quality estimation (QE) of machine translation (MT) aims to evaluate the quality of machine-translated sentences without references and is important in practical applications of MT. Training QE models require massive parallel data with hand-crafted quality annotations, which are time-consuming and laborintensive to obtain. To address the issue of the absence of annotated training data, previous studies attempt to develop unsupervised QE methods. However, very few of them can be applied to both sentence- and word-level QE tasks, and they may suffer from noises in the synthetic data. To reduce the negative impact of noises, we propose a self-supervised method for both sentence- and word-level QE, which performs quality estimation by recovering the masked target words. Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous unsupervised methods on several QE tasks in different language pairs and domains.(1)

TI Multi-Alignment Templates Induction
SO INFORMATICA
AB This paper examins approaches for translation between English and morphology-rich languages. Experiment with English-Russian and English-Lithuanian revels that "pure" statistical approaches on 10 million word corpus gives unsatisfactory translation. Then, several Web-available linguistic resources are suggested for translation. Syntax parsers, bilingual and semantic dictionaries, bilingual parallel corpus and monolingual Web-based corpus are integrated in one comprehensive statistical model. Multi-abstraction language representation is used for statistical induction of syntactic and semantic transformation rules called multi-alignment templates. The decoding model is described using the feature functions, a log-linear modeling approach and A* search algorithm. An evaluation of this approach is performed on the English-Lithuanian language pair. Presented experimental results demonstrates that the multi-abstraction approach and hybridization of learning methods can improve quality of translation,

AB Discourse coherence plays an important role in the translation of one text. However, the previous reported models most focus on improving performance over individual sentence while ignoring cross-sentence links and dependencies, which affects the coherence of the text. In this paper, we propose to use discourse context and reward to refine the translation quality from the discourse perspective. In particular, we generate the translation of individual sentences at first. Next, we deliberate the preliminary produced translations, and train the model to learn the policy that produces discourse coherent text by a reward teacher. Practical results on multiple discourse test datasets indicate that our model significantly improves the translation quality over the state-of-the-art baseline system by +1.23 BLEU score. Moreover, our model generates more discourse coherent text and obtains +2.2 BLEU improvements when evaluated by discourse metrics.

SO LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
AB Research on speech technologies necessitates spoken data, which is usually obtained through read recorded speech, and specifically adapted to the research needs. When the aim is to deal with the prosody involved in speech, the available data must reflect natural and conversational speech, which is usually costly and difficult to get. This paper presents a machine learning-oriented toolkit for collecting, handling, and visualization of speech data, using prosodic heuristic. We present two corpora resulting from these methodologies: PANTED corpus, containing 250 h of English speech from TED Talks, and Heroes corpus containing 8 h of parallel English and Spanish movie speech. We demonstrate their use in two deep learning-based applications: punctuation restoration and machine translation. The presented corpora are freely available to the research community.

AB Nowadays, Network Address Translation (NAT) is widely used to allow multiple devices within a private network to make use of a less number of public IP addresses. NAT Overloading or Port Address Translation (PAT) is an extension of NAT that can translate both the IP address and the port number of a packet in order to identify which inside local address each packet belongs to. PAT is often used in a virtual environment, where multiple virtual machines are connected to the Internet by using the host machine's IP address. However, an apparent downside of PAT is the fact that when all of the ports are used, no more new outbound connection could be made from the local addresses. In this paper, we present Slow-port-exhaustion DoS Attack on a virtual network, a new type of DoS Attack that exploits some flaws of the TCP protocol. In this attack, a compromised internal virtual machine with a low amount of attack bandwidth can occupy host machine's ports for a long time and therefore makes other machines on the same virtual network could not connect to the external network. We created a virtual network with PAT implemented gateway and perform the experimental attack. In the analysis, we explore a gateway's behavior that could benefit this kind of attack. We also introduce some countermeasures against this kind of attack.

AB Spoken language translation (SLT) combines automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT). During the decoding stage, the best hypothesis produced by the ASR system may not be the best input candidate to the MT system, but making use of multiple sub-optimal ASR results in SLT has been shown to be too complex computationally. This paper presents a method to rescore the k-best ASR output such as to improve translation quality. A translation quality estimation model is trained on a large number of features which aim to capture complementary information from both ASR and MT on translation difficulty and adequacy, as well as syntactic properties of the SLT inputs and outputs. Based on the predicted quality score, the ASR hypotheses are rescored before they are fed to the MT system. ASR confidence is found to be crucial in guiding the rescoring step. In an English-to-French speech-to-text translation task, the coupling of ASR and MT systems led to an increase of 0.5 BLEU points in translation quality.

TI Translationese and Post-editese: How comparable is comparable quality?
SO LINGUISTICA ANTVERPIENSIA NEW SERIES-THEMES IN TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB Whereas post-edited texts have been shown to be either of comparable quality to human translations or better, one study shows that people still seem to prefer human-translated texts. The idea of texts being inherently different despite being of high quality is not new. Translated texts, for example, are also different from original texts, a phenomenon referred to as 'Translationese'. Research into Translationese has shown that, whereas humans cannot distinguish between translated and original text, computers have been trained to detect Translationese successfully. It remains to be seen whether the same can be done for what we call Post-editese. We first establish whether humans are capable of distinguishing post-edited texts from human translations, and then establish whether it is possible to build a supervised machine-learning model that can distinguish between translated and post-edited text.

Specifically the then state of the art in parsing, information extraction, chatbots, and dialogue systems, speech processing and machine translation are briefly reviewed. The emergence in the 1980s and 1990s of machine learning (ML) and statistical methods (SM) is noted. Important trends and areas of progress in the subsequent years are identified. In particular, the move to the use of n-grams or skip grams and/or chunking with part of speech tagging and away from whole sentence parsing is noted, as is the increasing dominance of SM and ML. Some outstanding issues which merit further research are briefly pointed out, including metaphor processing and the ethical implications of NLE.

AB Direct speech translation describes a scenario where only speech inputs and corresponding translations are available. Such data are notoriously limited. We present a technique that allows cascades of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) to exploit in-domain direct speech translation data in addition to out-of-domain MT and ASR data. After pre-training MT and ASR, we use a feedback cycle where the downstream performance of the MT system is used as a signal to improve the ASR system by self-training, and the MT component is fine-tuned on multiple ASR outputs, making it more tolerant towards spelling variations. A comparison to end-to-end speech translation using components of identical architecture and the same data shows gains of up to 3.8 BLEU points on LibriVoxDeEn and up to 5.1 BLEU points on CoVoST for German-to-English speech translation.

AB Code generators play a critical role in the Model Based Development of complex software systems. This is particularly true in the automotive domain, where the code auto-generated from Simulink/Stateflow models is directly flashed onto embedded controllers. Testing based approaches are popular for validating the translation of models to code. However, these approaches cannot guarantee the absence of bugs introduced during translation. We use translation validation as an alternative to testing. By checking the equivalence between a Stateflow model and C code, it can provide formal guarantees about the absence of bugs introduced during translation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of translation validation to code generation from hierarchical state-machine modeling languages. Our approach builds upon the significant progress over the last few years in software model-checking: we use a state-of-the-art off-the-shelf software model-checker, CBMC, to make translation validation practical for a complex modeling language like Stateflow. We have applied this approach to Stateflow models from the automotive domain.

AB In the paper, authors proposed a methodology to solve the problem of prior art patent search, consists of a statistical and semantic analysis of patent documents, machine translation of patent application and calculation of semantic similarity between application and patents. The paper considers different variants of statistical analysis based on LDA method. On the step of the semantic analysis, authors applied a new method for building a semantic network on the base of Meaning-Text Theory. Prior art search also needs pre-translation of the patent application using machine translation tools. On the step of semantic similarity calculation, we compare the semantic trees for application and patent claims. We developed an automated system for the patent examination task, which is designed to reduce the time that an expert spends for the prior-art search and is adopted to deal with a large amount of patent information.

AB Virtual Space Teleconferencing System (VST), which based on video teleconferencing system, is a combination of Virtual Reality and several other techniques, such as Network Communication and Natural Language Processing. Participants appear in computer-generated virtual spaces as avatars in VST, and these avatars can locate, view, manipulate virtual objects, communicate with others face to face, so participants could share 'the same space' and do cooperative work. When participants use different kinds of natural language to communicate, language barrier would arise in interaction. So, besides the basic natural language processing, VST should provide translation service based on Machine Translation. First, this paper introduces the features of VST. Second, it describes the techniques of English-Chinese Bi-directional Machine Translation. Third, it analyzes the special requirements of English-Chinese bilingual interaction environment in VST. Finally it discusses the key issues of English-Chinese bilingual interaction environment and proposes a method of construction.

Using data from the ImageCLEF test collection, we investigate the relationship between translation quality and retrieval performance when using Systran, a machine translation (MT) system, as a translation resource. The quality of translation is assessed manually by comparing the original ImageCLEF topics with the output from Systran and rated by assessors based on their semantic content. Quality is also measured using an automatic score derived from the mteval MT evaluation tool, and compared to the manual assessment score. Like other MT tasks, we find that measures based on the automatic score are correlated with the manual assessments for this CLIR task. The results from this short study formed our entry to ImageCLEF 2003.

The B machines generated from the JML can then be checked to ensure their correctness. Thus, we deduce the correctness of the original JML specification, ensured by rewriting rules which give the semantical equivalence of the two models. More generally, this translation can be applied to object-oriented specification languages using before-after predicates.

AB This paper presents a method to effectively introduce a translation dictionary into phrase-based SMT. Though SMT systems can be built with only a parallel corpus, translation dictionaries are more widely available and have many more entries than parallel corpora. A simple and low-cost method to introduce a translation dictionary is to attach a dictionary entry into a phrase table. This, however, does not work well. Target word order and even whole target sentences are often incorrect. To solve this problem, the proposed method uses high-frequency words in the training corpus. The high-frequency words may already be trained well; in other words, they may appear in the phrase table and therefore be translated with correct word order. Experimental results show the proposed method as far superior to simply attaching dictionary entries into phrase tables.

TI Translating Sentimental Statements Using Deep Learning Techniques
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows machines to know nature languages and helps us do tasks, such as retrieving information, answering questions, text summarization, categorizing text, and machine translation. To our understanding, no NLP was used to translate statements from negative sentiment to positive sentiment with resembling semantics, although human communication needs. The developments of translating sentimental statements using deep learning techniques are proposed in this paper. First, for a sentiment translation model, we create negative-positive sentimental statement datasets. Then using deep learning techniques, the sentiment translation model is developed. Perplexity, bilingual evaluation understudy, and human evaluations are used in the experiments to test the model, and the results are satisfactory. Finally, if the trained datasets can be constructed as planned, we believe the techniques used in translating sentimental statements are possible, and more sophisticated models can be developed.

Without any help of cross-lingual resources such as machine translation and bilingual dictionaries, this paper can solve the many-to-many problem of word translation in CLIR and solve the problem of unregistered words partially. Under a unified framework, a series of topics are extracted from bilingual parallel corpora to form the thematic space for each language. Thematic space of each language exists independently, and the bilingual subject space is established through the bilingual semantic correspondence. The bilingual subject space reflects the semantic correspondence between documents and documents, words and words. It reveals the inherent structure and internal relations among languages and languages.

AB Transfer learning approaches for Neural Machine Translation (NMT) trains a NMT model on an assisting language-target language pair (parent model) which is later fine-tuned for the source language-target language pair of interest (child model), with the target language being the same. In many cases, the assisting language has a different word order from the source language. We show that divergent word order adversely limits the benefits from transfer learning when little to no parallel corpus between the source and target language is available. To bridge this divergence, we propose to pre-order the assisting language sentences to match the word order of the source language and train the parent model. Our experiments on many language pairs show that bridging the word order gap leads to major improvements in the translation quality in extremely low-resource scenarios.

AB The need for systems change: reflections on knowledge translation and organizational change.
   Despite over 40 years' work on general systems theory, informed by critical social science, there is a mismatch between the theories used to explain and influence clinical practice in nursing and the way in which transferring new knowledge into practice is articulated.
   The analysis and emerging propositions were based on a critique of seminal texts published in English up to 2008 covering critical social science, action science, diffusion of innovations, practice development and the management of innovations.
   There is an implicit adherence to the world view that healthcare systems operate like machines, and much of the science generated around knowledge translation research tends to be logico-deductive. This is in direct contrast to the prevailing arguments of general systems theorists, who view the system more as an organism. Five propositions are posited: knowledge translation is a necessary but not sufficient mechanism to transform systems; the 'system-as-machine' metaphor is profoundly unhelpful to knowledge translation; the healthcare system is best viewed as a complex entity; successful innovation is a function of the level of local autonomy experienced by individuals, teams and the unit involved; innovation is most effective when it involves key stakeholders.
   The purposeful integration of systems theory with knowledge translation theories and models may enable the application of research and new knowledge to practice to be speeded up.

AB In this paper, by relabeling nodes generated during binarization of syntactic trees, contexts can be easily and systematically integrated. This not only helps to restructure syntactic trees to obtain smaller rules, that can be acquired and exploited for translation, also helps to determine which rules are most suitable for translation. By contextual binarization, high-quality translation could be easily generated from the contextual rules, if available; otherwise the translation just falls back on original syntax-based model without performance loss. Experimental results on the NIST Chinese-to-English corpus show promising improvements, the system applying contextual binarization outperforms over both the original syntax-based system and the original one with right binarization.

AB Deep encoders have been proven to be effective in improving neural machine translation (NMT) systems, but training an extremely deep encoder is time consuming. Moreover, why deep models help NMT is an open question. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of a well-tuned deep Transformer system. We find that stacking layers is helpful in improving the representation ability of NMT models and adjacent layers perform similarly. This inspires us to develop a shallow-to-deep training method that learns deep models by stacking shallow models. In this way, we successfully train a Transformer system with a 54-layer encoder. Experimental results on WMT'16 English-German and WMT'14 English-French translation tasks show that it is 1.4 x faster than training from scratch, and achieves a BLEU score of 30:33 and 43:29 on two tasks. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/libeineu/SDT-Training.

AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is notorious for its need for large amounts of bilingual data. An effective approach to compensate for this requirement is Multi-Task Learning (MTL) to leverage different linguistic resources as a source of inductive bias. Current MTL architectures are based on the SEQ2SEQ transduction, and (partially) share different components of the models among the tasks. However, this MTL approach often suffers from task interference, and is not able to fully capture commonalities among subsets of tasks. We address this issue by extending the recurrent units with multiple blocks along with a trainable routing network. The routing network enables adaptive collaboration by dynamic sharing of blocks conditioned on the task at hand, input, and model state. Empirical evaluation of two low-resource translation tasks, English to Vietnamese and Farsi, show +1 BLEU score improvements compared to strong baselines.

AB We present a parallel corpus of German/Swiss German Sign Language train announcements. The corpus is used in a statistical machine translation system that translates from German to Swiss German Sign Language. The output of the translation system is then passed on to an animation system, the result being a sign language avatar representation on a mobile phone. Building the parallel corpus consisted of four steps: translating the written German train announcements into Swiss German Sign Language glosses, signing the announcements in front of a camera on the basis of the gloss transcriptions, notating the signs in the video recordings in a form-based sign language notation system, and adding information about non-manual features. The resulting corpus contains 3,241 sentence pairs, which makes it a large parallel corpus involving sign language.

AB This paper is concerned with data selection for adapting language model (LM) in statistical machine translation (SMT), and aims to find the LM training sentences that are topic similar to the translation task. Although the traditional methods have gained significant performance, they ignore the topic information and the distribution of words in calculating the sentence similarity. In this paper, the authors propose a topic model to discover the latent topics in the content of sentences, and combine the latent topic based similarity with TF-IDF into a unified framework for data selection. Furthermore, the authors combine a cross-lingual projecting method with the topic model, which makes the data selection depend on the source input directly. Large-scale experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the traditional approaches on both LM perplexity and SMT performance.

AB In traditional dynamic binary translation technology, the source machines' states are always mapped onto target machines by using their available resources. Usually, mapping source registers onto target memory is such a convenient and easy method that almost all binary translators select the strategy without taking the fact that target registers may be fewer than source registers into account, thus leads to large numbers of nonsensical load/store operations when context switches are occurring.
   While mapping source registers directly onto target registers is an intuitively good optimization approach, this approach hardly gets any performance improvement in some translators such as QEMU. The translation mechanism of QEMU is the main reason of this result.
   QEMU, which will be used as a tool to analysis register mapping strategies, is a classic and efficient dynamic binary translator. This paper has a study on the QEMU's register mapping mechamism, and proposes an improved translating mechanism.

AB Phrase-based machine translation (MT) systems require large bilingual corpora for training. Nevertheless, such large bilingual corpora are unavailable for most language pairs in the world, causing a bottleneck for the development of MT. For the Asian language pairs-Japanese, Indonesian, Malay paired with Vietnamese- they are also not excluded from the case, in which there are no large bilingual corpora on these low-resource language pairs. Furthermore, although the languages are widely used in the world, there is no prior work on MT, which causes an issue for the development of MT on these languages. In this article, we conducted an empirical study of leveraging additional resources to improve MT for the Asian low-resource language pairs: translation from Japanese, Indonesian, and Malay to Vietnamese. We propose an innovative approach that lies in two strategies of building bilingual corpora from comparable data and phrase pivot translation on existing bilingual corpora of the languages paired with English. Bilingual corpora were built from Wikipedia bilingual titles to enhance bilingual data for the low-resource languages. Additionally, we introduced a combined model of the additional resources to create an effective solution to improve MT on the Asian low-resource languages. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our systems with the improvement of +2 to +7 BLEU points. This work contributes to the development of MT on low-resource languages, especially opening a promising direction for the progress of MT on the Asian language pairs.

AB Previous works have shown that contextual information can improve the performance of neural machine translation (NMT). However, most existing document-level NMT methods only consider a few number of previous sentences. How to make use of the whole document as global contexts is still a challenge. To address this issue, we hypothesize that a document can be represented as a graph that connects relevant contexts regardless of their distances. We employ several types of relations, including adjacency, syntactic dependency, lexical consistency, and coreference, to construct the document graph. Then, we incorporate both source and target graphs into the conventional Transformer architecture with graph convolutional networks. Experiments on various NMT benchmarks, including IWSLT English-French, Chinese-English, WMT English-German and Opensubtitle English-Russian, demonstrate that using document graphs can significantly improve the translation quality. Extensive analysis verifies that the document graph is beneficial for capturing discourse phenomena.

AB The studies performed by the authors show that when using the model of generalized syntagmas, it is possible to implement the PMT process using a shorter and simpler technological scheme. This technological scheme can be reduced to two stages: 1) the stage of formation of several search syntagmas characterizing the semantic content of the source text sentences (on the base of results of morphological and simplified syntactic analysis); 2) the stage of searching for semantic information in the reference dictionaries of translations of global and local constructions of sentences, having which it will be possible to automatically form translated sentences of text on their basis. A comparison of the effectiveness of phraseological machine translation using the method of generalized syntagmas and without using it was made.

AB Many of the phrase pairs extracted in the phrase-based machine translation systems have low quality and are not relevant. So their existence in the phrase table not only enlarges it, but also could reduce the translation quality. There are many methods presented to prune these noisy phrase pairs, using the statistics derived from the phrase table. In this paper we proposed a new pruning method that unlike the other similar pruning approaches uses the content of each side of the phrase pair to estimate its relevance and quality. In order to model the content of phrases, the topic models have been used. With testing this new pruning method on a Farsi-English system we could prune more than 50% of the phrase-table without significant loss or even improvements in the BLEU scores.

AB Although teacher forcing has become the main training paradigm for neural machine translation, it usually makes predictions only conditioned on past information, and hence lacks global planning for the future. To address this problem, we introduce another decoder, called seer decoder, into the encoder-decoder framework during training, which involves future information in target predictions. Meanwhile, we force the conventional decoder to simulate the behaviors of the seer decoder via knowledge distillation. In this way, at test the conventional decoder can perform like the seer decoder without the attendance of it. Experiment results on the Chinese-English, English-German and English-Romanian translation tasks show our method can outperform competitive baselines significantly and achieves greater improvements on the bigger data sets. Besides, the experiments also prove knowledge distillation the best way to transfer knowledge from the seer decoder to the conventional decoder compared to adversarial learning and L2 regularization.

The author summarizes NCR's vision for the use of MT, the competitive "fly-off" evaluation process he conducted in the spring of 2000, the current MT production environment, and the reactions of the MT users. Although the vision is not yet fulfilled, progress is being made.

AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) based on the encoder-decoder architecture has recently achieved the state-of-the-art performance. Researchers have proven that extending word level attention to phrase level attention by incorporating source-side phrase structure can enhance the attention model and achieve promising improvement. However, word dependencies that can be crucial to correctly understand a source sentence are not always in a consecutive fashion (i.e. phrase structure), sometimes they can be in long distance. Phrase structures are not the best way to explicitly model long distance dependencies. In this paper we propose a simple but effective method to incorporate source-side long distance dependencies into NMT. Our method based on dependency trees enriches each source state with global dependency structures, which can better capture the inherent syntactic structure of source sentences. Experiments on Chinese-English and English-Japanese translation tasks show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art SMT and NMT baselines.

SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB This article shows that the structure of bilingual material from standard parsing and alignment tools is not optimal for training syntax-based statistical machine translation (SMT) systems. We present three modifications to the MT training data to improve the accuracy of a state-of-the-art syntax MT system: re-structuring changes the syntactic structure of training parse trees to enable reuse of substructures; re-labeling alters bracket labels to enrich rule application context; and re-aligning unifies word alignment across sentences to remove bad word alignments and refine good ones. Better structures, labels, and word alignments are learned by the EM algorithm. We show that each individual technique leads to improvement as measured by BLEU, and we also show that the greatest improvement is achieved by combining them. We report an overall 1.48 BLEU improvement on the NIST08 evaluation set over a strong baseline in Chinese/English translation.

AB Due to the increase in globalization, communication between different countries has become more and more frequent. Language barriers are the most important issues in communication. Machine translation is limited to texts, and cannot be an adequate substitute for oral communication. In this study, a speech recognition and translation system based on embedded technology was developed for the purpose of English speech recognition and translation. The system adopted the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Windows CE operating system. Experiments involving English speech recognition and English-Chinese translation found that the accuracy of the system in identifying English speech was about 88%, and the accuracy rate of the system in translating English to Chinese was over 85%. The embedded technology-based English speech recognition and translation system demonstrated a level of high accuracy in speech identification and translation, demonstrating its value as a practical application. Therefore, it merits further research and development.

AB We tackle the low-resource problem in style transfer by employing transfer learning that utilizes abundantly available raw corpora. Our method consists of two steps: pre-training learns to generate a semantically equivalent sentence with an input assured grammaticality, and fine-tuning learns to add a desired style. Pre-training has two options, auto-encoding and machine translation based methods. Pre-training based on AutoEncoder is a simple way to learn these from a raw corpus. If machine translators are available, the model can learn more diverse paraphrasing via roundtrip translation. After these, fine-tuning achieves high-quality paraphrase generation even in situations where only 1k sentence pairs of the parallel corpus for style transfer is available. Experimental results of formality style transfer indicated the effectiveness of both pre-training methods and the method based on roundtrip translation achieves state-of-the-art performance.

AB This paper presents a study on a new problem: applying machine learning approaches to translate remote sensing images between high-resolution optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. To this end, conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have been explored. Efficiency of the conditional GAN have been verified with different SAR parameters on three regions from the world: Toronto, Vancouver in Canada and Shanghai in China. The generated SAR images have been evaluated by pixel-based image classification with detailed land cover types including: low and high density residential area, industry area, construction site, golf course, water, forest, pasture and crops. In comparison with an unsupervised GAN translation approach, the proposed conditional GAN could effectively keep many land cover types with compatible classification accuracy to the ground truth SAR data. This is one of first study on multi-source remote sensing data translation by machine learning.

AB Even though machine translation (MT) systems have reached impressive performances in cross-lingual translation tasks, the quality of MT is still far behind professional human translations (HTs) due to the complexity in natural languages, especially for terminologies in different domains. Therefore, HTs are still widely demanded in practice. However, the quality of HT is also imperfect and vary significantly depending on the experience and knowledge of the translators. Evaluating the quality of HT in an automatic manner has faced many challenges. Although bilingual speakers are able to assess the translation quality, manually checking the accuracy of translations is expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method to evaluate the quality of HT without requiring any labelled data. We compare a range of methods for automatically grading HTs and observe the Bidirectional Minimum Word Mover's distance (BiMWMD) to produce gradings that correlate well with humans.

AB The bare minimum lexical resource required to translate between a pair of languages is a translation dictionary. Unfortunately, dictionaries exist only between a tiny fraction of the 49 million possible language-pairs making machine translation virtually impossible between most of the languages.
   This paper summarizes the last four years of our research motivated by the vision of panlingual communication. Our research comprises three key steps. First, we compile over 630 freely available dictionaries over the Web and convert this data into a single representation - the translation graph. Second, we build several inference algorithms that infer translations between word pairs even when no dictionary lists them as translations. Finally, we run our inference procedure offline to construct PANDICTIONARY- a sense-distinguished, massively multilingual dictionary that has translations in more than 1000 languages. Our experiments assess the quality of this dictionary and find that we have 4 times as many translations at a high precision of 0.9 compared to the English Wiktionary, which is the lexical resource closest to PANDICTIONARY.

TI SWARM ALGORITHMS FOR NLP - THE CASE OF LIMITED TRAINING DATA
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND SOFT COMPUTING RESEARCH
AB The present article describes a novel phrasing model which can be used for segmenting sentences of unconstrained text into syntactically-defined phrases. This model is based on the notion of attraction and repulsion forces between adjacent words. Each of these forces is weighed appropriately by system parameters, the values of which are optimised via particle swarm optimisation. This approach is designed to be language-independent and is tested here for different languages.
   The phrasing model's performance is assessed per se, by calculating the segmentation accuracy against a golden segmentation. Operational testing also involves integrating the model to a phrase-based Machine Translation (MT) system and measuring the translation quality when the phrasing model is used to segment input text into phrases. Experiments show that the performance of this approach is comparable to other leading segmentation methods and that it exceeds that of baseline systems.

AB In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of training a multimodal neural machine translation (MNMT) system with image features for a low-resource language pair, Hindi and English, using synthetic data. A three-way parallel corpus which contains bilingual texts and corresponding images is required to train a MNMT system with image features. However, such a corpus is not available for low resource language pairs. To address this, we developed both a synthetic training dataset and a manually curated development/test dataset for Hindi based on an existing English-image parallel corpus. We used these datasets to build our image description translation system by adopting state-of-the-art MNMT models. Our results show that it is possible to train a MNMT system for low-resource language pairs through the use of synthetic data and that such a system can benefit from image features.

AB Communication between different nations is essential. Languages which are foreign to another impose difficulty in understanding. For this problem to be resolved, options are limited to learning the language, having a dictionary as a guide, or making use of a translator. This paper discusses the development of ASEANMT-Phil, a phrase-based statistical machine translator, to be utilized as a tool beneficial for assisting ASEAN countries. The data used for training and testing came from Wikipedia articles comprising of 124,979 and 1,000 sentence pairs, respectively. ASEANMT-Phil was experimented on different settings producing the BLEU score of 32.71 for Filipino-English and 31.15 for English-Filipino. Future Directions for the translator includes the following: improvement of data through changing or adding the domain or size; implementing an additional approach; and utilizing a larger dictionary to the approach.

AB This work reviews information retrieval systems developed at ITC-irst which were evaluated through several tracks of CLEF, during the last three years. The presentation tries to follow the progress made over time in developing new statistical models first for monolingual information retrieval, then for cross-language information retrieval. Besides describing the underlying theory, performance of monolingual and bilingual information retrieval models are reported, respectively, on Italian monolingual tracks and Italian-English bilingual tracks of CLEF. Monolingual systems by ITC-irst performed consistently well in all the official evaluations, while the bilingual system ranked in CLEF 2002 just behind competitors using commercial machine translation engines. However, by experimentally comparing our statistical topic translation model against a state-of-the-art commercial system, no statistically significant difference in retrieval performance could be measured on a larger set of queries.

AB In the modern world, there is an increased need for language translation. This paper presents English to Arabic approach for translating well-structured English sentences into well-structured Arabic sentences, using a grammar-based and example-translation techniques to handle the problems of ordering and agreement. This technique combines rule-based MT (RBMT) and example-based MT (EBMT) which is called hybrid-based MT (HERBMT). The proposed methodology is flexible and scalable. The main advantages of HERBMT are that it combines the advantages of RBMT and EBMT, and it can be applied to other languages with minor modifications. EBMT extracts an example of target language sentences that are analogous to input source language sentences. The extraction of appropriate translated sentences is preceded by an analysis stage for the decomposition of input sentences into appropriate fragments. RBMT is used when examples of the source language to be translated into the target language are not found in the machine database. The OAK Parser is used to analyze the input English text to get the part of speech (POS) for each word in the text as a pre-translation process. A major design goal of this system is that it will be used as a stand-alone tool, and can be integrated with a general machine translation system for English sentences. The evaluation is carried out on 250 independent test suites, and the analysis indicates that HERBMT achieved good performance with an average of 97.2% precision.

AB Self-supervised neural machine translation (SSNMT) jointly learns to identify and select suitable training data from comparable (rather than parallel) corpora and to translate, in a way that the two tasks support each other in a virtuous circle. In this study, we provide an in-depth analysis of the sampling choices the SSNMT model makes during training. We show how, without it having been told to do so, the model self-selects samples of increasing (i) complexity and (ii) task-relevance in combination with (iii) performing a denoising curriculum. We observe that the dynamics of the mutual-supervision signals of both system internal representation types are vital for the extraction and translation performance. We show that in terms of the Gunning-Fog Readability index, SSNMT starts extracting and learning from Wikipedia data suitable for high school students and quickly moves towards content suitable for first year undergraduate students.

TI Graph-based Lexicalized Reordering Models for Statistical Machine
   Translation
SO CHINA COMMUNICATIONS
AB Lexicalized reordering models are very important components of phrase-based translation systems. By examining the reordering relationships between adjacent phrases, conventional methods learn these models from the word aligned bilingual corpus, while ignoring the effect of the number of adjacent bilingual phrases. In this paper, we propose a method to take the number of adjacent phrases into account for better estimation of reordering models. Instead of just checking whether there is one phrase adjacent to a given phrase, our method firstly uses a compact structure named reordering graph to represent all phrase segmentations of a parallel sentence, then the effect of the adjacent phrase number can be quantified in a forward-backward fashion, and finally incorporated into the estimation of reordering models. Experimental results on the NIST Chinese-English and WMT French-Spanish data sets show that our approach significantly outperforms the baseline method.

AB It is not uncommon for Internet users to have to produce a text in a foreign language they have very little knowledge of and are unable to verify the translation quality. We call the task "outbound translation" and explore it by introducing an open-source modular system Ptakop.et. Its main purpose is to inspect human interaction with MT systems enhanced with additional subsystems, such as backward translation and quality estimation. We follow up with an experiment on (Czech) human annotators tasked to produce questions in a language they do not speak (German), with the help of Ptakop.et. We focus on three real-world use cases (communication with IT support, describing administrative issues and asking encyclopedic questions) from which we gain insight into different strategies users take when faced with outbound translation tasks. Round trip translation is known to be unreliable for evaluating MT systems but our experimental evaluation documents that it works very well for users, at least on MT systems of mid-range quality.

TI Linguistic Knowledge-Aware Neural Machine Translation
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Recently, researchers have shown an increasing interest in incorporating linguistic knowledge into neural machine translation (NMT). To this end, previous works choose either to alter the architecture of NMT encoder to incorporate syntactic information into the translation model, or to generalize the embedding layer of the encoder to encode additional linguistic features. The former approach mainly focuses on injecting the syntactic structure of the source sentence into the encoding process, leading to a complicated model that lacks the flexibility to incorporate other types of knowledge. The latter extends word embeddings by considering additional linguistic knowledge as features to enrich the word representation. It thus does not explicitly balance the contribution from word embeddings and the contribution from additional linguistic knowledge. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a knowledge-aware NMT approach that models additional linguistic features in parallel to the word feature. The core idea is that we propose modeling a series of linguistic features at the word level (knowledge block) using a recurrent neural network (RNN). And in sentence level, those word-corresponding feature blocks are further encoded using a RNN encoder. In decoding, we propose a knowledge gate and an attention gate to dynamically control the proportions of information contributing to the generation of target words from different sources. Extensive experiments show that our approach is capable of better accounting for importance of additional linguistic, and we observe significant improvements from 1.0 to 2.3 BLEU points on Chinese <-> English and English -> German translation tasks.

TI Combining Lexical and Statistical Translation Evidence for
   Cross-Language Information Retrieval
SO JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB This article explores how best to use lexical and statistical translation evidence together for cross-language information retrieval (CLIR). Lexical translation evidence is assembled from Wikipedia and from a large machine-readable dictionary, statistical translation evidence is drawn from parallel corpora, and evidence from co-occurrence in the document language provides a basis for limiting the adverse effect of translation ambiguity. Coverage statistics for NII Testbeds and Community for Information Access Research (NTCIR) queries confirm that these resources have complementary strengths. Experiments with translation evidence from a small parallel corpus indicate that even rather rough estimates of translation probabilities can yield further improvements over a strong technique for translation weighting based on using Jensen-Shannon divergence as a term-association measure. Finally, a novel approach to posttranslation query expansion using a random walk over the Wikipedia concept link graph is shown to yield further improvements over alternative techniques for posttranslation query expansion. Evaluation results on the NTCIR-5 English-Korean test collection show statistically significant improvements over strong baselines.

AB As a special machine translation task, dialect translation has two main characteristics: 1) lack of parallel training corpus; and 2) possessing similar grammar between two sides of the translation. In this paper, we investigate how to exploit the commonality and diversity between dialects thus to build unsupervised translation models merely accessing to monolingual data. Specifically, we leverage pivot-private embedding, layer coordination, as well as parameter sharing to sufficiently model commonality and diversity among source and target, ranging from lexical, through syntactic, to semantic levels. In order to examine the effectiveness of the proposed models, we collect 20 million monolingual corpus for each of Mandarin and Cantonese, which are official language and the most widely used dialect in China. Experimental results reveal that our methods outperform rule-based simplified and traditional Chinese conversion and conventional unsupervised translation models over 12 BLEU scores.

In this paper we create a variant of the RECONTRA topology which takes into account what seems to be the natural work of the human brain in the translation process: complete paragraphs or sentences are translated, not individual words. Thus, the RECONTRA translator is modified to present as output several words at the same time. Experimentally, this simple modification has shown an improvement in the translation results.

AB DeConverter is one of the core software of the Universal Networking Language (UNL) translation system. Automatic translation system based on UNL consists of two components: EnConverter and DeConverter. EnConverter is used to translate a sentence from natural language into an equivalent UNL expression, and DeConverter is used to create a sentence on natural language from an UNL expression. The UNL system has supported over 48 different languages, but not much as certain research has been done for Vietnamese. In this paper, we describe the process of the translation from UNL expressions with scope into Vietnamese sentences by analyzing Vietnamese grammar and the semantic relationships in UNL expressions with scope node and how rules of translation from UNL expressions to equivalent Vietnamese sentences are built. We tested the UNL-Vietnamese-English translation on 500 different expressions alternatively by the DeCoVie tool and the English server, which was then compared to the manual translations. The results showed that the two machine translations are synonymous and 90% are identical in terms of grammar.

AB We examine methods and techniques, proven to be helpful for the text-to-text translation of spoken languages in the context of gloss-to-text translation systems, where the glosses are the written representation of the signs. We present one of the first works that include experiments on both parallel corpora of the German Sign Language (PHOENIX14T and the Public DGS Corpus). We experiment with two NMT architectures with optimization of their hyperparameters, several tokenization methods and two data augmentation techniques (back-translation and paraphrasing). Through our investigation we achieve a substantial improvement of 5.0 and 2.2 BLEU scores for the models trained on the two corpora respectively. Our RNN models outperform our Transformer models, and the segmentation method we achieve best results with is BPE, whereas back-translation and paraphrasing lead to minor but not significant improvements.

AB Translation is organized in a cycle that requires ribosomal subunits, mRNA, aminoacylated transfer RNAs, and myriad regulatory factors. As soon as translation reaches a stop codon or stall, a termination or surveillance process is launched via the release factors eRF1 or Pelota, respectively. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein ABCE1 interacts with release factors and coordinates the recycling process in Eukarya and Archaea. After splitting, ABCE1 stays with the small ribosomal subunit and emerges as an integral part of translation initiation complexes. In addition, eEF3 and ABCF proteins control translation by binding at the E-site. In this review, we highlight advances in the fundamental role of ABC systems in mRNA translation in view of their collective inner mechanics.

AB Search typically relies on keyword queries, but these are often semantically ambiguous. We propose to overcome this by offering users natural language questions, based on their keyword queries, to disambiguate their intent. This keyword-to-question task may be addressed using neural machine translation techniques. Neural translation models, however, require massive amounts of training data (keyword-question pairs), which is unavailable for this task. The main idea of this paper is to generate large amounts of synthetic training data from a small seed set of hand-labeled keyword-question pairs. Since natural language questions are available in large quantities, we develop models to automatically generate the corresponding keyword queries. Further, we introduce various filtering mechanisms to ensure that synthetic training data is of high quality. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using both automatic and manual evaluation.

The method uses the rotation, scale and translation invariant properties of the Fourier-Mellin transform to preprocess the fingerprint images. Afterward, with the results as the input properties, the automatically fingerprint identification is performed using support vector machines (SVM). The experimental results show that the method of fingerprint identification is effective and has high accuracy.

AB In encoder-decoder neural models, multiple encoders are in general used to represent the contextual information in addition to the individual sentence. In this paper, we investigate multi-encoder approaches in document-level neural machine translation (NMT). Surprisingly, we find that the context encoder does not only encode the surrounding sentences but also behaves as a noise generator. This makes us rethink the real benefits of multi-encoder in context-aware translation - some of the improvements come from robust training. We compare several methods that introduce noise and/or well-tuned dropout setup into the training of these encoders. Experimental results show that noisy training plays an important role in multi-encoder-based NMT, especially when the training data is small. Also, we establish a new state-of-the-art on IWSLT Fr-En task by careful use of noise generation and dropout methods.

AB Machine learning models often fail to generalize to unseen domains due to the distributional shifts. A family of such shifts, "correlation shifts," is caused by spurious correlations in the data. It is studied under the overarching topic of "domain generalization." In this work, we employ multi-modal translation networks to tackle the correlation shifts that appear when data is sampled out-of-distribution. Learning a generative model from training domains enables us to translate each training sample under the special characteristics of other possible domains. We show that by training a predictor solely on the generated samples, the spurious correlations in training domains average out, and the invariant features corresponding to true correlations emerge. Our proposed technique, Expected Domain Translation (EDT), is benchmarked on the Colored MNIST dataset and drastically improves the state-of-the-art classification accuracy by 38% with train-domain validation model selection.

This paper describes the development of a task inventory, i.e., a comprehensive list of the tasks analysts perform with translated material and details the capture of subjective user judgments and insights about MT samples. Also described are the user exercises conducted using machine and human translation samples and the assessment of task performance. By analyzing translation errors, user judgments about errors that interfere with task performance, and user task performance results, we isolate source language patterns which produce output problems, These patterns can then be captured in a single diagnostic test set, to be easily applied to any new Japanese-English system to predict the utility of its output.

TI The CQC Algorithm: Cycling in Graphs to Semantically Enrich and Enhance
   a Bilingual Dictionary
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
AB Bilingual machine-readable dictionaries are knowledge resources useful in many automatic tasks. However, compared to monolingual computational lexicons like WordNet, bilingual dictionaries typically provide a lower amount of structured information such as lexical and semantic relations, and often do not cover the entire range of possible translations for a word of interest. In this paper we present Cycles and Quasi-Cycles (CQC), a novel algorithm for the automated disambiguation of ambiguous translations in the lexical entries of a bilingual machine-readable dictionary. The dictionary is represented as a graph, and cyclic patterns are sought in this graph to assign an appropriate sense tag to each translation in a lexical entry. Further, we use the algorithm's output to improve the quality of the dictionary itself, by suggesting accurate solutions to structural problems such as misalignments, partial alignments and missing entries. Finally, we successfully apply CQC to the task of synonym extraction.

AB We present a novel approach to integrate transliteration into Hindi-to-Urdu statistical machine translation. We propose two probabilistic models, based on conditional and joint probability formulations, that are novel solutions to the problem. Our models consider both transliteration and translation when translating a particular Hindi word given the context whereas in previous work transliteration is only used for translating OOV (out-of-vocabulary) words. We use transliteration as a tool for disambiguation of Hindi homonyms which can be both translated or transliterated or transliterated differently based on different contexts. We obtain final BLEU scores of 19.35 (conditional probability model) and 19.00 (joint probability model) as compared to 14.30 for a baseline phrase-based system and 16.25 for a system which transliterates OOV words in the baseline system. This indicates that transliteration is useful for more than only translating OOV words for language pairs like Hindi-Urdu.

AB Word ambiguity and vocabulary mismatch are critical problems in information retrieval. To deal with these problems, this paper proposes the use of translated words to enrich document representation, going beyond the words in the original source language to represent a document. In our approach, each original document is automatically translated into an auxiliary language, and the resulting translated document serves as a semantically enhanced representation for supplementing the original bag of words. The core of our translation representation is the expected term frequency of a word in a translated document, which is calculated by averaging the term frequencies over all possible translations, rather than focusing on the 1-best translation only. To achieve better efficiency of translation, we do not rely on full-fledged machine translation, but instead use monotonic translation by removing the time-consuming reordering component. Experiments carried out on standard TREC test collections show that our proposed translation representation leads to statistically significant improvements over using only the original language of the document collection.

AB Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a prominent area of research in the field of linguistics. A number of researches have been made to resolve the ambiguity issue in natural sentences. If a sentence has ambiguity or ambiguous word in it, then the meaning of this sentence may differ from context. If the meaning of the sentence is not appropriately inferred from the context, then the WSD algorithms are used to remove the ambiguity. This paper discusses the issue of ambiguity in translation of question paper through various MT tools. In our experiment, we have collected different types of questions for analyzing the impact of ambiguity for wh-questions with respect to other questions (objective, match, fill in the blank and keyword specific). Some machine translators often fail to understand different types of questions and treat them as normal question/sentence. We used five different types of questions in English to translate them using five standard online/offline translators into respective Hindi translation. Our aim is to analyze the impact of translations that arise due to ambiguities. The experiment carried using 150 questions of different types, and the result suggests that most of the translations have performed better in objective questions while the keyword specific questions (such as discuss, explain, etc.) performed poorly.

AB The development of Arabic WordNet (AWN) has provided the Arabic Natural Language Processing (NLP) community with a lexical resource. However, due to the considerable lack of AWN Synsets compared to other WordNets, the use of this resource in Arabic NLP applications cannot be considered as an option yet. In this paper, we propose an automatic approach for AWN enrichment, based on three features: (1) the translation of Princeton WordNet (PWN) words and their direct Hypernyms; (2) an automatic validation of the hypernymy relation that is suggested as existing between words using Wikipedia articles; and (3) the integration of validated Synsets in AWN including their definitions, examples and synonyms that get extracted using dictionaries and other resources. The proposed approach has been implemented and a preliminary evaluation shows that the obtained results are promising.

AB Non-autoregressive Transformer is a promising text generation model. However, current non-autoregressive models still fall behind their autoregressive counterparts in translation quality. We attribute this accuracy gap to the lack of dependency modeling among decoder inputs. In this paper, we propose CNAT, which learns implicitly categorical codes as latent variables into the non-autoregressive decoding. The interaction among these categorical codes remedies the missing dependencies and improves the model capacity. Experiment results show that our model achieves comparable or better performance in machine translation tasks than several strong baselines.

AB Sequence-to-sequence (S2S) pre-training using large monolingual data is known to improve performance for various S2S NLP tasks. However, large monolingual corpora might not always be available for the languages of interest (LOI). Thus, we propose to exploit monolingual corpora of other languages to complement the scarcity of monolingual corpora for the LOI. We utilize script mapping (Chinese to Japanese) to increase the similarity (number of cognates) between the monolingual corpora of helping languages and LOI. An empirical case study of low-resource Japanese English neural machine translation (NMT) reveals that leveraging large Chinese and French monolingual corpora can help overcome the shortage of Japanese and English monolingual corpora, respectively, for S2S pre-training. Using only Chinese and French monolingual corpora, we were able to improve Japanese English translation quality by up to 8.5 BLEU in low-resource scenarios.

AB Recent advances in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) show that adding syntactic information to NMT systems can improve the quality of their translations. Most existing work utilizes some specific types of linguisticallyinspired tree structures, like constituency and dependency parse trees. This is often done via a standard RNN decoder that operates on a linearized target tree structure. However, it is an open question of what specific linguistic formalism, if any, is the best structural representation for NMT. In this paper, we (1) propose an NMT model that can naturally generate the topology of an arbitrary tree structure on the target side, and (2) experiment with various target tree structures. Our experiments show the surprising result that our model delivers the best improvements with balanced binary trees constructed without any linguistic knowledge; this model outperforms standard seq2seq models by up to 2.1 BLEU points, and other methods for incorporating target-side syntax by up to 0.7 BLEU.(1)

Most implementations of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models employ a padding strategy when processing a mini-batch to make all sentences in a mini-batch have the same length. This enables an efficient utilization of caches and GPU/SIMD parallelism but leads to a waste of computation time. In this paper, we implement and parallelize batch learning for a Sequence-toSequence (Seq2Seq) model, which is the most basic model of NMT, without using a padding strategy. More specifically, our approach forms vectors which represent the input words as well as the neural network's states at different time steps into matrices when it processes one sentence, and as a result, the approach makes a better use of cache and optimizes the process that adjusts weights and biases during the back-propagation phase. Our experimental evaluation shows that our implementation achieves better scalability on multi-core CPUs. We also discuss our approach's potential to be used in other implementations of RNN-based models.

TI Tracking translator training in tools and technologies: findings of the
   EMT survey 2017
SO JOURNAL OF SPECIALISED TRANSLATION
AB Over the past quarter century, translation tools and technologies have become indispensable in the language industries, and therefore also in university programmes that train student linguists for entry into them. The two Competence Frameworks set out by the European Master's in Translation (EMT) Network (Gambier (ed.) 2009, Toudic and Krause (eds) 2017) each devote a major section to Technological Competences, and delivering them effectively to students is a key criterion for admission to the Network. In 2012, for the EU-funded OPTIMALE project, the present authors surveyed 50 European postgraduate translator training programmes to investigate which technological competences they were delivering and how they were doing so. In 2017 the EMT Network decided to update and re-run the 2012 survey, to track the evolution of this aspect of translator training over the intervening five-year period. This article reports the results of this latest survey and compares them with those of its predecessor, revealing a clear trend towards greater uptake and professionalisation of tools and technologies training. While it is not possible to ascribe such positive developments solely to the EMT, it is probable that the Network has had a beneficial impact, both by strengthening relations between industry and academia, and by facilitating the exchange of good practices among programmes.

The temporal changes in amounts of translation state depended on the degree of advance of ribosomes on the messenger RNA and their numbers. To evaluate the noise filtering function and the worst case disturbances of the system, we introduced the H infinity control principle for the system equations. Some computational results were given for the temporal property of the translation system.

AB In this paper we report our recent development of an end-to-end integrative design methodology for speech translation. Specifically, a novel decision function is proposed based on the Bayesian analysis, and the associated discriminative learning technique is presented based on the decision-feedback principle. The decision function in our end-to-end design methodology integrates acoustic scores, language model scores and translation scores to refine the translation hypotheses and to determine the best translation candidate. This Bayesian-guided decision function is then embedded into the training process that jointly learns the parameters in speech recognition and machine translation sub-systems in the overall speech translation system. The resulting decision-feedback learning takes a functional form similar to the minimum classification error training. Experimental results obtained on the IWSLT DIALOG 2010 database showed that the proposed system outperformed the baseline system in terms of BLEU score by 2.3 points.

In total, the resource includes 9.17 million segment alignments in 31 language pairs and is publicly available via the ELRC-SHARE repository. The bilingual corpora in this collection could prove valuable in various applications, such as cross-lingual plagiarism detection or adapting Machine Translation systems for the translation of scientific texts and academic writing in general, especially for language pairs which include English.

AB Simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) outputs translation while reading source sentence and hence requires a policy to decide whether to wait for the next source word (READ) or generate a target word (WRITE), the actions of which form a read/write path. Although the read/write path is essential to SiMT performance, no direct supervision is given to the path in the existing methods. In this paper, we propose a method of dual-path SiMT which introduces duality constraints to direct the read/write path. According to duality constraints, the read/write path in source-totarget and target-to-source SiMT models can be mapped to each other. As a result, the two SiMT models can be optimized jointly by forcing their read/write paths to satisfy the mapping. Experiments on En.Vi and De.En tasks show that our method can outperform strong baselines under all latency.

AB In this paper, we develop compositional vector-based semantics of positive transitive sentences using quantum natural language processing (Q-NLP) to compare the parametrized quantum circuits of two synonymous simple sentences in English and Persian. We propose a protocol based on quantum long short-term memory (Q-LSTM) for Q-NLP to perform various tasks in general but specifically for translating a sentence from English to Persian. Then, we generalize our method to use quantum circuits of sentences as an input for the Q-LSTM cell. This enables us to translate sentences in different languages. Our work paves the way toward representing quantum neural machine translation, which may demonstrate quadratic speedup and converge faster or reaches a better accuracy over classical methods.

AB Attention mechanisms have achieved substantial improvements in neural machine translation by dynamically selecting relevant inputs for different predictions. However, recent studies have questioned the attention mechanisms' capability for discovering decisive inputs. In this paper, we propose to calibrate the attention weights by introducing a mask perturbation model that automatically evaluates each input's contribution to the model outputs. We increase the attention weights assigned to the indispensable tokens, whose removal leads to a dramatic performance decrease. The extensive experiments on the Transformer-based translation have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model. We further find that the calibrated attention weights are more uniform at lower layers to collect multiple information while more concentrated on the specific inputs at higher layers. Detailed analyses also show a great need for calibration in the attention weights with high entropy where the model is unconfident about its decision(1).

AB Lack of specialized data makes building a multi-domain neural machine translation tool challenging. Although emerging literature dealing with low resource languages starts to show promising results, most state-of-the-art models used millions of sentences. Today, the majority of multi-domain adaptation techniques are based on complex and sophisticated architectures that are not adapted for real-world applications. So far, no scalable method is performing better than the simple yet effective mixed-finetuning, i.e finetuning a generic model with a mix of all specialized data and generic data. In this paper, we propose a new training pipeline where knowledge distillation and multiple specialized teachers allow us to efficiently finetune a model without adding new costs at inference time. Our experiments demonstrated that our training pipeline allows improving the performance of multi-domain translation over finetuning in configurations with 2, 3, and 4 domains by up to 2 points in BLEU.

TI Attention Analysis and Calibration for Transformer in Natural Language
   Generation
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Attention mechanism has been ubiquitous in neural machine translation by dynamically selecting relevant contexts for different translations. Apart from performance gains, attention weights assigned to input tokens are often utilized to explain that high-attention tokens contribute more to the prediction. However, many works question whether this assumption holds in text classification by manually manipulating attention weights and observing decision flips. This article extends this question to Transformer-based neural machine translation, which heavily relies on cross-lingual attention to produce accurate translations but is relatively understudied in this context. We first design a mask perturbation model which automatically assesses each input's contribution to model outputs. We then test whether the token contributing most to the current translation receives the highest attention weight. We find that it sometimes does not, which closely depends on the entropy of attention weights, the syntactic role of the current generation, and language pairs. We also rethink the discrepancy between attention weights and word alignments from the view of unreliable attention weights. Our observations further motivate us to calibrate the cross-lingual multi-head attention by attaching more attention to indispensable tokens, whose removal leads to a dramatic performance drop. Empirical experiments on different-scale translation tasks and text summarization tasks demonstrate that our calibration methods significantly outperform strong baselines.

We define a number of masks that limit self-attention based on relationships among tree nodes, and we allow each attention head to learn which mask or masks to use. On translation from English to various low-resource languages, and translation in both directions between English and German, our method always improves over simple linearization of the source-side parse tree and almost always improves over a sequence-to-sequence baseline, by up to +2.1% BLEU.

AB Even though a linguistics-free sequence to sequence model in neural machine translation (NMT) has certain capability of implicitly learning syntactic information of source sentences, this paper shows that source syntax can be explicitly incorporated into NMT effectively to provide further improvements. Specifically, we linearize parse trees of source sentences to obtain structural label sequences. On the basis, we propose three different sorts of encoders to incorporate source syntax into NMT: 1) Parallel RNN encoder that learns word and label annotation vectors parallelly; 2) Hierarchical RNN encoder that learns word and label annotation vectors in a two-level hierarchy; and 3) Mixed RNN encoder that stitchingly learns word and label annotation vectors over sequences where words and labels are mixed. Experimentation on Chinese-to-English translation demonstrates that all the three proposed syntactic encoders are able to improve translation accuracy. It is interesting to note that the simplest RNN encoder, i.e., Mixed RNN encoder yields the best performance with an significant improvement of 1.4 BLEU points. Moreover, an in-depth analysis from several perspectives is provided to reveal how source syntax benefits NMT.

AB In this paper we compare structure of Czech word embeddings for English-Czech neural machine translation (NMT), word2vec and sentiment analysis. We show that although it is possible to successfully predict part of speech (POS) tags from word embeddings of word2vec and various translation models, not all of the embedding spaces show the same structure. The information about POS is present in word2vec embeddings, but the high degree of organization by POS in the NMT decoder suggests that this information is more important for machine translation and therefore the NMT model represents it in more direct way. Our method is based on correlation of principal component analysis (PCA) dimensions with categorical linguistic data. We also show that further examining histograms of classes along the principal component is important to understand the structure of representation of information in embeddings.

AB Word discovery is the task of extracting words from un-segmented text. In this paper we examine to what extent neural networks can be applied to this task in a realistic unwritten language scenario, where only small corpora and limited annotations are available. We investigate two scenarios: one with no supervision and another with limited supervision with access to the most frequent words. Obtained results show that it is possible to retrieve at least 27% of the gold standard vocabulary by training an encoder-decoder neural machine translation system with only 5,157 sentences. This result is close to those obtained with a task-specific Bayesian nonparametric model. Moreover, our approach has the advantage of generating translation alignments, which could be used to create a bilingual lexicon.

AB Bioinformatics is the study of computational and statistical techniques used in biological science. It plays an important role in the detection, prediction and treatment of a wide range of biological diseases. Protein is the main component of human tissues made up of amino acids. Post Translation Modification (PTM) is any modification that occurs in amino acids that are making protein. These changes may be done by adding some groups with the amino acids or decomposing a group of amino acids. \A proteome is the complete set of proteins that are expressed by the human organism. As PTM refers to the modification in the proteins so it is very important to understand it for a complete understanding of proteins and the diseases that refers to it. Acetylation, Phosphorylation, Hydroxylation, Methylation, AMPylation, Lipidation, Ubiquitination, Proteolysis, and Deamidation are some PTMs. This study describes machine learning techniques used for the detection of Post Translation Modification. These machine learning techniques include Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), Logical Regression (LR) Pseudo-amino acid composition (PseAAC) using Deep Neural Network, 10-fold cross validation test, Jackknife validation, Independent set testing. These techniques with their results are discussed in this paper.

TI The impact of translation modality on user experience: an eye-tracking
   study of the Microsoft Word user interface
SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB This paper presents results of the effect of different translation modalities on users when working with the Microsoft Word user interface. An experimental study was set up with 84 Japanese, German, Spanish, and English native speakers working with Microsoft Word in three modalities: the published translated version, a machine translated (MT) version (with unedited MT strings incorporated into the MS Word interface) and the published English version. An eye-tracker measured the cognitive load and usability according to the ISO/TR 16982 guidelines: i.e., effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction followed by retrospective think-aloud protocol. The results show that the users' effectiveness (number of tasks completed) does not significantly differ due to the translation modality. However, their efficiency (time for task completion) and self-reported satisfaction are significantly higher when working with the released product as opposed to the unedited MT version, especially when participants are less experienced. The eye-tracking results show that users experience a higher cognitive load when working with MT and with the human-translated versions as opposed to the English original. The results suggest that language and translation modality play a significant role in the usability of software products whether users complete the given tasks or not and even if they are unaware that MT was used to translate the interface.

TI Leveraging Neural Caption Translation with Visually Grounded Paraphrase
   Augmentation
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB Since a concept can be represented by different vocabularies, styles, and levels of detail, a translation task resembles a many-to-many mapping task from a distribution of sentences in the source language into a distribution of sentences in the target language. This viewpoint, however, is not fully implemented in current neural machine translation (NMT), which is one-to-one sentence mapping. In this study, we represent the distribution itself as multiple paraphrase sentences, which will enrich the model context understanding and trigger it to produce numerous hypotheses. We use a visually grounded paraphrase (VGP), which uses images as a constraint of the concept in paraphrasing, to guarantee that the created paraphrases are within the intended distribution. In this way, our method can also be considered as incorporating image information into NMT without using the image itself. We implement this idea by crowdsourcing a paraphrasing corpus that realizes VGP and construct neural paraphrasing that behaves as expert models in a NMT. Our experimental results reveal that our proposed VGP augmentation strategies showed improvement against a vanilla NMT baseline.

AB In Switzerland, two thirds of the population speak Swiss German, a primarily spoken language with no standardised written form. It is widely used on Swiss TV, for example in news reports, interviews or talk shows, and subtitles are required for people who cannot understand this spoken language. This paper focuses on the task of automatic Standard German subtitling of spoken Swiss German, and more specifically on the translation of a normalised Swiss German speech recognition result into Standard German suitable for subtitles. We compared different statistical and deep learning machine translation systems for this task. We also produced an aligned corpus of normalised Swiss German and Standard German subtitles. Results of two evaluations, automatic and human, show that the systems succeed in improving the content, but are currently not capable of producing entirely correct Standard German.

AB Large-scale transformers have been shown the state-of-the-art on neural machine translation. However, training these increasingly wider and deeper models could be tremendously memory intensive. We reduce the memory burden by employing the idea of reversible networks that a layer's input can be reconstructed from its output. We design three types of multi-split based reversible transformers. We also devise a corresponding back-propagation algorithm, which does not need to store activations for most layers. Furthermore, we present two fine-tuning techniques: splits shuffle and self ensemble, to boost translation accuracy. Specifically, our best models surpass the vanilla transformer by at least 1.4 BLEU points in three datasets. Our large-scale reversible models achieve 30.0 BLEU in WMT' 14 En-De and 43.5 BLEU in WMT' 14 En-Fr, beating several very strong baselines with less than half of the training memory.

TI Automatic assessment of spoken-language interpreting based on
   machine-translation evaluation metrics A multi-scenario exploratory
   study
SO INTERPRETING
AB Automated metrics for machine translation (MT) such as BLEU are customarily used because they are quick to compute and sufficiently valid to be useful in MT assessment. Whereas the instantaneity and reliability of such metrics are made possible by automatic computation based on predetermined algorithms, their validity is primarily dependent on a strong correlation with human assessments. Despite the popularity of such metrics in MT, little research has been conducted to explore their usefulness in the automatic assessment of human translation or interpreting. In the present study, we therefore seek to provide an initial insight into the way MT metrics would function in assessing spoken-language interpreting by human interpreters. Specifically, we selected five representative metrics - BLEU, NIST, METEOR, TER and BERT - to evaluate 56 bidirectional consecutive English-Chinese interpretations produced by 28 student interpreters of varying abilities. We correlated the automated metric scores with the scores assigned by different types of raters using different scoring methods (i.e., multiple assessment scenarios). The major finding is that BLEU, NIST, and METEOR had moderate-to-strong correlations with the human-assigned scores across the assessment scenarios, especially for the English-to-Chinese direction. Finally, we discuss the possibility and caveats of using MT metrics in assessing human interpreting.

AB Nowadays e-commerce search has become an integral part of many people's shopping routines. One critical challenge in today's e-commerce search is the semantic matching problem where the relevant items may not contain the exact terms in the user query. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network based approach to query rewriting, in order to tackle this problem. Specifically, we formulate query rewriting into a cyclic machine translation problem to leverage abundant click log data. Then we introduce a novel cyclic consistent training algorithm in conjunction with state-of-the-art machine translation models to achieve the optimal performance in terms of query rewriting accuracy. In order to make it practical in industrial scenarios, we optimize the syntax tree construction to reduce computational cost and online serving latency. Offfine experiments show that the proposed method is able to rewrite hard user queries into more standard queries that are more appropriate for the inverted index to retrieve. Comparing with human curated rule-based method, the proposed model significantly improves query rewriting diversity while maintaining good relevancy. Online A/B experiments show that it improves core e-commerce business metrics significantly. Since the summer of 2020, the proposed model has been launched into our search engine production, serving hundreds of millions of users.

TI Comparison and Combination of Lightly Supervised Approaches for Language
   Portability of a Spoken Language Understanding System
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Portability of a spoken dialogue system (SDS) to a new domain or a new language is a hot topic as it may imply gains in time and cost for building new SDSs. In particular in this paper we investigate several fast and efficient approaches for language portability of the spoken language understanding (SLU) module of a dialogue system. We show that the use of statistical machine translation (SMT) can reduce the time and the cost of porting a system from a source to a target language. For conceptual decoding, a state-of-the-art module based on conditional random fields (CRF) is used and a new approach based on phrase-based statistical machine translation (PB-SMT) is also evaluated. The experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed methods for a fast and low cost SLU language portability. In addition, we propose two methods to increase SLU robustness to translation errors. Overall, it is shown that the combination of all these approaches can further reduce the concept error rate. While most of the experiments in this paper deal with portability from French to Italian (given the availability of the Media French corpus and its subset manually translated into Italian), a validation of our methodology is eventually proposed in Arabic.

SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB How to utilize information sufficiently is a key problem in neural machine translation (NMT), which is effectively improved in rich-resource NMT by leveraging large-scale bilingual sentence pairs. However, for low-resource NMT, lack of bilingual sentence pairs results in poor translation performance; therefore, taking full advantage of global information in the encoding-decoding process is effective for low-resource NMT. In this article, we propose a novel reread-feedback NMT architecture (RFNMT) for using global information. Our architecture builds upon the improved sequence-to-sequence neural network and consists of a doubledeck attention-based encoder-decoder framework. In our proposed architecture, the information generated by the first-pass encoding and decoding process flows to the second-pass encoding process for more sufficient parameters initialization and information use. Specifically, we first propose a "reread" mechanism to transfer the outputs of the first-pass encoder to the second-pass encoder, and then the output is used for the initialization of the second-pass encoder. Second, we propose a "feedback" mechanism that transfers the first-pass decoder's outputs to a second-pass encoder via an important weight model and an improved gated recurrent unit (GRU). Experiments on multiple datasets show that our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art NMT systems, especially in low-resource settings.

SO JOURNAL OF SPECIALISED TRANSLATION
AB Technology plays an important role in the language industry. Investigating computer-assisted translation tools and machine translation systems is a continuing concern within translation studies. Among translation technologies, translator platforms, which are used both by translators and clients, have received scant attention in the research literature despite the fact that they can facilitate important tasks for translators such as order management. This paper provides an initial attempt to define translator platforms and their purpose. Moreover, it analyses the attitude towards these platforms among translators at different professional stages and with different years of experience. This study consists of a qualitative and a quantitative part. Semi-structured expert interviews and a survey among students in the field of specialised translation have revealed the differences regarding (expectations of) translation management and attitudes towards translator platforms. Especially professional translators who have already gained a foothold in the translation sector and are satisfied with their order management are sceptical about translator platforms providing order management features. Students, regardless of their practical translation experience, have a more positive attitude towards translator platforms. They appreciate the automatically generated quotations and invoices as well as client acquisition.

TI Word reordering on multiple pivots for the Japanese and Indonesian
   language pair
SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB We investigated multiple pivot approaches for the Japanese and Indonesian (Ja-Id) language pair in phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT). We used four languages as pivots: viz., English, Malaysian, Filipino, and the Myanmar language. Considering that each language pair between the source-pivot and pivot-target has a different word order, we conducted two experiments, namely, without reordering (WoR) and with reordering (WR) on the source language. Triangulation and linear interpolation (LI) approaches were used to combine multiple pivot phrase tables. The combination of phrase tables was employed without a source-target phrase table. In the WoR experiment, the use of multiple pivots improved the BLEU scores by 0.24 and 2.49 compared to the baseline and single pivot, respectively. However, the translation output of WoR was incomprehensible because it followed the Japanese word order. In the WR experiment, we reordered the Japanese word order, that is, subject-object-verb (SOV), into Indonesian word order, that is, subject-verb-object (SVO) using the Lader (Latent Derivation Reorderer). The multiple pivots of WR improved the BLEU scores by 0.47 compared with the baseline. Furthermore, by combining many pivot languages, the BLEU score was improved by more than 0.20. The translation output of WR is also more comprehensible than that of WoR. Finally, a comparison with neural machine translation (NMT) indicates that SMT obtained better results than NMT in the experiments, including a small dataset setup.

TI Unsupervised Quality Estimation for Neural Machine Translation
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Quality Estimation (QE) is an important component in making Machine Translation (MT) useful in real-world applications, as it is aimed to inform the user on the quality of the MT output at test time. Existing approaches require large amounts of expert annotated data, computation, and time for training. As an alternative, we devise an unsupervised approach to QE where no training or access to additional resources besides the MT system itself is required. Different from most of the current work that treats the MT system as a black box, we explore useful information that can be extracted from theMT system as a by-product of translation. By utilizing methods for uncertainty quantification, we achieve very good correlation with human judgments of quality, rivaling state-of-the-art supervised QE models. To evaluate our approach we collect the first dataset that enables work on both black-box and glass-box approaches to QE.

TI Synchronous bidirectional inference for neural sequence generation
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB In sequence to sequence generation tasks (e.g. machine translation and abstractive summarization), inference is generally performed in a left-to-right manner to produce the result token by token. The neural approaches, such as LSTM and self-attention networks, are now able to make full use of all the predicted history hypotheses from left side during inference, but cannot meanwhile access any future (right side) information and usually generate unbalanced outputs (e.g. left parts are much more accurate than right ones in Chinese-English translation). In this work, we propose a synchronous bidirectional inference model to generate outputs using both left-to-right and right-to-left decoding simultaneously and interactively. First, we introduce a novel beam search algorithm that facilitates synchronous bidirectional decoding. Then, we present the core approach which enables left-to-right and right-to-left decoding to interact with each other, so as to utilize both the history and future predictions simultaneously during inference. We apply the proposed model to both LSTM and self-attention networks. Furthermore, we propose a novel fine-tuning based parameter optimization algorithm in addition to the simple two-pass strategy. The extensive experiments on machine translation and abstractive summarization demonstrate that our synchronous bidirectional inference model can achieve remarkable improvements over the strong baselines.

TI Neural machine translation for Tamil to English
SO JOURNAL OF STATISTICS & MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
AB The Tamil language is spoken by 80 million people around the world. The translation between Tamil and English leads to a signi?cant impact by helping in the understanding of Tamil scripts, which otherwise would be a tedious, costly, and time-consuming process. Thus, developing an automated system to perform Tamil to English translation would save human time and effort. We publicly release a new high-quality corpus for standard training, evaluation, and report results experiments with two different architectures based on Encoder-Decoder to translate Tamil to English. We further tried to improve it by experimenting with pre-trained word embeddings and tuning hyperparameters.

AB Any-Language Communications has developed a novel semantics-oriented pre-market prototype system, based on the Theory of Universal Grammar, that uses the innate relationships of the words in a sensible sentence (the natural intelligence) to determine the true contextual meaning of all the words. The system is built on a class/category structure of language concepts and includes a weighted inheritance system, a number language word conversion, and a tailored genetic algorithm to select the best of the possible word meanings. By incorporating all of the language information within the dictionaries, the same semantic processing code is used to interpret any language. This approach is suitable for machine translation (NIT), sophisticated text mining, and artificial intelligence applications. An MT system has been tested with English, French, German, Hindi, and Russian. Sentences for each of those languages have been successfully interpreted and proper translations generated.

AB Low-frequency word prediction remains a challenge in modern neural machine translation (NMT) systems. Recent adaptive training methods promote the output of infrequent words by emphasizing their weights in the overall training objectives. Despite the improved recall of low-frequency words, their prediction precision is unexpectedly hindered by the adaptive objectives. Inspired by the observation that low frequency words form a more compact embedding space, we tackle this challenge from a representation learning perspective. Specifically, we propose a frequency-aware token-level contrastive learning method, in which the hidden state of each decoding step is pushed away from the counterparts of other target words, in a soft contrastive way based on the corresponding word frequencies. We conduct experiments on widely used NIST Chinese-English and WMT14 English-German translation tasks. Empirical results show that our proposed methods can not only significantly improve the translation quality but also enhance lexical diversity and optimize word representation space. Further investigation reveals that, comparing with related adaptive training strategies, the superiority of our method on low-frequency word prediction lies in the robustness of token-level recall across different frequencies without sacrificing precision.

AB Cross-lingual word embeddings are the representations of words across languages in a shared continuous vector space. Cross-lingual word embeddings have been shown to be helpful in the development of cross-lingual natural language processing tools. In case of more than two languages involved, we call them multilingual word embeddings. In this work, we introduce a multilingual word embedding corpus which is acquired by using neural machine translation. Unlike other cross-lingual embedding corpora, the embeddings can be learned from significantly smaller portions of data and for multiple languages at once. An intrinsic evaluation on monolingual tasks shows that our method is fairly competitive to the prevalent methods but on the cross-lingual document classification task, it obtains the best figures. We are in the process to produce the embeddings for more languages, especially the languages which belong to the same family or sematically close to each others, such as Japanese-Korean, Chinese-Vietnamese, German-Dutch, or Latin-based languagues. Furthermore, the corpus is being analyzedd regarding its usage and usefulness in other cross-lingual tasks.

AB Several natural languages have had much processing, but the problem of limited linguistic resources remains. Manual creation of parallel corpora by humans is rather expensive and very time consuming. In addition, language data required for statistical machine translation (SMT) does not exist in adequate capacity to use its statistical information to initiate the research process. On the other hand, applying unsubstantiated approaches to build the parallel resources from multiple means like comparable corpora or quasi-comparable corpora is very complicated and provides rather noisy output. These outputs of the process would later need to be reprocessed, and in-domain adaptations would also be required. To optimize the performance of these algorithms, it is essential to use a quality parallel corpus for training of the end-to-end procedure. In the present research, we have developed a methodology to generate an accurate parallel corpus from monolingual resources through the calculation of compatibility between the results of machine translation systems. We have translations of huge, single-language resources through the application of multiple translation systems and the strict measurement of translation compatibility with rules based on the Levenshtein distance. The results produced by such an approach are very favorable. All the monolingual resources that we obtained were taken from the WMT16 conference for Czech to generate the parallel corpus, which improved translation performance.

AB Learning multilingual and multi-domain translation model is challenging as the heterogeneous and imbalanced data make the model converge inconsistently over different corpora in real world. One common practice is to adjust the share of each corpus in the training, so that the learning process is balanced and low-resource cases can benefit from the highresource ones. However, automatic balancing methods usually depend on the intra- and interdataset characteristics, which is usually agnostic or requires human priors. In this work, we propose an approach, MULTIUAT, that dynamically adjusts the training data usage based on the model's uncertainty on a small set of trusted clean data for multi-corpus machine translation. We experiment with two classes of uncertainty measures on multilingual (16 languages with 4 settings) and multi-domain settings (4 for in-domain and 2 for out-of-domain on English-German translation) and demonstrate our approach MULTIUAT substantially outperforms its baselines, including both static and dynamic strategies. We analyze the crossdomain transfer and show the deficiency of static and similarity based methods.(1)

In contrast to previously proposed heuristic methods, our method finds a segmentation that directly maximizes the performance of the machine translation system. We describe two methods based on greedy search and dynamic programming that search for the optimal segmentation strategy. An experimental evaluation finds that our algorithm is able to segment the input two to three times more frequently than conventional methods in terms of number of words, while maintaining the same score of automatic evaluation.(1)

AB To simultaneously translate a source language into multiple different target languages is one of the most common scenarios of multilingual translation. However, existing methods cannot make full use of translation model information during decoding, such as intra-lingual and inter-lingual future information, and therefore may suffer from some issues like the unbalanced outputs. In this paper, we present a new approach for synchronous interactive multilingual neural machine translation (SimNMT), which predicts each target language output simultaneously and interactively using historical and future information of all target languages. Specifically, we first propose a synchronous cross-interactive decoder in which generation of each target output does not only depend on its generated sequences, but also relies on its future information, as well as history and future contexts of other target languages. Then, we present a new interactive multilingual beam search algorithm that enables synchronous interactive decoding of all target languages in a single model. We take two target languages as an example to illustrate and evaluate the proposed SimNMT model on IWSLT datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements over several advanced NMT and MNMT models.

AB Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is an effective framework to model the interdependency for non-autoregressive neural machine translation (NAT). One of the prominent VAE-based NAT frameworks, LaNMT, achieves great improvements to vanilla models, but still suffers from two main issues which lower down the translation quality: (1) mismatch between training and inference circumstances and (2) inadequacy of latent representations. In this work, we target on addressing these issues by proposing posterior consistency regularization. Specifically, we first perform stochastic data augmentation on the input samples to better adapt the model for inference circumstance, and then conduct consistency training on posterior latent variables to construct a more robust latent representations without any expansion on latent size. Experiments on En<->De and En<->Ro benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our methods with about 1.5/0.7 and 0.8/0.3 BLEU points improvement to the baseline model with about 12.6x faster than autoregressive Transformer.

AB We present a work to evaluate the hypothesis that automatic evaluation metrics developed forMachine Translation (MT) systems have significant impact on predicting semantic similarity scores in Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task, in light of their usage for paraphrase identification. We show that different metrics may have different behaviors and significance along the semantic scale [0-5] of the STS task. In addition, we compare several classification algorithms using a combination of different MT metrics to build an STS system; consequently, we show that although this approach obtains remarkable result in paraphrase identification task, it is insufficient to achieve the same result in STS. We show that this problem is due to an excessive adaptation of some algorithms to dataset domain and at the end a way to mitigate or avoid this issue.

AB Neural machine translation has achieved remarkable progress over the past several years; however, little attention has been paid to machine translation (MT) between Japanese and Chinese, which share a large proportion of cognate words that can be utilized as additional linguistic knowledge to enhance translation performance. In this article, we seek to strengthen the semantic correlation between Japanese and Chinese by leveraging cognate words that share common Chinese characters. Specifically, we experiment with three strategies: (1) a shared vocabulary with cognate lexicon induction, which models the commonality between source and target cognates; (2) a shared private representation with a dynamic gating mechanism, which models the language-specific features on the source side; and (3) an embedding shortcut, which enables the decoder to access the shared private representation with shortest distance and aids the training process. The experiments and analysis presented in this article demonstrate that our proposed approaches can significantly improve the performance of both Japanese-to-Chinese and Chinese-to-Japanese translations and verify the effectiveness of exploiting Japanese-Chinese cognates for MT.

AB Recently, mobile computing and embedded devices equipped with high performance computing components such as multicore processor and GPU are becoming popular. In order to speedup user programs by making full use of these computing components, it is necessary to optimize the program according to the runtime environment on various types of devices. Binary code optimization is one promising solution. Especially, in order to optimize ARM-native program code for various target devices, using the LLVM compiler infrastructure for binary code optimization is considered quite useful. To realize this, we want to use various optimization modules of LLVM compiler, but they perform their processings on LLVM-IR (Intermediate Representation). Thus, we need to develop a frontend for LLVM that translates ARM machine code to LLVM-IR. In this paper, we make preliminary discussions on the ARM-to-LLVM-IR translation. The translated IR codes should match the optimization process of LLVM. However, what form of IR code is desired is unclear, so we aim at generating the IR code equivalent to the compiler-generated IR code. We discuss a code translation method by comparing with the IR codes generated by Clang from C source codes. Preliminary evaluation results show that our translation method can generate the IR codes equivalent to the one generated from C source program code.

AB Though machine translation errors caused by the lack of context beyond one sentence have long been acknowledged, the development of context-aware NMT systems is hampered by several problems. Firstly, standard metrics are not sensitive to improvements in consistency in document-level translations. Secondly, previous work on context-aware NMT assumed that the sentence-aligned parallel data consisted of complete documents while in most practical scenarios such document-level data constitutes only a fraction of the available parallel data. To address the first issue, we perform a human study on an English-Russian subtitles dataset and identify deixis, ellipsis and lexical cohesion as three main sources of inconsistency. We then create test sets targeting these phenomena. To address the second shortcoming, we consider a set-up in which a much larger amount of sentence-level data is available compared to that aligned at the document level. We introduce a model that is suitable for this scenario and demonstrate major gains over a context-agnostic baseline on our new benchmarks without sacrificing performance as measured with BLEU.(1)

AB An example-based machine translation (EBMT) system based on proportional analogies requires numerous proportional analogies between linguistic units to work properly. Consequently, long sentences cannot be handled directly in such a framework. Cutting sentences into chunks would be a solution. Using different markers, we count the number of proportional analogies between chunks in 11 European languages. As expected, the number of proportional analogies between chunks found is very high. These results, and preliminary experiments in translation, are promising for the EBMT system that we intend to build.

AB This paper considers the unsupervised domain adaptation problem for neural machine translation (NMT), where we assume the access to only monolingual text in either the source or target language in the new domain We propose a cross-lingual data selection method to extract in-domain sentences in the missing language side from a large generic monolingual corpus. Our proposed method trains an adaptive layer on top of multilingual BERT by contrastive learning to align the representation between the source and target language. This then enables the transferability of the domain classifier between the languages in a zero-shot manner. Once the in-domain data is detected by the classifier, the NMT model is then adapted to the new domain by jointly learning translation and domain discrimination tasks. We evaluate our cross-lingual data selection method on NMT across five diverse domains in three language pairs, as well as a real-world scenario of translation for COVID-19. The results show that our proposed method outperforms other selection baselines up to +1.5 BLEU score.

AB Previous studies have shown that neural machine translation (NMT) models can benefit from explicitly modeling translated (PAST) and untranslated (FUTURE) source contents as recurrent states (Zheng et al., 2018). However, this less interpretable recurrent process hinders its power to model the dynamic updating of PAST and FUTURE contents during decoding. In this paper, we propose to model the dynamic principles by explicitly separating source words into groups of translated and untranslated contents through parts-to-wholes assignment. The assignment is learned through a novel variant of routing-by-agreement mechanism (Sabour et al., 2017), namely Guided Dynamic Routing, where the translating status at each decoding step guides the routing process to assign each source word to its associated group (i.e., translated or untranslated content) represented by a capsule, enabling translation to be made from holistic context. Experiments show that our approach achieves substantial improvements over both RNMT and Transformer by producing more adequate translations. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our method is highly interpretable, which is able to recognize the translated and untranslated contents as expected.(1)

AB In this paper we try to alleviate the problem of scares resources for developing Farsi-English Statistical Machine Translation system (SMT). It is done by applying Active Learning (AL) idea to choose more informative sentences to be translated by a human and then be added to the base-line corpus. While using the human translations is worthless in compare to the other approaches of corpus gathering (like automatic approaches), it is more costly too. So, in this way we can improve the translation system with less cost. This is done in intricate to human translator. Applying Active learning idea to a SMT system, changes it to a system which can improve its based-line corpus by asking for the essential data which directly leads to the system improvement. On the other hand, combination of AL idea with SMT is a way of using source side monolingual resources for improving SMT systems which is ignored in the original theory of SMT. Our results for Farsi-English system shows improvement in compare to random sentence selection.

TI An in-depth analysis of the individual impact of controlled language
   rules on machine translation output: a mixed-methods approach
SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB Examining the general impact of Controlled Language (CL) rules in the context of Machine Translation (MT) has been an area of research for many years. The present study focuses on the following question: how do CL rules impact MT output individually? By analysing a German corpus-based test suite of technical texts that have been translated into English by different MT systems, this study endeavours to answer this question at different levels: the general impact of CL rules (rule- and system-independent), their impact at rule level (system-independent) as well as at rule and system level. The results of five MT systems are analysed and contrasted: a rule-based system, a statistical system, two differently constructed hybrid systems, and a neural system. For this, a mixed-methods triangulation approach that includes error annotation, human evaluation, and automatic evaluation was applied. The data was analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of CL influence on the following parameters: number and type of MT errors, style and content quality, and scores of two automatic evaluation metrics. In line with many studies, the results show a general positive impact of the applied CL rules on the MT output. However, at rule level, only four rules proved to have positive effects on the aforementioned parameters; three rules had negative effects on the parameters; and two rules did not show any significant impact. At rule and system level, the rules affected the MT systems differently, as expected. Rules that had a positive impact on earlier MT approaches did not show the same impact on the neural MT approach. Furthermore, neural MT delivered distinctly better results than earlier MT approaches, namely the highest error-free, style and content quality rates both before and after applying the rules, which indicates that neural MT offers a promising solution that no longer requires CL rules for improving the MT output.

AB Transfer learning from high-resource languages is known to be an efficient way to improve end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) for low-resource languages. Pre-trained or jointly trained encoder-decoder models, however, do not share the language modeling (decoder) for the same language, which is likely to be inefficient for distant target languages. We introduce speech-to-text translation (ST) as an auxiliary task to incorporate additional knowledge of the target language and enable transferring from that target language. Specifically, we first translate high-resource ASR transcripts into a target low resource language, with which a ST model is trained. Both ST and target ASR share the same attention-based encoder-decoder architecture and vocabulary. The former task then provides a fully pre-trained model for the latter, bringing up to 24.6% word error rate (WER) reduction to the baseline (direct transfer from high-resource ASR). We show that training ST with human translations is not necessary. ST trained with machine translation (MT) pseudo-labels brings consistent gains. It can even outperform those using human labels when transferred to target ASR by leveraging only 500K MT examples. Even with pseudo-labels from low-resource MT (200K examples), ST-enhanced transfer brings up to 8.9% WER reduction to direct transfer.

SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB IntroductionDespite the growing attention paid to the research of translation technology teaching (TTT), there is still a lack of studies on students' attitudes and the motivational factors in relation to it. To this end, the paper reports on a questionnaire-based study that describes students' attitudes towards translation technology (in the Chinese MTI context) and explores its structural relations with translation mindsets and future work self. MethodsData were collected from 108 grade 2021 MTI students of three selected Chinese universities and analyzed using descriptive statistics and structural equation modeling (SEM). ResultsThe results demonstrate that Chinese MTI students' overall attitudes towards translation technology are slightly positive. So far, they perceive translation technology to be slightly effective for translation and are slightly mindful of it. They are slightly influenced by teachers and still feel inhibited when learning and using it. Furthermore, the results also indicate that growth translation mindsets positively influence students' attitudes towards the effectiveness of translation technology, teacher influence, exhibition to translation technology, and mindfulness about translation technology, whereas fixed translation mindsets only negatively predict students' teacher influence. Likewise, future work self-salience positively associates with students' attitudes towards the effectiveness of translation technology and mindfulness about translation technology, while future work self-elaboration positively relates to students' exhibition to translation technology. Among them, growth translation mindsets are the strongest predictor for all attitudes components. DiscussionTheoretical and pedagogical implications are also discussed.

TI Automatic Extraction of English-Chinese Translation Templates Based on
   Deep Learning
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB Translation templates are an important cause of knowledge in machine translation (MT) systems. Their quality and scale directly influence the performance of MT systems. How to obtain high-quality and efficient translation templates from corpora has become a hot topic in recent study. In this paper, a tree to String alignment template (TAT) based on syntactic structure is proposed. This template describes the alignment between the source language syntax tree and the target language string. The syntactic structure, a large number of construction tags, and variables are introduced into the template, which enables the syntactic model to deal with discontinuous phrases and has the ability of generalization. Templates can be used in syntactic statistics, case-based, and rule-based MT systems according to different decoders. ATTEBSC algorithm is a basic method to learn translation templates by comparing sentence pairs. It demands that sentence pairs be constructed in a precise comparison structure ahead of time, but there are no strict guidelines on how to do it. In this paper, we propose a method to calculate the specific comparison scheme using the longest common subsequence (LCS) and use the normalized LCS distance to screen sentences with high similarity and then use the ATTEBSC algorithm to automatically remove the template. Experiments show that this method is easy and effective, and many expensive templates can be learned.

TI Improving translation quality stability using Bayesian predictive
   adaptation
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB We introduce a Bayesian approach for the adaptation of the log-linear weights present in state-of-the-art statistical machine translation systems. Typically, these weights are estimated by optimising a given translation quality criterion, taking only into account a certain set of development data (e.g., the adaptation data). In this article, we show that the Bayesian framework provides appropriate estimates of such weights in conditions where adaptation data is scarce. The theoretical framework is presented, alongside with a thorough experimentation and comparison with other weight estimation methods. We provide a comparison of different sampling strategies, including an effective heuristic strategy and a theoretically sound Markov chain Monte-Carlo algorithm. Experimental results show that Bayesian predictive adaptation (BPA) outperforms the re-estimation from scratch in conditions where adaptation data is scarce. Further analysis reveals that the improvements obtained are due to the greater stability of the estimation procedure. In addition, the proposed BPA framework has a much lower computational cost than raw re-estimation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI AN EXAMPLE-BASED DISAMBIGUATION OF ENGLISH PREPOSITIONAL PHRASE
   ATTACHMENT
SO SYSTEMS AND COMPUTERS IN JAPAN
AB The English prepositional phrase often has multiple candidates for attachment. Usually, it is difficult to determine uniquely the attachment of the prepositional phrase only by the syntactic analysis. Since the prepositional phrase appears with a high frequency, it is a very important problem in English analysis to disambiguate the attachment. In the machine translation, for example, the translation of the preposition and consequently the translation of the whole sentence become unnatural if the attachment of the prepositional phrase is not correctly identified.
   This paper proposes the Example-Based Disambiguation (EBD) method, which is composed of the following processes: (1) examples (prepositional phrase and its attachment) are extracted from the corpus; (2) the semantic distance between the input expression and the example is calculated according to the thesaurus; and (3) the attachment of the prepositional phrase is disambiguated using the example with the minimum distance. Through the comparison experiment between the proposed method and the conventional method, it is shown that the former is better in terms of the success rate in the determination of the prepositional phrase attachment.

AB The use of computer-based technologies by non-native Arabic-speaking teachers for teaching native Arabic-speaking students can result in higher learner engagement. In this study, a machine translation (MT) system is developed as a learning technology. The proposed system can be linked to a digital podium and projector to reduce multitasking. A total of 25 students from Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University, Saudi Arabia participated in our experiment and survey related to the use of the proposed technology-enhanced MT system. An important reason for using this framework is to exploit the high service bandwidth (up to several bandwidths) made available for interactive translation services. The framework is deployed by linking it to a video camera, digital podium, and projector in each classroom for the translation operation. Accordingly. After employing the system, the effect on the understanding of the students of the technical aspects of the subject that was taught using English was evaluated. The results indicated that the use of the developed technology for translation during classroom sessions was beneficial. Furthermore, the engagement of students in the classes improved their performance and learning outcomes. The students also commented that the proposed framework is useful from two perspectives: vocabulary improvement and subject comprehension. Many of the students indicated that working on assignments and homework using the framework was useful because words difficult

TI Machine learning for automatic rule classification of agricultural
   regulations: A case study in Spain
SO COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
AB Currently, pest management practices require modern equipment and the use of complex information, such as regulations and guidelines. The complexity of regulations is the root cause of the emergence of automated solutions for compliance assessment by translating regulations into sets of machine-processable rules that can be run by specialized modules of farm management information systems (FMIS). However, the manual translation of rules is prohibitively costly, and therefore, this translation should be carried out with the support of artificial intelligence techniques.
   In this paper, we use the official Spanish phytosanitary products registry to empirically evaluate the performance of four popular machine learning algorithms in the task of correctly classifying pesticide regulations as prohibitions or obligations. Moreover, we also evaluate how to improve the performance of the algorithms in the preprocessing of the texts with natural language processing techniques. Finally, due to the specific characteristics of the texts found in pesticide regulations, resampling techniques are also evaluated. Experiments show that the combination of the machine learning algorithm Logic regression, the natural language technique part-ofspeech tagging and the resampling technique Tomek links is the best performing approach, with an F-1 score of 68.8%, a precision of 84.46% and a recall of 60%. The experimental results are promising, and they show that this approach can be applied to develop a computer-aided tool for transforming textual pesticide regulations into machine-processable rules. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates the use of artificial intelligence methods for the automatic translation of agricultural regulations into machine-processable representations.

AB The aim of the pilot study is to draw attention to the importance of online translation tools as a contemporary didactic tool in the language and translation educational process. In the paper the following hypotheses were tested: (i) use of free online translation tools can contribute to the development of ICT competences; (ii) use of modern translation tools contribute to the consistency and quality; (iii) free online translation tools for under-resourced languages can be used as pedagogical tools. Two studies were conducted using the text of EU legislation (acquis communautaire). In the first study, evaluation of the German-Slovenian translation quality of legislation was performed between two groups: one group using traditional reference works and the other group using online electronic translation tools (the Slovenian multilingual terminology database Evroterm and the bilingual corpus Evrokorpus). In both translations, mistakes were analyzed and a paired samples t-test was conducted. In the second study, machine translation of English-Croatian legislative text using the Google Translate online translation service was analyzed. The human evaluation of the translation quality was calculated, and Fleiss' kappa metric used to assess inter-rater reliability of agreement. The evaluation was enriched by analysis of different types of errors.

AB It is reported that grammatical information is useful for machine translation (MT) task. However, the annotation of grammatical information requires the highly human resources. Furthermore, it is not trivial to adapt grammatical information to MT since grammatical annotation usually adapts tokenization standards which might not be suitable to capture the relation of two languages, and the use of subword tokenization, e.g., Byte-Pair-Encoding, to alleviate out-of-vocabulary problem might not be compatible with those annotations. In this work, we propose two methods to explicitly incorporate grammatical information without supervising annotation; first, latent phrase structure is induced in an unsupervised fashion from a multi-head attention mechanism; second, the induced phrase structures in encoder and decoder are synchronized so that they are compatible with each other using constraints during training. We demonstrate that our approach produces better performance and explainability in two tasks, translation and alignment tasks without extra resources. Although we could not obtain the high quality phrase structure in constituency parsing when evaluated monolingually, we find that the induced phrase structures enhance the explainability of translation through the synchronization constraint.

TI Explicitly Modeling Word Translations in Neural Machine Translation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB In this article, we show that word translations can be explicitly incorporated into NMT effectively to avoid wrong translations. Specifically, we propose three cross-lingual encoders to explicitly incorporate word translations into NMT: (1) Factored encoder, which encodes a word and its translation in a vertical way; (2) Gated encoder, which uses a gated mechanism to selectively control the amount of word translations moving forward; and (3) Mixed encoder, which stitchingly learns a word and its translation annotations over sequences where words and their translations are alternatively mixed. Besides, we first use a simple word dictionary approach and then a word sense disambiguation (WSD) approach to effectively model the word context for better word translation. Experimentation on Chinese-to-English translation demonstrates that all proposed encoders are able to improve the translation accuracy for both traditional RNN-based NMT and recent self-attention-based NMT (hereafter referred to as Transformer). Specifically, Mixed encoder yields the most significant improvement of 2.0 in BLEU on the RNN-based NMT, while Gated encoder improves 1.2 in BLEU on Transformer. This indicates the usefulness of an WSD approach in modeling word context for better word translation. This also indicates the effectiveness of our proposed cross-lingual encoders in explicitly modeling word translations to avoid wrong translations in NMT. Finally, we discuss in depth how word translations benefit different NMT frameworks from several perspectives.

AB Neural machine translation (NMT) is a popular topic in Natural Language Processing which uses deep neural networks (DNNs) for translation from source to targeted languages. With the emerging technologies, such as bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), attention mechanisms, and beam-search algorithms, NMT can deliver improved translation quality compared to the conventional statistics-based methods, especially for translating long sentences. However, higher translation quality means more complicated models, higher computation/memory demands, and longer translation time, which causes difficulties for practical use. In this paper, we propose a design methodology for implementing the inference of a real-life NMT (with the problem size = 172 GFLOP) on FPGA for improved run time latency and energy efficiency. We use High-Level Synthesis (HLS) to build high-performance parameterized IPs for handling the most basic operations (multiply-accumulations) and construct these IPs to accelerate the matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) kernels, which are frequently used in NMT. Also, we perform a design space exploration by considering both computation resources and memory access bandwidth when utilizing the hardware parallelism in the model and generate the best parameter configurations of the proposed IPs. Accordingly, we propose a novel hybrid parallel structure for accelerating the NMT with affordable resource overhead for the targeted FPGA. Our design is demonstrated on a Xilinx VCU118 with overall performance at 7.16 GFLOPS.

AB We present a framework for the verified programming of multi-tape Turing machines in Coq. Improving on prior work by Asperti and Ricciotti in Matita, we implement multiple layers of abstraction. The highest layer allows a user to implement nontrivial algorithms as Turing machines and verify their correctness, as well as time and space complexity compositionally. The user can do so without ever mentioning states, symbols on tapes or transition functions: They write programs in an imperative language with registers containing values of encodable data types, and our framework constructs corresponding Turing machines.
   As case studies, we verify a translation from multi-tape to single-tape machines as well as a universal Turing machine, both with polynomial time overhead and constant factor space overhead.

AB Popular Neural Machine Translation model training uses strategies like backtranslation to improve BLEU scores, requiring large amounts of additional data and training. We introduce a class of conditional generative-discriminative hybrid losses that we use to fine-tune a trained machine translation model. Through a combination of targeted fine-tuning objectives and intuitive re-use of the training data the model has failed to adequately learn from, we improve the model performance of both a sentence-level and a contextual model without using any additional data. We target the improvement of pronoun translations through our fine-tuning and evaluate our models on a pronoun benchmark testset. Our sentence-level model shows a 0.5 BLEU improvement on both the WMT14 and the IWSLT13 De-En testsets, while our contextual model achieves the best results, improving from 31.81 to 32 BLEU on WMT14 De-En testset, and from 32.10 to 33.13 on the IWSLT13 De-En testset, with corresponding improvements in pronoun translation. We further show the generalizability of our method by reproducing the improvements on two additional language pairs, Fr-En and Cs-En.(1)

AB This paper proposes a dependency-enhanced pre-reordering method for Chinese-English statistical machine translation (SMT). Firstly, two kinds of dependency structure-based rules are extracted based on the source-side dependency tree and corresponding word alignments between the source-side and the target-side sentences. Then a maximum entropy classifier is used to calculate the orientation probability in terms of swap or monotone between two rules. As a result, a reordering rule set is obtained. Two different ways are proposed to filter out the rule set. Afterwards, the dependency parsing trees of the training data, development set and the test set are traversed, and if the syntactic sub-tree structure matches the rules in the rule set, the word orders will be adjusted. Thus, a reordered source-side sentence is generated and then fed into an SMT system for translation. Experiments conducted on NIST Chinese-English MT data sets show that the proposed method significantly improves translation performance by 0.46 BLEU compared to the baseline system.

TI Query Rewriting Using Monolingual Statistical Machine Translation
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Long queries often suffer from low recall in Web search due to conjunctive term matching. The chances of matching words in relevant documents can be increased by rewriting query terms into new terms with similar statistical properties. We present a comparison of approaches that deploy user query logs to learn rewrites of query terms into terms from the document space. We show that the best results are achieved by adopting the perspective of bridging the "lexical chasm" between queries and documents by translating from a source language of user queries into a target language of Web documents. We train a state-of-the-art statistical machine translation model on query-snippet pairs from user query logs, and extract expansion terms from the query rewrites produced by the monolingual translation system. We show in an extrinsic evaluation in a real-world Web search task that the combination of a query-to-snippet translation model with a query language model achieves improved contextual query expansion compared to a state-of-the-art query expansion model that is trained on the same query log data.

AB Patent retrieval is a branch of Information Retrieval (IR) that aims to enable the challenging task of retrieving highly technical and often complicated patents. Typically, patent granting bodies translate patents into several major foreign languages, so that language boundaries do not hinder their accessibility. Given such multilingual patent collections, we posit that the patent translations can be exploited for facilitating patent retrieval.
   Specifically, we focus on the translation of patent queries from German and French, the morphology of which poses an extra challenge to retrieval. We compare two translation approaches that expand the query with (i) translated terms and (ii) translated phrases. Experimental evaluation on a standard CLEF-IP European Patent Office dataset reveals a novel finding: phrase translation may be more suited to French, and term translation may be more suited to German. We trace this finding to language morphology, and we conclude that tailoring the query translation per language can lead to improved results in patent retrieval.

The virtual machines have been widely developed and adopted for the flight software because of advantage of the reusability of the flight software and the portability of the virtual machine. However, most of virtual machines in flight software has not supported the real-time property. Also, the interpreter has slow translation speed compared to compilation-based methods. These cause the limitation of applications running on virtual machine. We introduce the virtual machine design which is supporting the real time property and improving the performance of the interpreter execution.

AB The exact position in space of the end effecter or tool head cannot be not sensed directly in many automated machines. These machines operate under overall 'open loop' control as the software controlling the machine makes a calculated estimate of where the tool head should be. This is done by monitoring sensors on axes that track linear translation and rotations of shafts/gears. For low precision applications this system is appropriate. However positional errors can occur and accumulate. There exists a need for a sensor system that is capable of acquiring the exact spatial coordinates of the tool point or end effector directly.

TI Research on an English translation method based on an improved
   transformer model
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB With the expansion of people's needs, the translation performance of traditional models is increasingly unable to meet current demands. This article mainly studied the Transformer model. First, the structure and principle of the Transformer model were briefly introduced. Then, the model was improved by a generative adversarial network (GAN) to improve the translation effect of the model. Finally, experiments were carried out on the linguistic data consortium (LDC) dataset. It was found that the average Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) value of the improved Transformer model improved by 0.49, and the average perplexity value reduced by 10.06 compared with the Transformer model, but the computation speed was not greatly affected. The translation results of the two example sentences showed that the translation of the improved Transformer model was closer to the results of human translation. The experimental results verify that the improved Transformer model can improve the translation quality and be further promoted and applied in practice to further improve the English translation and meet application needs in real life.

TI A Comparative Study of Text Genres in English-Chinese Translation
   Effects Based on Deep Learning LSTM
SO COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE
AB In recent years, neural network-based English-Chinese translation models have gradually supplanted traditional translation methods. The neural translation model primarily models the entire translation process using the "encoder-attention-decoder" structure. Simultaneously, grammar knowledge is essential for translation, as it aids in the grammatical representation of word sequences and reduces grammatical errors. The focus of this article is on two major studies on attention mechanisms and grammatical knowledge, which will be used to carry out the following two studies. Firstly, in view of the existing neural network structure to build translation model caused by long distance dependent on long-distance information lost in the delivery, leading to problems in terms of the translation effect which is not ideal, put forward a kind of embedded attention long short-term memory (LSTM) network translation model. Secondly, in view of the lack of grammatical prior knowledge in translation models, a method is proposed to integrate grammatical information into translation models as prior knowledge. Finally, the proposed model is simulated on the IWSLT2019 dataset. The results show that the proposed model has a better representation of source language context information than the existing translation model based on the standard LSTM model.

TI An Intelligent Recognition of English Translation Based on Improved GLR

SO MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB English is a global language. In the process of China's internationalization, overcoming the difficulty of understanding English is the only way to achieve cultural exchanges, economic exchanges, and even scientific and technological exchanges. Especially in the context of globalization, translation between languages has become the focus of transnational communication. However, there are still problems such as low accuracy and singularity in current machine translation. Aiming at the above problems, based on the improved GLR algorithm (IGLR), this paper proposes a recognition method to solve the English translation problem. First, a corpus is built, and the number of label words reaches tens of thousands. In this way, the automatic search function of the phrase is realized. In addition, create an intelligent method for translation; and plan the intelligent recognition model with data collection, processing, and output; extract characteristic parameters to realize intelligent translation. Conduct an experimental analysis on the designed English translation method and record the experimental data. Through the experiment, it can be seen that the designed translation method can achieve accurate translation results and meet the actual needs.

To retaining a constant and appropriated surface cutting speed in CNC machining, this method considers the part surface geometry, synthetic movement and kinetics of machine tools. In contrast to those traditional methods, the method can gain more appropriate F-code instruction in NC program. Then a X'Y'ZAB type five-axis machine tool is taken as an example to analyze the translation and rotation movement respectively, and the displacement and velocity changing curves of each axis were displayed as the result. By utilizing aided information file and setting proper F-code in NC program files, this method can facilitate improvement of machining quality and efficiency.

AB In this paper, we introduce the Do-It-Yourself virtual memory translation (DVMT) architecture as a flexible complement for current hardware-fixed translation flows. DVMT decouples the virtual-to-physical mapping process from the access permissions, giving applications freedom in choosing mapping schemes, while maintaining security within the operating system. Furthermore, DVMT is designed to support virtualized environments, as a means to collapse the costly, hardware-assisted two-dimensional translations. We describe the architecture in detail and demonstrate its effectiveness by evaluating several different DVMT schemes on a range of virtualized applications with a model based on measurements from a commercial system. We show that different DVMT configurations preserve the native performance, while achieving speedups of 1.2x to 2.0x in virtualized environments.

AB A natural language interface is always desirable for a search system. While performance of machine translation for general texts with acceptable computational costs seems to reach a limit, narrowing down the domain to one of queries reduces the complexity and enables better translation correctness. This paper proposes a query translation method that is robust to ill-formed questions and exploits knowledge of an ontology for semantic search. It uses conceptual graphs as the target language for the translation. As a logical inter-lingua with smooth mapping to and from natural language, conceptual graphs simplify translation rules and can be easily converted to other formal query languages. Experiment results of the method on the TREC 2002 and TREC 2007 data sets are also presented and discussed.

AB Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a vital field of artificial intelligence that automates the study of human language. However for Malay manuscripts (MM) written in old jawi, its exposure on such field is limited. Besides, most of the studies related to MM studies and NLP were focused on rule based or rule based machine transliteration (RBMT). Hence the objective of this study is to propose a statistical approach for old jawi to modern jawi transliteration of Malay manuscript contents using Phrase Based Statistical Machine Translation (PBSMT) as its model. In order to achieve such purpose, quality score of Word Error Rate (WER) was computed on the transliteration output. Besides, the issues formerly encountered by rule based approach such as vocals limitation and homograph, reduplication, letters error and combination of multiple words were observed in the implementation. Moreover, this paper utilized exploratory approach as its research strategy and mixed method as its research method. The data for the analysis were extracted from a MM titled Bidayat al-Mubtadi bi-Fadlillah al-Muhdi. Quality score of WER was computed for the evaluation of SMT output. Afterwards, related issues were identified and assessed. The research found that quality score of PBSMT for old jawi to modern jawi transliteration was high in terms of WER, however the issues of rule based were generally addressed by PBSMT except homograph. The research is however limited to the approach of SMT that solely focused on PBSMT as its model. Moreover, the corpus size was limited to one manuscript while SMT relies on corpus size. Nevertheless the research contributes to the wider coverage on Malay language as one of the under resource languages in NLP, in form of old and modern jawi. Besides, to the best of the researcher's knowledge, it is also the first to apply SMT (PBSMT) approach on old jawi transliteration. Most importantly, the study is to contribute on MM's studies.

The behaviors of instructions are abstractly represented as manipulation of the machine state. The behavior of each basic block of the software program is then represented as state transition pair. Instruction set retargeting is then modeled as the problem of finding sequences of instructions accomplishing the same machine state transitions at the target machine as does the software program at the source machine. The proposed approach has been successfully demonstrated for software translation between several industrial microcontrollers.

However translators frequently engage in operations that do not start from textual meaning but from phonetic form, typographic form or some other formal feature of a text. In this article, I look at several such operations, and how they are used in handling proper names, numerical expressions, text in a third language, so-called untranslatable words, passages of uncertain meaning, and poetry, as well as their use in translation studies and linguistics journals, and in pronunciation guides for tourists and for choirs singing in languages unknown to their members.

AB Neural machine translation (NMT) has achieved impressive performance recently by using large-scale parallel corpora. However, it struggles in the low-resource and morphologically-rich scenarios of agglutinative language translation task. Inspired by the finding that monolingual data can greatly improve the NMT performance, we propose a multi-task neural model that jointly learns to perform bi-directional translation and agglutinative language stemming Our approach employs the shared encoder and decoder to train a single model without changing the standard NMT architecture but instead adding a token before each source-side sentence to specify the desired target outputs of the two different tasks. Experimental results on Turkish-English and Uyghur-Chinese show that our proposed approach can significantly improve the translation performance on agglutinative languages by using a small amount of monolingual data.

We use prosodic and lexical cues to determine sentence boundaries, and successfully combine two complementary approaches to sentence boundary prediction. We also introduce a new feature for segmentation prediction that directly considers the assumptions of the phrase translation model. In addition, we show how automatically predicted commas can be used to constrain reordering in MT search. We evaluate the presented methods using a state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical MT system on two large vocabulary tasks. We find that careful optimization of the segmentation parameters directly for translation quality improves the translation results in comparison to independent optimization for segmentation quality of the predicted source language sentence boundaries.

To obtain MT systems of different translation quality, we degrade a rule-based MT system by decreasing the size of the rule base and the size of the dictionary. We use the degraded MT systems to translate queries and submit the translated queries of varying quality to the IR system. Retrieval effectiveness is found to correlate highly with the translation quality of the queries. We further analyze the factors that affect the retrieval effectiveness. Title queries are found to be preferred in MT-based CLIR. In addition, dictionary-based degradation is shown to have stronger impact than rule-based degradation in MT-based CLIR.

AB This paper is based on the work carried out in the framework of the VERBMOBIL project, which is a limited-domain speech translation task (German-English). In the final evaluation, the statistical approach was found to perform best among five competing approaches.
   In this paper, we will further investigate the used statistical translation models. A shortcoming of the single-word based model is that it does not take contextual information into account for the translation decisions. We will present a translation model that is based on bilingual phrases to explicitly model the local context. We will show that this model performs better than the single-word based model. We will compare monotone and non-monotone search for this model and we will investigate the benefit of using the sum criterion instead of the maximum approximation.

AB This paper proposes some ideas to build an effective estimator, which predicts the quality of words in a Machine Translation (MT) output. We integrate a number of features of various types (system-based, lexical, syntactic and semantic) into the conventional feature set, for our baseline classifier training. After the experiments with all features, we deploy a "Feature Selection" strategy to filter the best performing ones. Then, a method that combines multiple "weak" classifiers to build a strong "composite" classifier by taking advantage of their complementarity allows us to achieve a better performance in term of F score. Finally, we exploit word confidence scores for improving the estimation system at sentence level.

TI Machine translation-based bug localization technique for bridging
   lexical gap
SO INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
AB Context: The challenge of locating bugs in mostly large-scale software systems has led to the development of bug localization techniques. However, the lexical mismatch between bug reports and source codes degrades the performances of existing information retrieval or machine learning-based approaches.
   Objective: To bridge the lexical gap and improve the effectiveness of localizing buggy files by leveraging the extracted semantic information from bug reports and source code.
   Method: We present BugTranslator, a novel deep learning-based machine translation technique composed of an attention-based recurrent neural network (RNN) Encoder-Decoder with long short-term memory cells. One RNN encodes bug reports into several context vectors that are decoded by another RNN into code tokens of buggy files. The technique studies and adopts the relevance between the extracted semantic information from bug reports and source files.
   Results: The experimental results show that BugTranslator outperforms a current state-of-the-art word embedding technique on three open-source projects with higher MAP and MRR. The results show that BugTranslator can rank actual buggy files at the second or third places on average.
   Conclusion: BugTranslator distinguishes bug reports and source code into different symbolic classes and then extracts deep semantic similarity and relevance between bug reports and the corresponding buggy files to bridge the lexical gap at its source, thereby further improving the performance of bug localization.

AB In simultaneous machine translation (SMT), an output sequence should be produced as soon as possible, without reading the whole input sequence. This requirement creates a trade-off between translation delay and quality because less context may be known during translation. In most SMT methods, this trade-off is controlled with parameters whose values need to be tuned. In this paper, we introduce an SMT system that learns with reinforcement and is able to find the optimal delay in training. We conduct experiments on Tatoeba and IWSLT2014 datasets against state-of-the-art translation architectures. Our method achieves comparable results on the former dataset, with better results on long sentences and worse but comparable results on the latter dataset.

AB One of the major challenges in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the handling of idioms; seemingly ordinary phrases which could be further conjugated or even spread across the sentence to fit the context. Since idioms are a part of natural language, the ability to tackle them brings us closer to creating efficient NLP tools. This paper presents a multilingual parallel idiom dataset for seven Indian languages in addition to English and demonstrates its usefulness for two NLP applications - Machine Translation and Sentiment Analysis. We observe significant improvement for both the subtasks over baseline models trained without employing the idiom dataset.

In this work, we propose the use of machine translation to translate English transcripts of telephone speech into Czech language in order to improve a Czech CTS speech recognition system. The translated transcripts are used as additional language model training data in a scenario where the baseline language model is trained on off-and close-domain data only. We report perplexities, OOV and word error rates and examine different data sets and translators on their suitability for the described task.

NSE is equipped with a novel memory update rule and has a variable sized encoding memory that evolves over time and maintains the understanding of input sequences through read, compose and write operations. NSE can also access1 multiple and shared memories. In this paper, we demonstrated the effectiveness and the flexibility of NSE on five different natural language tasks: natural language inference, question answering, sentence classification, document sentiment analysis and machine translation where NSE achieved state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on publically available benchmarks. For example, our shared-memory model showed an encouraging result on neural machine translation, improving an attention-based baseline by approximately 1.0 BLEU.

AB Hierarchical Communicating Real-Time State Machines (H-CRSM) is a formal modelling language for the modular development of distributed real-time systems. The formalism is characterized by the use of state transitions with guarded commands and timing constraints, the adoption of a few distilled statecharts constructs, and the modular specification of timing constraints along a state hierarchy. This paper proposes a translation of H-CRSM into UPPAAL which enables model checking. Translation rests on unfolding a hierarchical model on a flat representation. The resultant approach is demonstrated by means of a case study. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

TI Investigating global language networks using Google search queries
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB Over the centuries, languages have evolved and influenced each other. These changes might have been caused by long wars, economic superiority, religious imposition or scientific domination. These macro-level forces at micro-level deeply involve individuals who want to translate their messages into another language. Therefore, the frequency of translation requests from a language to another might be an acceptable measure to show the necessity of those languages to each other given speakers of those languages are unable to communicate due to linguistic barriers. In this paper, we first collect the average number of translation requests per month from the Google search engine for one hundred languages and then visualize them by using customized presentation software to identify features and patterns. Based on the extracted information, the rank and the position of each language in the global language network have been investigated with respect to four criteria: translation balance, centrality, the number of connections and native speaker population, and interconnections between language families. Our study sheds light on the individual's consumption behavior of machine translation in different cultures. Our findings might be interesting especially for policymakers who design school curricula.

TI Translational Regulation of Yersinia enterocolitica mRNA Encoding a Type
   Ill Secretion Substrate
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Background:Yersinia enterocolitica yopD, lcrH, and yscM1 control the expression of yopQ encoding a secretion substrate. Results: YopD associates with 30 S ribosomal particles, and YopD, LcrH, and YscM1 block yopQ mRNA translation. Conclusion: In response to environmental signals, Yersinia prevent yopQ expression by blocking the translation of its transcripts. Significance: These results demonstrate translational regulation for the Yersinia type III secretion pathway. Yersinia enterocolitica type III secretion machines transport YopQ and other Yop effectors into host immune cells. YopD and its chaperone LcrH are essential components of the Yersinia type III pathway, enabling effector translocation into host cells. YopD, LcrH, and YscM1 also regulate yop expression post-transcriptionally in response to environmental signals; however, the molecular mechanisms for this regulation and Yop secretion are unknown. We show here that YopD associates with 30 S ribosomal particles in a manner requiring LcrH. When added to ribosomes, YopD, LcrH, and YscM1 block the translation of yopQ mRNA. We propose a model whereby LcrH-dependent association of YopD with 30 S ribosomal particles enables YscM1 to block yopQ translation unless type III machines are induced to secrete the effector.

AB A regularization technique based on adversarial perturbation, which was initially developed in the field of image processing, has been successfully applied to text classification tasks and has yielded attractive improvements. We aim to further leverage this promising methodology into more sophisticated and critical neural models in the natural language processing field, i.e., neural machine translation (NMT) models. However, it is not trivial to apply this methodology to such models. Thus, this paper investigates the effectiveness of several possible configurations of applying the adversarial perturbation and reveals that the adversarial regularization technique can significantly and consistently improve the performance of widely used NMT models, such as LSTM-based and Transformer-based models.(1)

TI Retrieval-Based Transformer Pseudocode Generation
SO MATHEMATICS
AB The comprehension of source code is very difficult, especially if the programmer is not familiar with the programming language. Pseudocode explains and describes code contents that are based on the semantic analysis and understanding of the source code. In this paper, a novel retrieval-based transformer pseudocode generation model is proposed. The proposed model adopts different retrieval similarity methods and neural machine translation to generate pseudocode. The proposed model handles words of low frequency and words that do not exist in the training dataset. It consists of three steps. First, we retrieve the sentences that are similar to the input sentence using different similarity methods. Second, pass the source code retrieved (input retrieved) to the deep learning model based on the transformer to generate the pseudocode retrieved. Third, the replacement process is performed to obtain the target pseudo code. The proposed model is evaluated using Django and SPoC datasets. The experiments show promising performance results compared to other language models of machine translation. It reaches 61.96 and 50.28 in terms of BLEU performance measures for Django and SPoC, respectively.

AB Neural machine translation (NMT) suffers a performance deficiency when a limited vocabulary fails to cover the source or target side adequately, which happens frequently when dealing with morphologically rich languages. To address this problem, previous work focused on adjusting translation granularity or expanding the vocabulary size. However, morphological information is relatively under-considered in NMT architectures, which may further improve translation quality. We propose a novel method, which can not only reduce data sparsity but also model morphology through a simple but effective mechanism. By predicting the stein and suffix separately during decoding, our system achieves an improvement of up to 1.98 BLEU compared with previous work on English to Russian translation. Our method is orthogonal to different NMT architectures and stably gains improvements on various domains.

AB In machine translation (MT) mediated human-to-human communication, it is not an easy task to select the languages and translation services to be used as the users have various language backgrounds and skills. Our previous work introduced the best-balanced machine translation mechanism (BBMT) to automatically select the languages and translation services so as to equalize the language barriers of participants and to guarantee their equal opportunities in joining conversations. To assign proper languages to be used, however, the mechanism needs information of the participants' language skills, typically participants' language test scores. Since it is important to keep test score confidential, as well as other sensitive information, this paper introduces agents, which exchange encrypted information, and secure computation to ensure that agents can select the languages and translation services without destroying privacy. Our contribution is to introduce a multi-agent system with secure computation that can protect the privacy of users in multilingual communication. To our best knowledge, it is the first attempt to introduce multi-agent systems and secure computing to this area. The key idea is to model interactions among agents who deal with user's sensitive data, and to distribute calculation tasks to three different types of agents, together with data encryption, so no agent is able to access or recover participants' score.

TI Large Pages and Lightweight Memory Management in Virtualized

AB Large pages have long been used to mitigate address translation overheads on big-memory systems, particularly in virtualized environments where TLB miss overheads are severe. We show, however, that far from being a panacea, large pages are used sparingly by modern virtualization software. This is because large pages often preclude lightweight memory management, which can outweigh their Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) benefits. For example, they reduce opportunities to deduplicate memory among virtual machines in overcommitted systems, interfere with lightweight memory monitoring, and hamper the agility of virtual machine (VM) migrations. While many of these problems are particularly severe in overcommitted systems with scarce memory resources, they can (and often do) exist generally in cloud deployments. In response, virtualization software often (though it doesn't have to) splinters guest operating system (OS) large pages into small system physical pages, sacrificing address translation performance for overall system-level benefits. We introduce simple hardware that bridges this fundamental conflict, using speculative techniques to group contiguous, aligned small page translations such that they approach the address translation performance of large pages. Our Generalized Large-page Utilization Enhancements (GLUE) allow system hypervisors to splinter large pages for agile memory management, while retaining almost all of the TLB performance of unsplintered large pages.

AB We present a translation scheme from a pure functional domain-specific language (DSL) to C. The over-arching idea of this scheme is to preserve the structure of the input program as much as possible. This includes, among other things, to refrain from inlining user-written functions and to retain variable names as much as possible. We apply this translation scheme to GDSL, a DSL used for the specification of decoders for machine instructions. GDSL offers non-trivial language features such as monadic actions that our translation scheme maps one-to-one to C statements, resulting in code that closely resembles hand-written C code. Indeed, it is feasible to debug and profile the program at the C level and to interface the generated code with existing C code without marshaling data. Our translation scheme is therefore an attractive starting point for a light-weight DSL since no other language-specific tools besides the compiler are necessary. Moreover, the generated code is amenable to compiler optimizations found in off-the-shelf C compilers. This is illustrated by the performance achieved by a decoder for x86 machine instructions implemented in GDSL which is as fast as a production-quality decoding library shipped by Intel.

AB While end-to-end neural machine translation (NMT) has made remarkable progress recently, it still suffers from the data scarcity problem for low-resource language pairs and domains. In this paper, we propose a method for zero-resource NMT by assuming that parallel sentences have close probabilities of generating a sentence in a third language. Based on the assumption, our method is able to train a source-to-target NMT model ("student") without parallel corpora available guided by an existing pivot-to-target NMT model ("teacher") on a source-pivot parallel corpus. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves over a baseline pivot-based model by +3.0 BLEU points across various language pairs.

AB Pre-training and fine-tuning have achieved great success in natural language process field. The standard paradigm of exploiting them includes two steps: first, pre-training a model, e.g. BERT, with a large scale unlabeled monolingual data. Then, fine-tuning the pre-trained model with labeled data from downstream tasks. However, in neural machine translation (NMT), we address the problem that the training objective of the bilingual task is far different from the monolingual pre-trained model. This gap leads that only using fine-tuning in NMT can not fully utilize prior language knowledge. In this paper, we propose an APT framework for acquiring knowledge from pre-trained model to NMT. The proposed approach includes two modules: 1). a dynamic fusion mechanism to fuse task-specific features adapted from general knowledge into NMT network, 2). a knowledge distillation paradigm to learn language knowledge continuously during the NMT training process. The proposed approach could integrate suitable knowledge from pre-trained models to improve the NMT. Experimental results on WMT English to German, German to English and Chinese to English machine translation tasks show that our model outperforms strong baselines and the fine-tuning counterparts.

AB Automatic speech to speech translation is known to be highly beneficial in enabling people to directly communicate with each other when they do not share a common language. This work presents a modular system for Romanian to English and English to Romanian speech translation created by integrating four families of components in a cascaded manner: (1) automatic speech recognition, (2) transcription correction, (3) machine translation and (4) text-to-speech. We further experimented with several models for each component and present several indicators of the system's performance. Modularity allows the system to be expanded with additional modules for each of the four components. The resulting system is currently deployed on RELATE and is available for public usage through the web interface of the platform.

TI Intersubunit Bridges of the Bacterial Ribosome
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB The ribosome is a large two-subunit ribonucleoprotein machine that translates the genetic code in all cells, synthesizing proteins according to the sequence of the mRNA template. During translation, the primary substrates, transfer RNAs, pass through binding sites formed between the two subunits. Multiple interactions between the ribosomal subunits, termed intersubunit bridges, keep the ribosome intact and at the same time govern dynamics that facilitate the various steps of translation such as transfer RNA-mRNA movement. Here, we review the molecular nature of these intersubunit bridges, how they change conformation during translation, and their functional roles in the process. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This article discusses the production of new "postgenomic" knowledges that aim to be more ecological and "wholistic" than the reductionist genetics of the last forty years. It examines systems biology and, briefly, developmental systems theory, which are two approaches that attempt to model complexities in biology. System biological metaphors and languages have been in part taken from engineering models of automobiles, airplanes and robots and then applied to complex living systems. Systems biology is only the most recent example and perhaps an excellent case in which to study this movement back and forth across the machine-living organism border in Euro-American biology to track how what we know to be nature and machine is constituted. This article argues for a careful analysis of this historical production specifically around the question of what is lost in translation at these border crossings and their potential consequences.

TI Adaptive Language Processing Based on Deep Learning in Cloud Computing

SO COMPLEXITY
AB With the continuous advancement of technology, the amount of information and knowledge disseminated on the Internet every day has been developing several times. At the same time, a large amount of bilingual data has also been produced in the real world. These data are undoubtedly a great asset for statistical machine translation research. Based on the dual-sentence quality corpus screening, two corpus screening strategies are proposed first, based on the double-sentence pair length ratio method and the word-based alignment information method. The innovation of these two methods is that no additional linguistic resources such as bilingual dictionary and syntactic analyzer are needed as auxiliary. No manual intervention is required, and the poor quality sentence pairs can be automatically selected and can be applied to any language pair. Secondly, a domain adaptive method based on massive corpus is proposed. The method based on massive corpus utilizes massive corpus mechanism to carry out multidomain automatic model migration. In this domain, each domain learns the intradomain model independently, and different domains share the same general model. Through the method of massive corpus, these models can be combined and adjusted to make the model learning more accurate. Finally, the adaptive method of massive corpus filtering and statistical machine translation based on cloud platform is verified. Experiments show that both methods have good effects and can effectively improve the translation quality of statistical machines.

AB Learning both domain mapping and domain knowledge is crucial for different sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) tasks. Traditionally, seq2seq model only characterized domain mapping while the knowledge in source and target domains was ignored. To strengthen seq2seq representation, this study presents a unified transformer for bidirectional domain mapping where collaborative regularization is imposed. This regularization enforces the bidirectional mapping constraint and avoids the model from overfitting for better generalization. Importantly, the unified learning objective is optimized for collaborative learning among different modules in two domains with two learning directions. Experiments on machine translation demonstrate the merit of unified transformer by comparing with the existing methods under different tasks and settings.

To avoid the data sparseness problem and to uncover relations between sublexical components of words such as morphemes, we have converted our parallel texts to a morphemic representation and then used standard word alignment algorithms. Results from a mere 3K sentences of parallel English-Turkish texts show that we are able to link Turkish morphemes with English morphemes and function words quite successfully. We have also used the Turkish WordNet which is linked with the English WordNet, as a bootstrapping dictionary to constrain root word alignments.

TI Reordering space design in statistical machine translation
SO LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
AB In Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), the constraints on word reorderings have a great impact on the set of potential translations that is explored during search. Notwithstanding computational issues, the reordering space of a SMT system needs to be designed with great care: if a larger search space is likely to yield better translations, it may also lead to more decoding errors, because of the added ambiguity and the interaction with the pruning strategy. In this paper, we study the reordering search space, using a state-of-the art translation system, where all reorderings are represented in a permutation lattice prior to decoding. This allows us to directly explore and compare different reordering schemes and oracle settings. We also study in detail a rule-based preordering system, varying the length and number of rules, the tagset used, as well as contrasting with purely combinatorial subsets of permutations. We carry out experiments on three language pairs in both directions: English-French, a close language pair; English-German and English-Czech, two much more challenging pairs. We show that even though it might be desirable to design better reordering spaces, model and search errors seem to be the most important issues. Therefore, improvements of the reordering space should come along with improvements of the associated models to be really effective.

AB Data selection has been demonstrated to be an effective approach to addressing the lack of high-quality bitext for statistical machine translation in the domain of interest. Most current data selection methods solely use language models trained on a small scale in-domain data to select domain-relevant sentence pairs from general-domain parallel corpus. By contrast, we argue that the relevance between a sentence pair and target domain can be better evaluated by the combination of language model and translation model. In this paper, we study and experiment with novel methods that apply translation models into domain-relevant data selection. The results show that our methods outperform previous methods. When the selected sentence pairs are evaluated on an end-to-end MT task, our methods can increase the translation performance by 3 BLEU points.

AB Current predominant neural machine translation (NMT) models often have a deep structure with large amounts of parameters, making these models hard to train and easily suffering from over-fitting. A common practice is to utilize a validation set to evaluate the training process and select the best checkpoint. Average and ensemble techniques on checkpoints can lead to further performance improvement. However, as these methods do not affect the training process, the system performance is restricted to the checkpoints generated in the original training procedure. In contrast, we propose an online knowledge distillation method. Our method on-the-fly generates a teacher model from checkpoints, guiding the training process to obtain better performance. Experiments on several datasets and language pairs show steady improvement over a strong self-attention-based baseline system. We also provide analysis on data-limited setting against over-fitting. Furthermore, our method leads to an improvement on a machine reading experiment as well.

AB Sanskrit and Hindi are considered structurally close owing to genealogical relations. However, on a closer look, Hindi appears to have diverged significantly more in terms of structure than in lexical ingenuities. Gender, number distinctions, ergative, postposition, verb group, double causative, echo are some (among many) remarkable structural innovations that Hindi has gone through over the ages. While the structure of Sanskrit vibhakti was fairly organized, the same may not be true for Hindi. The present paper is a study in mapping Sanskrit Noun Phrase (NP) case markers with Hindi for Machine Translation (MT) purposes with a view to evolve cross-linguistic model for Indian languages.

Because their definitions are dated, we first extend their machine model to modern architectures with paged virtual memory, 10 and interrupts. We then use our new model to show that ARMv7-A is not classically virtualizable.
   Insights such as binary translation enable efficient virtualization beyond the original criteria. Companies are also making their architectures virtualizable through extensions. We analyse both approaches for ARM and conclude that both have their use in future systems. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper explores a simple and effective unified framework for incorporating soft linguistic reordering constraints into a hierarchical phrase-based translation system: 1) a syntactic reordering model that explores reorderings for context free grammar rules; and 2) a semantic reordering model that focuses on the reordering of predicate-argument structures. We develop novel features based on both models and use them as soft constraints to guide the translation process. Experiments on Chinese-English translation show that the reordering approach can significantly improve a state-of-the-art hierarchical phrase-based translation system. However, the gain achieved by the semantic reordering model is limited in the presence of the syntactic reordering model, and we therefore provide a detailed analysis of the behavior differences between the two.

AB This paper provides an overview of NVIDIA NeMo's speech translation systems for the IWSLT 2022 Offline Speech Translation Task. Our cascade system consists of 1) Conformer RNN-T automatic speech recognition model, 2) punctuation-capitalization model based on pretrained T5 encoder, 3) ensemble of Transformer neural machine translation models fine-tuned on TED talks. Our end-to-end model has less parameters and consists of Conformer encoder and Transformer decoder. It relies on the cascade system by re-using its pre-trained ASR encoder and training on synthetic translations generated with the ensemble of NMT models. Our En -> De cascade and end-to-end systems achieve 29.7 and 26.2 BLEU on the 2020 test set correspondingly, both outperforming the previous year's best of 26 BLEU.

AB The translation stage in cross language information retrieval (CLIR) acts as the main enabling stage to cross the language barrier between documents and queries. In recent years machine translation (MT) systems have become the dominant approach to translation in CLIR. However, unlike information retrieval (IR), MT focuses on the morphological and syntactical quality of the sentence. This requires large training resources and high computational power for training and translation. We present a novel technique for MT designed specifically for CLIR. In this method IR text pre-processing in the form of stop word removal and stemming are applied to the MT training corpus prior to the training phase. Applying this pre-processing step is found to significantly speed up the translation process without affecting the retrieval quality.

AB Neural Machine Translation (MT) has reached state-of-the-art results. However, one of the main challenges that neural MT still faces is dealing with very large vocabularies and morphologically rich languages.
   In this paper, we propose a neural MT system using character-based embeddings in combination with convolutional and highway layers to replace the standard lookup-based word representations. The resulting unlimited-vocabulary and affix-aware source word embeddings are tested in a state-of-the-art neural MT based on an attention-based bidirectional recurrent neural network. The proposed MT scheme provides improved results even when the source language is not morphologically rich. Improvements up to 3 BLEU points are obtained in the German-English WMT task.

AB The present article aims at presenting the results of the first pilot project we carried out in the framework of our Ph. D. research. In concrete terms, we will explain our provisional findings related to the study of the 51 first texts of a corpus constituted by texts translated from English into French in the European Commission's Directorate-General for Translation (DGT). In these texts, we analysed segments which were post-edited by the volunteer translators taking part in our project. We studied the modifications introduced in the post-edited segments by French units' revisers throughout the revision process. All modifications introduced by revisers in the post-edited segments were attributed a penalty score thanks to an evaluation tool issued by Toudic et al. (2014), so that we could compute an average penalty score for each text and translator. We also grouped all modifications by revisers in post-edited segments under several categories that we will briefly describe. Finally, we will draw provisional conclusions related to the influence of Machine Translation post-editing on the quality of the final texts provided by the translators participating in our project.

AB Allowing learners to self-assess their knowledge through questions is a well-established method to improve learning. However, many educational texts lack a sufficient amount of questions for self-studying. Hence, learners read texts passively, and learning becomes inefficient. To alleviate the lack of questions, educational technologists investigate the use of automatic question generators. However, the vast majority of automatic question generation systems consider English input texts only. Therefore, we propose a simple yet effective multilingual automatic question generator based on machine-translation techniques. We investigate the linguistic and pedagogical quality of the generated questions in a human evaluation study.

In this paper, we present a technical framework and implemented system that answers English questions on the basis of information in foreign-language, semi-structured sources such as websites. This work helps users locate, with high precision, relevant segments of foreign-language information, and then makes use of existing machine translation services to present that information in English. The resulting technology extends an approach embodied in the START information access system and its supporting Omnibase uniform data access system, and it has been applied to several Chinese and Arabic websites.

The objective is to identify handwritten characters with the help of neural networks and facilitates the conversion of handwritten documents to editable text from document images. Handwritten contentedness boasts challenges that are seldom encountered in machine-printed text. The translation basis is either mechanical or electronic translation. This is not easy since different people have different handwriting styles. Assigning distinct templates to each and every alphabet and numbers is the approach described. This concept can be a trademark in data entry applications. The suggested method is simple, have promising discrimination accuracy and less time complexity.

AB We describe a method to automatically discover translation collocations from a bilingual corpus and how these improve a machine translation system. The process of inference of collocations is iterative: an alignment is used to derive an initial set of collocations, these are used in turn to improve the alignment and this new alignment is used to generate new collocations. This process is repeated until no more collocations are found. The final alignment and the set of collocations are used to train a translation model. We use a model that is based on finite state transducers and word clusters and has been modified to work with collocations in addition to single words.
   We present experiments in which we show that automatic collocations improve translation quality without prior linguistic information.

AB In this paper, we present a semi-automated workflow for live interlingual speech-to-text communication which seeks to reduce the shortcomings of existing ASR systems: a human respeaker works with a speaker-dependent speech recognition software (e.g., Dragon Naturally Speaking) to deliver punctuated same-language output of superior quality than obtained using out-of-the-box automatic speech recognition of the original speech. This is fed into a machine translation engine (the EU's eTranslation) to produce live-caption ready text. We benchmark the quality of the output against the output of best-in-class (human) simultaneous interpreters working with the same source speeches from plenary sessions of the European Parliament. To evaluate the accuracy and facilitate the comparison between the two types of output, we use a tailored annotation approach based on the NTR model (Romero-Fresco and Pochhacker, 2017). We find that the semi-automated workflow combining intralingual respeaking and machine translation is capable of generating outputs that are similar in terms of accuracy and completeness to the outputs produced in the benchmarking workflow, although the small scale of our experiment requires caution in interpreting this result.

AB This article presents the results of an experiment to assess the quality of post-edited wildlife documentary films to be voiced-over and off-screen dubbed, which was compared to the quality of human translation. The hypothesis of the article is that there are no significant differences between translated and post-edited texts in terms of quality. Twelve MA students translated and post-edited two excerpts of an English wildlife documentary into Spanish. Six professional translators then assessed both the translations and post-edited texts by: (1) grading the documents, (2) correcting them using a Multidimensional Quality Metrics-based error classification that takes into account documentary translation specificities, and (3) answering questionnaires on their impressions. The results confirm the hypothesis by indicating that the quality of post-edited and translated wildlife documentary films is significantly similar.

AB Kernel-target alignment is commonly used to predict the behavior of any given reproducing kernel in a classification context, without training any kernel machine. However, a poor position of the data in feature space can drastically reduce the value of the alignment. This implies that, in a kernel selection setting, the best kernel in a given collection may be associated with a low value of alignment. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for maximizing the alignment by data translation in feature space. The aim is to reduce the biais introduced by the translation non-invariance of this criterion. Experimental results on multi-dimensional benchmarks show the effectiveness of our approach.

TI The interaction effect between source text complexity and machine
   translation quality on the task difficulty of NMT post-editing from
   English to Chinese: A multi-method study
SO ACROSS LANGUAGES AND CULTURES
AB This study explores the interaction effect between source text (ST) complexity and machine translation (MT) quality on the task difficulty of neural machine translation (NMT) post-editing from English to Chinese. When investigating human effort exerted in post-editing, existing studies have seldom taken both ST complexity and MT quality levels into account, and have mainly focused on MT systems used before the emergence of NMT. Drawing on process and product data of post-editing from 60 trainee translators, this study adopted a multi-method approach to measure post-editing task difficulty, including eye-tracking, keystroke logging, quality evaluation, subjective rating, and retrospective written protocols. The results show that: 1) ST complexity and MT quality present a significant interaction effect on task difficulty of NMT post-editing; 2) ST complexity level has a positive impact on post-editing low-quality NMT (i.e., post-editing task becomes less difficult when ST complexity decreases); while for post-editing high-quality NMT, it has a positive impact only on the subjective ratings received from participants; and 3) NMT quality has a negative impact on its post-editing task difficulty (i.e., the post-editing task becomes less difficult when MT quality goes higher), and this impact becomes stronger when ST complexity increases. This paper concludes that both ST complexity and MT quality should be considered when testing post-editing difficulty, designing tasks for post-editor training, and setting fair post-editing pricing schemes.

TI A Simple Yet Robust Algorithm for Automatic Extraction of Parallel
   Sentences: A Case Study on Arabic-English Wikipedia Articles
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Parallel corpora are vital components in several applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly in machine translation. In this paper, we present a novel method for automatically creating parallel sentences from comparable corpora. The method requires a bilingual dictionary as well as an adequate word-vectorisation method. We use Arabic and English Wikipedia as a comparable corpus to apply our proposed method and construct a parallel corpus between Arabic and English. The created Arabic-English corpus consists of 105,010 parallel sentences with a total number of 4.6M words. During our study, we compared two methods of word vectorisation, word embedding and term frequency-inverse document frequency, in terms of their usefulness in computing similarities between well-formed and syntactically ill-formed sentences. We also quantitatively and qualitatively examined the parallel corpus produced by our proposed method and compared it with other available Arabic-English parallel corpora counterparts: GlobalVoices, TED, and Wiki-OPUS. We explored the main advantages and shortcomings of these corpora when used for NLP applications, such as word semantic similarity identification and Neural Machine Translation (NMT). The word semantic similarity models trained on our parallel corpus outperformed models trained on other corpora in the task of English non-similar word identification. Our parallel corpus also proved competitive when building Arabic-English NMT systems, yielding results comparable to those of the automatically created Wiki-OPUS corpus and of the manually created TED corpus, while achieving results superior to the smaller GlobalVoices corpus.

AB We propose a novel method for translation selection in statistical machine translation, in which a convolutional neural network is employed to judge the similarity between a phrase pair in two languages. The specifically designed convolutional architecture encodes not only the semantic similarity of the translation pair, but also the context containing the phrase in the source language. Therefore, our approach is able to capture context-dependent semantic similarities of translation pairs. We adopt a curriculum learning strategy to train the model: we classify the training examples into easy, medium, and difficult categories, and gradually build the ability of representing phrases and sentencelevel contexts by using training examples from easy to difficult. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the baseline system by up to 1.4 BLEU points.

AB Language models play a very important role in many natural language processing applications, in particular large vocabulary speech recognition and statistical machine translation. For a long time, back-off n-gram language models were considered to be the state-of-art when large amounts of training data are available. Recently, so called continuous space methods or neural network language models have shown to systematically outperform these models and they are getting increasingly popular.
   This article describes an open-source toolkit that implements these models in a very efficient way, including support for GPU cards. The modular architecture makes it very easy to work with different data formats and to support various alternative models. Using data selection, resampling techniques and a highly optimized code, training on more than five billions words takes less than 24 hours. The resulting models achieve reductions in the perplexity of almost 20%. This toolkit has been very successfully applied to various languages for large vocabulary speech recognition and statistical machine translation.
   By making available this toolkit we hope that many more researchers will be able to work on this very promising technique, and by these means, quickly advance the field.

AB The health domain is rich in specific vocabulary and information structures. Previous work on this area includes the collection of this information in information systems. However, the language of these can limit their use. To overcome this, we present Health Translations, a web application that uses crowd-sourcing to translate a large vocabulary set that, currently, is only available in English. To increase usage, gamification methods are applied that reward both the quantity of collaboration and the quality of it. When completed, these translations can be made available without costs to the research community. This paper presents the platform as a responsive web application.

AB In this paper, a generalized space translation decision feedback equalizer (DFE) structure having arbitrary design parameters is presented. This new DFE structure extends previous research-on design techniques based on space translation properties, such as the minimum bit error rate DFE (MBER-DFE) and the support vector machine DFE (SVM-DFE). A novel design technique, termed a Hybrid MMSE-SVM-DFE, based on generalized space translation is proposed. It combines the advantages of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) and SVM designs. Simulation results show that the proposed design performs very close to the MBER-DFE in terms of symbol error rate, over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios.

AB In formal language theory finite-state transducers are well-know models for "input-output" rational mappings between two languages. Even if more powerful, recursive models can be used to account for more complex mappings, it has been argued that the input-output relations underlying most usual natural language pairs are essentially rational. Moreover, the relative simplicity of these mappings has recently lead to the development of techniques for learning finite-state transducers from a training set of input-output sentence pairs of the languages considered. Following these arguments, in the last few years a number of machine translation systems have been developed based on stochastic finite-state transducers. Here we review the statistical statement of Machine Translation and how the corresponding modelling, learning and search problems can be solved by using stochastic finite-state transducers. We also review the results achieved by the systems developed under this paradigm. After presenting the traditional approach, where transducer learning is mainly solved under the grammatical inference framework, we propose a new approach where learning is explicitly considered as a statistical estimation problem and the whole stochastic finite-state transducer learning problem is solved by expectation maximisation.

TI End-to-End Speech Translation With Transcoding by Multi-Task Learning
   for Distant Language Pairs
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Directly translating spoken utterances from a source language to a target language is challenging because it requires a fundamental transformation in both linguistic and para/non-linguistic features. Traditional speech-to-speech translation approaches concatenate automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-text machine translation (MT), and text-to-speech synthesizer (TTS) by text information. The current state-of-the-art models for ASR, MT, and TTS have mainly been built using deep neural networks, in particular, an attention-based encoder-decoder neural network with an attention mechanism. Recently, several works have constructed end-to-end direct speech-to-text translation by combining ASR and MT into a single model. However, the usefulness of these models has only been investigated on language pairs of similar syntax and word order (e.g., English-French or English-Spanish). For syntactically distant language pairs (e.g., English-Japanese), speech translation requires distant word reordering. Furthermore, parallel texts with corresponding speech utterances that are suitable for training end-to-end speech translation are generally unavailable. Collecting such corpora is usually time-consuming and expensive. This article proposes the first attempt to build an end-to-end direct speech-to-text translation system on syntactically distant language pairs that suffer from long-distance reordering. We train the model on English (subject-verb-object (SVO) word order) and Japanese (SOV word order) language pairs. To guide the attention-based encoder-decoder model on this difficult problem, we construct end-to-end speech translation with transcoding and utilize curriculum learning (CL) strategies that gradually train the network for end-to-end speech translation tasks by adapting the decoder or encoder parts. We use TTS for data augmentation to generate corresponding speech utterances from the existing parallel text data. Our experiment results show that the proposed approach provides significant improvements compared with conventional cascade models and the direct speech translation approach that uses a single model without transcoding and CL strategies.

AB We propose Semantic Parser Localizer (SPL), a toolkit that leverages Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems to localize a semantic parser for a new language. Our methodology is to (1) generate training data automatically in the target language by augmenting machine-translated datasets with local entities scraped from public websites, (2) add a fewshot boost of human-translated sentences and train a novel XLMR-LSTM semantic parser, and (3) test the model on natural utterances curated using human translators.
   We assess the effectiveness of our approach by extending the current capabilities of Schema2QA, a system for English Question Answering (QA) on the open web, to 10 new languages for the restaurants and hotels domains. Our models achieve an overall test accuracy ranging between 61% and 69% for the hotels domain and between 64% and 78% for restaurants domain, which compares favorably to 69% and 80% obtained for English parser trained on gold English data and a few examples from validation set. We show our approach outperforms the previous state-of-theart methodology by more than 30% for hotels and 40% for restaurants with localized ontologies for the subset of languages tested.
   Our methodology enables any software developer to add a new language capability to a QA system for a new domain, leveraging machine translation, in less than 24 hours. Our code is released open-source.(1)

AB In this paper, two Translation Memory (TM) sharing models adopted in XMCAT, a Computer Assisted Translation tool (CAT) supporting cooperated work in machine translation, was described in detail. One is Center-based TM sharing model, which is only fit for users in a local area network (LAN) and the other is a novel model called P2P-based TM sharing model, which could be used through Internet by geographically distributed users. With the two TM sharing models, a user may share data with other users through network, so that he/she may reduce the repeated work further,and cooperate with others more easily. Besides, the methods used in XMCAT to deal with the problem of multi-translations arose in the cooperated memory sharing models, were also proposed in this paper. XMCAT system has been adopted and approved by some translation companies.

TI Multilingual sequence to sequence convolutional machine translation
SO MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB In this paper, to improve the translation quality of a sentence, Convolutional sequence to sequence architecture has been applied to English-Punjabi, Punjabi-English, Hindi-Punjabi, Punjabi-Hindi language pairs. The Convolution architecture consists of Gated Linear Unit (GLU) and a Multi-Hop attention mechanism. The GLU mechanism controls the information flow through hidden units to produce good translations. The Multi-Hop attention is an enhanced version of the attention mechanism that allows the model to make repeated gaze on the sentence than looking at the sentence only once. As compared to the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), the Convolution based technique provides better accuracy, captures long-range dependencies between the words, capture local context, and allows parallelization over every element in a sequence without depending on the computations of the previous time steps. In this work, we have applied the architecture on four Indian language pairs and compared the performance of our model with conventional models using BLEU, METEOR and WER as evaluation metrics. Our model outperforms recurrent neural networks by 2 BLEU points on English-Punjabi, 2.5 BLEU points on Punjabi-English, 3.5 BLEU points on Hindi-Punjabi translations, and 1.5 BLEU points on Punjabi-Hindi.

AB Sequential recommendation algorithms aim to predict users' future behavior given their historical interactions. A recent line of work has achieved state-of-the-art performance on sequential recommendation tasks by adapting ideas from metric learning and knowledge-graph completion. These algorithms replace inner products with low-dimensional embeddings and distance functions, employing a simple translation dynamic to model user behavior over time.
   In this paper, we propose TransFM, a model that combines translation and metric-based approaches for sequential recommendation with Factorization Machines (FMs). Doing so allows us to reap the benefits of FMs (in particular, the ability to straightforwardly incorporate content-based features), while enhancing the state-of-the-art performance of translation-based models in sequential settings. Specifically, we learn an embedding and translation space for each feature dimension, replacing the inner product with the squared Euclidean distance to measure the interaction strength between features. Like FMs, we show that the model equation for TransFM can be computed in linear time and optimized using classical techniques. As TransFM operates on arbitrary feature vectors, additional content information can be easily incorporated without significant changes to the model itself. Empirically, the performance of TransFM significantly increases when taking content features into account, outperforming state-of-the-art models on sequential recommendation tasks for a wide variety of datasets.

AB Continuous generative models proved their usefulness in high-dimensional data, such as image and audio generation. However, continuous models for text generation have received limited attention from the community. In this work, we study continuous text generation using Transformers for neural machine translation (NMT). We argue that the choice of embeddings is crucial for such models, so we aim to focus on one particular aspect: target representation via embeddings. We explore pretrained embeddings and also introduce knowledge transfer from the discrete Transformer model using embeddings in Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces. Our results on the WMT Romanian-English and English-Turkish benchmarks show such transfer leads to the best-performing continuous model.

AB Adding linguistic information (syntax or semantics) to neural machine translation (NMT) has mostly focused on using point estimates from pre-trained models. Directly using the capacity of massive pre-trained contextual word embedding models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) has been marginally useful in NMT because effective fine-tuning is difficult to obtain for NMT without making training brittle and unreliable. We augment NMT by extracting dense fine-tuned vector-based linguistic information from BERT instead of using point estimates. Experimental results show that our method of incorporating linguistic information helps NMT to generalize better in a variety of training contexts and is no more difficult to train than conventional Transformerbased NMT.

The combination of Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks in these models has proven to outperform the previous state of the art, obtaining more accurate video descriptions. In this work we propose pushing further this model by introducing two contributions into the encoding stage. First, producing richer image representations by combining object and location information from Convolutional Neural Networks and second, introducing Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks for capturing both forward and backward temporal relationships in the input frames.

A SF is a functional relation mapping sentences from one language to another. The core of the system uses the SF approach to translate without going through syntactic and semantic analysis as many MT systems usually do. Our work focuses on business users for whom MT often is a great help if they need an immediate idea of the content of texts like e-mail messages, reports, web pages, or business letters. In this paper, we aim at performing MT between Japanese and Chinese to translate business letters by the SF based technique.

This system is composed of an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system, followed by a statistical translation module and an animated agent that represents the different signs. Two different approaches have been used to perform the translations: a phrase-based system and a finite state transducer. For the evaluation, the followings figures have been considered: WER (Word Error Rate), BLEU and NIST. The paper presents translation results of reference sentences and sentences from the Automatic Speech Recognizer. Also three different configurations have been evaluated for the Speech Recognizer. The best results were obtained with the finite state transducer, with a word error rate of 28.21% for the reference text, and 29.27% using the ASR output.

AB This paper proposes an unsupervised word segmentation algorithm that identifies word boundaries in continuous source language text in order to improve the translation quality of statistical machine translation (SMT) approaches for the translation of local dialects by exploiting linguistic information of the standard language. The method iteratively learns multiple segmentation schemes that are consistent with (1) the standard dialect segmentations and (2) the phrasal segmentations of an SMT system trained on the resegmented bitext of the local dialect. In a second step multiple segmentation schemes are integrated into a single SMT system by characterizing the source language side and merging identical translation pairs of differently segmented SMT models. Experimental results translating three Japanese local dialects (Kumamoto, Kyoto, Osaka) into three Indo-European languages (English, German, Russian) revealed that the proposed system outperforms SMT engines trained on character-based as well as standard dialect segmentation schemes for the majority of the investigated translation tasks anti automatic evaluation metrics.

AB Recent Advances in the processing capabilities of Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) have enabled the implementation of an end-to-end speech translation system on these devices. We have presented a bi-directional speech-to-speech (English and Chinese) translation system, which is hosted on a PDA running embedded Linux. Our Multilingual Automatic Speech-to-Speech Translator (MASTOR) system includes an HMM-based large vocabulary continuous speech recognizer using statistical n-grams, a translation module, and a multi-language speech synthesis system. This paper describes our recent efforts to develop a bi-directional English and colloquial Arabic speech-to-speech system on a device running the popular Windows-CE operating system. We have created completely new translation modules and introduced a fast adaptation scheme for a new speaker or environment. In addition, the componentization of system modules speeds up the development of a new speech-to-speech system.

AB This paper describes NiuTrans's submission to the IWSLT22 English-to-Chinese (En-Zh) offline speech translation task. The end-to-end and bilingual system is built by constrained English and Chinese data and translates the English speech to Chinese text without intermediate transcription. Our speech translation models are composed of different pre-trained acoustic models and machine translation models by two kinds of adapters. We compared the effect of the standard speech feature (e.g. log Mel-filterbank) and the pre-training speech feature and try to make them interact. The final submission is an ensemble of three potential speech translation models. Our single best and ensemble model achieves 18.66 BLEU and 19.35 BLEU separately on MuST-C En-Zh tst-COMMON set.

TI Optimizing segmentation granularity for neural machine translation
SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB In neural machine translation (NMT), it has become standard to translate using subword units to allow for an open vocabulary and improve accuracy on infrequent words. Byte-pair encoding (BPE) and its variants are the predominant approach to generating these subwords, as they are unsupervised, resource-free, and empirically effective. However, the granularity of these subword units is a hyperparameter to be tuned for each language and task, using methods such as grid search. Tuning may be done inexhaustively or skipped entirely due to resource constraints, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically tune this parameter using only one training pass. We incrementally introduce new BPE vocabulary online based on the held-out validation loss, beginning with smaller, general subwords and adding larger, more specific units over the course of training. Our method matches the results found with grid search, optimizing segmentation granularity while significantly reducing overall training time. We also show benefits in training efficiency and performance improvements for rare words due to the way embeddings for larger units are incrementally constructed by combining those from smaller units.

AB Multilingual neural machine translation (NMT) has led to impressive accuracy improvements in low-resource scenarios by sharing common linguistic information across languages. However, the traditional multilingual model fails to capture the diversity and specificity of different languages, resulting in inferior performance compared with individual models that are sufficiently trained. In this paper, we incorporate a language-aware interlingua into the Encoder-Decoder architecture. The interlingual network enables the model to learn a language-independent representation from the semantic spaces of different languages, while still allowing for language-specific specialization of a particular language-pair. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves remarkable improvements over state-of-the-art multilingual NMT baselines and produces comparable performance with strong individual models.

AB Several attempts have been made to learn phrase translation probabilities for phrase-based statistical machine translation that go beyond pure counting of phrases in word-aligned training data. Most approaches report problems with over-fitting. We describe a novel leaving-one- out approach to prevent over-fitting that allows us to train phrase models that show improved translation performance on the WMT08 Europarl German-English task. In contrast to most previous work where phrase models were trained separately from other models used in translation, we include all components such as single word lexica and reordering models in training. Using this consistent training of phrase models we are able to achieve improvements of up to 1.4 points in BLEU. As a side effect, the phrase table size is reduced by more than 80%.

TI Sampling Tree Fragments from Forests
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB We study the problem of sampling trees from forests, in the setting where probabilities for each tree may be a function of arbitrarily large tree fragments. This setting extends recent work for sampling to learn Tree Substitution Grammars to the case where the tree structure (TSG derived tree) is not fixed. We develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm which corrects for the bias introduced by unbalanced forests, and we present experiments using the algorithm to learn Synchronous Context-Free Grammar rules for machine translation. In this application, the forests being sampled represent the set of Hiero-style rules that are consistent with fixed input word-level alignments. We demonstrate equivalent machine translation performance to standard techniques but with much smaller grammars.

AB Neural machine translation (NMT) heavily relies on parallel bilingual data for training. Since large-scale, high-quality parallel corpora are usually costly to collect, it is appealing to exploit monolingual corpora to improve NMT. Inspired by the law of total probability, which connects the probability of a given target-side monolingual sentence to the conditional probability of translating from a source sentence to the target one, we propose to explicitly exploit this connection to learn from and regularize the training of NMT models using monolingual data. The key technical challenge of this approach is that there are exponentially many source sentences for a target monolingual sentence while computing the sum of the conditional probability given each possible source sentence. We address this challenge by leveraging the dual translation model (target-to-source translation) to sample several mostly likely source-side sentences and avoid enumerating all possible candidate source sentences. That is, we transfer the knowledge contained in the dual model to boost the training of the primal model (source-to-target translation), and we call such an approach dual transfer learning. Experiment results on English -> French and German -> English tasks demonstrate that dual transfer learning achieves significant improvement over several strong baselines and obtains new state-of-the-art results.

TI SBSim: A Sentence-BERT Similarity-Based Evaluation Metric for Indian
   Language Neural Machine Translation Systems
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Machine translation (MT) outputs are widely scored using automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluation scores. The automatic evaluation metrics are expected to be easily computable and a reflection of human evaluation. Traditional string-based metrics such as BLEU, ChrF++ scores, are widely used to evaluate MT systems, but fail to account for synonyms that appear in the state-of-the-art neural machine translation (NMT) systems, owing to their inability to evaluate paraphrases. While similarity-based metrics such as Yisi, BERTScore address this issue, these metrics need to be modified to better evaluate morphologically rich Indian languages such as, Tamil and Hindi. The current work proposes a novel and individual sentence-BERT based similarity (SBSim) metric, that makes use of a paraphrase-BERT model and sentence-level embedding to evaluate NMT outputs. The effectiveness of the BLEU, ChrF++, Yisi, BERTScore, and the proposed SBSim are evaluated on English-to-Tamil and English-to-Hindi NMT outputs. The sentence-level metric correlation of the proposed SBSim metric with respect to human scores is observed to outperform the existing metrics with a correlation of 0.9123 and 0.9052 for English-to-Tamil and English-to-Hindi NMT systems, respectively. Further, the average metric correlation of the SBSim metric is also observed to be the highest with a value of 0.9801 and 0.9836 for these NMT systems, respectively. The proposed metric is also evaluated on WMT2020 dataset and reports the highest correlation of 0.7129 with the human scores.

AB An effective method to improve neural machine translation with monolingual data is to augment the parallel training corpus with back-translations of target language sentences. This work broadens the understanding of back-translation and investigates a number of methods to generate synthetic source sentences. We find that in all but resource poor settings back-translations obtained via sampling or noised beam outputs are most effective. Our analysis shows that sampling or noisy synthetic data gives a much stronger training signal than data generated by beam or greedy search. We also compare how synthetic data compares to genuine bitext and study various domain effects. Finally, we scale to hundreds of millions of monolingual sentences and achieve a new state of the art of 35 BLEU on the WMT'14 English-German test set.

AB We present a hierarchical phrase-based statistical machine translation in which a target sentence is efficiently generated in left-to-right order. The model is a class of synchronous-CFG with a Greibach Normal Form-like structure for the projected production rule: The paired target-side of a production rule takes a phrase prefixed form. The decoder for the target-normalized form is based on an Early-style top down parser on the source side. The target-normalized form coupled with our top down parser implies a left-to-right generation of translations which enables us a straightforward integration with ngram language models. Our model was experimented on a Japanese-to-English newswire translation task, and showed statistically significant performance improvements against a phrase-based translation system.

TI Computing with relational machines
SO MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB We propose a relational computing paradigm based on Eilenberg machines, an effective version of Eilenberg's X-machines suitable for general non-deterministic computation. An Eilenberg machine generalizes a finite-state automaton, seen as its control component, with a computation component over a data domain specified as a relational algebra, its actions being interpreted as binary relations over the data domain. We show various strategies for the sequential simulation of our relational machines, using variants of the reactive engine. In a particular case of finite machines, we show that bottom-up search yields an efficient complete simulator.
   Relational machines may be composed in a modular fashion, since atomic actions of one machine can be mapped to the characteristic relation of other relational machines acting as its parameters.
   The control components of machines can be compiled from regular expressions. Several such translations have been proposed in the literature, which we briefly survey.

The GCP Corpus is intended to be develop speech translation systems; thus, it primarily consists of pseudo-dialogues between foreign visitors and local Japanese people. The GCP Corpus is sentence-aligned and covers four domains and ten languages, including many Asian languages. In this paper, we summarize the GCP and the current status of the GCP Corpus. Then, we describe some of the corpus' basic characteristics from the perspective of multilingual machine translation and compare direct, pivot, and zero-shot translation techniques.

We report results for an Italian-English translation task obtained on a small corpus (about 150 K tokens), that can be considered a task with a lack of training data. Different word history length included in the connectionist language model (n-gram order) and distinct continuous space representation (i.e. words appearing in the training corpus more than k times) are considered in the study. The experimental results are evaluated by means of automatic evaluation metrics correlated with fluency and adequacy of the generated translations.

AB Although we have far from solved the issues in porting speech translation systems to new languages, we have gathered sufficient experience by now to identify a number of major challenges in the process. Although well-defined processes exist for building speech recognition, speech synthesis and statistical machine translation models, they still require both significant native speaker involvement and linguistic expertise. As the core technology improves we believe we will see increasing cultural and social issues in contributions from native speakers. This paper identifies some of these issues and presents our initial attempts to build tools that we hope will eventually allow linguistically naive native informants build complete speech translation systems.

AB Many researchers have worked on example-based machine translation and different techniques have been investigated in the area. In literature, a method of using translation templates learned from bilingual example pairs was proposed. The paper investigates the possibility of applying the same idea for close languages where word order is preserved. In addition to applying the original algorithm for example pairs, we believe that the similarities between the translated sentences may always be learned as atomic translations. Since the word order is almost always preserved, there is no need to have any previous knowledge to identify the corresponding differences. The paper concludes that applying this method for close languages may improve the performance of the system.

AB Automatic abstractive summarization is one of natural language processing fields that generates a sequence of words representing important information of the input document. The sequence-to-sequence model, which is widely used in abstractive summarization, has a repetition problem in which the same sub-pattern is repeatedly generated in decode phases. To solve this problem, various coverage models have been proposed in machine translation. In automatic summarization, unlike machine translation, the lengths of input and summary documents are very different. Because the summary document is a compressed form of important meaning of the input document. Due to the nature of automatic summarization, it is difficult to apply a word position-based coverage model in machine translation directly. For automatic summarization, we propose a context based coverage model to consider the coverage based on the compressed meaning of the input document. The context based coverage is defined as the accumulated weighted average of the encoded word meaning by the attention scores. This considers the meaning of words rather than the position of words in the input document. In the experiment with CNN/DailyMail dataset, the proposed model shows better performance than the previous researches.

TI A Binary Complete and Aperiodic Turing Machine
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF UNCONVENTIONAL COMPUTING
AB Turing machines have been studied as dynamical systems for more than two decades, first formalized by Mirka, proposing a topological dynamical system named Turing machine with moving tape (TMT). It was conjectured that every TMT has at least one periodic point. Nowadays, there are several examples of aperiodic Turing machines, disproving Mirka's conjecture. Moreover, one of these machines, named SMART, has other interesting properties like reversibility, completeness, topological minimality, among others. This machine has four states and works over an alphabet of three symbols. In this research, we study the dynamical properties of BinSmart, a 2-symbols reconstruction of the main dynamic of SMART machine. This machine results to be aperiodic, topologically minimal (therefore transitive) but not time-symmetric, as it is not a direct translation of the original machine. We also prove that its t-shift is a primitive substitution.

TI An Empirical Study on Learning Bug-Fixing Patches in the Wild via Neural
   Machine Translation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY
AB Millions of open source projects with numerous bug fixes are available in code repositories. This proliferation of software development histories can be leveraged to learn how to fix common programming bugs. To explore such a potential, we perform an empirical study to assess the feasibility of using Neural Machine Translation techniques for learning bug-fixing patches for real defects. First, we mine millions of bug-fixes from the change histories of projects hosted on GitHub in order to extract meaningful examples of such bug-fixes. Next, we abstract the buggy and corresponding fixed code, and use them to train an Encoder-Decoder model able to translate buggy code into its fixed version. In our empirical investigation, we found that such a model is able to fix thousands of unique buggy methods in the wild. Overall, this model is capable of predicting fixed patches generated by developers in 9-50% of the cases, depending on the number of candidate patches we allow it to generate. Also, the model is able to emulate a variety of different Abstract Syntax Tree operations and generate candidate patches in a split second.

AB Writing exploits for security assessment is a challenging task. The writer needs to master programming and obfuscation techniques to develop a successful exploit. To make the task easier, we propose an approach (EVIL) to automatically generate exploits in assembly/Python language from descriptions in natural language. The approach leverages Neural Machine Translation (NMT) techniques and a dataset that we developed for this work. We present an extensive experimental study to evaluate the feasibility of EVIL, using both automatic and manual analysis, and both at generating individual statements and entire exploits. The generated code achieved high accuracy in terms of syntactic and semantic correctness.

AB With great practical value, the study of Multidomain Neural Machine Translation (NMT) mainly focuses on using mixed-domain parallel sentences to construct a unified model that allows translation to switch between different domains. Intuitively, words in a sentence are related to its domain to varying degrees, so that they will exert disparate impacts on the multi-domain NMT modeling. Based on this intuition, in this paper, we devote to distinguishing and exploiting word-level domain contexts for multi-domain NMT. To this end, we jointly model NMT with monolingual attention-based domain classification tasks and improve NMT as follows: 1) Based on the sentence representations produced by a domain classifier and an adversarial domain classifier, we generate two gating vectors and use them to construct domain-specific and domain-shared annotations, for later translation predictions via different attention models; 2) We utilize the attention weights derived from target-side domain classifier to adjust the weights of target words in the training objective, enabling domain-related words to have greater impacts during model training. Experimental results on ChineseEnglish and English-French multi-domain translation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

TI Three-dimensional structure-guided evolution of a ribosome with tethered
   subunits
SO NATURE CHEMICAL BIOLOGY
AB RNA-based macromolecular machines, such as the ribosome, have functional parts reliant on structural interactions spanning sequence-distant regions. These features limit evolutionary exploration of mutant libraries and confound three-dimensional structure-guided design. To address these challenges, we describe Evolink (evolution and linkage), a method that enables high-throughput evolution of sequence-distant regions in large macromolecular machines, and library design guided by computational RNA modeling to enable exploration of structurally stable designs. Using Evolink, we evolved a tethered ribosome with a 58% increased activity in orthogonal protein translation and a 97% improvement in doubling times in SQ171 cells compared to a previously developed tethered ribosome, and reveal new permissible sequences in a pair of ribosomal helices with previously explored biological function. The Evolink approach may enable enhanced engineering of macromolecular machines for new and improved functions for synthetic biology.

TI The Ties That Bind: Text Similarities and Conditional Diffusion among
   Parties
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
AB Comparative analyses of party policy diffusion are only just emerging. To better understand the conditions under which diffusion occurs, this article argues that three heuristics - availability, representativeness and anchoring - shape parties' efforts to gather information (from elsewhere), leading to differing diffusion effects. The study operationalizes the outcome as textual similarity of party manifestos in nineteen Western democracies from 1960 to 2016, applying a text-as-data approach and machine translation. Analyzing dyads, it assesses how commonalities and sender/receiver attributes impact diffusion. It finds that there is little room for cross-border diffusion as successful parties stick to their old program. Beyond the still-prevailing domestic context, 'learning from cultural reference groups' in a region is most important. In addition, diffusion appears within EP factions and transnational party organizations independently of the success/loss of the sender. The analysis thus sheds light on (un-)favorable conditions for party policy diffusion and paves the way for future studies applying machine translation and quantitative text analyses.

TI Arabic Handwritten Word Recognition Based on Stationary Wavelet
   Transform Technique using Machine Learning
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB This paper is aimed at improving the performance of the word recognition system (WRS) of handwritten Arabic text by extracting features in the frequency domain using the Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) method using machine learning, which is a wavelet transform approach created to compensate for the absence of translation invariance in the Discrete Wavelets Transform (DWT) method. The proposed SWT-WRS of Arabic handwritten text consists of three main processes: word normalization, feature extraction based on SWT, and recognition. The proposed SWT-WRS based on the SWT method is evaluated on the IFN/ENIT database applying the Gaussian, linear, and polynomial support vector machine, the k-nearest neighbors, and ANN classifiers. ANN performance was assessed by applying the Bayesian Regularization (BR) and Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) training methods. Numerous wavelet transform (WT) families are applied, and the results prove that level 19 of the Daubechies family is the best WT family for the proposed SWT-WRS. The results also confirm the effectiveness of the proposed SWT-WRS in improving the performance of handwritten Arabic word recognition using machine learning. Therefore, the suggested SWT-WRS overcomes the lack of translation invariance in the DWT method by eliminating the up-and-down samplers from the proposed machine learning method.

AB This paper examines the history and development of Machine Translation (MT) applications for the Arabic language in the context of the history and machine translation in general. It starts with a discussion of the beginnings of MT in the US and then, depending on the work of MT historians, surveys the decline of the work on MT and drying up of funding; then the revival with globalization, development of information technology and the rising needs for breaking the language barriers in the world; and last on the dramatic developments that came with the advances in computer technology. The paper also examined some of the major approaches for MT within a historical perspective. The case of Arabic is treated along the same lines focusing on the work that was done on Arabic by Western research institutes and Western profit motivated companies. Special attention is given to the work of the one Arab company, Sakr of Al-Alamiyya Group, which was established in 1982 and has seriously since then worked on developing software applications for Arabic under the umbrella of natural language processing for the Arabic language. Major available software applications for Arabic/English Arabic MT as well as MT related software were surveyed within a historical framework.

AB Sentence splitting is a major simplification operator. Here we present a simple and efficient splitting algorithm based on an automatic semantic parser. After splitting, the text is amenable for further fine-tuned simplification operations. In particular, we show that neural Machine Translation can be effectively used in this situation. Previous application of Machine Translation for simplification suffers from a considerable disadvantage in that they are over-conservative, often failing to modify the source in any way. Splitting based on semantic parsing, as proposed here, alleviates this issue. Extensive automatic and human evaluation shows that the proposed method compares favorably to the state-of-the-art in combined lexical and structural simplification.

AB Given a rough, word-by-word gloss of a source language sentence, target language natives can uncover the latent, fully-fluent rendering of the translation. In this work we explore this intuition by breaking translation into a two step process: generating a rough gloss by means of a dictionary and then 'translating' the resulting pseudo-translation, or 'Translationese' into a fully fluent translation. We build our Translationese decoder once from a mish-mash of parallel data that has the target language in common and then can build dictionaries on demand using unsupervised techniques, resulting in rapidly generated unsupervised neural MT systems for many source languages. We apply this process to 14 test languages, obtaining better or comparable translation results on high-resource languages than previously published unsupervised MT studies, and obtaining good quality results for low-resource languages that have never been used in an unsupervised MT scenario.

TI Grounded Sequence to Sequence Transduction
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB Speech recognition and machine translation have made major progress over the past decades, providing practical systems to map one language sequence to another. Although multiple modalities such as sound and video are becoming increasingly available, the state-of-the-art systems are inherently unimodal, in the sense that they take a single modality - either speech or text - as input. Evidence from human learning suggests that additional modalities can provide disambiguating signals crucial for many language tasks. In this article, we describe the How2 dataset , a large, open-domain collection of videos with transcriptions and their translations. We then show how this single dataset can be used to develop systems for a variety of language tasks and present a number of models meant as starting points. Across tasks, we find that building multimodal architectures that perform better than their unimodal counterpart remains a challenge. This leaves plenty of room for the exploration of more advanced solutions that fully exploit the multimodal nature of the How2 dataset , and the general direction of multimodal learning with other datasets as well.

AB Tree adjoining Grammar (TAG) is a rich formalism for capturing syntax and some limited semantics of Natural languages. The XTAG project has contributed a very comprehensive TAG for English Language. Although TAGs have been proposed nearly 40 years ago by Joshi et al, 1975, their usage and application in the Indian Languages have been very rare, predominantly due to their complexity and lack of resources. In this paper we discuss a new TAG system and methodology of development for Tamil Language that can be extended for other Indian languages. The trees are developed synchronously with a minimalistic grammar obtained by careful pruning of XTAG English Grammar. We also apply Chomskian minimalism on these TAG trees, so as to make them simple and easily parsable. Furthermore we have also developed a parser that can parse simple sentences using the above mentioned grammar, and generating a TAG derivation that can be used for dependency resolution. Due to the synchronous nature of these TAG pairs they can be readily adapted for Formalism based Machine Translation (MT) from English to Tamil and vice versa.

An influential account of French, current since the seventeenth century, claims that it is a "transparent" translating machine, superior to other languages in its ability to render all meanings in a noiseless transaction. This essay examines the responses of three postmodern/postcolonial writers in French, Edouard Glissant, Abdelkebir Khatibi and Jacques Derrida. All three critique the neoclassical account of French not by denying the centrality of translation to French, but by offering a new understanding of translation as an inherent component of language. For each, translation is key to a utopic, emancipatory project. Ultimately, their revisionary approach to the French language enables us to return to the texts of the past and read them anew in an ongoing dialogue.

AB Binary translation (BT) has been an important approach to migrate application software across instruction set architectures (ISAs). Some architectures, such as X86, allow misaligned data accesses (MDAs), while most modern architectures have the alignment restriction that requires data to be aligned in memory on natural boundaries. In a binary translation system, where the source ISA allows MDA and the target ISA does not, memory operations must be carefully translated to satisfy the alignment restriction. Naive translation will cause frequent misaligned data access traps to occur at runtime on the target machine, and severely slow down the migrated application.
   This paper evaluates different approaches in handling MDA in binary translation systems. It also proposes a new mechanism to deal with MDAs. Measurements based on SPEC CPU2000 and CPU2006 benchmark show that the proposed approach can significantly outperform existing methods.

AB Transitional expressions provide glue that holds ideas together in a text and enhance the logical organization, which together help improve readability of a text. However, in most current statistical machine translation (SMT) systems, the outputs of compound-complex sentences still lack proper transitional expressions. As a result, the translations are often hard to read and understand. To address this issue, we propose two novel models to encourage generating such transitional expressions by introducing the source compound-complex sentence structure (CSS). Our models include a CSS-based translation model, which generates new CSS-based translation rules, and a generative transfer model, which encourages producing transitional expressions during decoding. The two models are integrated into a hierarchical phrase-based translation system to evaluate their effectiveness. The experimental results show that significant improvements are achieved on various test data meanwhile the translations are more cohesive and smooth.

AB This paper proposes an approach to cross-language sentence selection in a low-resource setting. It uses data augmentation and negative sampling techniques on noisy parallel sentence data to directly learn a cross-lingual embedding-based query relevance model. Results show that this approach performs as well as or better than multiple state-of-the-art machine translation + monolingual retrieval systems trained on the same parallel data. Moreover, when a rationale training secondary objective is applied to encourage the model to match word alignment hints from a phrase-based statistical machine translation model, consistent improvements are seen across three language pairs (English-Somali, English-Swahili and English-Tagalog) over a variety of state-of-the-art baselines.

AB This paper presents a language independent and simple methodology to mine bilingual parallel corpus from the web. In particular, we extract parallel corpus for the Hindi-English (Hi-En) language pair from web pages which are previously unexplored. Candidate websites containing Hindi and English pages are identified by using a list of Hindi stop words to the system. A small set of manually generated patterns and a state of the art sentence aligner is then used to extract Hindi-English parallel corpus from these candidate websites. The quality of the mined parallel corpus is also demonstrated empirically in Hindi-English machine translation task.

TI An alternative to synchronous tree substitution grammars
SO NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING
AB Synchronous tree substitution grammars (STSG) are a (formal) tree transformation model that is used in the area of syntax-based machine translation. A competitor that is at least as expressive as STSG is proposed and compared to STSG. The competitor is the extended multi bottom-up tree transducer (MBOT), which is the bottom-up analogue with the additional feature that states have non-unary ranks. Unweighted MBOT have already been investigated with respect to their basic properties, but the particular properties of the constructions that are required in the machine translation task are largely unknown. STSG and MBOT are compared with respect to binarization, regular restriction, and application. Particular attention is paid to the complexity of the constructions.

AB In recent years, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has achieved great success, but we can not ignore two important problems. One is the exposure bias caused by the different strategies between training and inference, and the other is that the NMT model generates the best candidate word for the current step yet a bad element of the whole sentence. The popular methods to solve these two problems are Schedule Sampling and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) respectively, and both achieved some success. In this paper, we proposed a more precise approach called "similarity selection" combining a new GAN structure called twin-GAN to solve the above two problems. There are two generators and two discriminators in the twin-GAN. One generator uses the "similarity selection" and the other one uses the same way as inference (simulate the inference process). One discriminator guides generators at the sentence level, and the other discriminator forces these two generators to have similar distributions. Moreover, we performed a lot of experiments on the IWSLT 2014 German -> English (De -> En) and the WMT'17 Chinese -> English (Zh -> En) and the result shows that we improved the performance compared to some other strong baseline models which based on recurrent architecture.

AB Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) is an important component in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, and plays an important role in diverse areas such as information retrieval, machine translation, information extraction and plagiarism detection. In this paper we propose two word embedding-based approaches devoted to measuring the semantic similarity between Arabic-English crosslanguage sentences. The main idea is to exploit Machine Translation (MT) and an improved word embedding representations in order to capture the syntactic and semantic properties of words. MT is used to translate English sentences into Arabic language in order to apply a classical monolingual comparison. Afterwards, two word embeddingbased methods are developed to rate the semantic similarity. Additionally, Words Alignment (WA), Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) and Part-of-Speech (POS) weighting are applied on the examined sentences to support the identification of words that are most descriptive in each sentence. The performances of our approaches are evaluated on a crosslanguage dataset containing more than 2400 Arabic-English pairs of sentence. Moreover, the proposed methods are confirmed through the Pearson correlation between our similarity scores and human ratings.

AB The filtering and/or selection of training data is one of the core aspects to be considered when building a strong machine translation system. In their influential work, Khayrallah and Koehn (2018) investigated the impact of different types of noise on the performance of machine translation systems. In the same year the WMT introduced a shared task on parallel corpus filtering, which went on to be repeated in the following years, and resulted in many different filtering approaches being proposed. In this work we aim to combine the recent achievements in data filtering with the original analysis of Khayrallah and Koehn (2018) and investigate whether state-of-the-art filtering systems are capable of removing all the suggested noise types. We observe that most of these types of noise can be detected with an accuracy of over 90% by modern filtering systems when operating in a well studied high resource setting. However, we also find that when confronted with more refined noise categories or when working with a less common language pair, the performance of the filtering systems is far from optimal, showing that there is still room for improvement in this area of research.

AB This paper aims to solve a series of referential problems in sequence decoding, which caused by corpus sparsity in low-resource Neural Machine Translation (NMT), including pronoun missing, reference error, gender bias. It is difficult to find the essential reason of these problems because they are only shown in the prediction results and all aspects of the model training. Different from the usual solutions based on complex mathematical rule setting and adding artificial features, we expect to turn the problems in the predictions into noise as much as possible. On this basis, we further use adversarial training to make the model find the balance between the noise and the golden samples, instead of exploring the reason of the problem during the complex training. In this paper, a noise-based preprocessing operation and a slight modification of the adversarial training can help the model to better generalize a series of referential problems in low-resource NMT tasks. Experiments show that the evaluation of BLEU score and the accuracy of pronouns in sequence on Korean-Chinese, Mongolian-Chinese and Arabic-Chinese task have been significantly improved.

TI Neural text normalization with adapted decoding and POS features
SO NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING
AB Text normalization is the task of mapping noncanonical language, typical of speech transcription and computer-mediated communication, to a standardized writing. This task is especially important for languages such as Swiss German, with strong regional variation and no written standard. In this paper, we propose a novel solution for normalizing Swiss German WhatsApp messages using the encoder-decoder neural machine translation (NMT) framework. We enhance the performance of a plain character-level NMT model with the integration of a word-level language model and linguistic features in the form of part-of-speech (POS) tags. The two components are intended to improve the performance by addressing two specific issues: the former is intended to improve the fluency of the predicted sequences, whereas the latter aims at resolving cases of word-level ambiguity. Our systematic comparison shows that our proposed solution results in an improvement over a plain NMT system and also over a comparable character-level statistical machine translation system, considered the state of the art in this task till recently. We perform a thorough analysis of the compared systems' output, showing that our two components produce indeed the intended, complementary improvements.

AB End-to-end multilingual speech translation (ST) directly models the mapping from the speech in source languages to the text of multiple target languages. While multilingual neural machine translation has been proved effective in modeling the general knowledge with shared parameters and handling inter-task interference with language-specific parameters, it still lacks exploration of when and where parameter sharing matters in multilingual ST. This work offers such a study by proposing a comprehensive analysis on the influence of various heuristically designed sharing strategies. We further investigate the inter-task interference through gradient similarity between different tasks, and improve the parameter sharing strategy in multilingual ST under the guidance of inter-task gradient similarity. Experimental results on the one-to-many MuST-C dataset have shown that the gradient-guided sharing method can significantly improve the translation quality with a comparable or even lower cost in terms of parameter scale.

AB Error propagation from automatic speech recognition (ASR) to machine translation (MT) is a critical issue for the (still) dominant cascade approach to speech translation. To robustify MT to ill-formed inputs, we propose a technique to artificially corrupt clean transcripts so as to emulate noisy automatic transcripts. Our Lexical Noise model relies on estimating from ASR data: i) the probability distribution of the possible edit operations applicable to each word, and ii) the probability distribution of possible lexical substitutes for that word. Corrupted data generated from these probabilities are paired with their original clean counterpart for MT adaptation via fine-tuning. Contrastive experiments on three language pairs led to three main findings. First, on noisy transcripts, the adapted models outperform MT systems fine-tuned on synthetic data corrupted with previous noising techniques, approaching the upper bound performance obtained by fine-tuning on real ASR data. Second, the increased robustness does not come at the cost of performance drops on clean test data. Third, and crucial from the application standpoint, our approach is domain/ASR-independent: noising patterns learned from a given ASR system in a certain domain can be successfully applied to robustify MT to errors made by other ASR systems in a different domain.

TI A Snapshot of Children's Attitudes toward Machine Translation
SO INFORMATION
AB Technologies offered and used on the Internet play a significant part in the lives of children; nevertheless, little research has been done on how children view and use machine translation (MT). According to recent literature, there are various benefits to using MT in teaching/learning foreign languages, such as more fluent writing, more effective communication, and fewer errors. Nevertheless, the use of MT in classroom settings is often viewed as problematic by language teachers. Despite the fact that a vast number of students have used MT for various purposes or have tried experimenting with MT for certain academic or entertainment purposes, they seem to have mixed feelings about it. The present qualitative study is based on semi-structured interviews and aims to capture a snapshot of Lithuanian children's perceptions and awareness of MT technologies. The results of the interviews reveal that children mostly find out about MT as a result of their own efforts and employ MT tools for a variety of purposes; however, at school no systematic guidance and/or support in terms of MT use is provided and children tend to perceive that their teachers generally hold negative attitudes towards MT.

However, existing WSD systems rarely consider multilingual information, and no effective method has been proposed for improving WSD by generating translations. In this paper, we present a novel approach that improves the performance of a base WSD system using machine translation. Since our approach is language independent, we perform WSD experiments on several languages. The results demonstrate that our methods can consistently improve the performance of WSD systems, and obtain state-of-the-art results in both English and multilingual WSD. To facilitate the use of lexical translation information, we also propose BABALIGN, an precise bitext alignment algorithm which is guided by multilingual lexical correspondences from BabelNet.

AB Parallel programs for distributed memory machines are not easy to create and maintain, especially when they involve sparse matrix computations. In this paper, we propose a program translation system for generating parallel sparse matrix computation codes utilizing PSBLAS. The purpose of the development of the system is to offer the user a convenient way to construct parallel sparse code based on PSBLAS. The system is build up on the idea of bridging the gap between the easy-to-read program representations and highly-tuned parallel executables based on existing parallel sparse matrix computation libraries. The system accepts a MATLAB program with annotations and generates subroutines for an SPMD-style parallel program which runs on distributed-memory machines. Experimental results on parallel machines show that the prototype of our system can generate fairly efficient PSBLAS codes for simple applications such as CG and Bi-CGSTAB programs.

TI Crowdsourcing Used in Higher Education: An Empirical Study on a
   Sustainable Translation Teaching Mode Based on Crowdsourced Translation
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The language service industry needs more qualified translators. The training of qualified translators needs innovation of translation teaching mode. The combination of crowdsourcing and translation teaching can realize the innovation of translation teaching mode. This study developed an empirical study in which such quantitative and qualitative methods are conducted as classroom observation, case analysis, translation quality analysis, questionnaire survey, and email interviews. Participants in the study included university students registered in the English and Translation degrees in Chinese universities. Statistical analyses were carried out with IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (IBM SPSS 26). Validation of the survey instruments, descriptive statistics, and group comparisons were all accomplished. The results demonstrate that the integration of crowdsourcing with translation teaching worked well. The mode has positive significance for exploring learner autonomy, stimulating students' motivation, improving students' translation ability, and training qualified translators. The mode is of sustainable value, with the development of AI-driven machine translation technology, and the innovation of translation teaching mode is significant for professional translator training. This mode of translation teaching based on crowdsourcing has a certain reference value for the cultivation of high-quality language service talents and the construction of a new mode of personnel training in the language service industry.

TI Workload Time Series Cumulative Prediction Mechanism for Cloud Resources
   Using Neural Machine Translation Technique
SO JOURNAL OF GRID COMPUTING
AB Dynamic resource allocation and auto-scaling represent effective solutions for many cloud challenges, such as over-provisioning (i.e., energy-wasting, and Service level Agreement "SLA" violation) and under-provisioning (i.e., Quality of Service "QoS" dropping) of resources. Early workload prediction techniques play an important role in the success of these solutions. Unfortunately, no prediction technique is perfect and suitable enough for most workloads, particularly in cloud environments. Statistical and machine learning techniques may not be appropriate for predicting workloads, due to instability and dependency of cloud resources' workloads. Although Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) deep learning technique considers these shortcomings, it provides poor results for long-term prediction. On the other hand, Sequence-to-Sequence neural machine translation technique (Seq2Seq) is effectively used for translating long texts. In this paper, workload sequence prediction is treated as a translation problem. Therefore, an Attention Seq2Seq-based technique is proposed for predicting cloud resources' workloads. To validate the proposed technique, real-world dataset collected from a Google cluster of 11 k machines is used. For improving the performance of the proposed technique, a novel procedure called cumulative-validation is proposed as an alternative procedure to cross-validation. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique for predicting workloads of cloud resources in terms of accuracy by 98.1% compared to 91% and 85% for other sequence-based techniques, i.e. Continuous Time Markov Chain based models and Long short-term memory based models, respectively. Also, the proposed cumulative-validation procedure achieves a computational time superiority of 57% less compared to the cross-validation with a slight variation of 0.006 in prediction accuracy.

AB In this paper, we introduce our participation in the WMT 2019 Metric Shared Task. We propose a method to filter pseudo-references by paraphrasing for automatic evaluation of machine translation (MT). We use the outputs of off-the-shelf MT systems as pseudo-references filtered by paraphrasing in addition to a single human reference (gold reference). We use BERT fine-tuned with paraphrase corpus to filter pseudo-references by checking the paraphrasability with the gold reference. Our experimental results of the WMT 2016 and 2017 datasets show that our method achieved higher correlation with human evaluation than the sentence BLEU (Sent-BLEU) baselines with a single reference and with unfiltered pseudo-references.

AB Mis-translation or dropping of proper nouns reduces the quality of machine translation output or speech recognition output as input of a dialog system. In this paper, we propose an automatic method of building a location dependent dictionary for speech recognition and speech translation systems. The method consists of two parts: location dependent word extraction and word classification. The first part extracts the word by using micro blog data based on Akaike's information criteria. The second part classifies the words by using the Convolutional Neural Net(CNN) trained on crawled data. According to the experimental results, the method extracted around 2,000 location dependent words in the Tokyo area with 75% accuracy.

TI From bilingual to multilingual neural-based machine translation by
   incremental training
SO JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A common intermediate language representation in neural machine translation can be used to extend bilingual systems by incremental training. We propose a new architecture based on introducing an interlingual loss as an additional training objective. By adding and forcing this interlingual loss, we can train multiple encoders and decoders for each language, sharing among them a common intermediate representation. Translation results on the low-resource tasks (Turkish-English and Kazakh-English tasks) show a BLEU improvement of up to 2.8 points. However, results on a larger dataset (Russian-English and Kazakh-English) show BLEU losses of a similar amount. While our system provides improvements only for the low-resource tasks in terms of translation quality, our system is capable of quickly deploying new language pairs without the need to retrain the rest of the system, which may be a game changer in some situations. Specifically, what is most relevant regarding our architecture is that it is capable of: reducing the number of production systems, with respect to the number of languages, from quadratic to linear; incrementally adding a new language to the system without retraining the languages already there; and allowing for translations from the new language to all the others present in the system.

TI Impact of technology on Translation and Translation Studies
SO VESTNIK ROSSIISKOGO UNIVERSITETA DRUZHBY NARODOV-SERIYA
   LINGVISTIKA-RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS
AB The landscape in translation and interpreting is changing deeply and rapidly. For a long time, but not necessarily everywhere, translation was denied as a need (except for the political and religious powers), as effort (translation being defined as a kind of mechanical work, as substitution of words), and as a profession (translators embodying a subaltern position). Technology is bringing in certain changes in attitudes and perceptions with regards international, multilingual and multimodal communications. This article tries to define the changes and their consequences in the labelling and characterisation of the different practices. It is organised in five sections: first, we recall that translation and interpreting are only one option in international relations; then, we explain the different denials of translation in the past (or the refusal to recognize the different values of translation). In the third section, we consider how and to what extent technology is transforming today practices and markets. The ongoing changes do not boil solely to developments in Machine Translation (which started in the 1960s): community, crowdsourced/collaborative translation and volunteer translation encompass different practices. In many cases, users provide their own translations, with or without formal qualifications in translation. The evolution is not only technical but also economic and social. In addition, the fragmentation and the diversity of practices do have an impact on a multi-faceted market. In the fourth section, we emphasize that there are nowadays different concepts of translation and competitive paradigms in Translation Studies. Finally, we tackle the organisational challenge of the field, since the institutionalisation of translation and Translation Studies cannot remain the same as when there was a formal consensus on the concept of translation.

AB With predictions that in the near future tens of billions of devices will be added to the Internet of Things (IoT), new challenges arise, including the development and deployment of software for a wide variety of devices, architectures, instruction set architectures, and computational resources. Despite the fact that emulation techniques have been successful in the creation of virtual layers to ease software deployment in heterogeneous settings, the power consumption and memory code footprint restrictions of the IoT lead to new issues which still need to be further explored within the scope of software emulation. Therefore, we investigate how a distributed implementation of dynamic translation can be used to increase emulation performance in this context. To evidence this, we present a novel distributed dynamic translator simulator that can simulate environments with several devices running RISCV applications and offloading code compilation through the network. Using this simulator, we tested a scenario with 400 constrained IoT devices running lean virtual machines that are capable of offloading dynamic translation to four fog devices, which in turn have the option of distributing their workload to other fog devices or the cloud. The results show that we can improve the performance of constrained devices by 10 times with the use of fog-assisted translation, while at the same time guaranteeing no extra overhead in the emulation process of the fog devices themselves. These findings suggest that, in general, distributed dynamic translation can leverage fog computing to improve emulation in the IoT, even when it comes to devices with limited resources.

TI The Translation of Working-Class Speech and Culture in Japanese
   Translations of Robert Westall's Novels Set in North-East England
SO CHILDRENS LITERATURE IN EDUCATION
AB Robert Westall (1929-1993) was one of the most successful British children's writers in the latter half of the twentieth century. However, his novels often provoked controversy in Britain because of his inclusion of working-class language and culture in children's books. This paper examines how such "controversial" working-class dialogues are translated in Japan, where his novels are particularly popular. This paper explores Japanese translations of Westall's novels published between 1980 and 2009, with a particular focus on three novels set in north-east England in the 1940s: The Machine-Gunners (1975; Japanese translation, 1980), Fathom Five (1979; Japanese translation, 2009), and The Kingdom by the Sea (1990; Japanese translation, 1994). Examination of these translations, which were produced during different economic periods in Japan, will contribute to understanding the cultural and political roles of translators and of children's literature, as it reveals the hegemonic process of how working-class culture is reduced and how gender stereotypes, as well as normative middle-class culture, are reinforced through translation.

AB Within the context of the global digital revolution, translation in professional settings cannot be understood without the Internet, as a communicative, documentary, and productivity tool (Cronin 2013; Jimenez-Crespo 2013). Similarly, translation training has been revolutionized by the wide range of possibilities afforded by the Internet. This paper reviews the impact of the Internet on translation e research within the framework of translation competence models (PACTE 2005; Gopferich 2009), as well as socio-constructivist approaches to translation education (Kiraly 2012; 2000). Its impact has been felt in two areas: (1) how translation is taught and (2) how the world of translation has been changed by the Internet. Related to the first area is the rapid increase in the number of online and hybrid programs offered and in the use of online teaching platforms in classroom-based contexts. Related to the second area, a wide range of new opportunities has arisen, such as: (1) those related to the Internet as a communicative platform, (2) those related to the use of the Internet during translation tasks, both in terms of cloud-based translation memory and human-aided machine translation, as well as the use of the Internet for 'external support' (Alves and Liparini 2009) to solve translation problems, and (3) the emergence of new translation modalities such as web localization, new textual genres, such as social networking sites or tweets, as well as new translation practices, such as online crowdsourcing and volunteer translation communities.

TI Design of Intelligent Speech Translation System Based on Deep Learning
SO MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB In order to solve the problem of low translation accuracy caused by complex sentence parameters in traditional machine translation systems, a method based on deep learning was proposed. First, MCU SPCE061A is used to study the problem of complex digital signal. Thetraining data in the synchronous translation server support the translation services of a large number of users, and the translation results were displayed through the session interface of the user terminal. The PMDL model is used to detect the keyword signal, record the PCM audio data, and slice the collected pulse code modulation signal, so as to wake up the artiOcial intelligence voice service. Theen, this study establishes a speech recognition process that accurately outputs the speech-related semantics. In this paper, a manual interactive synchronous translation program is designed with the input text as the search criterion, and the set is trimmed to obtain the best translation effect. Thee experimental results show that the sentence translation accuracy of the system is 0.9 similar to 1.0. It is proved that the method based on deep learning solves the problem of low accuracy of the traditional translation system.

AB We propose a method to recover missing phrases dropped in the phrase extraction algorithm. Those phrases, therefore, are not translated even though we tested the system with the training data. On the other hand, in native-to-foreign, or backward training, some missing phrases can be recovered. In this paper, we combined two phrase translation tables extracted by the source-to-target and target-to-source training for the sake of more complete phrase translation table. We re-estimated the lexical weights and phrase translation probabilities for each phrase pair. Additional combining weights were applied to both tables. We assessed our method on different combining weights by counting the missing phrases and calculating the BLEU scores and NIST scores. Approximately 7% of missing phrases are recovered and 1.3% of BLEU score is increased.

AB Humour remains one of the most difficult aspects of intercultural communication: understanding humour often requires understanding implicit cultural references and/or double meanings, and this raises the question of its (un)translatability. Wordplay is a common source of humour in due to its attention-getting and subversive character. The translation of humour and wordplay is therefore in high demand. Modern translation depends heavily on technological aids, yet few works have treated the automation of humour and wordplay translation, or the creation of humour corpora. The goal of the JOKER workshop is to bring together translators and computer scientists to work on an evaluation framework for wordplay, including data and metric development, and to foster work on automatic methods for wordplay translation. We propose three pilot tasks: (1) classify and explain instances of wordplay, (2) translate single words containing wordplay, and (3) translate entire phrases containing wordplay.

AB Previous methods on improving translation quality by employing multiple SMT models usually carry out as a second-pass decision procedure on hypotheses from multiple systems using extra features instead of using features in existing models in more depth. In this paper, we propose translation model generalization (TMG), an approach that updates probability feature values for the translation model being used based on the model itself and a set of auxiliary models, aiming to alleviate the over-estimation problem and enhance translation quality in the first-pass decoding phase. We validate our approach for translation models based on auxiliary models built by two different ways. We also introduce novel probability variance features into the log-linear models for further improvements. We conclude our approach can be developed independently and integrated into current SMT pipeline directly. We demonstrate BLEU improvements on the NIST Chinese-to-English MT tasks for single-system decodings.

AB Communication and interaction with machines are changing our ways of life. However, developing an acoustic interface that simultaneously features waterproofness, wearability, high fidelity, and high accuracy for human-machine interaction remains a grand challenge. Herein, a waterproof acoustic sensor (WAS) as a wearable translation interface to communicate with machines is reported. Owing to the sound-response ability of internal microparticles, the WAS holds a significantly broad frequency response range of 0.1-20 kHz, covering almost the entire human audible range. The WAS is stable against human perspiration, shows omnidirectional response, and displays an excellent frequency detection resolution of 0.0001 kHz. With a collection of compelling features, the WAS can serve as a wearable acoustic human-machine interface and a high-fidelity auditory platform for music recording. Moreover, the WAS-based acoustic interface holds a remarkable 98% accuracy for speech recognition with the assistance of an artificial intelligence algorithm. Finally, the WAS-based acoustic interface demonstrates speaker verification and identification for implementation in highly secure biometric authentication systems and wireless control of an intelligent car using speech recognition. Such a WAS-based acoustic interface represents the advancement of high-fidelity translation platforms for human-machine interactions toward practical applications, including the Internet of Things, assistive technology, and intelligent recognition systems.

AB A compiler is a computer program which translates a source code into a target code, often with an objective to reduce the execution time and/or save critical resources. However, an error in the design or in the implementation of a compiler may result in software bugs in the target code obtained from that compiler. Translation validation is a formal verification approach for compilers whereby, each individual translation is followed by a validation phase which verifies that the target code produced correctly implements the source code. In this paper, we present a tool for translation validation of optimizing transformations of programs; the original and the transformed programs are modeled as Finite State Machines with Datapath having Arrays (FSMDAs) and a symbolic value propagation (SVP) based equivalence checking strategy is applied over this model to determine the correctness of the applied transformations. The tool has been demonstrated to handle uniform and non-uniform code motions, including code motions across loops, along with transformations which result in modification of control structures of programs. Moreover, arithmetic transformations such as, associative, commutative, distributive transformations, expression simplification, constant folding, etc., are also supported.

For this purpose, we use the Brazilian Portuguese version of a tool named LIWC, that distributes lexical words in categories with linguistic and psychological characteristics. By counting words in categories, this work seeks to evaluate the percentage of psycholinguistic changes in automatically translated texts and compare them with a reliable translation performed by a human expert. In this way, this study aims to contribute to the improvement of automatic translation tools. Experimental results indicate promising directions for further research.

AB Pronouns are frequently omitted in pro-drop languages, such as Chinese, generally leading to significant challenges with respect to the production of complete translations. Recently, Wang et al. (2018) proposed a novel reconstruction-based approach to alleviating dropped pronoun (DP) translation problems for neural machine translation models. In this work, we improve the original model from two perspectives. First, we employ a shared reconstructor to better exploit encoder and decoder representations. Second, we jointly learn to translate and predict DPs in an end-to-end manner, to avoid the errors propagated from an external DP prediction model. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves both translation performance and DP prediction accuracy.

TI A TRANSLATION METHOD FROM NATURAL-LANGUAGE SPECIFICATIONS OF
   COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS INTO ALGEBRAIC SPECIFICATIONS USING CONTEXTUAL
   DEPENDENCIES
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB This paper presents a method of translating natural language specifications of communication protocols into algebraic specifications. Such a natural language specification specifies action sequences performed by the protocol machine (program). Usually, a sentence implicitly specifies the state of the protocol machine at which the described actions must be performed. The authors propose a method of analyzing the implicitly specified states of the protocol machine taking the OSI session protocol specification (265 sentences) as an example. The method uses the following properties: (a) syntactic properties of a natural language (English in this paper); (b) syntactic properties introduced by the target algebraic specifications, e.g., type constraints; (c) properties specific to the target domain, e.g., properties of data types. This paper also shows the result of applying this method to the main part of the OSI session protocol specification (29 paragraphs, 98 sentences). For 95 sentences, the translation system uniquely determines the states specified implicitly by these sentences, using only (a) and (b) described above. By using (c) in addition, each implicitly specified state in the remaining three sentences is uniquely determined.

AB Deep convolutional neural networks have enabled remarkable progress over the last years on a variety of visual tasks, such as image recognition, speech recognition, and machine translation. These tasks contribute many to machine intelligence. However, developments of deep convolutional neural networks to a machine terminal remains challenging due to massive number of parameters and float operations that a typical model contains. Therefore, there is growing interest in convolutional neural network pruning. Existing work in this field of research can be categorized according to three dimensions: pruning method, training strategy, estimation criterion.

AB The growing popularity of hardware virtualization (VMware and Xen being two prominent implementations) leads us to examine the common ground between this yet-again vibrant technology and partial evaluation. A virtual machine executes oil host hardware and presents to its guest program a replica of that host environment, complete with CPU, memory, and I/O devices. A virtual machine can be seen its a self-interpreter.
   A program specializer is considered Jones-optimal if it is capable of removing a layer of interpretational overhead. We propose a formulation of Jones optimality which coincides with a well-known virtualization efficiency criterion.
   A fully abstract programming language translation (an idea put forward by Abadi) is one that preserves program equivalences. We may translate a program by specializing a self-interpreter with respect to it. We argue that full abstraction for such translations captures the notion of transparency (whether or not a program can determine if it is running on a virtual machine) in virtual machine folklore.
   We hope that this discussion will encourage wider exchange of ideas between the virtualization and partial evaluation communities.

AB The functional correspondence is a manual derivation technique transforming higher-order evaluators into the semantically equivalent abstract machines. The transformation consists of two well-known program transformations: translation to continuation-passing style that uncovers the control flow of the evaluator and Reynolds's defunctionalization that generates a first-order transition function. Ever since the transformation was first described by Danvy et al. it has found numerous applications in connecting known evaluators and abstract machines, but also in discovering new abstract machines for a variety of A-calculi as well as for logic-programming, imperative and object-oriented languages.
   We present an algorithm that automates the functional correspondence. The algorithm accepts an evaluator written in a dedicated minimal functional meta-language and it first transforms it to administrative normal form, which facilitates program analysis, before performing selective translation to continuation-passing style, and selective defunctionalization. The two selective transformations are driven by a control-flow analysis that is computed by an abstract interpreter obtained using the abstracting abstract machines methodology, which makes it possible to transform only the desired parts of the evaluator. The article is accompanied by an implementation of the algorithm in the form of a command-line tool that allows for automatic transformation of an evaluator embedded in a Racket source file and gives fine-grained control over the resulting machine.

AB Multilingual neural machine translation has shown the capability of directly translating between language pairs unseen in training, i.e. zero-shot translation. Despite being conceptually attractive, it often suffers from low output quality. The difficulty of generalizing to new translation directions suggests the model representations are highly specific to those language pairs seen in training. We demonstrate that a main factor causing the language-specific representations is the positional correspondence to input tokens. We show that this can be easily alleviated by removing residual connections in an encoder layer. With this modification, we gain up to 18.5 BLEU points on zero-shot translation while retaining quality on supervised directions. The improvements are particularly prominent between related languages, where our proposed model outperforms pivot-based translation. Moreover, our approach allows easy integration of new languages, which substantially expands translation coverage. By thorough inspections of the hidden layer outputs, we show that our approach indeed leads to more language-independent representations.(1)

AB Multimedia interaction-based computer-aided translation (CAT) is an effective method for translating massive multimedia applications. It is an essential English learning tool for college students with majors in multimedia technology. English teachers need to properly guide their students to use CAT technology by improving the students' English translation capabilities via reasonable setting of courses, selection of multimedia materials for teaching, and implementation of learning multimedia assessment. This paper proposes a semiautomatic evaluation method for a machine translation system based on fuzzy mathematics. It first discusses the characteristics of multimedia CAT software, describes its working principle, and proposes an optimization scheme suitable for translating teaching by analyzing its advantages and disadvantages. The author believes that only through the combination of multimedia interaction-based CAT teaching and traditional translation teaching we can better achieve the purpose of translation education to improve the quality and English-speaking talent.

AB The development of a speech translation (ST) system is costly, largely because it is expensive to collect parallel data. A new language pair is typically only considered in the aftermath of an international crisis that incurs a major need of cross-lingual communication. Urgency justifies the deployment of interpreters while data is being collected. In recent work, we have shown that audio recordings of interpreter-mediated communication can present a low-cost data resource for the rapid development of automatic text and speech translation. However, our previous experiments remain limited to English/Spanish simultaneous interpretation. In this work, we examine our approaches for exploiting interpretation audio as translation model training data in the context of English/Pashto consecutive interpretation. We show that our previously made findings remain valid, despite the more complex language pair and the additional challenges introduced by the strong resource-limitations of Pashto.

TI Systematic geometric rigid body error identification of 5-axis milling
   machines
SO COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN
AB A 5-axis milling machine has 39 independent geometric error components when the machine tool is considered as a set of five rigid bodies. The identification of the deterministic component of the systematic error is very important. It permits one to improve the accuracy close to the repeatability of the machine tool. This paper gives a new way to identify and compensate all the systematic angular errors separately and then use them further to identify the systematic translational error.
   Identification based on a new mathematical method and a stable numerical solution method is proposed. The model explains from first principles why some error components have no effect in a first order model. The identification of the total angular systematic errors can be done independently from the translation errors. However, the total translation error depends on the angular errors and the translation errors of each machine tool slide. The main problems solved are to find enough linear independent equations and avoid numerical instability in the computation. It is important to separate numerical problems and linear dependence. The very complex equations are first analyzed in symbolic form to eliminate the linear dependencies. The total of linear independent components in the model is reduced from 30 to 26 for the position dependent errors and from 9 to 3 for the position independent components. Secondly, the large system of linear equations is broken down in many smaller systems. The model is tested first with simulated errors modeled as cubic polynomials. An artifact-based identification is proposed and implemented based on drilling holes in various locations and orientations. New ways to measure the volumetric error directly are proposed. Direct measurement of the total volumetric error requires considerably less measurement than measuring all 6 components of each machine slide especially in the case of a 5-axis machine.

AB Modern sentence-level NMT systems often produce plausible translations of isolated sentences. However, when put in context, these translations may end up being inconsistent with each other. We propose a monolingual DocRepair model to correct inconsistencies between sentence-level translations. DocRepair performs automatic post-editing on a sequence of sentence-level translations, refining translations of sentences in context of each other. For training, the DocRepair model requires only monolingual document-level data in the target language. It is trained as a monolingual sequence-to-sequence model that maps inconsistent groups of sentences into consistent ones. The consistent groups come from the original training data; the inconsistent groups are obtained by sampling roundtrip translations for each isolated sentence. We show that this approach successfully imitates inconsistencies we aim to fix: using contrastive evaluation, we show large improvements in the translation of several contextual phenomena in an English -> Russian translation task, as well as improvements in the BLEU score. We also conduct a human evaluation and show a strong preference of the annotators to corrected translations over the baseline ones. Moreover, we analyze which discourse phenomena are hard to capture using monolingual data only.(1)

AB Nowadays knowledge base (KB) has been viewed as one of the important infrastructures for many web search applications and NLP tasks. However, in practice the availability of KB data varies from language to language, which greatly limits potential usage of knowledge base. In this paper, we propose a novel method to construct or enrich a knowledge base by entity translation with help of another KB but compiled in a different language. In our work, we concentrate on two key tasks: 1) collecting translation candidates with as good coverage as possible from various sources such as web or lexicon; 2) building an effective disambiguation algorithm based on collective inference approach over knowledge graph to find correct translation for entities in the source knowledge base. We conduct experiments on movie domain of our in-house knowledge base from English to Chinese, and the results show the proposed method can achieve very high translation precision compared with classical translation methods, and significantly increase the volume of Chinese knowledge base in this domain.

TI Opinion mining from machine translated Bangla reviews with stacked
   contractive auto-encoders
SO JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING
AB In the last years, online users have been sharing more and more opinions, reviews, and comments on the web. Opinion mining is the automatic process of getting the subject of such opinions, and recently it has been attracting great commercial and academic interest. Several methods were presented for performing opinion mining in Bangla language, however they reported limited performance. In the present article, we considered the only two publicly datasets available for opinion mining in the Bangla language. We machine translated the datasets into the English language and we preprocessed them by extracting textual frequency based features. Then, we designed two stacked contractive auto-encoders based architectures to perform opinion mining in Bangla language, one for each dataset. The classifiers were trained on the machine translated version on the two datasets in a stacked learning fashion. The proposed classifiers achieved improved performance, with respect to accuracy (>= 96%), precision (>= 93%), recall (>= 94%), and F1 score (>= 94%), reported in the past state of the art works. Furthermore, the experimental results showed that both the machine translation procedure and the stacked learning frameworks improved the final classification performance.

AB We tackle the problem of machine translation (MT) of manga, Japanese comics. Manga translation involves two important problems in MT: context-aware and multimodal translation. Since text and images are mixed up in an unstructured fashion in manga, obtaining context from the image is essential for its translation. However, it is still an open problem how to extract context from images and integrate into MT models. In addition, corpus and benchmarks to train and evaluate such models are currently unavailable. In this paper, we make the following four contributions that establish the foundation of manga translation research. First, we propose a multimodal context-aware translation framework. We are the first to incorporate context information obtained from manga images. It enables us to translate texts in speech bubbles that cannot be translated without using context information (e.g., texts in other speech bubbles, gender of speakers, etc.). Second, for training the model, we propose the approach to automatic corpus construction from pairs of original manga and their translations, by which a large parallel corpus can be constructed without any manual labeling. Third, we created a new benchmark to evaluate manga translation. Finally, on top of our proposed methods, we devised a first comprehensive system for fully automated manga translation.

In this paper, the idea of local structurization method is combined with the theory of decoupling. A new decoupling method, local structurization decoupling method, is proposed first. Jacobian matrix is decomposed into two matrices-translation matrix and rotation matrix. So decoupling between parallel motion and rotation is implemented in a six-leg virtual-axis NC machine tool for small time intervals.

The identification of non-nominal pronouns is important in information retrieval, machine translation and automatic summarisation. Given that previous work has only tackled a subset of those non-nominal uses, a machine learning method for identification of all instances of non-nominal it is presented. The machine learning method is compared with a rule-based approach. The performance of each implementation is evaluated. The construction of an annotated corpus and training data are also described.

Eigen-RBM exploits the global structure of the image and does not impose any locality or translation-invariance assumption, and regularizes the network weights to be a linear combination of a set of predefined filters. We show that, compared to basic RBM, Eigen-RBM can achieve similar or better performance in both recognition and sample generation with significantly less training time.

AB There has been great progress in improving streaming machine translation, a simultaneous paradigm where the system appends to a growing hypothesis as more source content becomes available. We study a related problem in which revisions to the hypothesis beyond strictly appending words are permitted. This is suitable for applications such as live captioning an audio feed. In this setting, we compare custom streaming approaches to re-translation, a straightforward strategy where each new source token triggers a distinct translation from scratch. We find retranslation to be as good or better than state-of-the-art streaming systems, even when operating under constraints that allow very few revisions. We attribute much of this success to a previously proposed data-augmentation technique that adds prefix-pairs to the training data, which alongside wait-k inference forms a strong baseline for streaming translation. We also highlight re-translation's ability to wrap arbitrarily powerful MT systems with an experiment showing large improvements from an upgrade to its base model.

TI Differential brain mechanisms during reading human vs. machine
   translated fiction and news texts
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Few neuroimaigng studies on reading comprehension have been conducted under natural reading settings. In this study, we showed texts presented in a natural way during functional MRI (fMRI) measurements to reveal brain areas sensitive to reading comprehension. Specifically, this paradigm independently manipulated two holistic features of article style: text genre and translation style, a qualitative index of how typical word choices and arrangements are made in daily use of the language. Specifically, articles from The NewYorkTimes (news) and Reader's Digest (fiction) translated from English to Mandarin Chinese either by human experts or machine (Google Translate) were used to investigate the correlation of brain activity across participants during article reading. We found that bi-hemispheric visual cortex, precuneus, and occipito-parietal junction show significantly correlated hemodynamics across participants regardless of translation style and article genre. Compared to machine translation, reading human expert translation elicited more reliable fMRI signals across participants at precuneus, potentially because narrative representations and contents can be coherently presented over tens of seconds. We also found significantly stronger inter-subject correlated fMRI signals at temporal poles and fusiform gyri in fiction reading than in news reading. This may be attributed to more stable empathy processing across participants in fiction reading. The degree of stability of brain responses across subjects at extra-linguistic areas was found correlated with subjective rating on the text fluency. The functional connectivity between these areas was modulated by text genre and translation style. Taken together, our imaging results suggested stable and selective neural substrates associated with comprehending holistic features of written narratives.

TI Item-based assessment of translation competence: Chimera of objectivity
   versus prospect of reliable measurement
SO LINGUISTICA ANTVERPIENSIA NEW SERIES-THEMES IN TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB In the course of the past decade, scholars in Translation Studies have repeatedly expressed the need for more empirical research on translation assessment. Notwithstanding the many pleas for "objectivity" that have been voiced in the literature, the issue of reliability remains unaddressed. Although there is no consensus on the best method for measuring the quality of human or machine translations, it is clear that in both cases measurement error will need to be accounted for. This is especially the case in high-stake situations such as assessments that lead to translation competence being certified. In this article we focus on the summative assessment of translation competence in an educational context. We explore the psychometric quality of two assessment methods: the CDI method (Eyckmans, Anckaert, & Segers, 2009) and the PIE method (Kockaert & Segers, 2014; 2017; Segers & Kockaert, 2016). In our study, the reliability of both methods is compared empirically by scoring the same set of translations (n > 100) according to each method.

TI Research on Traditional Mongolian-Chinese Neural Machine Translation
   Based on Dependency Syntactic Information and Transformer Model
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Neural machine translation (NMT) is a data-driven machine translation approach that has proven its superiority in large corpora, but it still has much room for improvement when the corpus resources are not abundant. This work aims to improve the translation quality of Traditional Mongolian-Chinese (MN-CH). First, the baseline model is constructed based on the Transformer model, and then two different syntax-assisted learning units are added to the encoder and decoder. Finally, the encoder's ability to learn Traditional Mongolian syntax is implicitly strengthened, and the knowledge of Chinese-dependent syntax is taken as prior knowledge to explicitly guide the decoder to learn Chinese syntax. The average BLEU values measured under two experimental conditions showed that the proposed improved model improved by 6.706 (45.141-38.435) and 5.409 (41.930-36.521) compared with the baseline model. The analysis of the experimental results also revealed that the proposed improved model was still deficient in learning Chinese syntax, and then the Primer-EZ method was introduced to ameliorate this problem, leading to faster convergence and better translation quality. The final improved model had an average BLEU value increase of 9.113 (45.634-36.521) compared with the baseline model at experimental conditions of N = 5 and epochs = 35. The experiments showed that both the proposed model architecture and prior knowledge could effectively lead to an increase in BLEU value, and the addition of syntactic-assisted learning units not only corrected the initial association but also alleviated the long-term dependence between words.

AB Evaluation plays an essential way in Information Retrieval (IR) researches. Existing Web search evaluation methodologies usually come in two ways: offline and online methods. The benchmarks generated by offline methods (e.g. Cranfield-like ones) could be easily reused. However, the evaluation metrics in these methods are usually based on various user behavior assumptions (e.g. Cascade assumption) and may not well accord with actual user behaviors. Online methods, in contrast, can well capture users' actual preferences while the results are not usually reusable. In this paper, we focus on the evaluation problem where users are using search engines to finish complex tasks. These tasks usually involve multiple queries in a single search session and propose challenges to both offline and online evaluation methodologies. To tackle this problem, we propose a search success evaluation framework based on machine translation model. In this framework, we formulate the search success evaluation problem as a machine translation evaluation problem: the ideal search outcome (i.e. necessary information to finish the task) is considered as the reference while search outcome from individual users (i.e. content that are perceived by users) as the translation. Thus, we adopt BLEU, a long standing machine translation evaluation metric, to evaluate the success of searchers. This framework avoids the introduction of possibly unreliable behavior assumptions and is reusable as well. We also tried a number of automatic methods which aim to minimize assessors' efforts based on search interaction behavior such as eye-tracking and click-through. Experimental results indicate that the proposed evaluation method well correlates with explicit feedback on search satisfaction from search users. It is also suitable for search success evaluation when there is need for quick or frequent evaluations.

TI Multi-Retranslation corpora: Visibility, variation, value, and virtue
SO DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP IN THE HUMANITIES
AB Variation among human translations is usually invisible, little understood, and under-valued. Previous statistical research finds that translations vary most where the source items are most semantically significant or express most 'attitude' (affect, evaluation, ideology). Understanding how and why translations vary is important for translator training and translation quality assessment, for cultural research, and for machine translation development. Our experimental project began with the intuition that quantitative variation in a corpus of historical retranslations might be used to project quasi-qualitative annotations onto the translated text. We present a web-based system which enables users to create parallel, segment-aligned multi-version corpora, and provides visual interfaces for exploring multiple translations, with their variation projected onto a base text. The system can support any corpus of variant versions. We report experiments using our tools (and stylometric analysis) to investigate a corpus of forty German versions of a work by Shakespeare. Initial findings lead to more questions than answers.

TI Translation as discrimination: Sociolinguistics and inequality in
   multilingual institutional contexts
SO LANGUAGE IN SOCIETY
AB Sociolinguistic approaches to social justice tend to treat the use of interpreters or translators as a remedy to linguistic inequality in multilingual institutional settings. This article challenges this assumption by showing how translation can instead contribute to inequality and discrimination. Drawing on studies of face-to-face interpreting in judicial contexts and of written translation in linguistic landscapes, it explores inequalities found in habitual practices of professional interpreters and in the use of machine translation. It shows how language ideologies about multilingualism motivate translation practices that systematically restrict the participation of speakers of subordinated languages, or that stereotype them as deviant when addressed solely by prohibitions and warnings, a practice I call 'punitive multilingualism'. The article thus argues that sociolinguistic studies of multilingualism should pay closer attention to translation practices within a wider context of language contact and in relation to phenomena such as translanguaging, mock languages, or language shift.

AB Non-Autoregressive Transformer (NAT) aims to accelerate the Transformer model through discarding the autoregressive mechanism and generating target words independently, which fails to exploit the target sequential information. Over-translation and under-translation errors often occur for the above reason, especially in the long sentence translation scenario. In this paper, we propose two approaches to retrieve the target sequential information for NAT to enhance its translation ability while preserving the fast-decoding property. Firstly, we propose a sequence-level training method based on a novel reinforcement algorithm for NAT (Reinforce-NAT) to reduce the variance and stabilize the training procedure. Secondly, we propose an innovative Transformer decoder named FS-decoder to fuse the target sequential information into the top layer of the decoder. Experimental results on three translation tasks show that the Reinforce-NAT surpasses the baseline NAT system by a significant margin on BLEU without decelerating the decoding speed and the FS-decoder achieves comparable translation performance to the autoregressive Transformer with considerable speedup.

AB Multilingual neural machine translation (Multi-NMT) with one encoder-decoder model has made remarkable progress due to its simple deployment. However, this multilingual translation paradigm does not make full use of language commonality and parameter sharing between encoder and decoder. Furthermore, this kind of paradigm cannot outperform the individual models trained on bilingual corpus in most cases. In this paper, we propose a compact and language-sensitive method for multilingual translation. To maximize parameter sharing, we first present a universal representor to replace both encoder and decoder models. To make the representor sensitive for specific languages, we further introduce language-sensitive embedding, attention, and discriminator with the ability to enhance model performance. We verify our methods on various translation scenarios, including one-to-many, many-to-many and zero-shot. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed methods remarkably outperform strong standard multilingual translation systems on WMT and IWSLT datasets. Moreover, we find that our model is especially helpful in low-resource and zero-shot translation scenarios.

AB A rotation, scaling and translation (RST) invariant, watermarking scheme using support vector machine and image moments for synchronization is proposed in this paper. Watermark is adaptively embedded in discrete wavelet transform (DWT) domain. In order to estimate RST transform parameters, support vector machine is utilized to learn image geometric pattern represented by six combined low order image moments. Watermark extraction is carried out after watermarked image has been synchronized. Experiments show that the proposed scheme can effectively resist JPEG compression, noise and geometric attacks.

AB Word segmentation is an essential step in building natural language applications such as machine translation, text summarization, and cross-lingual information retrieval. For certain oriental languages where word boundary is not clearly defined, a recognition process can become very challenging. One of the serious problems is dealing with word ambiguity. In this paper, we investigate the use of Linear Support Vector Machines (LSVM) for word boundary disambiguation. We empirically show, in the Vietnamese case, that LSVM obtains a better result when comparing to the Trigram Language Model approach.

AB The ISO EN 17100:2015 (Translation Services - Requirements for Translation Services) is a quality standard including a set of provisions (requirements and recommendations) for all the core aspects of the translation process, considered as an industrial asset. Its main (or, rather, its only) goal is the implementation of a series of activities deemed as necessary for the delivery of a quality translation end-product, on the assumption that a quality process leads ineluctably to a quality end-product. The standard's provisions do not refer to what is in Spain known as traduccion jurada (sworn translation). This paper addresses what the standard leaves out: a proposal for the implementation of its provisions, combined with the usage of the blockchain(1) and other disruptive technologies to sworn translation, by focusing on the illustrative case of Spain. It discusses the applicable regulations concerning sworn translation and sworn translation standardization and explores the methods through which the combined application of a functional translation methodological framework, the provisions of the iso EN 17100:2015 standard, a standardized macrotextual pattern and a number of security devices and disruptive technologies might contribute to building a quality management system in the domain of sworn translation.

TI Enriching the Transfer Learning with Pre-Trained Lexicon Embedding for
   Low-Resource Neural Machine Translation
SO TSINGHUA SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Most State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems today achieve outstanding results based only on large parallel corpora. The large-scale parallel corpora for high-resource languages is easily obtainable. However, the translation quality of NMT for morphologically rich languages is still unsatisfactory, mainly because of the data sparsity problem encountered in Low-Resource Languages (LRLs). In the low-resource NMT paradigm, Transfer Learning (TL) has been developed into one of the most efficient methods. It is difficult to train the model on high-resource languages to include the information in both parent and child models, as well as the initially trained model that only contains the lexicon features and word embeddings of the parent model instead of the child languages feature. In this work, we aim to address this issue by proposing the language-independent Hybrid Transfer Learning (HTL) method for LRLs by sharing lexicon embedding between parent and child languages without leveraging back translation or manually injecting noises. First, we train the High-Resource Languages (HRLs) as the parent model with its vocabularies. Then, we combine the parent and child language pairs using the oversampling method to train the hybrid model initialized by the previously parent model. Finally, we fine-tune the morphologically rich child model using a hybrid model. Besides, we explore some exciting discoveries on the original TL approach. Experimental results show that our model consistently outperforms five SOTA methods in two languages Azerbaijani (Az) and Uzbek (Uz). Meanwhile, our approach is practical and significantly better, achieving improvements of up to 4.94 and 4.84 BLEU points for low-resource child languages Az -> Zh and Uz -> Zh, respectively.

AB One way to achieve semantic interoperability when data lexicalized in different languages is by means of cross-lingual linking. Translation resources are used as an intermediate step to reduce the language barriers. The key challenge is to select the correct mapping among candidate matches. We define an experiment to study upper bounds for the correctness of a cross-lingual ontology matching system. We highlight different lexical characteristics that can support the selection step. We believe that our findings can be useful in the design of cross-lingual mapping algorithms.

AB Multilingual Neural Machine Translation (NMT) enables one model to serve all translation directions, including ones that are unseen during training, i.e. zero-shot translation. Despite being theoretically attractive, current models often produce low quality translations - commonly failing to even produce outputs in the right target language. In this work, we observe that off-target translation is dominant even in strong multilingual systems, trained on massive multilingual corpora. To address this issue, we propose a joint approach to regularize NMT models at both representation-level and gradient-level. At the representation level, we leverage an auxiliary target language prediction task to regularize decoder outputs to retain information about the target language. At the gradient level, we leverage a small amount of direct data (in thousands of sentence pairs) to regularize model gradients. Our results demonstrate that our approach is highly effective in both reducing off-target translation occurrences and improving zero-shot translation performance by +5.59 and +10.38 BLEU on WMT and OPUS datasets respectively. Moreover, experiments show that our method also works well when the small amount of direct data is not available.(1)

TI Using decision tree to hybrid morphology generation of Persian verb for
   English-Persian translation
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB Languages such as English need to be morphologically analyzed in translation into morphologically rich languages such as Persian. Analyzing the output of English to Persian machine translation systems illustrates that Persian morphology comes with many challenges especially in the verb conjugation. In this paper, we investigate three ways to deal with the morphology of Persian verb in machine translation (MT): no morphology generation in statistical MT, rule-based morphology generation in rule-based MT and a hybrid-model-independent morphology generation. By model-independent we mean that it is not based on statistical or rule-based MT and could be applied to any English to Persian MT as a post-processor. We select Google translator (translate.google.com) to show the performance of a statistical MT without any morphology generation component for the verb conjugation. Rule-based morphology generation is implemented as a part of a rule-based MT. Finally, we enrich the rule-based approach by statistical methods and information to present a hybrid model. A set of linguistically motivated features are defined using both English and Persian linguistic knowledge obtained from a parallel corpus. Then we make a model to predict six morphological features of the verb in Persian using decision tree classifier and generate an inflected verb form. In a real translation process, by applying our model to the output of Google translator and a rule-based MT as a post-processor, we achieve an improvement of about 0.7% absolute BLEU score in the best case. When we are given the gold lemma in our reference experiments, using the most common feature values as a baseline shows an improvement of almost 2.8% absolute BLEU score on a test set containing 15K sentences.

AB Recently, representation learning for text and speech has successfully improved many language related tasks. However, all existing methods suffer from two limitations: (a) they only learn from one input modality, while a unified representation for both speech and text is needed by tasks such as end-to-end speech translation, and as a result, (b) they can not exploit various large-scale text and speech data and their performance is limited by the scarcity of parallel speech translation data. To address these problems, we propose a Fused Acoustic and Text Masked Language Model (FAT-MLM) which jointly learns a unified representation for both acoustic and text input from various types of corpora including parallel data for speech recognition and machine translation, and even pure speech and text data. Within this cross-modal representation learning framework, we further present an end-to-end model for Fused Acoustic and Text Speech Translation (FAT-ST). Experiments on three translation directions show that by fine-tuning from FAT-MLM, our proposed speech translation models substantially improve translation quality by up to +5.9 BLEU.

TI The practical ethics of bias reduction in machine translation: why
   domain adaptation is better than data debiasing
SO ETHICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB This article probes the practical ethical implications of AI system design by reconsidering the important topic of bias in the datasets used to train autonomous intelligent systems. The discussion draws on recent work concerning behaviour-guiding technologies, and it adopts a cautious form of technological utopianism by assuming it is potentially beneficial for society at large if AI systems are designed to be comparatively free from the biases that characterise human behaviour. However, the argument presented here critiques the common well-intentioned requirement that, in order to achieve this, all such datasets must be debiased prior to training. By focusing specifically on gender-bias in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems, three automated strategies for the removal of bias are considered - downsampling, upsampling, and counterfactual augmentation - and it is shown that systems trained on datasets debiased using these approaches all achieve general translation performance that is much worse than a baseline system. In addition, most of them also achieve worse performance in relation to metrics that quantify the degree of gender bias in the system outputs. By contrast, it is shown that the technique of domain adaptation can be effectively deployed to debias existing NMT systems after they have been fully trained. This enables them to produce translations that are quantitatively far less biased when analysed using gender-based metrics, but which also achieve state-of-the-art general performance. It is hoped that the discussion presented here will reinvigorate ongoing debates about how and why bias can be most effectively reduced in state-of-the-art AI systems.

AB This research employs genre-comparable data from a number of parallel and comparable corpora to explore the specificity of translations from English into German and Russian produced by students and professional translators. We introduce an elaborate set of human-interpretable lexicogrammatic translationese indicators and calculate the amount of translationese manifested in the data for each target language and translation variety. By placing translations into the same feature space as their sources and the genre-comparable non-translated reference texts in the target language, we observe two separate translationese effects: a shift of translations into the gap between the two languages and a shift away from either language. These trends are linked to the features that contribute to each of the effects. Finally, we compare the translation varieties and find out that the professionalism levels seem to have some correlation with the amount and types of translationese detected, while each language pair demonstrates a specific socio-linguistically determined combination of the translationese effects.

TI Statistical Approaches to Computer-Assisted Translation
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Current machine translation (MT) systems are still not perfect. In practice, the output from these systems needs to be edited to correct errors. A way of increasing the productivity of the whole translation process (MT plus human work) is to incorporate the human correction activities within the translation process itself, thereby shifting the MT paradigm to that of computer-assisted translation. This model entails an iterative process in which the human translator activity is included in the loop: In each iteration, a prefix of the translation is validated (accepted or amended) by the human and the system computes its best (or n-best) translation suffix hypothesis to complete this prefix. A successful framework for MT is the so-called statistical (or pattern recognition) framework. Interestingly, within this framework, the adaptation of MT systems to the interactive scenario affects mainly the search process, allowing a great reuse of successful techniques and models. In this article, alignment templates, phrase-based models, and stochastic finite-state transducers are used to develop computer-assisted translation systems. These systems were assessed in a European project (TransType2) in two real tasks: The translation of printer manuals; manuals and the translation of the Bulletin of the European Union. In each task, the following three pairs of languages were involved (in both translation directions): English-Spanish, English-German, and English-French.

AB Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) is an unsupervised sub-word tokenization technique, commonly used in neural machine translation and other NLP tasks. Its effectiveness makes it a de facto standard, but the reasons for this are not well understood. We link BPE to the broader family of dictionary-based compression algorithms and compare it with other members of this family. Our experiments across datasets, language pairs, translation models, and vocabulary size show that - given a fixed vocabulary size budget - the fewer tokens an algorithm needs to cover the test set, the better the translation (as measured by BLEU).

TI Parallelizing and optimizing neural Encoder-Decoder models without
   padding on multi-core architecture
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Scaling up Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms for massive datasets to improve their performance is becoming crucial. In Machine Translation (MT), one of most important research fields of AI, models based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) show state-of-the-art performance in recent years, and many researchers keep working on improving RNN-based models to achieve better accuracy in translation tasks. Most implementations of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models employ a padding strategy when processing a mini-batch to make all sentences in a mini-batch have the same length. This enables an efficient utilization of caches and GPU/SIMD parallelism but leads to a waste of computation time. In this paper, we implement and parallelize batch learning for a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model, which is the most basic model of NMT, without using a padding strategy. More specifically, our approach forms vectors which represent the input words as well as the neural network's states at different time steps into matrices when it processes one sentence, and as a result, the approach makes a better use of cache and optimizes the process that adjusts weights and biases during the back-propagation phase. Our experimental evaluation shows that our implementation achieves better scalability on multi-core CPUs. We also discuss our approach's potential to be used in other implementations of RNN-based models. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Consistent Transcription and Translation of Speech
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB The conventional paradigm in speech translation starts with a speech recognition step to generate transcripts, followed by a translation step with the automatic transcripts as input. To address various shortcomings of this paradigm, recent work explores end-to-end trainable direct models that translate without transcribing. However, transcripts can be an indispensable output in practical applications, which often display transcripts alongside the translations to users.
   We make this common requirement explicit and explore the task of jointly transcribing and translating speech. Although high accuracy of transcript and translation are crucial, even highly accurate systems can suffer from inconsistencies between both outputs that degrade the user experience. We introduce a methodology to evaluate consistency and compare several modeling approaches, including the traditional cascaded approach and end-to-end models. We find that direct models are poorly suited to the joint transcription/translation task, but that end-to-end models that feature a coupled inference procedure are able to achieve strong consistency. We further introduce simple techniques for directly optimizing for consistency, and analyze the resulting trade-offs between consistency, transcription accuracy, and translation accuracy.

AB We propose a hybrid approach for automatic generation of SystemVerilog assertions from natural-language specifications by combining machine-learning and formal analysis of the input text. The formal analysis focuses on parsing the input text, while the machine learning engine focuses on translating the input text to formal logic and/or assertions. Such a hybrid reduces the burden of a purely machine-learning based translation and increases accuracy in the generated assertions, especially for those complex assertions. In addition, the proposed hybrid approach offers a novel method to validate the assertions generated, in which the results of different machine-learning models are used to determine the confidence of the hybrid approach.

TI Machine Translation Evaluation: Unveiling the Role of Dense Sentence
   Vector Embedding for Morphologically Rich Language
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Machine Translation (MT) evaluation metrics like BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) and Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit Ordering (METEOR) are known to have poor performance for word-order and morphologically rich languages. Application of linguistic knowledge to evaluate MTs for morphologically rich language like Hindi as a target language, is shown to be more effective and accurate [S. Tripathi and V. Kansal, Using linguistic knowledge for machine translation evaluation with Hindi as a target language, Comput. Sist. 21(4) (2017) 717-724]. Leveraging the recent progress made in the domain of word vector and sentence vector embedding [T. Mikolov and J. Dean, Distributed representations of words and phrases and their compositionality, Adv. Neural Inf. Process. Syst. 2 (2013) 3111-3119], authors have trained a large corpus of pre-processed Hindi text (similar to 112 million tokens) for obtaining the word vectors and sentence vector embedding for Hindi. The training has been performed on high end system configuration utilizing Google Cloud platform resources. This sentence vector embedding is further used to corroborate the findings through linguistic knowledge in evaluation metric. For morphologically rich language as target, evaluation metric of MT systems is considered as an optimal solution. In this paper, authors have demonstrated that MT evaluation using sentence embedding-based approach closely mirrors linguistic evaluation technique. The relevant codes used to generate the vector embedding for Hindi have been uploaded on code sharing platform Github.(a)

AB Image translation across different domains has attracted much attention in both machine learning and computer vision communities. Taking the translation from a source domain to a target domain as an example, existing algorithms mainly rely on two kinds of loss for training: One is the discrimination loss, which is used to differentiate images generated by the models and natural images; the other is the reconstruction loss, which measures the difference between an original image and the reconstructed version. In this work, we introduce a new kind of loss, multi-path consistency loss, which evaluates the differences between direct translation from source domain to target domain and indirect translation from source domain to an auxiliary domain to target domain, to regularize training. For multi-domain translation (at least, three) which focuses on building translation models between any two domains, at each training iteration, we randomly select three domains, set them respectively as the source, auxiliary and target domains, build the multi-path consistency loss and optimize the network. For two-domain translation, we need to introduce an additional auxiliary domain and construct the multi-path consistency loss. We conduct various experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, including face-to-face translation, paint-to-photo translation, and de-raining/de-noising translation.

AB Serious efforts to develop computerized systems for natural language understanding and machine translation have taken place for more than half a century. Some successful systems that translate texts in limited domains such as weather forecasts have been implemented. However, the more general the domain or complex the style of the text the more difficult it is to reach high quality translation. The same applies to natural language understanding. All systems need to deal with problems like ambiguity, lack of semantic coverage and pragmatic insight. In this article, some philosophical questions that underlie the difficulty of natural language understanding and good quality translation are first studied. These two areas of dealing with languages are actually closely related. Namely, for instance Quine's notion of indeterminacy of translation have shown that the problem of translation does not only hold for translation between different languages but similar problems are encountered when communication between users of same language is considered. The term intralingual translation has been used e.g. by Roman Jakobson. Intralingual translation relates to translation between languages and to the problem of sameness of meaning. In this article, arguments and methods of considering translation and meaning within the framework of continuous-valued multidimensional representations, probability theory, fuzzy sets and neural adaptive systems are considered.

TI BERT-JAM: Maximizing the utilization of BERT for neural machine
   translation
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
AB Pre-training based approaches have been demonstrated effective for a wide range of natural language processing tasks. Leveraging BERT for neural machine translation (NMT), which we refer to as BERT enhanced NMT, has received increasing interest in recent years. However, there still exists a research gap in studying how to maximize the utilization of BERT for NMT tasks. Firstly, previous studies mostly focus on utilizing BERT's last-layer representation, neglecting the linguistic features encoded by the intermediate layers. Secondly, it requires further architectural exploration to integrate the BERT representation with the NMT encoder/decoder layers efficiently. And thirdly, existing methods keep the BERT parameters fixed during training to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem, wasting the chances of boosting the performance via fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose BERT-JAM to fill the research gap from three aspects: 1) we equip BERT-JAM with fusion modules for composing BERT's multi-layer representations into a fused representation that can be leveraged by the NMT model, 2) BERT-JAM utilizes joint-attention modules to allow the BERT representation to be dynamically integrated with the encoder/decoder representations, and 3) we train BERT-JAM with a three-phase optimization strategy that progressively unfreezes different components to overcome catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. Experimental results show that BERT-JAM achieves state-of-the-art BLEU scores on multiple translation tasks. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Dynamic Phrase Generation for Detection of Idioms of Gujarati Language
   using Diacritics and Suffix-based Rules
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB Gujarati is the language used for everyday communication in the state of Gujarat, India. The Gujarati language is also officially recognized by the constitution and the government of India. Gujarati script is based on the Devanagari script. An idiom is an expression, phrase, or word that has a different meaning from the literal meaning of the words in it. Idioms represent the cultural heritage of Gujarati language. Idioms are used in Gujarati language for effective communication and convey of an accurate message. No Machine Translation System does the accurate translation of Gujarati idioms to English or any other language. Different idiom phrases can be generated by adding diacritic(s) as well as suffix to the root or base form of the idiom. Many forms of single idiom make automatic idiom identification as well as machine translation more challenging. This paper focuses on the design and implementation of diacritics and suffix-based rules for dynamic phrase generation and detection of idioms of Gujarati language. This implementation helps in identifying Gujarati idiom present in any possible form in the Gujarati text. The obtained results with the execution of 7050 different Gujarati idiom phrases yield an accuracy of 99.73%. The results are encouraging enough to make the proposed implementation useful for Natural Language processing tasks related to Gujarati language idioms.

AB Speech recognition and Speech synthesis are the two emerging technologies in the communication field. Speech recognition is a system which generates text for the given speech, while a speech synthesizer is a system that should be able to read any text aloud. Research is conducting all over the world, to develop an efficient text to speech synthesis (TTS) system for minority languages. India has the largest democracy system in the world, also known as land of unity in diversity and has more than 22 official languages. It becomes difficult to understand the English and the other European languages to common people. This works aims to help people to translate English text to their own language and implement a TTS for the minority language, Malayalam. It is achieved by combining both Machine Translation and TTS. When an English text is given, it is translated to Malayalam with the help of a parser, using grammatical rules, applying morphology and a bilingual dictionary. From each of the translated Malayalam text, syllables are separated. A good number of syllables are recorded and stored in the syllable corpus. Syllables are concatenated to generate a synthesized Malayalam speech. Machine translation of English to Malayalam text is tested and achieved 73 percentage accuracy. For the TTS system, accuracy is verified by checking the naturalness and intelligibility. 87 percentages of the sentences are uttered correctly.

TI Neural Machine Translation with Target-Attention Model
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB Attention mechanism, which selectively focuses on source-side information to learn a context vector for generating target words, has been shown to be an effective method for neural machine translation (NMT). In fact, generating target words depends on not only the source-side information but also the target-side information. Although the vanilla NMT can acquire target-side information implicitly by recurrent neural networks (RNN), RNN cannot adequately capture the global relationship between target-side words. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel target-attention approach to capture this information, thus enhancing target word predictions in NMT. Specifically, we propose three variants of target-attention model to directly obtain the global relationship among target words: 1) a forward target-attention model that uses a target attention mechanism to incorporate previous historical target words into the prediction of the current target word; 2) a reverse target-attention model that adopts a reverse RNN model to obtain the entire reverse target words information, and then to combine with source context information to generate target sequence; 3) a bidirectional target-attention model that combines the forward target-attention model and reverse target-attention model together, which can make full use of target words to further improve the performance of NMT. Our methods can be integrated into both RNN based NMT and self-attention based NMT, and help NMT get global target-side information to improve translation performance. Experiments on the NIST Chinese-to-English and the WMT English-to-German translation tasks show that the proposed models achieve significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.

AB We investigate the behavior of maps learned by machine translation methods. The maps translate words by projecting between word embedding spaces of different languages. We locally approximate these maps using linear maps, and find that they vary across the word embedding space. This demonstrates that the underlying maps are non-linear. Importantly, we show that the locally linear maps vary by an amount that is tightly correlated with the distance between the neighborhoods on which they are trained. Our results can be used to test non-linear methods, and to drive the design of more accurate maps for word translation.

AB A language lexicon can be divided into four main strata, depending on origin of words: core vocabulary words, fully- and partially-assimilated foreign words, and unassimilated foreign words (or transliterations). This paper focuses on translation of fully- and partially-assimilated foreign words, called "borrowed words". Borrowed words (or loanwords) are content words found in nearly all languages, occupying up to 70% of the vocabulary. We use models of lexical borrowing in machine translation as a pivoting mechanism to obtain translations of out-of-vocabulary loanwords in a low-resource language. Our framework obtains substantial improvements (up to 1.6 BLEU) over standard baselines.

AB The ATLAS Transformation Language (ATL) is a well-known hybrid model transformation language that allows both declarative and imperative constructs to be used in the definition of model transformations. In this paper, we present ATL transformations providing an integrated structural description of the source and target metamodels and the transformation between them. More specifically, the paper presents translation rules of Systems Modeling Language (SysML) state machines models into a class of non-autonomous Petri net models using ATL. The target formalism for the translation is the class of Input-Output Place Transition Nets (IOPT), which extends the well-known low-level Petri net class of Place/Transition Petri nets with input and output signals and events dependencies. Based on this Petri net class, a set of tools have been developed and integrated on a framework for the project of embedded systems using co-design techniques. The main goal is to benefit from the model-based attitude while allowing the integration of development flows based on SysML state machines with the ones based on Petri nets.

TI Panlingual lexical translation via probabilistic inference
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB This paper introduces a novel approach to the task of lexical translation between languages for which no translation dictionaries are available. We build a massive translation graph, automatically constructed from over 630 machine-readable dictionaries and Wiktionaries. In this graph each node denotes a word in some language and each edge (v(i), v(j)) denotes a word sense shared by v(i) and v(j). Our current graph contains over 10,000,000 nodes and expresses more than 60,000,000 pairwise translations.
   The composition of multiple translation dictionaries leads to a transitive inference problem: if word A translates to word B which in turn translates to word C, what is the probability that C is a translation of A? The paper describes a series of probabilistic inference algorithms that solve this problem at varying precision and recall levels. All algorithms enable us to quantify our confidence in a translation derived from the graph, and thus trade precision for recall.
   We compile the results of our best inference algorithm to yield PANDICTIONARY, a novel multilingual dictionary.

TI A Systematic Study of Inner-Attention-Based Sentence Representations in
   Multilingual Neural Machine Translation
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Neural machine translation has considerably improved the quality of automatic translations by learning good representations of input sentences. In this article, we explore a multilingual translation model capable of producing fixed-size sentence representations by incorporating an intermediate crosslingual shared layer, which we refer to as attention bridge. This layer exploits the semantics from each language and develops into a language-agnostic meaning representation that can be efficiently used for transfer learning. We systematically study the impact of the size of the attention bridge and the effect of including additional languages in the model. In contrast to related previous work, we demonstrate that there is no conflict between translation performance and the use of sentence representations in downstream tasks. In particular, we show that larger intermediate layers not only improve translation quality, especially for long sentences, but also push the accuracy of trainable classification tasks. Nevertheless, shorter representations lead to increased compression that is beneficial in non-trainable similarity tasks. Similarly, we show that trainable downstream tasks benefit from multilingual models, whereas additional language signals do not improve performance in non-trainable benchmarks. This is an important insight that helps to properly design models for specific applications. Finally, we also include an in-depth analysis of the proposed attention bridge and its ability to encode linguistic properties. We carefully analyze the information that is captured by individual attention heads and identify interesting patterns that explain the performance of specific settings in linguistic probing tasks.

TI An end-to-end model for cross-lingual transformation of paralinguistic
   information
SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB Speech translation is a technology that helps people communicate across different languages. The most commonly used speech translation model is composed of automatic speech recognition, machine translation and text-to-speech synthesis components, which share information only at the text level. However, spoken communication is different from written communication in that it uses rich acoustic cues such as prosody in order to transmit more information through non-verbal channels. This paper is concerned with speech-to-speech translation that is sensitive to this paralinguistic information. Our long-term goal is to make a system that allows users to speak a foreign language with the same expressiveness as if they were speaking in their own language. Our method works by reconstructing input acoustic features in the target language. From the many different possible paralinguistic features to handle, in this paper we choose duration and power as a first step, proposing a method that can translate these features from input speech to the output speech in continuous space. This is done in a simple and language-independent fashion by training an end-to-end model that maps source-language duration and power information into the target language. Two approaches are investigated: linear regression and neural network models. We evaluate the proposed methods and show that paralinguistic information in the input speech of the source language can be reflected in the output speech of the target language.

AB Homoeopathy is a branch of medical science that treats the ailments with a very different approach when compared with allopathy or other branches of medical science. Its terminology also differs from other branches of medical science. As homoeopathy rests on a basic principle of nature, allopathic or other western methods do not pay any attention to the symptoms of the patient and the medicine is prescribed on the basis of the name of the ailment, whatever are the symptoms? An English-Hindi machine translation (MT) system for the translation of allopathic terminologies requires to translate only the ailment, therapeutic description, name of remedies and doctor's recommendation, but when it comes to translating the homoeopathic contents, necessitate to translate the general symptoms of the patient, ailments, name of medicines, and prescription. In fact the general medical MT system may not use symbols, doctor's prescriptions, symptoms of patient and medicines with potencies (such as Ipecac Q or 30, Ferrum met. 3X, Syphilinum 1M) the way they are used in Homoeopathy. In this paper, we try to explore the structure of homoeopathic language and compare it with the allopathic language which we experienced during the design of English-Hindi MT system for Homoeopathy. The system accuracy has been evaluated using Bleu score found out to be 0.7801 and accuracy percentage of the system is 82.23%, the proposed architecture has shown good results.

TI Broken Time Translation Symmetry as a Model for Quantum State Reduction
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB The symmetries that govern the laws of nature can be spontaneously broken, enabling the occurrence of ordered states. Crystals arise from the breaking of translation symmetry, magnets from broken spin rotation symmetry and massive particles break a phase rotation symmetry. Time translation symmetry can be spontaneously broken in exactly the same way. The order associated with this form of spontaneous symmetry breaking is characterised by the emergence of quantum state reduction: systems which spontaneously break time translation symmetry act as ideal measurement machines. In this review the breaking of time translation symmetry is first compared to that of other symmetries such as spatial translations and rotations. It is then discussed how broken time translation symmetry gives rise to the process of quantum state reduction and how it generates a pointer basis, Born's rule, etc. After a comparison between this model and alternative approaches to the problem of quantum state reduction, the experimental implications and possible tests of broken time translation symmetry in realistic experimental settings are discussed.

AB This paper describes an approach to translate rarely occurring named entities (NE) by combining phonetic and semantic similarities. The phonetic similarity is estimated from a surface string transliteration model, and the semantic similarity is calculated from a context vector semantic model. Given a source (Chinese) NE and its context, this approach first generates queries in the target (English) language according to the context translation hypotheses, then searches for relevant documents from a target language corpus. Target NEs in retrieved documents are compared with the source NE based on their phonetic and contextual semantic similarities, and the best-matched one is selected as the correct translation. Experiments show that this approach achieves 67% accuracy on translating rarely occurring NEs, and consistently improves the translation quality on different tasks over a state-of-the-art statistical machine translation system.

AB We describe an approach that largely automatizes the construction and extension of MT dictionaries. These dictionaries include selectional constraints allowing informed decisions with regard to the selection of translation alternatives. Using an MT system with a rule based core, bilingual corpora are analyzed and syntacto-semantic conditions are extracted that arc useful for the selection of translation alternatives. For illustrative purposes, using the generation module of the MT system the extracted rules can be transformed to explicative examples of usage. In contrast, translation knowledge used by current statistical MT systems is usually not well suited to be prepared for human inspection. Of particular importance for our approach is the underspecified semantic representation which is the level of analysis to be used for the formulation of all translation relations. The approach is currently being investigated using components of Lingenio's MT system translate.

AB The majority of current researches in Machine Translation field are focalized essentially on spoken languages. The aim is to find a most likely translation for a given source sentence based on statistical learning techniques which are applied to very big parallel corpora. In this work, we focused on gesture languages especially on Sign Language in order to present a new methodological foundation for Sign Language Machine Translation. Our approach is based on Kernel Regression combined to Kernel Density Estimation method applied to Sign Language n-grams. The translation process is modelled as an n-gram to n-gram mapping with the consideration of the n-gram positions in the source and the target phrases. For doing so, we propose a new feature mapping process (Weighted Sub n-gram Feature Mapping) which is a modified version of the String Subsequence Kernel SSK feature mapping. The Weighted Sub n-gram aims to generate feature vectors mapping of both source and target n-gram. Afterwards, to learn the function that map source n-grams to target n-grams, we used and compared four learning techniques (Gaussian Process Regressor, K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor, Support Vector Regressor with Gaussian Kernel and Kernel Ridge Regression) for the purpose to choose the efficient one which minimizes the SSE (Sum of Squared Error). Even so, to find solution to the pre-image problem, we rely on the De-Bruijn Multi Graph search applied on n-grams target. For the purpose to obtain the best translation, we relied on the search of the most frequently observed bilingual n-gram alignment in term of the maximization of the translation probability. For unknown n-grams, we used kernel ridge regression for the purpose to predict the probability through learning the Density Estimation function of the bilingual n-grams alignments. We obtained encouraging experimental results on a small-scale reduced-domain corpus.

AB Word Sense Disambiguation is the most critical issue in machine translation. Although it has been addressed by many researchers, no satisfactory results are reported. Rule based systems alone can not handle this issue due to ambiguous nature of the natural language. Knowledge-based systems are therefore essential to find the intended sense of a word form. Machine readable dictionaries have been widely used in word sense disambiguation. The problem with this approach is that the dictionary entries for the target words are very short. WordNet is the most developed and widely used lexical database for English. The entries are always updated and many tools are available to access the database on all sorts of platforms. The WordNet database can be converted in MySQL format and we have modified it as per our requirement. Sense's definitions of the specific word, "Synset" definitions, the "Hypernymy" relation, and definitions of the context features (words in the same sentence) are retrieved from the WordNet database and used as an input of our Disambiguation algorithm.

TI Semantic graph for word disambiguation in machine translation
SO MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB This work is an attempt to incorporate semantic context in machine translation using a combination of parallel corpora as well as feedback from human translators. Both parallel corpora and human translators help in determining what constitute keywords/key phrases that help in the disambiguation of words or phrases that lend themselves to multiple possible meanings. The disambiguation process uses a probabilistic language model that captures the dependencies of ambiguous words/phrases on those keywords/phrases through parametric conditional probabilities, with their parameters estimated using parallel corpora data. These are augmented via human translator feedbacks using an interface that maps the degree of confidence (a measure between 0 and 1, with 1 being 100% certainty about the word disambiguation) of the human translator in the disambiguation of a word/phrase into updated language model parameters. The disambiguation is made in accordance with the most probable meaning based on the keywords/phrases. This work also presents an iterative relaxation algorithm to disambiguate multiple words in one sentence by obtaining the translation with the highest joint probability. Experimental results using our model and method are reported on testbeds in the medical and literary fiction domains and our results fare more than favorably when compared to the state-of-the-art Neural Network (NN) based Word Sense Disambiguation approach. Our method goes beyond NN learning by extracting and modeling the essential semantic elements in the original language to faithfully capture the meaning of the source text.

TI SANSUNL: A Sanskrit to UNL Enconverter System
SO IETE JOURNAL OF RESEARCH
AB Machine translation has become the most challenging as well as demanding field of research and as a result, to develop a fully automatic 100% correct machine translation system has not been achieved till date. More than 7000 of languages are being used worldwide for communication purposes and in India alone 22 languages have been recognized as official languages for communication purposes. Various efforts have been made to solve this problem by different researchers using different approaches. With the enhancement in technology and internet, automatic translation has become more important to share the knowledge. The authors in this paper described a mechanism of translation using machines for one of the ancient Indian Language Sanskrit to the latest computer understandable language Universal Networking Language (UNL). The proposed system uses two databases: one for the analysis purpose consists of more than 300 rules and the other for the generation of UNL which consists of about 1500 rules. For the performance evaluation, the authors selected 500 Sanskrit sentences in such a way that covers maximum UNL relations from various sources. The sentences are manually converted from English to Sanskrit language taken from Spanish Language center, Hindi to English language taken from IIT Bombay Hindi-UNL expressions and NCERT class 8th Sanskrit book titled "Ruchita Part 3". The proposed system achieves a BLEU score of 0.85. The proposed system gives 93.18% efficiency in resolving UNL relation successfully.

AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) tends to perform poorly in low-resource language settings due to the scarcity of parallel data. Instead of relying on inadequate parallel corpora, we can take advantage of monolingual data available in abundance. Training a denoising self-supervised multilingual sequence-to-sequence model by noising the available large scale monolingual corpora is one way to utilize monolingual data. For a pair of languages for which monolingual data is available in such a pre-trained multilingual denoising model, the model can be fine-tuned with a smaller amount of parallel data from this language pair. This paper presents fine-tuning self-supervised multilingual sequence-to-sequence pre-trained models for extremely low-resource domain-specific NMT settings. We choose one such pre-trained model: mBART. We are the first to implement and demonstrate the viability of non-English centric complete fine-tuning on multilingual sequence-to-sequence pretrained models. We select Sinhala, Tamil and English languages to demonstrate fine-tuning on extremely low-resource settings in the domain of official government documents. Experiments show that our fine-tuned mBART model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art Transformer based NMT models in all pairs in all six bilingual directions, where we report a 4.41 BLEU score increase on Tamil -> Sinhala and a 2.85 BLUE increase on Sinhala -> Tamil translation.

SO INFORMATICS-BASEL
AB The recent arrival on the market of high-performing neural MT engines will likely lead to a profound transformation of the translation profession. The purpose of this study is to explore how this paradigm change impacts the post-editing process, with a focus on lexico-grammatical patterns that are used in the communication of specialized knowledge. A corpus of 109 medical abstracts pre-translated from English into French by the neural MT engine DeepL and post-edited by master's students in translation was used to study potential distortions in the translation of lexico-grammatical patterns. The results suggest that neural MT leads to specific sources of distortion in the translation of these patterns, not unlike what has previously been observed in human translation. These observations highlight the need to pay particular attention to lexico-grammatical patterns when post-editing neural MT in order to achieve functional equivalence in the translation of specialized texts.

AB Pivot methods have shown to be an effective solution to overcome the problem of unavailable large bilingual corpora in statistical machine translation. The representative approach of pivot methods is the phrase pivot translation which is based on common pivot phrases to produce connections between source-pivot and pivot-target phrase tables. Nevertheless, this approach produces insufficient connections behind the phrase tables because pivot phrases still contain the same meaning even when they are not matched to each other. In this work, we propose applying semantic similarity between pivot phrases to phrase pivot translation. In order to extract similar pivot phrases, we used string similarity measures for phrase similarity, and WordNet and Word2Vec were used for word similarity. The experiments show that using semantic similarity is able to extract more informative phrases, which can support for phrase pivot translation.

However, the approach used for emphasis translation is not optimal for sequence translation tasks and fails to easily handle the long-term dependencies of words and emphasis levels. It also requires the quantization of emphasis levels and treats them asdiscrete labels instead of continuous values. Moreover, the whole translation pipeline is fairly complexand slow because all components are trained separately without joint optimization. In this paper, we make two contributions: 1) we propose an approach that can handle continuous emphasis levels based on sequence-to-sequence models, and 2) we combine machine and emphasis translation into a single model, which greatly simplifies the translation pipeline and make it easier to perform joint optimization. Our results on an emphasis translation task indicate that our translation models outperform previous models by a large margin in both objective and subjective tests. Experiments on a joint translation model also show that our models can perform joint translation of words and emphasis with one-word delays instead of full-sentence delays while preserving the translation performance of both tasks.

The method is based on the research about English training corpus, first of all, we use statistical methods extract feature words in English, and use machine translation tools build an "English-Chinese" feature word bank. Then, we put forward a feature word weighting method which combined TF-IDF with sentimental intensity of sentiment words, after that, we constructed a vector space model. Finally, we optimized the Support Vector Machine classification model by using a joint training set. Experimental results show the effectiveness of this method.

AB Despite the improvement of translation quality, neural machine translation (NMT) often suffers from the lack of diversity in its generation. In this paper, we propose to generate diverse translations by deriving a large number of possible models with Bayesian modelling and sampling models from them for inference. The possible models are obtained by applying concrete dropout to the NMT model and each of them has specific confidence for its prediction, which corresponds to a posterior model distribution under specific training data in the principle of Bayesian modeling. With variational inference, the posterior model distribution can be approximated with a variational distribution, from which the final models for inference are sampled. We conducted experiments on Chinese-English and English-German translation tasks and the results shows that our method makes a better trade-off between diversity and accuracy.

TI The Use of Automated Machine Translation to Translate Figurative
   Language in a Clinical Setting: Analysis of a Convenience Sample of
   Patients Drawn From a Randomized Controlled Trial
SO JMIR MENTAL HEALTH
AB Background: Patients with limited English proficiency frequently receive substandard health care. Asynchronous telepsychiatry (ATP) has been established as a clinically valid method for psychiatric assessments. The addition of automated speech recognition (ASR) and automated machine translation (AMT) technologies to asynchronous telepsychiatry may be a viable artificial intelligence (AI)-language interpretation option.Objective: This project measures the frequency and accuracy of the translation of figurative language devices (FLDs) and patient word count per minute, in a subset of psychiatric interviews from a larger trial, as an approximation to patient speech complexity and quantity in clinical encounters that require interpretation.Methods: A total of 6 patients were selected from the original trial, where they had undergone 2 assessments, once by an English-speaking psychiatrist through a Spanish-speaking human interpreter and once in Spanish by a trained mental health interviewer-researcher with AI interpretation. 3 (50%) of the 6 selected patients were interviewed via videoconferencing because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Interview transcripts were created by automated speech recognition with manual corrections for transcriptional accuracy and assessment for translational accuracy of FLDs.Results: AI-interpreted interviews were found to have a significant increase in the use of FLDs and patient word count per minute. Both human and AI-interpreted FLDs were frequently translated inaccurately, however FLD translation may be more accurate on videoconferencing.Conclusions: AI interpretation is currently not sufficiently accurate for use in clinical settings. However, this study suggests that alternatives to human interpretation are needed to circumvent modifications to patients' speech. While AI interpretation technologies are being further developed, using videoconferencing for human interpreting may be more accurate than in-person interpreting.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03538860; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03538860(JMIR Ment Health 2022;9(9):e39556) doi: 10.2196/39556

TI Exploiting Morphology and Local Word Reordering in English-to-Turkish
   Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB In this paper, we present the results of our work on the development of a phrase-based statistical machine translation prototype from English to Turkish-an agglutinative language with very productive inflectional and derivational morphology. We experiment with different morpheme-level representations for English-Turkish parallel texts. Additionally, to help with word alignment, we experiment with local word reordering on the English side, to bring the word order of specific English prepositional phrases and auxiliary verb complexes, in line with the morpheme order of the corresponding case-marked nouns and complex verbs, on the Turkish side. To alleviate the dearth of the parallel data available, we also augment the training data with sentences just with content word roots obtained from the original training data to bias root word alignment, and with highly reliable phrase-pairs from an earlier corpus alignment. We use a morpheme-based language model in decoding and a word-based language model in re-ranking the n-best lists generated by the decoder. Lastly, we present a scheme for repairing the decoder output by correcting words which have incorrect morphological structure or which are out-of-vocabulary with respect to the training data and language model, to further improve the translations. We improve from 15.53 BLEU points for our word-based baseline model to 25.17 BLEU points for an improvement of 9.64 points or about 62% relative.

AB Technological for the purpose of interlingual communication has gone through tremendous changes because of mechanical progressions. The significance of two important technological advancements in current translation is as follows: PC helped translation apparatuses and machine translation, which is talked about in this article. These innovations have further developed translation efficiency and quality, supported overall communication, and underlined the developing requirement for state-of-the-art specialized answers for the deep rooted challenge of language boundaries. These instruments, then again, give extensive obstacles and vulnerability to the deciphering calling and industry. People have proposed new standards for several disciplines and their own lifestyles based on computer technology. Because of its significant data advantage, network information technology plays a key role in traditional language translation. Thus, it is basic to comprehend how to more readily involve network data assets in the Japanese translation process, as well as to investigate changes in network data assets and merge the commonsense headway of the Japanese translation process, in light of the significant issue of Japanese learning and exploration.

AB Using statistical machine translation (SMT) for dialectal varieties usually suffers from data sparsity, but combining word-level and character-level models can yield good results even with small training data by exploiting the relative proximity between the two varieties. In this paper, we describe a specific problem and its solution, arising with the translation between standard Austrian German and Viennese dialect. In general, for a phrase-based approach to SMT, complex lexical transformations and syntactic reordering cannot be dealt with satisfyingly. In a situation with sparse resources it becomes merely impossible. These are typical cases where rule-based preprocessing of the source data is the preferable option, hence the hybrid character of the resulting system. One such case is the transformation between synthetic imperfect verb forms to perfect tense with finite auxiliary and past participle, which involves detection of clause boundaries and identification of clause type. We present an approach that utilizes a full parse of the source sentences and discuss the problems that arise using such an approach. Within the developed SMT system, the models trained on preprocessed data unsurprisingly fare better than those trained on the original data, but also unchanged sentences gain slightly better scores. This shows that introducing a rule-based layer dealing with systematic non-local transformations increases the overall performance of the system, most probably due to a higher accuracy in the alignment.

TI Attention-Passing Models for Robust and Data-Efficient End-to-End Speech
   Translation
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Speech translation has traditionally been approached through cascaded models consisting of a speech recognizer trained on a corpus of transcribed speech, and a machine translation system trained on parallel texts. Several recent works have shown the feasibility of collapsing the cascade into a single, direct model that can be trained in an end-to-end fashion on a corpus of translated speech. However, experiments are inconclusive on whether the cascade or the direct model is stronger, and have only been conducted under the unrealistic assumption that both are trained on equal amounts of data, ignoring other available speech recognition and machine translation corpora.
   In this paper, we demonstrate that direct speech translation models require more data to perform well than cascaded models, and although they allow including auxiliary data through multi-task training, they are poor at exploiting such data, putting them at a severe disadvantage. As a remedy, we propose the use of endto-end trainable models with two attention mechanisms, the first establishing source speech to source text alignments, the second modeling source to target text alignment. We show that such models naturally decompose into multitask-trainable recognition and translation tasks and propose an attention-passing technique that alleviates error propagation issues in a previous formulation of a model with two attention stages. Our proposed model outperforms all examined baselines and is able to exploit auxiliary training data much more effectively than direct attentional models.

TI Translation Divergences in Chinese-English Machine Translation: An
   Empirical Investigation
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB In this article, we conduct an empirical investigation of translation divergences between Chinese and English relying on a parallel treebank. To do this, we first devise a hierarchical alignment scheme where Chinese and English parse trees are aligned in a way that eliminates conflicts and redundancies between word alignments and syntactic parses to prevent the generation of spurious translation divergences. Using this Hierarchically Aligned Chinese-English Parallel Treebank (HACEPT), we are able to semi-automatically identify and categorize the translation divergences between the two languages and quantify each type of translation divergence. Our results show that the translation divergences are much broader than described in previous studies that are largely based on anecdotal evidence and linguistic knowledge. The distribution of the translation divergences also shows that some high-profile translation divergences that motivate previous research are actually very rare in our data, whereas other translation divergences that have previously received little attention actually exist in large quantities. We also show that HACEPT allows the extraction of syntax-based translation rules, most of which are expressive enough to capture the translation divergences, and point out that the syntactic annotation in existing treebanks is not optimal for extracting such translation rules. We also discuss the implications of our study for attempts to bridge translation divergences by devising shared semantic representations across languages. Our quantitative results lend further support to the observation that although it is possible to bridge some translation divergences with semantic representations, other translation divergences are open-ended, thus building a semantic representation that captures all possible translation divergences may be impractical.

This work presents an overview of kinematic constraints, which are important for the offline programming of industrial robots for the use in machining applications. The three possible solutions for overcoming kinematic constraints (end-effector rotation, part translation, and part rotation) are presented. The computer algorithm for avoiding such constraints was developed, programmed and tested with a case study. Results show that kinematic constraints can be automatically avoided by implementation of developed avoidance algorithm into the offline programming software for robotic machining.

AB Word formation via compounding is a very widely observed but quite diverse phenomenon across the world's languages, but the compositional semantics of a compound are often productively correlated between even distant languages. Using only freely available bilingual dictionaries and no annotated training data, we derive novel models for analyzing compound words and effectively generate novel foreign-language translations of English concepts using these models. In addition, we release a massively multilingual dataset of compound words along with their decompositions, covering over 21,000 instances in 329 languages, a previously unprecedented scale which should both productively support machine translation (especially in low resource languages) and also facilitate researchers in their further analysis and modeling of compounds and compound processes across the world's languages.

Further, in ablations, we show the benefits of both quantity and diversity in augmented data. Finally, we show that we can combine our approach with augmentation by machine-translated transcripts to obtain a competitive end-to-end AST model that outperforms a very strong cascade model on an English-French AST task. Our method is sufficiently general that it can be applied to other speech generation and analysis tasks.

AB Non-autoregressive Transformers (NATs) significantly reduce the decoding latency by generating all tokens in parallel. However, such independent predictions prevent NATs from capturing the dependencies between the tokens for generating multiple possible translations. In this paper, we propose Directed Acyclic Transfomer (DA-Transformer), which represents the hidden states in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), where each path of the DAG corresponds to a specific translation. The whole DAG simultaneously captures multiple translations and facilitates fast predictions in a non-autoregressive fashion. Experiments on the raw training data of WMT benchmark show that DA-Transformer substantially outperforms previous NATs by about 3 BLEU on average, which is the first NAT model that achieves competitive results with autoregressive Transformers without relying on knowledge distillation.

AB Many corpus-based machine translation systems require parallel corpora. In this paper, we present a word-for-word glossing algorithm that requires only a source language corpus. To gloss a word, we first identify its similar words that occurred in the same context in a large corpus. We then determine the gloss by maximizing the similarity between the set of contextually similar words and the different translations of the word in a bilingual thesaurus.

TI Retrosynthesis pre diction using grammar-base d neural machine
   translation: An information-theoretic approach
SO COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Retrosynthetic prediction is one of the main challenges in chemical synthesis because it requires a search over the space of plausible chemical reactions that often results in complex, multi-step, branched synthesis trees for even moderately complex organic reactions. Here, we propose an approach that performs single-step retrosynthesis prediction using SMILES grammar-based representations in a neural machine translation framework. Information-theoretic analyses of such grammar-representations reveal that they are superior to SMILES representations and are better-suited for machine learning tasks due to their underlying redundancy and high information capacity. We report the top-1 prediction accuracy of 43 . 8% (syntactic validity 95 . 6% ) and maximal fragment (MaxFrag) accuracy of 50 . 4% . Comparing our model's performance with previous work that used character-based SMILES representations demonstrate significant reduction in grammatically invalid predictions and improved prediction accuracy. Fewer invalid predictions for both known and unknown reaction class scenarios demonstrate the model's ability to learn the underlying SMILES grammar efficiently. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Black-box machine translation systems have proven incredibly useful for a variety of applications yet by design are hard to adapt, tune to a specific domain, or build on top of. In this work, we introduce a method to improve such systems via automatic pre-processing (APP) using sentence simplification. We first propose a method to automatically generate a large in-domain paraphrase corpus through back-translation with a black-box MT system, which is used to train a paraphrase model that "simplifies" the original sentence to be more conducive for translation. The model is used to preprocess source sentences of multiple low-resource language pairs. We show that this preprocessing leads to better translation performance as compared to non-preprocessed source sentences. We further perform side-by-side human evaluation to verify that translations of the simplified sentences are better than the original ones. Finally, we provide some guidance on recommended language pairs for generating the simplification model corpora by investigating the relationship between ease of translation of a language pair (as measured by BLEU) and quality of the resulting simplification model from back-translations of this language pair (as measured by SARI), and tie this into the downstream task of low-resource translation.

TI Context-aware positional representation for self-attention networks q
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
AB In self-attention networks (SANs), positional embeddings are used to model order dependencies between words in the input sentence and are added with word embeddings to gain an input representation, which enables the SAN-based neural model to perform (multi-head) and to stack (multi-layer) self-attentive functions in parallel to learn the representation of the input sentence. However, this input representation only involves static order dependencies based on discrete position indexes of words, that is, is independent of context information, which may be weak in modeling the input sentence. To address this issue, we proposed a novel positional representation method to model order dependencies based on n-gram context or sentence context in the input sentence, which allows SANs to learn a more effective sentence representation. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, it is applied to the neural machine translation model, which adopts a typical SAN-based neural model. Experimental results on two widely used translation tasks, i.e., WMT14 English-to-German and WMT17 Chinese-to-English, showed that the proposed approach can significantly improve the translation performance over the strong Transformer baseline.

AB Neural Networks trained with gradient descent are known to be susceptible to catastrophic forgetting caused by parameter shift during the training process. In the context of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) this results in poor performance on heterogeneous datasets and on sub-tasks like rare phrase translation. On the other hand, non-parametric approaches are immune to forgetting, perfectly complementing the generalization ability of NMT. However, attempts to combine non-parametric or retrieval based approaches with NMT have only been successful on narrow domains, possibly due to over-reliance on sentence level retrieval. We propose a novel n-gram level retrieval approach that relies on local phrase level similarities, allowing us to retrieve neighbors that are useful for translation even when overall sentence similarity is low. We complement this with an expressive neural network, allowing our model to extract information from the noisy retrieved context. We evaluate our semi-parametric NMT approach on a heterogeneous dataset composed of WMT, IWSLT, JRC-Acquis and OpenSubtitles, and demonstrate gains on all 4 evaluation sets. The semi-parametric nature of our approach opens the door for non-parametric domain adaptation, demonstrating strong inference-time adaptation performance on new domains without the need for any parameter updates.

In this paper, we present an English/Iraqi Arabic speech-to-speech translation system for the military force protection domain (checkpoints, municipal services surveys, basic descriptions of people, houses, vehicles, etc). The system combines statistical N-gram speech recognition, statistical machine translation, hand-crafted rules, and speech synthesis in order to translate between the two languages. The system is designed for "eyes-free", or "displayless" use. That is, it does not make use of a screen, mouse, or keyboard, but is instead operated by a handheld microphone with just two push buttons: one for English, and the other for Arabic.

TI A survey on Sign Language machine translation
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB Sign Languages (SLs) are employed by deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) people to communicate on a daily basis. However, the communication with hearing people still faces some barriers, mainly because of the scarce knowledge about SLs among hearing people. Hence, tools to allow the communication between users of either sign or spoken languages must be encouraged. A stepping stone in this direction is the research of the sign language translation (SLT) task, which aims to produce a spoken language translation of a sign language video or vice versa. By implementing these types of translators in portable devices, we will make considerable progress towards a barrier-free communication between DHH and hearing people. That is why, in this work, we focus on reviewing the literature on SLT and provide the necessary background about SLs. Besides, we summarise the available datasets and the results found in the literature for one of the most used datasets, the RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T. Moreover, the survey lists the challenges that need to be tackled within the SLT research and also for the adoption of SLT technologies, and proposes future research lines.

TI Searching for Translated Plagiarism with the Help of Desktop Grids
SO JOURNAL OF GRID COMPUTING
AB Translated or cross-lingual plagiarism is defined as the translation of someone else's work or words without marking it as such or without giving credit to the original author. The existence of cross-lingual plagiarism is not new, but only in recent years, due to the rapid development of the natural language processing, appeared the first algorithms which tackled the difficult task of detecting it. Most of these algorithms utilize machine translation to compare texts written in different languages. We propose a different method, which can effectively detect translations between language-pairs where machine translations still produce low quality results. Our new algorithm presented in this paper is based on information retrieval (IR) and a dictionary based similarity metric. The preprocessing of the candidate documents for the IR is computationally intensive, but easily parallelizable. We propose a desktop Grid solution for this task. As the application is time sensitive and the desktop Grid peers are unreliable, a resubmission mechanism is used which assures that all jobs of a batch finish within a reasonable time period without dramatically increasing the load on the whole system.

AB The paper presents the development, by using the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL, of a compiler back-end translating from a functional source language to the bytecode language of an abstract machine. The Haskell code of the compiler is extracted from the Isabelle/HOL specification and this tool is also used for proving tyre correctness of the implementation. The main correctness theorem riot only ensures functional semantics preservation but also resource consumption preservation: the heap and stacks figures predicted by the semantics are confirmed in the translation to the abstract machine.
   The language and the development belong to a wider Proof Carrying Code framework in which formal compiler-generated certificates about memory consumption are sought for.

AB We present a discriminative model that directly predicts which set of phrasal translation rules should be extracted from a sentence pair. Our model scores extraction sets: nested collections of all the overlapping phrase pairs consistent with an underlying word alignment. Extraction set models provide two principle advantages over word-factored alignment models. First, we can incorporate features on phrase pairs, in addition to word links. Second, we can optimize for an extraction-based loss function that relates directly to the end task of generating translations. Our model gives improvements in alignment quality relative to state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised baselines, as well as providing up to a 1.4 improvement in BLEU score in Chinese-to-English translation experiments.

AB A novel distributed language model that has no constraints on the n-grarn order and no practical constraints on vocabulary size is presented. This model is scalable and allows for an arbitrarily large corpus to be queried for statistical estimates. Our distributed model is capable of producing n-gram counts on demand. By using a novel heuristic estimate for the interpolation weights of a linearly interpolated model, it is possible to dynamically compute the language model probabilities. The distributed architecture follows the client-server paradigm and allows for each client to request an arbitrary weighted mixture of the corpus. This allows easy adaptation of the language model to particular test conditions. Experiments using the distributed LM for re-ranking N-best lists of a speech recognition system resulted in considerable improvements in word error rate (WER), while integration with a machine translation decoder resulted in significant improvements in translation quality as measured by the BLEU score.

AB Japanese and Chinese are very different in syntactic structure, while their adnominal construction is quite similar. A head noun comes after the modifier, and a particle "no((sic))" (Japanese) or "de((sic))" (Chinese) used (or not used) between the modifier and the head noun, where the modifier can be a noun, an adjective and a verbal clause etc, and the head noun can be a substantial noun or a non-substantial noun. But the usage of "no((sic))" and "de((sic))" is not identical, they do not correspond one to one. This causes a difficult problem in translating an adnominal construction in Japanese-Chinese machine translation. In this paper, focusing the disambiguation between "no" and "de", we propose a rule for translating an adnominal construction in Japanese-Chinese MT. The rule proposed was evaluated both in our jaw/Chinese MT system and by manual in a small-scale, and got an accuracy of about 95% and 94% respectively.

AB This paper discusses a new approach to the fundamental problem of learning optimal Q-functions. In this approach, optimal Q-functions are formulated as saddle points of a nonlinear Lagrangian function derived from the classic Bellman optimality equation. The paper shows that the Lagrangian enjoys strong duality, in spite of its nonlinearity, which paves the way to a general Lagrangian method to Q-function learning. As a demonstration, the paper develops an imitation learning algorithm based on the duality theory, and applies the algorithm to a state-of-the-art machine translation benchmark. The paper then turns to demonstrate a symmetry breaking phenomenon regarding the optimality of the Lagrangian saddle points, which justifies a largely overlooked direction in developing the Lagrangian method.

AB Non-autoregressive machine translation models significantly speed up decoding by allowing for parallel prediction of the entire target sequence. However, modeling word order is more challenging due to the lack of autoregressive factors in the model. This difficultly is compounded during training with cross entropy loss, which can highly penalize small shifts in word order. In this paper, we propose aligned cross entropy (AXE) as an alternative loss function for training of non-autoregressive models. AXE uses a differentiable dynamic program to assign loss based on the best possible monotonic alignment between target tokens and model predictions. AXE-based training of conditional masked language models (CMLMs) substantially improves performance on major WMT benchmarks, while setting a new state of the art for non-autoregressive models.

We propose a new technique to filter non parallel articles in Wikipedia based on Zipfian frequency distribution. We also use the SVM approach to find parallel chunks of text in a candidate comparable document. In our approach we use a parallel corpus to generate the required features for the training step. The evaluations of generated bilingual texts are promising.

AB Neural network language models are often trained by optimizing likelihood, but we would prefer to optimize for a task specific metric, such as BLEU in machine translation. We show how a recurrent neural network language model can be optimized towards an expected BLEU loss instead of the usual cross-entropy criterion. Furthermore, we tackle the issue of directly integrating a recurrent network into first-pass decoding under an efficient approximation. Our best results improve a phrase-based statistical machine translation system trained on WMT 2012 French-English data by up to 2.0 BLEU, and the expected BLEU objective improves over a cross-entropy trained model by up to 0.6 BLEU in a single reference setup.

AB Brain-machine interface (BMI) devices have unparalleled potential to restore functional movement capabilities to stroke, paralyzed and amputee patients. Although BMI systems have achieved success in a handful of investigative studies, translation of closed-loop neuroprosthetic devices from the laboratory to the market is challenged by gaps in the scientific data regarding long-term device reliability and safety, uncertainty in the regulatory, market and reimbursement pathways, lack of metrics for evaluating and quantifying performance in BMI systems, as well as patient-acceptance challenges that impede their fast and effective translation to the end user. This review focuses on the identification of engineering, clinical and user's BMI metrics for new and existing BMI applications.

TI Misalignment Detection for Web-Scraped Corpora: A Supervised Regression
   Approach
SO INFORMATICS-BASEL
AB To build state-of-the-art Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems, high-quality parallel sentences are needed. Typically, large amounts of data are scraped from multilingual web sites and aligned into datasets for training. Many tools exist for automatic alignment of such datasets. However, the quality of the resulting aligned corpus can be disappointing. In this paper, we present a tool for automatic misalignment detection (MAD). We treated the task of determining whether a pair of aligned sentences constitutes a genuine translation as a supervised regression problem. We trained our algorithm on a manually labeled dataset in the FR-NL language pair. Our algorithm used shallow features and features obtained after an initial translation step. We showed that both the Levenshtein distance between the target and the translated source, as well as the cosine distance between sentence embeddings of the source and the target were the two most important features for the task of misalignment detection. Using gold standards for alignment, we demonstrated that our model can increase the quality of alignments in a corpus substantially, reaching a precision close to 100%. Finally, we used our tool to investigate the effect of misalignments on NMT performance.

TI Machine translation in higher education: Perceptions, policy, and
   pedagogy
SO TESOL JOURNAL
AB Multiple studies have shown that language learners and other students undertaking postsecondary studies in an additional language (L2) consult digital translation tools to complete course-related work despite general disapproval of their use by instructors. Significant improvements in the accuracy of machine translation (MT) along with their widespread use among students present ethical and pedagogical implications that have yet to be coherently addressed by instructors and institutions at the tertiary level. Recognizing MT as inextricable from L2 users' academic realities, this article reviews the current research on perceptions and purposes of its use in higher education institutions, discusses MT at the policy level (e.g., gaps in legislation related to academic integrity and, more broadly, inconsistencies between the aims of internationalization and the continued delegitimization of marginalized varieties of English), outlines various ways that MT can be harnessed to support learning (e.g., for vocabulary acquisition, writing, metalinguistic awareness, learner autonomy), and suggests ways forward in education, research, and theory on the intersection of MT and learning.

AB We propose a translation recommendation framework to integrate Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) output with Translation Memory (TM) systems. The framework recommends SMT outputs to a TM user when it predicts that SMT outputs are more suitable for post-editing than the hits provided by the TM. We describe an implementation of this framework using an SVM binary classifier. We exploit methods to fine-tune the classifier and investigate a variety of features of different types. We rely on automatic MT evaluation metrics to approximate human judgements in our experiments. Experimental results show that our system can achieve 0.85 precision at 0.89 recall, excluding exact matches. Furthermore, it is possible for the end-user to achieve a desired balance between precision and recall by adjusting confidence levels.

AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has become a popular technology in recent years, and beam search is its de facto decoding method due to the shrunk search space and reduced computational complexity. However, since it only searches for local optima at each time step through one-step forward looking, it usually cannot output the best target sentence. Inspired by the success and methodology of AlphaGo, in this paper we propose using a prediction network to improve beam search, which takes the source sentence x, the currently available decoding output y(1), ...,y(t-1) and a candidate word w at step t as inputs and predicts the long-term value (e.g., BLEU score) of the partial target sentence if it is completed by the NMT model. Following the practice in reinforcement learning, we call this prediction network value network. Specifically, we propose a recurrent structure for the value network, and train its parameters from bilingual data. During the test time, when choosing a word w for decoding, we consider both its conditional probability given by the NMT model and its long-term value predicted by the value network. Experiments show that such an approach can significantly improve the translation accuracy on several translation tasks.

TI A generalised alignment template formalism and its application to the
   inference of shallow-transfer machine translation rules from scarce
   bilingual corpora
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB Statistical and rule-based methods are complementary approaches to machine translation (MT) that have different strengths and weaknesses. This complementarity has, over the last few years, resulted in the consolidation of a growing interest in hybrid systems that combine both data-driven and linguistic approaches. In this paper, we address the situation in which the amount of bilingual resources that is available for a particular language pair is not sufficiently large to train a competitive statistical MT system, but the cost and slow development cycles of rule-based MT systems cannot be afforded either. In this context, we formalise a new method that uses scarce parallel corpora to automatically infer a set of shallow-transfer rules to be integrated into a rule-based MT system, thus avoiding the need for human experts to handcraft these rules.
   Our work is based on the alignment template approach to phrase-based statistical MT, but the definition of the alignment template is extended to encompass different generalisation levels. It is also greatly inspired by the work of Sanchez-Martinez and Forcada (2009) in which alignment templates were also considered for shallow-transfer rule inference. However, our approach overcomes many relevant limitations of that work, principally those related to the inability to find the correct generalisation level for the alignment templates, and to select the subset of alignment templates that ensures an adequate segmentation of the input sentences by the rules eventually obtained. Unlike previous approaches in literature, our formalism does not require linguistic knowledge about the languages involved in the translation. Moreover, it is the first time that conflicts between rules are resolved by choosing the most appropriate ones according to a global minimisation function rather than proceeding in a pairwise greedy fashion.
   Experiments conducted using five different language pairs with the free/open-source rule-based MT platform Apertium show that translation quality significantly improves when compared to the method proposed by Sanchez-Martinez and Forcada (2009), and is close to that obtained using handcrafted rules. For some language pairs, our approach is even able to outperform them. Moreover, the resulting number of rules is considerably smaller, which eases human revision and maintenance.

AB Recent NLP studies reveal that substantial linguistic information can be attributed to single neurons, i.e., individual dimensions of the representation vectors. We hypothesize that modeling strong interactions among neurons helps to better capture complex information by composing the linguistic properties embedded in individual neurons. Starting from this intuition, we propose a novel approach to compose representations learned by different components in neural machine translation (e.g., multi-layer networks or multi-head attention), based on modeling strong interactions among neurons in the representation vectors. Specifically, we leverage bilinear pooling to model pairwise multiplicative interactions among individual neurons, and a low-rank approximation to make the model computationally feasible. We further propose extended bilinear pooling to incorporate first-order representations. Experiments on WMT14 English double right arrow German and English double right arrow French translation tasks show that our model consistently improves performances over the SOTA TRANSFORMER baseline. Further analyses demonstrate that our approach indeed captures more syntactic and semantic information as expected.

TI Hierarchical Semantic-Category-Tree Model for Chinese-English Machine
   Translation
SO CHINA COMMUNICATIONS
AB We introduce a novel Semantic-Category-Tree (SCT) model to present the semantic structure of a sentence for Chinese-English Machine Translation (MT). We use the SCT model to handle the reordering in a hierarchical structure in which one reordering is dependent on the others. Different from other reordering approaches, we handle the reordering at three levels: sentence level, chunk level, and word level. The chunk-level reordering is dependent on the sentence-level reordering, and the word-level reordering is dependent on the chunk-level reordering. In this paper, we formally describe the SCT model and discuss the translation strategy based on the SOT model. Further, we present an algorithm for analyzing the source language in KT and transforming the source SCT into the target SCT. We apply the SCT model to a rule-based patent text MT to evaluate the ability of the SCT model. The experimental results show that SCT is efficient in handling the hierarchical reordering operation in MT.

TI A novel framework for image-to-image translation and image compression
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
AB Data-driven paradigms using machine learning are becoming ubiquitous in image processing and communications. In particular, image-to-image (I2I) translation is a generic and widely used approach to image processing problems, such as image synthesis, style transfer, and image restoration. At the same time, neural image compression has emerged as a data-driven alternative to traditional coding approaches in visual communications. In this paper, we study the combination of these two paradigms into a joint I2I compression and translation framework, focusing on multi-domain image synthesis. We first propose distributed I2I translation by integrating quantization and entropy coding into an I2I translation framework (i.e. I2Icodec). In practice, the image compression functionality (i.e. autoencoding) is also desirable, requiring to deploy alongside I2Icodec a regular image codec. Thus, we further propose a unified framework that allows both translation and autoencoding capabilities in a single codec. Adaptive residual blocks conditioned on the translation/compression mode provide flexible adaptation to the desired functionality. The experiments show promising results in both I2I translation and image compression using a single model. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Translation quality estimation (QE) has been attracting increasing attention due to its potential to reduce post-editing human effort. However, QE still suffers heavily from the problem that the quality annotation data remain expensive and small. In this paper, we focus on overcoming the limitation of QE data and explore to utilize the high level latent features learned by the pretrained language models to reduce the model's dependence on QE data and improve QE performance. Specifically, we propose two strategies to integrate the pre-trained language features into QE model: (1) a mixed integration model, where the pre-trained language features are fed into the QE mode combined with other features; and (2) a constrained integration model, where a constraint mechanism is used to adjust the reporting bias of our first integration model and enhance the robustness of the QE model. Experimental results on WMT17 QE task demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.

AB Humans can learn multiple languages. If they know a fact in one language, they can answer a question in another language they understand. They can also answer Code-mix (CM) questions: questions which contain both languages. This ability is attributed to the unique learning ability of humans. Our task aims to study if machines can achieve this. We demonstrate how effectively a machine can answer CM questions. In this work, we adopt a two-step approach: candidate generation and candidate re-ranking to answer questions. We propose a Triplet-Siamese-Hybrid CNN (TSHCNN) to re-rank candidate answers. We show experiments on the SimpleQuestions dataset. Our network is trained only on English questions provided in this dataset and noisy Hindi translations of these questions and can answer English-Hindi CM questions effectively without the need of translation into English. Back-transliterated CM questions outperform their lexical and sentence level translated counterparts by 5% & 35% respectively, highlighting the efficacy of our approach in a resource-constrained setting.

AB The encoder-decoder framework has achieved promising process for many sequence generation tasks, such as neural machine translation and text summarization. Such a framework usually generates a sequence token by token from left to right, hence (1) this autoregressive decoding procedure is time-consuming when the output sentence becomes longer, and (2) it lacks the guidance of future context which is crucial to avoid under-translation. To alleviate these issues, we propose a synchronous bidirectional sequence generation (SBSG) model which predicts its outputs from both sides to the middle simultaneously. In the SBSG model, we enable the left-to-right (L2R) and right-to-left (R2L) generation to help and interact with each other by leveraging interactive bidirectional attention network. Experiments on neural machine translation (En double right arrow De, Ch double right arrow En, and En double right arrow Ro) and text summarization tasks show that the proposed model significantly speeds up decoding while improving the generation quality compared to the autoregressive Transformer.

AB We propose a simple modification to existing neural machine translation (NMT) models that enables using a single universal model to translate between multiple languages while allowing for language specific parameterization, and that can also be used for domain adaptation. Our approach requires no changes to the model architecture of a standard NMT system, but instead introduces a new component, the contextual parameter generator (CPG), that generates the parameters of the system (e.g., weights in a neural network). This parameter generator accepts source and target language embeddings as input, and generates the parameters for the encoder and the decoder, respectively. The rest of the model remains unchanged and is shared across all languages. We show how this simple modification enables the system to use monolingual data for training and also perform zero-shot translation. We further show it is able to surpass state-of-theart performance for both the IWSLT-15 and IWSLT-17 datasets and that the learned language embeddings are able to uncover interesting relationships between languages.

AB In this paper, we propose a new task of machine translation (MT), which is based on no parallel sentences but can refer to a ground-truth bilingual dictionary. Motivated by the ability of a monolingual speaker learning to translate via looking up the bilingual dictionary, we propose the task to see how much potential an MT system can attain using the bilingual dictionary and large scale monolingual corpora, while is independent on parallel sentences. We propose anchored training (AT) to tackle the task. AT uses the bilingual dictionary to establish anchoring points for closing the gap between source language and target language. Experiments on various language pairs show that our approaches are significantly better than various baselines, including dictionary-based word-by-word translation, dictionary-supervised crosslingual word embedding transformation, and unsupervised MT. On distant language pairs that are hard for unsupervised MT to perform well, AT performs remarkably better, achieving performances comparable to supervised SMT trained on more than 4M parallel sentences(1).

AB Translation of Multi-word expressions (MWEs) is one of the most challenging tasks of a Machine translation (MT) system. In this paper, we present an innovative technique for dealing with MWEs in the context of MT. The technique permits bilinguals to give translations of MWEs in the form of patterns, without requiring them to be trained linguistically. The interpretation of the patterns is done by a dynamic machine learning algorithm, which allows the main rule-based MT system to operate based on linguistic rules. Thus, the bilingual patterns (without any explicit linguistic input) are used in conjunction with the main linguistic system. This is made possible by the learning pathway templates. These templates need to be specially prepared by trained linguists only once. After that they help to process potentially a large number of patterns.
   The implemented system is being used with a large-scale rule-based MT system to improve its performance. This framework can also be extended to help example-based or statistical MT systems to deal with MWEs.

TI Multilingual access to web resources: an overview
SO PROGRAM-ELECTRONIC LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB The World Wide Web offers access to information resources in many languages. Certain developments facilitate multilingual exploitation of these resources. Some search engines, for example, allow the user to restrict retrieved sites to those in particular languages; some also provide the searcher with an interface in a chosen language. Many web sites also offer their information in several languages, one of which typically is English. Systran, a machine translation system available from the AltaVista search engine, can even translate a search statement or a retrieved page from one language to another. Despite these features, however, language also creates obstacles to full exploitation of web resources. Not all languages are catered for by these multilingual tools. Machine translation output typically is but a rough and ready version of a human translation. The variety of scripts in which the written forms of the world's languages appear also create major problems in searching, inputting, displaying and printing text in non-roman scripts. The paper offers an overview of multilingual information access issues in relation to the Web.

AB A hardware/software co-designed processor transparently supports a ubiquitous ISA (e.g. x86) with diversified and innovative microarchitectural implementations. It leverages co-designed HW features and dynamic binary translation (DBT) SW to morph existing binary programs to scale performance and save power. On such systems, the portable bytecode of modern dynamic languages (e.g. Java, JavaScript, etc.) is first translated into the code in the architecture ISA by the just-in-time (JIT) compilation in the bytecode virtual machine, and then into the code in the internal implementation ISA by the DBT. This not only incurs the translation overheads twice, but also brings significant emulation inefficiency as the DBT does not have the high level bytecode information. In this paper, we present AccelDroid, which accelerates the Android Dalvik bytecode execution on the HW/SW co-designed processor through direct bytecode translation in the DBT. Our experiments on a HW/SW co-designed Transmeta Efficeon machine show that AccelDroid can improve performance by 78% and save energy by 40% for the CaffeineMark 3.0 benchmark suite.

AB Ontologies are at the heart of knowledge management and make use of information that is not only written in English but also in many other natural languages. In order to enable knowledge discovery, sharing and reuse of these multilingual ontologies, it is necessary to support ontology mapping despite natural language barriers. This paper examines the soundness of a generic approach that involves machine translation tools and monolingual ontology matching techniques in cross-lingual ontology mapping scenarios. In particular, experimental results collected from case studies which engage mappings of independent ontologies that are labeled in English and Chinese are presented. Based on findings derived from these studies, limitations of this generic approach are discussed. It is shown with evidence that appropriate translations of conceptual labels in ontologies are of crucial importance when applying monolingual matching techniques in cross-lingual ontology mapping. Finally, to address the identified challenges, a semantic-oriented cross-lingual ontology mapping (SOCOM) framework is proposed and discussed.

AB Most of the existing models for document-level machine translation adopt dual-encoder structures. The representation of the source sentences and the document-level contexts' are modeled with two separate encoders. Although these models can make use of the document-level contexts, they do not fully model the interaction between the contexts and the source sentences, and can not directly adapt to the recent pre-training models (e.g., BERT) which encodes multiple sentences with a single encoder. In this work, we propose a simple and effective unified encoder that can outperform the baseline models of dual encoder models in terms of BLEU and METLOR scores. Moreover, the pre-training models can further boost the performance of our proposed model.

AB This paper proposes a novel method to inject custom terminology into neural machine translation at run time. Previous works have mainly proposed modifications to the decoding algorithm in order to constrain the output to include run-time-provided target terms. While being effective, these constrained decoding methods add, however, significant computational overhead to the inference step, and, as we show in this paper, can be brittle when tested in realistic conditions. In this paper we approach the problem by training a neural MT system to learn how to use custom terminology when provided with the input. Comparative experiments show that our method is not only more effective than a state-of-the-art implementation of constrained decoding, but is also as fast as constraint-free decoding.

AB The goal of Morpho Challenge 2009 was to evaluate unsupervised algorithms that provide morpheme analyses for words in different languages and in various practical applications. Morpheme analysis is particularly useful in speech recognition, information retrieval and machine translation for morphologically rich languages where the amount of different word forms is very large. The evaluations consisted of: 1. a comparison to grammatical morphemes, 2. using morphemes instead of words in information retrieval tasks, and 3. combining morpheme and word based systems in statistical machine translation tasks. The evaluation languages were: Finnish, Turkish, German, English and Arabic. This paper describes the tasks, evaluation methods, and obtained results. The Morpho Challenge was part of the EU Network of Excellence PASCAL Challenge Program and organized in collaboration with CLEF.

AB In statistical machine translation, the generation of a translation hypothesis is computationally expensive. If arbitrary wordreorderings are permitted, the search problem is NP-hard. On the other hand, if we restrict the possible word-reorderings in an appropriate way, we obtain a polynomial-time search algorithm.
   In this paper, we compare two different reordering constraints, namely the ITG constraints and the IBM constraints. This comparison includes a theoretical discussion on the permitted number of re-orderings for each of these constraints. We show a connection between the ITG constraints and the since 1870 known Schroder numbers.
   We evaluate these constraints on two tasks: the Verbmobil task and the Canadian Hansards task. The evaluation consists of two parts: First, we check how many of the Viterbi alignments of the training corpus satisfy each of these constraints. Second, we restrict the search to each of these constraints and compare the resulting translation hypotheses.
   The experiments will show that the baseline ITG constraints are not sufficient on the Canadian Hansards task. Therefore, we present an extension to the ITG constraints. These extended ITG constraints increase the alignment coverage from about 87% to 96%.

AB Computers have become an essential part of modem life, providing services in a multiplicity of ways. Access to these services, however, comes at a price: human attention is bound and directed toward a technical artifact in a human-machine interaction setting at the expense of time and attention for other humans. This paper explores a new class of computer services that support human-human interaction and communication implicitly and transparently. Computers in the Human Interaction Loop (CHIL), require consideration of all communication modalities, multimodal integration and more robust performance. We review the technologies and several CHIL services providing human-human support. Among them, we specifically highlight advanced computer services for cross-lingual communication.

AB This work addresses the problem of resolving the noun attachment problem in Urdu Machine Translation. This is basically an ambiguity issue which arises when the source language is to be translated into the target language. In our approach, the input to the system is a sentence in Urdu, and its output determines if the nouns that occur together in the sentence are attached or are completely separate. We have developed a conceptual model for the resolution of this problem which revolves around prepositions present in simple declarative sentence of Urdu. In this paper we present the readers with the algorithms developed and experimental results of the proposed procedure. In the end, some enhancement strategies of the methodology are also presented.

AB Non-autoregressive machine translation models significantly speed up decoding by allowing for parallel prediction of the entire target sequence. However, modeling word order is more challenging due to the lack of autoregressive factors in the model. This difficultly is compounded during training with cross entropy loss, which can highly penalize small shifts in word order. In this paper, we propose aligned cross entropy (AXE) as an alternative loss function for training of non-autoregressive models. AXE uses a differentiable dynamic program to assign loss based on the best possible monotonic alignment between target tokens and model predictions. AXE-based training of conditional masked language models (CMLMs) substantially improves performance on major WMT benchmarks, while setting a new state of the art for non-autoregressive models.

AB This paper proposes a new approach to construction of rule bases for the transferred- based machine translation. In our approach, the rule bases are constructed in combination of the linguistics knowledge and large scale of corpora. On the one hand the lexical knowledge, the syntactic knowledge and the semantic knowledge are all used in the rules. on the other hand the knowledge is used for the statistics and self-learning of rules. In each rule base, all rules are scored and ranked. Thus an impersonal choice for the sentence can be made. The preliminary experimental results show that the approach may increase the speed to build the rule base and improve the quality of rules.

AB BPE tokenization merges characters into longer tokens by finding frequently occurring contiguous patterns within the word boundary. An intuitive relaxation would be to extend a BPE vocabulary with multi-word expressions (MWEs): bigrams (in_a), trigrams (out_of_the), and skip-grams (he.his). In the context of Neural Machine Translation (NMT), we replace the least frequent subword/whole-word tokens with the most frequent MWEs. We find that these modifications to BPE end up hurting the model, resulting in a net drop of BLEU and chrF scores across two language pairs. We observe that naively extending BPE beyond word boundaries results in incoherent tokens which are themselves better represented as individual words. Moreover, we find that Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) instead of frequency finds better MWEs (e.g., New_Y ork, Statue_of_Liberty, neither.nor) which consistently improves translation performance. We release all code at https://github.com/pegasus-lynx/mwe-bpe.

AB Neural machine translation (NMT) heavily relies on word level modelling to learn semantic representations of input sentences. However, for languages without natural word delimiters (e.g., Chinese) where input sentences have to be tokenized first, conventional NMT is confronted with two issues: 1) it is difficult to find an optimal tokenization granularity for source sentence modelling, and 2) errors in 1-best tokenizations may propagate to the encoder of NMT. To handle these issues, we propose word-lattice based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) encoders for NMT, which generalize the standard RNN to word lattice topology. The proposed encoders take as input a word lattice that compactly encodes multiple tokenizations, and learn to generate new hidden states from arbitrarily many inputs and hidden states in preceding time steps. As such, the word-lattice based encoders not only alleviate the negative impact of tokenization errors but also are more expressive and flexible to embed input sentences. Experiment results on Chinese-English translation demonstrate the superiorities of the proposed encoders over the conventional encoder.

Besides regular grammatical, lexical, positional and semantic features, we develop two innovative Web-based features for extracting additional semantic information of ZA from the Web. Our study shows the Web as a knowledge source can be incorporated effectively in the learning framework and significantly improves its performance. In the application of ZA resolution in MT, it is viewed as a pre-processing module that is detachable and MT-independent. The experiment results demonstrate a significant improvement on BLEU/NIST scores after the ZA resolution is employed.

Our experiments suggest that discourse context is unlikely the cause for concatenation improving BLEU by about +1 across four language pairs. Instead, we demonstrate that the improvement comes from three other factors unrelated to discourse: context diversity, length diversity, and (to a lesser extent) position shifting.

AB Many NLP models operate over sequences of subword tokens produced by hand-crafted to-kenization rules and heuristic subword induction algorithms. A simple universal alternative is to represent every computerized text as a sequence of bytes via UTF-8, obviating the need for an embedding layer since there are fewer token types (256) than dimensions. Surprisingly, replacing the ubiquitous embedding layer with one-hot representations of each byte does not hurt performance; experiments on byte-to-byte machine translation from English to 10 different languages show a consistent improvement in BLEU, rivaling character-level and even standard subword-level models. A deeper investigation reveals that the combination of embeddingless models with decoder-input dropout amounts to token dropout, which benefits byte-to-byte models in particular.(1)

It was found that ambiguity, named entity & terminology and verb valency are the categories where MT systems struggle most. Negation, pronouns, subordination, verb tense/aspect/mood and false friends are the categories where MT systems perform best.

This method makes it possible to classify input text data in two different categories: applied linguistics texts (AL) and non-applied linguistics texts (nonAL). The proposed method is implemented using the statistical measure of TF-IDF and the evaluation measure of cosine similarity. The study gives promising results and opens up further prospects for the application of this approach to text classification in other languages.

AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has reached a level of maturity to be recognized as the premier method for the translation between different languages and aroused interest in different research areas, including software engineering. A key step to validate the robustness of the NMT models consists in evaluating the performance of the models on adversarial inputs, i.e., inputs obtained from the original ones by adding small amounts of perturbation. However, when dealing with the specific task of the code generation (i.e., the generation of code starting from a description in natural language), it has not yet been defined an approach to validate the robustness of the NMT models. In this work, we address the problem by identifying a set of perturbations and metrics tailored for the robustness assessment of such models. We present a preliminary experimental evaluation, showing what type of perturbations affect the model the most and deriving useful insights for future directions.

AB A core technology of natural language processing (NLP) incorporated into many text processing applications is a part-of-speech (POS) tagger, a software component that labels words in text with syntactic tags such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. These tags may then be used within more complex task such as parsing, question-answering, and machine translation (MT). In this paper we describe the phases of our work training and evaluating statistical POS taggers on Arabic texts and their English translations using Kepler workflows. While the original objectives for encapsulating our research code within Kepler workflows were driven by software engineering needs to document and verify the re-usability or our software, our research benefitted as well: the ease of rapid retraining and testing enabled our research to detect reporting discrepancies, document their source, independently validating the correct results.

AB Binary translation is one of the most important approaches for system migration. However, software binary translation systems often suffer from the inefficiency and traditional hardware-software co-designed virtual machines require the unavoidable re-design of the processor architecture. This paper presents a novel hardware-software co-designed method to accelerate the binary translation on an existing architecture. The hardware supports for source-architecture-only functions, partial decodes and binary translation system acceleration are proposed. These hardware supports help the binary translation system to achieve high performance and simplify the design of the binary translation software. In the meantime, the hardware cost is well controlled in a certain low level. These supports are implemented in Godson-3 processors to speedup the x86 binary translation to the native MIPS instruction set. Performance evaluations on RTL simulation and FPGA emulation platforms show that the proposed method can speedup most benchmark programs by nearly 10 times compared to pure software-based binary translation and achieves about 70% performance of the native program execution. The chip is fabricated in ST 65nm CMOS technology, and the physical design results show that the chip area cost is less than 5%.

A series of fairly simple modifications to the original IBM/Giza++ word alignment models allows to update the symmetrized models between chosen iterations of the original training algorithms. We achieve a relative alignment quality improvement of more than 17% compared to Giza++ and MGiza++ on the standard Canadian Hansards task, while maintaining the speed improvements provided by the capability of parallel computations of MGiza++.
   Furthermore, the alignment models are evaluated in the context of phrase-based statistical machine translation, where a consistent improvement measured in BLEU scores can be observed when SyMGiza++ is used instead of Giza++ or MGiza++.

   Solution in the Process of Translation Using English Corpus
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
AB In order to improve the accuracy and reasonableness of using English corpus for translation, a method of using English corpus to perform translation tasks based on fuzzy semantic optimal solution intelligent selection and inspired computing for wireless networks is proposed. The information extraction model using English corpus for translation is constructed, and the fuzzy semantic keyword feature directivity model of English corpus translation is established. Fuzzy semantic ontology feature registration method is used to calculate the fuzzy semantic intelligence optimal solution vector in English translation. The semantic fuzzy feature matching and adaptive subject word registration are realized in English translation. The fuzzy link relation of semantic ontology is established, and the fuzzy semantic optimal solution is obtained. The accuracy of machine translation in English corpus is improved. The experimental results show that the fuzzy semantic optimal solution has better registration performance and the feature matching degree of the subject words is higher, which improves the reasonableness and accuracy of translation in English corpus. At the same time, it provides a new idea for intelligent computation and recognition of wireless network.

AB Efficient machine translation models are commercially important as they can increase inference speeds, and reduce costs and carbon emissions. Recently, there has been much interest in non-autoregressive (NAR) models, which promise faster translation. In parallel to the research on NAR models, there have been successful attempts to create optimized autoregressive models as part of the WMT shared task on efficient translation. In this paper, we point out flaws in the evaluation methodology present in the literature on NAR models and we provide a fair comparison between a stateof-the-art NAR model and the autoregressive submissions to the shared task. We make the case for consistent evaluation of NAR models, and also for the importance of comparing NAR models with other widely used methods for improving efficiency. We run experiments with a connectionist-temporal-classification-based (CTC) NAR model implemented in C++ and compare it with AR models using wall clock times. Our results show that, although NAR models are faster on GPUs, with small batch sizes, they are almost always slower under more realistic usage conditions. We call for more realistic and extensive evaluation of NAR models in future work.

AB Statistical Machine Translation is the state-of-the-art technique based on sentence-level aligned parallel corpora. The improvement of this kind of technique is constrained by the lack of parallel corpora publicly available. The booming of the World Wide Web stands a fair chance that we can construct parallel corpora in a big scale more easily. In this paper, we summarize the current strategies fetching parallel corpora from the web and classify them into three classes: the structure-based, the content-based and the hybrid We compare these approaches and bring out some ideas that may be useful for improving the performance of the algorithms. In the discussion section, we put forward some problems that should be considered in future research.

We trained neural machine translation models for the language pairs Czech <-> Polish and Spanish <-> Portuguese. Our experiments focused on different subword segmentation methods, and in particular on the comparison of a cognate-aware segmentation method, Cognate Morfessor, with character segmentation and unsupervised segmentation methods for which the data from different languages were simply concatenated. We did not observe major benefits from cognate-aware segmentation methods, but further research may be needed to explore larger parts of the parameter space. Character-level models proved to be competitive for translation between Spanish and Portuguese, but they are slower in training and decoding.

AB Despite increasing efforts to improve evaluation of machine translation (MT) by going beyond the sentence level to the document level, the definition of what exactly constitutes a "document level" is still not clear. This work deals with the context span necessary for a more reliable MT evaluation. We report results from a series of surveys involving three domains and 18 target languages designed to identify the necessary context span as well as issues related to it. Our findings indicate that, despite the fact that some issues and spans are strongly dependent on domain and on the target language, a number of common patterns can be observed so that general guidelines for context-aware MT evaluation can be drawn.

AB The aim of this paper is to evaluate the quality of popular machine translation engines on three texts of different genre in a scenario in which both source and target languages are morphologically rich. Translations are obtained from Google Translate and Microsoft Bing engines and German-Croatian is selected as the language pair. The analysis entails both human and automatic evaluation. The process of error analysis, which is time-consuming and often tiresome, is conducted in the user-friendly Windows 10 application TREAT. Prior to annotation, training is conducted in order to familiarize the annotator with MQM, which is used in the annotation task, and the interface of TREAT. The annotation guidelines elaborated with examples are provided. The evaluation is also conducted with automatic metrics BLEU and CHRF++ in order to assess their segment-level correlation with human annotations on three different levels-accuracy, mistranslation, and the total number of errors. Our findings indicate that neither the total number of errors, nor the most prominent error category and subcategory, show consistent and statistically significant segment-level correlation with the selected automatic metrics.

AB This paper describes Unbabel's submission to the WMT2019 APE Shared Task for the English-German language pair. Following the recent rise of large, powerful, pretrained models, we adapt the BERT pretrained model to perform Automatic Post-Editing in an encoder-decoder framework. Analogously to dual-encoder architectures we develop a BERT-based encoder-decoder (BED) model in which a single pretrained BERT encoder receives both the source src and machine translation mt strings. Furthermore, we explore a conservativeness factor to constrain the APE system to perform fewer edits. As the official results show, when trained on a weighted combination of in-domain and artificial training data, our BED system with the conservativeness penalty improves significantly the translations of a strong Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system by -0.78 and +1.23 in terms of TER and BLEU, respectively. Finally, our submission achieves a new state-of-the-art, ex-aequo, in English-German APE of NMT.

TI Optimization of ultrafast axial scanning parameters for efficient pulsed
   laser micro-machining
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
AB In order to achieve high-resolution micro-machined features, tight focusing is traditionally adopted in laser micro-machining systems, at the cost of a narrow axial machining range. As the laser energy is confined in a single, fixed focal spot, machining throughput is significantly constrained by the writing speed of either translation stages or galvanometer scanners. We study an ultrafast axial scanning technique that asynchronously distributes laser pulses along the axial direction. Oscillation of the focal spot induced by the tunable acoustic gradient index lens is visualized in borosilicate glass with femtosecond laser pulses. By tuning frequency and amplitude of the acoustic field, machining parameters can be optimized, as demonstrated by the case of line machining on silicon. Multi-pass groove machining with axial scanning on silicon as well as femtosecond laser cutting of battery separators exhibit an extended effective machining range and an improved machining efficiency for both focused and defocused surfaces.

In this paper, we explore one novel dark silicon methodology, based on a heterogeneous multi-accelerator system model and an implicit execution model for the host processor. We also highlight a backend translation methodology from raw machine code into data-flow style hardware cores, and introduce two distinct implementation styles. We then demonstrate comparative power benefits as compared to a relevant CPU model, assuming a 65nm benchmark technology node for both cases.

It is demonstrated that the query based on WFSA can effectively avoid the redundant queries and accelerate the query speed. Furthermore, it is revealed that investigating a simple caching technique can further speed up the query. The experiment results show that this method can finally speed up the LM query by 75% in relative. With the LM order increasing, the performance benefits by WFSA will be much more significant.

AB Multiple-pronunciation dictionaries are often used by automatic speech recognition systems in order to account for different speaking styles. In this paper, two methods based on statistical machine translation (SMT) are used to generate multiple pronunciations from the canonical pronunciation of a word. In the first method, a machine translation tool is used to perform phoneme-to-phoneme (p2p) conversion and derive variants from a given canonical pronunciation. The second method is based on a pivot method proposed for the paraphrase extraction task. The two methods are compared under different training conditions which allow single or multiple pronunciations in the training set, and their performance is evaluated in terms of recall and precision measures.

AB The Arabic language is a collection of spoken dialects and a standard written language. The dialects show phonological, morphological, lexical, and syntactic. Differences, although the standard written language is the same throughout the Arab world. The present work reports our attempt in developing a bi-lingual Machine Translation tool for simple present and past sentences in an elementary school domain. The work described here is part of an ongoing research to automate the translation of user interfaces of knowledge-based systems. Our project tries to translate from a well-structured Arabic simple present and past sentence into a well-structured English sentence, by using a dictionary to translate a single word, and a simple lexicon consists of word categories and the meaning relative to categories in appropriate format. The domain area is an Arabic-English dictionary and a set of well-structured Arabic sentences from many textbooks in an elementary school.

TI Sign Language Translation Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
SO KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Sign language is a natural, visually oriented and non-verbal communication channel between people that facilitates communication through facial/bodily expressions, postures and a set of gestures. It is basically used for communication with people who are deaf or hard of hearing. In order to understand such communication quickly and accurately, the design of a successful sign language translation system is considered in this paper. The proposed system includes object detection and classification stages. Firstly, Single Shot Multi Box Detection (SSD) architecture is utilized for hand detection, then a deep learning structure based on the Inception v3 plus Support Vector Machine (SVM) that combines feature extraction and classification stages is proposed to constructively translate the detected hand gestures. A sign language fingerspelling dataset is used for the design of the proposed model. The obtained results and comparative analysis demonstrate the efficiency of using the proposed hybrid structure in sign language translation.

AB Simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) aims to translate a continuous input text stream into another language with the lowest latency and highest quality possible. The translation thus has to start with an incomplete source text, which is read progressively, creating the need for anticipation. In this paper, we seek to understand whether the addition of visual information can compensate for the missing source context. To this end, we analyse the impact of different multimodal approaches and visual features on state-of-the-art SiMT frameworks. Our results show that visual context is helpful and that visually-grounded models based on explicit object region information are much better than commonly used global features, reaching up to 3 BLEU points improvement under low latency scenarios. Our qualitative analysis illustrates cases where only the multimodal systems are able to translate correctly from English into gender-marked languages, as well as deal with differences in word order, such as adjective-noun placement between English and French.

AB Interpreting speech signals by making a speech to text translation is an active research area especially in current machine learning/deep learning literature. The speech to text translation of call center recordings is an important and specialized application for speech to text translation. Detecting silence in audio recordings can be a pre-processing step in order to optimize processing speed by not-considering audio parts not having significant information. In this work, such a pre-processing framework for detecting silence parts in an audio signal is considered. It is shown that further statistical analysis on the silence distributions results in detecting interesting audio features which can help in finding audio recordings which do not have actual speech sound but a fax machine tone sequence. This foundation can be directly implemented in a call center management software and makes it possible to discriminate between a normal conversation recording and a fax sound recording.

AB This paper describes an approach to case-based reasoning by which the case base is enriched at reasoning time. Enrichment results from the local application of variations to seed cases: new hypothetical cases are created which get closer and closer to the target problem. The creation of these hypothetical cases is based on structures associated to the problem and solution spaces, called variation spaces, that enable defining a language of adaptation rules. Ultimately reaching the target problem (exactly or nearly) allows the system to deliver a solution. Application of the proposed approach to machine translation shows behind state-of-the-art, but promising results.

AB In this study, we implemented a bi-directional English-Hiligaynon translator using Statistical Machine Translation framework. Hiligaynon is a member of the Malayo-Polynesian language family and is the fourth major language in the Philippines. Text documents from the New Testament were used as training data. These were cleaned and tokenized, and a parallel corpus was developed. To evaluate the performance of the translator, Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) Score was used. We were able to achieve 21.74 for Hiligaynon to English and 24.43 for English to Hiligaynon. Philippine languages have free-word order, which would explain why we were able to get a lower score for Hiligaynon to English. For future work, increasing the size of the training data and using deep learning can be explored.

AB Despite their original goal to jointly learn to align and translate, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models, especially Transformer, are often perceived as not learning interpretable word alignments. In this paper, we show that NMT models do learn interpretable word alignments, which could only be revealed with proper interpretation methods. We propose a series of such methods that are model-agnostic, are able to be applied either offline or online, and do not require parameter update or architectural change. We show that under the force decoding setup, the alignments induced by our interpretation method are of better quality than fast-align for some systems, and when performing free decoding, they agree well with the alignments induced by automatic alignment tools.

AB This paper introduces an automatic method to extend existing WordNets via machine translation. Our proposal relies on the hierarchical skeleton of the English Princeton WordNet (PWN) as a backbone to extend their taxonomies. Our proposal is applied to the Arabic WordNet (AWN) to enrich it by adding new synsets, and also by providing vocalizations and usage examples for each inserted lemma. Around 12000 new potential synsets can be added to AWN with a precision of at least 93%. As such the coverage of AWN in terms of synsets can be increased from 11269 to around 24000 a very promising achievement on the path of enriching the Arabic WordNet.

AB In the process of machine translation, similarity threshold is an important factor restricting retrieval and translation. When the fuzzy interval similarity threshold is low, the translation effect of the traditional online translation teaching system is poor, but if the threshold is too high, it will lead to retrieval difficulties and affect the translation progress. In view of this situation, a computer-aided online translation teaching system is designed. In the hardware design of the system, the content addressed memory is mainly studied to provide space for data storage and facilitate address search for the partition of translation cache package; In the software design, firstly, the neural loop network is established for deep learning, the natural language feature vector is extracted, and the source sentence is encoded to obtain the sentence vector with a certain length. After adding some algorithms and constraints, the decoding is completed with the help of neural network to eliminate the gradient imbalance in the process of translation ambiguity; Optimize the translation training model, reorder the extracted feature vectors, and optimize the translation results. In order to verify the effectiveness of the designed system, experiments are designed. The results show that when the fuzzy interval is less than 0.5, the performance of the designed system is significantly better than the traditional system. With the increase of similarity threshold, the performance gap between the two methods gradually narrows.

AB We propose a novel introspective model for variational neural machine translation (IntroVNMT) in this paper, inspired by the recent successful application of introspective variational autoencoder (IntroVAE) in high quality image synthesis. Different from the vanilla variational NMT model, IntroVNMT is capable of improving itself introspectively by evaluating the quality of the generated target sentences according to the high-level latent variables of the real and generated target sentences. As a consequence of introspective training, the proposed model is able to discriminate between the generated and real sentences of the target language via the latent variables generated by the encoder of the model. In this way, IntroVNMT is able to generate more realistic target sentences in practice. In the meantime, IntroVNMT inherits the advantages of the variational autoencoders (VAEs), and the model training process is more stable than the generative adversarial network (GAN) based models. Experimental results on different translation tasks demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve significant improvements over the vanilla variational NMT model.

AB Across language portability of a spoken language understanding system (SLU) deals with the possibility of reusing with moderate effort in a new language knowledge and data acquired for another language.
   The approach proposed in this paper is motivated by the availability of the fairly large MEDIA corpus carefully transcribed in French and semantically annotated in terms of constituents. A method is proposed for manually translating a portion of the training set for training an automatic machine translation (MT) system to be used for translating the remaining data. As the source language is annotated in terms of concept tags, a solution is presented for automatically transferring these tags to the translated corpus. Experimental results are presented on the accuracy of the translation expressed with the BLEU score as function of the size of the training corpus. It is shown that the process leads to comparable concept error rates in the two languages making the proposed approach suitable for SLU portability across languages.

AB In statistical machine translation (SMT), the optimization of the system parameters to maximize translation accuracy is now a fundamental part of virtually all modern systems. In this article, we survey 12 years of research on optimization for SMT, from the seminal work on discriminative models (Och and Ney 2002) and minimum error rate training (Och 2003), to the most recent advances. Starting with a brief introduction to the fundamentals of SMT systems, we follow by covering a wide variety of optimization algorithms for use in both batch and online optimization. Specifically, we discuss losses based on direct error minimization, maximum likelihood, maximum margin, risk minimization, ranking, and more, along with the appropriate methods for minimizing these losses. We also cover recent topics, including large-scale optimization, nonlinear models, domain-dependent optimization, and the effect of MT evaluation measures or search on optimization. Finally, we discuss the current state of affairs in MT optimization, and point out some unresolved problems that will likely be the target of further research in optimization for MT.

AB Cross-lingual sentiment classification aims to conduct sentiment classification in a target language using labeled sentiment data in a source language. Most existing research works rely on machine translation to directly project information from one language to another. But cross-lingual classifiers always cannot learn all characteristics of target language data by using only translated data from one language. In this paper, we propose a new learning model that uses labeled sentiment data from more than one language to compensate some of the limitations of resource translation. In this model, we first create different views of sentiment data via machine translation, then train individual classifiers in every view and finally combine the classifiers for final decision. We have applied this model to the sentiment classification datasets in three different languages using different combination methods. The results show that the combination methods improve the performances obtained separately by each individual classifier.

AB A novel approach to Spoken Language Translation is proposed, which more tightly integrates Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). SMT is directly applied on an approximation of the word graph produced by the ASR system, namely a confusion network. The decoding aloorithm extends a conventional phrase-based decoder in that it can process at once a large number of source sentence hypotheses contained in the confusion network. Experimental results are presented on a Spanish-English large vocabulary task, namely the translation of the European Parliament Plenary Sessions. With respect to a conventional SMT decoder processing N-best lists, a slight improvement in the BLEU score is reported as well as a significantly lower decoding time.

AB Pre-trained language model representations have been successful in a wide range of language understanding tasks. In this paper, we examine different strategies to integrate pretrained representations into sequence to sequence models and apply it to neural machine translation and abstractive summarization. We find that pre-trained representations are most effective when added to the encoder network which slows inference by only 14%. Our experiments in machine translation show gains of up to 5.3 BLEU in a simulated resource-poor setup. While returns diminish with more labeled data, we still observe improvements when millions of sentence-pairs are available. Finally, on abstractive summarization we achieve a new state of the art on the full text version of CNN-DailyMail.

AB The last few years have witnessed the success of attention-based Neural Machine Translation (NMT), and many of variant models have been used to improve the performance. Most of the proposed attention-based NMT models encode the source sentence into a sequence of annotations which are kept fixed for the following steps. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of fixed annotations is the bottleneck in improving the performance of conventional attention-based NMT. To tackle this shortcoming, we propose a novel model for attention-based NMT, which is intended to update the source annotations recursively when generating the target word at each time step. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves significant performance improvement over multiple test sets.

AB Subject and verb relation in Bangla sentences plays an important key role during machine translation for a semantically valid sentence. In Bangla sentences, the verbal inflection is changed to form verb according to the nature of subject and can have multiple syntactically valid verb form for a sentence. Multiple form of same meaning verb word in Bangla language introduce complexity in computational linguistic like machine translation. The work mainly focuses on analysis of Bangla person and verbal inflections and relation between them. This paper describes a system for finding semantically valid verb form for a certain subject in Bangla sentences using our proposed algorithm.

AB The CMU Statistical Transfer Framework (Stat-XFER) is a general framework for developing search-based syntax-driven machine translation (MT) systems. The framework consists of an underlying syntax-based transfer formalism along with a collection of software components designed to facilitate the development of a broad range of NIT research systems. The main components are a general language-independent runtime transfer engine and decoder, along with several different tools for creating the various underlying language-pair-specific resources that are required for building a specific NIT system for any given language pair. We describe the general framework, its unique properties and features, and its application to the construction of NIT research prototype systems for a diverse collection of language pairs.

AB We present a perceptron-style discriminative approach to machine translation in which large feature sets can be exploited. Unlike discriminative reranking approaches, our system can take advantage of learned features in all stages of decoding. We first discuss several challenges to error-driven discriminative approaches. In particular, we explore different ways of updating parameters given a training example. We find that making frequent but smaller updates is preferable to making fewer but larger updates. Then, we discuss an array of features and show both how they quantitatively increase BLEU score and how they qualitatively interact on specific examples. One particular feature we investigate is a novel way to introduce learning into the initial phrase extraction process, which has previously been entirely heuristic.

TI Global sequence features based translation initiation site prediction in
   human genomic sequences
SO HELIYON
AB Gene prediction has been increasingly important in genome annotation due to advancements in sequencing technology. Genome annotation further helps in determining the structure and function of these genes. Translation initiation site prediction (TIS) in human genomic sequences is one of the fundamental and essential steps in gene prediction. Thus, accurate prediction of TIS in these sequences is highly desirable. Although many computational methods were developed for this problem, none of them focused on finding these sites in human genomic sequences. In this paper, a new TIS prediction method is proposed by incorporating global sequence based features. Support vector machine is used to assess the prediction power of these features. The proposed method achieved accuracy of above 90% when tested for genomic as well as cDNA sequences. The experimental results indicate that the method works well for both genomic and cDNA sequences. The method can be integrated into gene prediction system in future.

AB The unique nature of histopathology images opens the door to domain-specific formulations of image translation models. We propose a difficulty translation model that modifies colorectal histopathology images to be more challenging to classify. Our model comprises a scorer, which provides an output confidence to measure the difficulty of images, and an image translator, which learns to translate images from easy-to-classify to hard-to-classify using a training set defined by the scorer. We present three findings. First, generated images were indeed harder to classify for both human pathologists and machine learning classifiers than their corresponding source images. Second, image classifiers trained with generated images as augmented data performed better on both easy and hard images from an independent test set. Finally, human annotator agreement and our model's measure of difficulty correlated strongly, implying that for future work requiring human annotator agreement, the confidence score of a machine learning classifier could be used as a proxy.

TI Innovatively Fused Deep Learning with Limited Noisy Data for Evaluating
   Translations from Poor into Rich Morphology
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Evaluation of machine translation (MT) into morphologically rich languages has not been well studied despite its importance. This paper proposes a classifier, that is, a deep learning (DL) schema for MT evaluation, based on different categories of information (linguistic features, natural language processing (NLP) metrics and embeddings), by using a model for machine learning based on noisy and small datasets. The linguistic features are string based for the language pairs English (EN)-Greek (EL) and EN-Italian (IT). The paper also explores the linguistic differences that affect evaluation accuracy between different kinds of corpora. A comparative study between using a simple embedding layer (mathematically calculated) and pre-trained embeddings is conducted. Moreover, an analysis of the impact of feature selection and dimensionality reduction on classification accuracy has been conducted. Results show that using a neural network (NN) model with different input representations produces results that clearly outperform the state-of-the-art for MT evaluation for EN-EL and EN-IT, by an increase of almost 0.40 points in correlation with human judgments on pairwise MT evaluation. It is observed that the proposed algorithm achieved better results on noisy and small datasets. In addition, for a more integrated analysis of the accuracy results, a qualitative linguistic analysis has been carried out in order to address complex linguistic phenomena.

AB We present a simple joint inference of deep case analysis and zero subject generation for the pre-ordering in Japanese-to-English machine translation. The detection of subjects and objects from Japanese sentences is more difficult than that from English, while it is the key process to generate correct English word orders. In addition, subjects are often omitted in Japanese when they are inferable from the context. We propose a new Japanese deep syntactic parser that consists of pointwise probabilistic models and a global inference with linguistic constraints. We applied our new deep parser to pre-ordering in Japanese-to-English SMT system and show substantial improvements in automatic evaluations.

CY MAR 09-11, 2011
CL Newport Beach, CA
AB Profilers based on hardware performance counters are indispensable for performance debugging of complex software systems. All modern processors feature hardware performance counters, but current virtual machine monitors (VMMs) do not properly expose them to the guest operating systems. Existing profiling tools require privileged access to the VMM to profile the guest and are only available for VMMs based on paravirtualization. Diagnosing performance problems of software running in a virtualized environment is therefore quite difficult.
   This paper describes how to extend VMMs to support performance profiling. We present two types of profiling in a virtualized environment: guest-wide profiling and system-wide profiling. Guest-wide profiling shows the runtime behavior of a guest. The profiler runs in the guest and does not require privileged access to the VMM. System-wide profiling exposes the runtime behavior of both the VMM and any number of guests. It requires profilers both in the VMM and in those guests.
   Not every VMM has the right architecture to support both types of profiling. We determine the requirements for each of them, and explore the possibilities for their implementation in virtual machines using hardware assistance, paravirtualization, and binary translation.
   We implement both guest-wide and system-wide profiling for a VMM based on the x86 hardware virtualization extensions and system-wide profiling for a VMM based on binary translation. We demonstrate that these profilers provide good accuracy with only limited overhead.

AB Word alignment is a crucial component in applications that use bilingual resources. Statistical methods are widely used because they are portable and allow simple system building. However, pure statistical methods often incorrectly align functional words in the English-Korean language pair due to differences in the typology of the languages and a lack of knowledge. Knowledge is inevitably required to correct errors and to improve word alignment quality. In this paper, we introduce an effective method that uses an iterative process to incorporate knowledge into the word alignment system. The method achieved significant improvements in word alignment and its application: statistical machine translation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI From Feature to Paradigm: Deep Learning in Machine Translation
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
AB In the last years, deep learning algorithms have highly revolutionized several areas including speech, image and natural language processing. The specific field of Machine Translation (MT) has not remained invariant. Integration of deep learning in MT varies from re-modeling existing features into standard statistical systems to the development of a new architecture. Among the different neural networks, research works use feed-forward neural networks, recurrent neural networks and the encoder-decoder schema. These architectures are able to tackle challenges as having low-resources or morphology variations.
   This manuscript focuses on describing how these neural networks have been integrated to enhance different aspects and models from statistical MT, including language modeling, word alignment, translation, reordering, and rescoring. Then, we report the new neural MT approach together with a description of the foundational related works and recent approaches on using subword, characters and training with multilingual languages, among others. Finally, we include an analysis of the corresponding challenges and future work in using deep learning in MT.

AB This paper presents a method to improve Thai-English word alignment in statistical machine translation (SMT) for interrogative sentences in a parallel corpus. We utilize the Thai and English grammatical knowledge i.e. tense, part of speech (POS), and question inversion pattern. The proposed method handles the difference of Thai and English interrogative sentences using sentence transformation, interrogative grammatical attribute extraction, and interrogative grammatical attribute annotation. This method works as a pre-processing of GIZA, a standard word co-occurrence alignment tool in SMT. We hypothesize that using grammatical knowledge as a pre-processing of GIZA can provide higher accuracy. We experiment by using 43,500 interrogative sentences to compare alignment result between interrogative sentences attached an interrogative grammatical label and interrogative sentences unattached interrogative grammatical label. The experimental results yield 95% of accuracy with significant improvement than the conventional one. With the increasing accuracy of word alignment, the translation accuracy is consequently improved.

AB This paper proposes the implementation of a post-processing stage to a grammar-based machine translation (MT) system from written into sign language for the pair written Greek-Greek sign language (GSL), where translation output is visualized by an avatar. Post-processing is applied on the output of the MT system's transfer module by activating an editing environment for SL which utilizes a dictionary of signs coded for HamNoSys transcriptions and non-manual elements along with grammar knowledge. This post-processing environment may also be used as a standalone editing environment for expert users allowing for a considerable range of editing actions, as well as an SL editing tool for the general public who are not familiar with the underlying technology. In both cases, this environment provides the opportunity of on-the-fly structuring of new signed utterances going far beyond current limitations in composition with new signed language content.

AB Humans use rich natural language to describe and communicate visual perceptions. In order to provide natural language descriptions for visual content, this paper combines two important ingredients. First, we generate a rich semantic representation of the visual content including e.g. object and activity labels. To predict the semantic representation we learn a CRF to model the relationships between different components of the visual input. And second, we propose to formulate the generation of natural language as a machine translation problem using the semantic representation as source language and the generated sentences as target language. For this we exploit the power of a parallel corpus of videos and textual descriptions and adapt statistical machine translation to translate between our two languages. We evaluate our video descriptions on the TACoS dataset [23], which contains video snippets aligned with sentence descriptions. Using automatic evaluation and human judgments we show significant improvements over several baseline approaches, motivated by prior work. Our translation approach also shows improvements over related work on an image description task.

AB We present a way to construct a complete set of scaling rotation and translation invariants extract directly from Zernike moments. Zernike moment can be constructed by Radial moment. In our method in order to construct invariant Zernike moment is to achieve invariant Radial moment which is component of Zernike moment. We use matrix form to denote relationship between Radial and Zernike moment, which makes derivation more comprehensible. The translation invariant Radial moment is first introduced, for it is most complicated part of all the three invariant. Rotation and scaling invariant Radial moment is achieved by normalizing the factor caused by rotation and scaling. The form of invariant radial moment is to combine three parts of invariant. Some experiment has done to test the performance of invariance. In this experiment we take an image library containing 2 3,3 2 9 files which are built by translation rotation and zoom in out of one origin Latin character image. Most of the value of standard deviation ratio by mean of proposed moments is nearly 1%. In addition, retrieval experiment is to test the discrimination ability. MPEG-7 CE shape1 - Part A library is taken in this experiment. The recall rate in part A1 is 96.6% and is 100% in part A2.

In these systems, large amplitude motions can be triggered by various external signals. Among them catenanes and rotaxanes play an important role since the inherent mechanical bonds restrict the degree of freedom of their components but permit motions like pirouetting, rotation or translation. Several examples of electrochemically triggered molecular machine prototypes based on catenanes and rotaxanes are described in this article. Recent spectacular results obtained with such systems are also discussed in the context of possible applications.

SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB In the field of machine translation of texts, the ambiguity in both lexical (dictionary) and structural aspects is still one of the difficult problems. Researchers in this field use different approaches, the most important of which is machine learning in its various types. The goal of the approach that we propose in this article is to define a new concept of electronic text, which makes the electronic text free from any lexical or structural ambiguity. We used a semantic coding system that relies on attaching the original electronic text (via the text editor interface) with the meanings intended by the author. The author defines the meaning desired for each word that can be a source of ambiguity. The proposed approach in this article can be used with any type of electronic text (text processing applications, web pages, email text, etc.). Thanks to the approach that we propose and through the experiments that we have conducted using it, we can obtain a very high accuracy rate. We can say that the problem of lexical and structural ambiguity can be completely solved. With this new concept of electronic text, the text file contains not only the text but also with it the true sense of the exact meaning intended by the writer in the form of symbols. These semantic symbols are used during machine translation to obtain a translated text completely free of any lexical and structural ambiguity.

Still, the study of EVs presents major challenges due to their heterogeneity, complexity, and scarcity. Recently, liquid biopsy platforms have allowed the study of tumor-derived materials, holding great promise for early-stage diagnosis and monitoring of cancer when interfaced with novel adaptations of optical readouts and advanced machine learning analysis. Here, recent advances in labeled and label-free optical techniques such as fluorescence, plasmonic, and chromogenic-based systems interfaced with nanostructured sensors like nanoparticles, nanoholes, and nanowires and diverse machine learning analysis are reviewed. The adaptability of the different optical methods discussed is compared and provide insights into prospective avenues for the translation of the technological approaches for cancer diagnosis. It is discussed that the inherent augmented properties of nanostructures enhance the sensitivity of the detection of EVs. It is concluded by reviewing recent integrations of nanostructured based optical readouts with diverse machine learning models as novel analysis ventures that can potentially increase the capability of the methods to the point of translation into diagnostic applications.

AB Anaphora resolution is an essential component of most NLP applications, from text understanding to Machine Translation. In this work we discuss a supervised machine learning approach to the problem, focusing on instances of anaphora ubiquitously found in a corpus of Brazilian Portuguese texts, namely, third-person pronominal references. Although still limited to a subset of the more general co-reference resolution problem, our present results are comparable to existing work in the field in both English and Portuguese languages, representing the highest accuracy rates that we are aware of in (Brazilian) Portuguese pronoun resolution.

AB We present a simple but effective approach for leveraging Wikipedia for neural machine translation as well as cross-lingual tasks of image captioning and dependency parsing without using any direct supervision from external parallel data or supervised models in the target language. We show that first sentences and titles of linked Wikipedia pages, as well as cross-lingual image captions, are strong signals for a seed parallel data to extract bilingual dictionaries and cross-lingual word embeddings for mining parallel text from Wikipedia. Our final model achieves high BLEU scores that are close to or sometimes higher than strong supervised baselines in low-resource languages; e.g. supervised BLEU of 4.0 versus 12.1 from our model in English-to-Kazakh. Moreover, we tailor our "wikily" supervised translation models to unsupervised image captioning, and cross-lingual dependency parser transfer. In image captioning, we train a multitasking machine translation and image captioning pipeline for Arabic and English from which the Arabic training data is a translated version of the English captioning data, using our wikily-supervised translation models. Our captioning results on Arabic are slightly better than that of its supervised model. In dependency parsing, we translate a large amount of monolingual text, and use it as artificial training data in an annotation projection framework. We show that our model outperforms recent work on cross-lingual transfer of dependency parsers.

AB Machine Translation (MT) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) application which has taken off and reported considerable progress in recent years. Most recent applications of MT employ neural networks imitating the principles of human understanding and creation of meaning at conceptual and cognitive levels (Nerlich and Clarke 2000: 141). They are based on techniques which try to simulate the mechanisms of learning in biological organisms carried out through the neurons (Aggarwal 2018: 1; Theordoris 2020: 903). However, human intelligence and the cognitive models which humans use through language should be subject to more examination in order to have the capacity to unveil more basic cognitive features. For this reason, a more holistic understanding of certain aspects of human intelligence based on cognitive models is still required in order to take machine learning a step further (Goertzel et al. 2012: 124). Image schemas and image schematic complexes are among the cognitive issues which would benefit from further studies as its basic structure is fundamental in natural language processing and conceptualisation (Hedblom et al. 2019). They are common in all languages and all cultures but their use is not always universal. This variation influences the quality of MT, as in some cases, this variance is not taken into consideration while feeding the neural networks of MT. This preliminary study has the objective of studying the novel idea of image schemas and image schematic complexes and proposing an applied methodology to use them in MT.

TI Multilingual Sentiment Analysis: A Systematic Literature Review
SO PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB With the explosive growth of social media, the online community can freely express their opinions without disclosing their identities. People with hidden agendas can easily post fake opinions to discredit target products, services, politicians, or organizations. With these big data, monitoring opinions and distilling their sentiments remain a formidable task because of the proliferation of diverse sites with a large volume of opinions that are portrayed in multilingual. Therefore, this paper aims to provide a systematic literature review on multilingual sentiment analysis, which summarises the common languages supported in multilingual sentiment analysis, pre-processing techniques, existing sentiment analysis approaches, and evaluation models that have been used for multilingual sentiment analysis. By following the systematic literature review, the findings revealed, most of the models supported two languages, and English is seen as the most used language in sentiment analysis studies. None of the reviewed literature has catered the combination of languages for English, Chinese, Malay, and Hindi language on multilingual sentiment analysis. The common pre-processing techniques for the multilingual domain are tokenization, normalization, capitalization, N-gram, and machine translation. Meanwhile, the sentiment analysis classification techniques for multilingual sentiment are hybrid sentiment analysis, which includes localized language analysis, unsupervised topic clustering, and then followed by multilingual sentiment analysis. In terms of evaluation, most of the studies used precision, recall, and accuracy as the benchmark for the results.

TI Language translation for file paths

CT 13th Annual DFRWS Conference
CY AUG 05-05, 2013
CL Monterey, CA
AB Forensic examiners are frequently confronted with content in languages that they do not understand, and they could benefit from machine translation into their native language. But automated translation of file paths is a difficult problem because of the minimal context for translation and the frequent mixing of multiple languages within a path. This work developed a prototype implementation of a file-path translator that first identifies the language for each directory segment of a path, and then translates to English those that are not already English nor artificial words. Brown's LA-Strings utility for language identification was tried, but its performance was found inadequate on short strings and it was supplemented with clues from dictionary lookup, Unicode character distributions for languages, country of origin, and language-related keywords. To provide better data for language inference, words used in each directory over a large corpus were aggregated for analysis. The resulting directory-language probabilities were combined with those for each path segment from dictionary lookup and character-type distributions to infer the segment's most likely language. Tests were done on a corpus of 50.1 million file paths looking for 35 different languages. Tests showed 90.4% accuracy on identifying languages of directories and 93.7% accuracy on identifying languages of directory/file segments of file paths, even after excluding 44.4% of the paths as obviously English or untranslatable. Two of seven proposed language clues were shown to impair directory-language identification. Experiments also compared three translation methods: the Systran translation tool, Google Translate, and word-for-word substitution using dictionaries. Google Translate usually performed the best, but all still made errors with European languages and a significant number of errors with Arabic and Chinese. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Label Attention Network for Structured Prediction
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Sequence labeling assigns a label to each token in a sequence, which is a fundamental problem in natural language processing (NLP). Many NLP tasks, including part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition, can be solved in a form of sequence labeling problem. Other tasks such as constituency parsing and non-autoregressive machine translation can also be transformed into sequence labeling tasks. Neural models have been shown powerful for sequence labeling by employing a multi-layer sequence encoding network. Conditional random field (CRF) is proposed to enrich information over label sequences, yet it suffers large computational complexity and over-reliance on Marko assumption. To this end, we propose label attention network (LAN) to hierarchically refine representation of marginal label distributions bottom-up, enabling higher layers to learn more informed label sequence distribution based on information from lower layers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LAN through extensive experiments on various NLP tasks including POS tagging, NER, CCG supertagging, constituency parsing and non-autoregressive machine translation. Empirical results show that LAN not only improves the overall tagging accuracy with similar number of parameters, but also significantly speeds up the training and testing compared to CRF.

The stream programming model consists of an extension to the C language and it's translation towards a streaming machine. The extensions will be a set of OpenMP-like directives. We show how a serial application can be converted into a streaming parallel application using the proposed annotations. We also show how the machine description can be used to parametrize a cost-model simulator to predict the performance of the stream program. The cost model allows the compiler to determine the best task partitioning and scheduling for each architecture.

AB Network Address Translation (NAT) is an address remapping technique placed at the borders of stub domains. It is present in almost all routers and CPEs. Most NAT devices implement Port Address Translation (PAT), which allows the mapping of multiple private IP addresses to one public IP address. Based on port number information, PAT matches the incoming traffic to the corresponding "hidden" client. In an enterprise context, and with the proliferation of unauthorized wired and wireless NAT routers, NAT can be used for re-distributing an Intranet or Internet connection or for deploying hidden devices that are not visible to the enterprise IT or under its oversight, thus causing a problem known as shadow IT. Thus, it is important to detect NAT devices in an intranet to prevent this particular problem. Previous methods in identifying NAT behavior were based on features extracted from traffic traces per flow. In this paper, we propose a method to identify NAT devices using a machine learning approach from aggregated flow features. The approach uses multiple statistical features in addition to source and destination IPs and port numbers, extracted from passively collected traffic data. We also use aggregated features extracted within multiple window sizes and feed them to a machine learning classifier to study the effect of timing on NAT detection. Our approach works completely passively and achieves an accuracy of 96.9% when all features are utilized.

AB Higher education at scale, such as in the California public post-secondary system, has promoted upward socioeconomic mobility by supporting student transfer from 2-year community colleges to 4-year degree granting universities. Among the barriers to transfer is earning enough credit at 2-year institutions that qualify for the transfer credit required by 4-year degree programs. Defining which course at one institution will count as credit for an equivalent course at another institution is called course articulation, and it is an intractable task when attempting to manually articulate every set of courses at every institution with one another. In this paper, we present a methodology towards making tractable this process of defining and maintaining articulations by leveraging the information contained within historic enrollment patterns and course catalog descriptions. We provide a proof-of-concept analysis using data from a 4-year and 2-year institution to predict articulation pairs between them, produced from machine translation models and validated by a set of 65 institutionally pre-established course-to-course articulations. Finally, we create a report of proposed articulations for consumption by the institutions and close with a discussion of limitations and the challenges to adoption.

AB The rapid development of deep learning has significantly bolstered the performance of natural language processing (NLP) in the form of language modeling. Recent advances in hardware security studies have demonstrated that hardware-based threats can severely jeopardize the integrity of computing systems (e.g., fault attacks for data at rest). Internal adversaries exploiting such hardware vulnerabilities are becoming a major security concern. Yet the impact of hardware faults on systems running NLP models has not been fully understood.
   In this paper, we perform the first investigation of hardware-based fault injections in modern neural machine translation (NMT) models. We find that compared to neural network classifiers (e.g., CNNs), fault attacks on NMT models present unique challenges. We propose a novel attack framework-NMT-Stroke-that can maliciously divert the translation of a victim NMT model by modeling memory fault injections with the rowhammer attack vector. We design a fault injection strategy to minimize bit flips needed, which would mislead the translation to an arbitrary natural output sentence. Our evaluation on state-of-the-art Transformer-based NMT models shows that NMT-Stroke can effectively induce the attacker-desired and linguistically sound translation by faulting minimal parameter bits. Our work highlights the significance of understanding the robustness of emerging NLP models with the presence of hardware vulnerabilities, which could lead to future new research directions.

SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
AB Intelligent education is an intelligent education platform that integrates correct education concept and Internet of things, big data, cloud computing and other technologies. This paper hopes to use the construction of the composition scoring model to further construct a computer scoring system for college English translation, which can give students a translation score and give feedback evaluation based on the quality of the translation. In this paper, according to the knowledge of the existing automatic scoring system at home and abroad, the feature selection method (TF-IDF, IG, CHI) is discussed and analyzed. Moreover, this paper studies the impact of our composition automatic scoring from the perspective of linguistics. In addition, this paper uses the multiple regression method to evaluate the final score. The features considered in this paper mainly include simple linguistic features and complex linguistic features. Finally, performance analysis of the algorithm model is performed by setting up a control experiment. The research results show that the proposed algorithm model has certain effects. The future trend is to form adult auxiliary machines through various human-computer interaction technologies, which will reshape future learning and education and form a new teaching form.

TI Korean Historical Documents Analysis with Improved Dynamic Word

SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Historical documents refer to records or books that provide textual information about the thoughts and consciousness of past civilisations, and therefore, they have historical significance. These documents are used as key sources for historical studies as they provide information over several historical periods. Many studies have analysed various historical documents using deep learning; however, studies that employ changes in information over time are lacking. In this study, we propose a deep-learning approach using improved dynamic word embedding to determine the characteristics of 27 kings mentioned in the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, which contains a record of 500 years. The characteristics of words for each king were quantitated based on dynamic word embedding; further, this information was applied to named entity recognition and neural machine translation.In experiments, we confirmed that the method we proposed showed better performance than other methods. In the named entity recognition task, the F1-score was 0.68; in the neural machine translation task, the BLEU4 score was 0.34. We demonstrated that this approach can be used to extract information about diplomatic relationships with neighbouring countries and the economic conditions of the Joseon Dynasty.

   In this paper, we alleviate this problem by means of 3D pose normalization using One-Class Support Vector Machines (OCSVM). In detail, we show how OCSVM are employed in order to increase the consistency of translation and scale normalization under articulations, extrusions or the presence of outliers. To estimate the relative translation and scale of an object, we use the 3D distribution of points that is modelled by employing OCSVM to estimate the decision surface corresponding to the surface points of the object under a preset tolerance to outliers. By discarding the outliers in the estimation of the object's center and size we compute the canonical pose of the core distribution that is less sensitive to intra-class shape variations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through the increased stability of translation and scale normalization and further justified by improving the precision of content-based 3D object retrieval.

AB NURBS interpolator has great advantages for machining complex part comparing to the simple linear and circular interpolator, such as reducing program size, smoothing tool motion and improving machining surface quality. However, the existing NURBS interpolators only deal with the case in which the NURBS trajectory is given in a customized NURBS G code. In addition, they are limited to three translation axes, which mean no rotation axes were considered so far. In this paper, a unified NURBS interpolator was developed to treat three kinds of situations so that NURBS interpolator can be thoroughly applied into five-axes machining. In first case, a NURBS curve converter was built to convert a series of linear and circular segments exactly to a NURBS trajectory. In second case, a series of linear and circular segments were fitted to a NURBS trajectory, which obtains the optimal smoothness instead of exactly representing. In third case, two kinds of NURBS G codes were proposed to represent NURBS trajectory directly, which includes both three translation axes and two rotation axes. Upon these three kinds of input NURBS trajectory, only one NURBS interpolator is designed, in which, most factors that influence the five-axes CNC machining performance are considered. Also, a three-steps NURBS interpolation algorithm was implemented inside the proposed interpolator. Two actual five-axes machining examples were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed interpolator.

AB Many computer controlled multi-axis machines operate under 'open loop' control. The exact position in space of the end effector cannot always be sensed directly. The controlling software makes a calculated estimate of where the tool head should be by monitoring sensors on axes that track linear translation and rotations of shafts/gears. For some applications this may be appropriate; however positional errors occur, and may accumulate. There exists a need for a sensor system that provides direct feedback of the end effector's spatial coordinates for machining and assembly applications.

Based on the functional description of ''state diagrams'' an approach is presented, which enables the extraction of diagnosis program structures. The semiautomatic translation from the controlling application Program is the base of the fault detection and the support of operator in starting up the machine. The solution is characterised by the use of ''availability graphs'', their hierarchy, and the search of paths in these nets. An example of a controller and a programming tool is presented.

AB Almost paradoxically, the globalization of the economy requires ever more localization of products and services, and thus translation of on-line and paper documents. Despite technological support, translation remains a difficult art, one poorly understood by most people, perhaps especially those who have never had to translate complex documents themselves. The paper reviews three enduring myths about the translation process, then proposes guidelines for the successful management or coordination of translation projects.
   Common misconceptions about translation are (1) that it is a straightforward, convergent, sentence-level process and, as such, can be entrusted to any native speaker or can be arbitrarily fragmented or iterated; (2) that it can be carried out satisfactorily by software applications, at least as a first draft, (3) that it is fully out of the control of anyone who does not speak the target language and thus must be delegated blindly to translators, not to say to any native speaker for editing and proofreading. A more effective approach is to see translation as rewriting in another language and apply to it the same proven principles as for writing: select the individuals with the appropriate skills for each part of the job (translation, editing, proofreading), provide guidelines before the job, and carry out quality control after the job.

AB While the World Wide Web provides a large amount of text in many languages, cross-lingual parallel data is more difficult to obtain. Despite its scarcity, this parallel cross-lingual data plays a crucial role in a variety of tasks in natural language processing with applications in machine translation, cross-lingual information retrieval, and document classification, as well as learning cross-lingual representations. Here, we describe the end-to-end process of searching the web for parallel cross-lingual texts. We motivate obtaining parallel text as a retrieval problem whereby the goal is to retrieve cross-lingual parallel text from a large, multilingual web-crawled corpus. We introduce techniques for searching for cross-lingual parallel data based on language, content, and other metadata. We motivate and introduce multilingual sentence embeddings as a core tool and demonstrate techniques and models that leverage them for identifying parallel documents and sentences as well as techniques for retrieving and filtering this data. We describe several large-scale datasets curated using these techniques and show how training on sentences extracted from parallel or comparable documents mined from the Web can improve machine translation models and facilitate cross-lingual NLP.

AB Transformer models (Vaswani et al., 2017) achieve remarkable success in Neural Machine Translation. Many efforts have been devoted to deepening the Transformer by stacking several units (i.e., a combination of Multi-head Attentions and FFN) in a cascade, while the investigation over multiple parallel units draws little attention. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Unit TransformErs (MUTE), which aim to promote the expressiveness of the Transformer by introducing diverse and complementary units. Specifically, we use several parallel units and show that modeling with multiple units improves model performance and introduces diversity. Further, to better leverage the advantage of the multi-unit setting, we design biased module and sequential dependency that guide and encourage complementariness among different units. Experimental results on three machine translation tasks, the NIST Chinese-to-English, WMT'14 English-to-German and WMT'18 Chinese-to-English, show that the MUTE models significantly outperform the Transformer-Base, by up to +1.52, +1.90 and +1.10 BLEU points, with only a mild drop in inference speed (about 3.1%). In addition, our methods also surpass the Transformer-Big model, with only 54% of its parameters. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the MUTE, as well as its efficiency in both the inference process and parameter usage.(1)

TI Solving Perspective-n-Point Problem in Variable Projection Framework
   Based on Wahba Problem
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB We propose an algorithm that solves the perspective-n-point problem in the framework of variable projection. The perspective-n-point is the problem of determining the rotation and translation parameters of a camera, which is widely used in computer vision, photogrammetry, robotics, space rendezvous and virtual reality. We separately estimate the rotation and translation parameters in the variable projection framework. Firstly, an optimal rotation matrix is solved by using the Wahba problem with fixed translation parameters. By applying the formula for the derivative of the singular value decomposition, the derivative of the optimal rotation matrix is calculated with respect to the translation parameters, then the derivative of the objective function with respect to the translation parameters is obtained. Finally, the objective function is minimized by Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm over the translation parameters. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is one of the most accurate and effective algorithms and has a large convergence basin.

AB All words in every natural language are ambiguous, specially when translation is at stake. In translation tasks, there is the need for finding out adequate translations for such words in the contexts where they occur. In this article, a bilingual strategy to cluster words according to their meanings is described. A publicly available parallel corpora sentence aligned is used. Word senses are discriminated by their translations and by the words occurring in a window, both in the source and target language parallel sentences. This strategy is language independent and uses a correlation algorithm for filtering out irrelevant features. Clusters obtained were evaluated in terms of F-measure (getting an average rating of 94%) and their homogeneity and completeness was determined using V-Measure (getting an average rating of 83%). Learned clusters are then used to train a support vector machine to tag ambiguous words with their translations in the contexts where they occur. This task was also evaluated in terms of F-measure and confronted with a baseline.

AB Our research focuses on the multilingual enhancement of ontologies that, often represented only in English, need to be translated in different languages to enable knowledge access across languages. Ontology translation is a rather different task then the classic document translation, because ontologies contain highly specific vocabulary and they lack contextual information. For these reasons, to improve automatic ontology translations, we first focus on identifying relevant unambiguous and domain-specific sentences from a large set of generic parallel corpora. Then, we leverage Linked Open Data resources, such as DBPedia, to isolate ontology-specific bilingual lexical knowledge. In both cases, we take advantage of the semantic information of the labels to select relevant bilingual data with the aim of building an ontology-specific statistical machine translation system. We evaluate our approach on the translation of a medical ontology, translating from English into German. Our experiment shows a significant improvement of around 3 BLEU points compared to a generic as well as a domain-specific translation approach.

TI Machine translation of easy-to-read and understand (EtR) texts: a
   comparative study
SO META
AB Over the last decade, controlled languages (CL) have received increased attention in machine translation (MT) research. The vast majority of studies have dealt with the impact of CLs on the quality of the final MT output, but very little work has focused on the impact of MT on the accessibility of target texts for people with special needs. This article represents a first attempt to bridge this gap. We present a comparative linguistic study that seeks to explore whether MT systems are a viable option for translating texts that are easy to read and understand (EtR). We tested DeepL, Google Translate, and Yandex with EtR texts from three different domains in four language pairs. Findings show that DeepL is the highest-performing system, and that Spanish and administrative texts in particular seem to present more challenges. The evaluation of the MT output in terms of linguistic accessibility indicates that the highest number of issues are found at a lexical and stylistic level. Although MT systems do not generate EtR texts of acceptable quality yet, our study highlights the potential of this tool, as well as the challenges of creating multilingual content that is accessible for all.

SO INTERACTING WITH COMPUTERS
AB Algorithms designed to translate textual content into sign language (SL) expressed through avatars have been used to reduce accessibility barriers. Our research aimed to identify whether the VLibras tool, widely adopted on Brazilian government websites, is an effective accessibility solution for automatic translation into SL. It is an exploratory and applied qualitative research project involving a bibliographic review and support from expert interpreters. We conducted two experimental studies using sequential chronological cuts and applying prescriptive and semantic analyses. We present evidence that there is no actual translation into SL in the automatic translation process performed by the VLibras translation algorithm (TA) but only a transposition of part of the SL lexicon to the Portuguese morphosyntactic structure. The automatic translation of long texts and texts with complex syntactic structures results in excessive pauses and dactylology for words that have a sign registered in the basic SL dictionary. Using human-computer interaction concepts to evaluate automatic translation into sign language by the VLibras TA expands the existing theoretical discussion. It also contributes to minimizing communication problems caused by the discrepancy between the original message and the machine translation, a practical applicability of this study.

TI Semantic Orientation of Crosslingual Sentiments: Employment of Lexicon

SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Sentiment Analysis is a modern discipline at the crossroads of data mining and natural language processing. It is concerned with the computational treatment of public moods shared in the form of text over social networking websites. Social media users express their feelings in conversations through cross-lingual terms, intensifiers, enhancers, reducers, symbols, and Net Lingo. However, the generic Sentiment Analysis (SA) research lacks comprehensive coverage about such abstruseness. In particular, they are inapt in the semantic orientation of Crosslingual based code switching, capitalization and accentuation of opinionative text due to the lack of annotated corpora, computational resources, linguistic processing and inefficient machine translation. This study proposes a Heuristic Framework for Crosslingual Sentiment Analysis (HF-CSA) and takes into consideration the NetLingua, code switching, opinion intensifiers, enhancers and reducers in order to cope with intrinsic linguistic peculiarities. The performance of proposed HF-CSA is examined on the Twitter dataset and the robustness of system is assessed on SemEval-2020 task9. The results show that HF-CSA outperformed the existing systems and reached to 71.6% and 76.18% of average accuracy on Clift and SemEval-2020 datasets respectively.

AB Terms extensively exist in specific domains, and term translation plays a critical role in domain-specific statistical machine translation (SMT) tasks. However, it's a challenging task to extract term translation knowledge from parallel sentences because of the error propagation in the SMT training pipeline. In this paper, we propose a simple, straightforward and effective model to mitigate the error propagation and improve the quality of term translation. The proposed model goes from initial weak monolingual detection of terms based on naturally annotated resources (e.g. Wikipedia) to a stronger bilingual joint detection of terms, and allows the word alignment to interact. The extensive experiments show that our method substantially boosts the performance of bilingual term detection by more than 8 points absolute F-score. And the term translation quality is substantially improved by more than 3.66% accuracy, as well as the sentence translation quality is significantly improved by 0.38 absolute BLEU points, compared with the strong baseline, i.e. the well tuned Moses.

AB The translation of comics (and Manga) involves removing text from a foreign comic images and typesetting translated letters into it. The text in comics contain a variety of deformed letters drawn in arbitrary positions, in complex images or patterns. These letters have to be removed by experts, as computationally erasing these letters is very challenging. Although several classical image processing algorithms and tools have been developed, a completely automated method that could erase the text is still lacking. Therefore, we propose an image processing framework called 'SickZil-Machine' (SZMC) that automates the removal of text from comics. SZMC works through a two-step process. In the first step, the text areas are segmented at the pixel level. In the second step, the letters in the segmented areas are erased and inpainted naturally to match their surroundings. SZMC exhibited a notable performance, employing deep learning based image segmentation and image inpainting models. To train these models, we constructed 285 pairs of original comic pages, a text area-mask dataset, and a dataset of 31,497 comic pages. We identified the characteristics of the dataset that could improve SZMC performance. SZMC is available at: https://github.com/KUR-creative/SickZil-Machine.

TI Efficient and Effective Misaligned Data Access Handling in a Dynamic
   Binary Translation System
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ARCHITECTURE AND CODE OPTIMIZATION
AB Binary Translation (BT) has been commonly used to migrate application software across Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs). Some architectures, such as X86, allow Misaligned Data Accesses (MDAs), while most modern architectures require natural data alignments. In a binary translation system, where the source ISA allows MDA and the target ISA does not, memory operations must be carefully translated. Naive translation may cause frequent misaligned data access traps to occur at runtime on the target machine and severely slow down the migrated application.
   This article evaluates different approaches in handling MDA in a binary translation system including how to identify MDA candidates and how to translate such memory instructions. This article also proposes some new mechanisms to more effectively deal with MDAs. Extensive measurements based on SPEC CPU2000 and CPU2006 benchmarks show that the proposed approaches are more effective than existing methods and getting close to the performance upper bound of MDA handling.

AB Speech translation (ST) is a subject of rapidly increasing interest in the area of speech processing research. This interest is apparent from the increasing tools and corpora for this task. However, the lack of sufficient datasets is still the biggest challenge for under-resourced languages. Specifically, ST requires a large corpus of parallel speech, transcription, and translation text. In this work, we construct a large corpus of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC), including simultaneous translation from Khmer into English and French. We also address the problem of sentence segmentation of Khmer by conducting a bilingual sentence alignment from English to Khmer with a monotonic assumption. This corpus has approximately 155 hours of speech in length and 1.7M words of text. We also report the baseline results of automatic speech recognition (ASR), machine translation, and ST systems, which show reasonable performance.

AB The introduction of parametric polymorphism in Java with translation approaches has been shown to be of considerable interest, allowing the definition of extensions of Java on top of the existing Virtual Machines. Homogeneous translations furthermore, seem to be more useful than heterogeneous, avoiding the continuous increase of library code with redundant information. At this time however, homogeneous approaches aren't as flexible as heterogeneous, with extensions failing to integrate well with base language typing. In this paper, using some of the features of the Core Reflection of Java, we introduce a homogeneous translation in which run-time information about instantiation of type-parameters is carried, allowing full integration of parameterized types with Java typing. Performance overhead is greatly decreased using a brand new translation technique based on the deferring of the management of type information at load-time. The same power and flexibility of previous heterogeneous approaches is obtained while maintaining homogeneous translation advantages.

TI Enhancing low-resource neural machine translation with syntax-graph
   guided self-attention
SO KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS
AB Most neural machine translation (NMT) models only rely on parallel sentence pairs, while the performance drops sharply in low-resource cases, as the models fail to mine the linguistry of the corpus. Incorporating prior monolingual knowledge explicitly, such as syntax, has been shown to be effective for NMT, particularly in low-resource scenarios. However, existing approaches have not exploited the full potential of the NMT architectures. In this paper, we present syntax-graph guided self-attention (SGSA): a neural network model that combines the source-side syntactic knowledge with multi-head self-attention. We introduce an additional syntax-aware localness modeling as a bias, which indicates that the syntactically relevant parts need to be paid more attention to. The bias is then incorporated into the original attention distribution to form a revised distribution. Moreover, to maintain the strength of capturing the meaningful semantic representations of source-sentence, we adopt a node random dropping strategy in multi-head self-attention subnetworks. Extensive experiments on several standard small-scale datasets demonstrate that SGSA can significantly improve the performance of Transformer-based NMT, and is also superior to the previous syntax-dependent state-of-the-art.

AB Attention-based Encoder-Decoder has the effective architecture for neural machine translation (NMT), which typically relies on recurrent neural networks (RNN) to build the blocks that will be lately called by attentive reader during the decoding process. This design of encoder yields relatively uniform composition on source sentence, despite the gating mechanism employed in encoding RNN. On the other hand, we often hope the decoder to take pieces of source sentence at varying levels suiting its own linguistic structure: for example, we may want to take the entity name in its raw form while taking an idiom as a perfectly composed unit. Motivated by this demand, we propose Multi-channel Encoder (MCE), which enhances encoding components with different levels of composition. More specifically, in addition to the hidden state of encoding RNN, MCE takes 1) the original word embedding for raw encoding with no composition, and 2) a particular design of external memory in Neural Turing Machine (NTM) for more complex composition, while all three encoding strategies are properly blended during decoding. Empirical study on Chinese-English translation shows that our model can improve by 6.52 BLEU points upon a strong open source NMT system: DL4MT(1). On the WMT14 English French task, our single shallow system achieves BLEU=38.8, comparable with the state-of-the-art deep models.

TI Ebaluatoia: crowd evaluation for English-Basque machine translation
SO LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
AB This work explores the feasibility of a crowd-based pair-wise comparison evaluation to get feedback on machine translation progress for under-resourced languages. Specifically, we propose a task based on simple work units to compare the outputs of five English-to-Basque systems, which we implement in a web application. In our design, we put forward two key aspects that we believe community collaboration initiatives should consider in order to attract and maintain participants, that is, providing both a community challenge and a personal challenge. We describe how these aspects can comply with a strict methodology to ensure research validity. In particular, we consider the evaluation set size and the characteristics of the test sentences, the number of evaluators per comparison pair, and a mechanism to identify dishonest participation (or participants with insufficient linguistic knowledge). We also describe our dissemination effort, which targeted both general users and interest groups. Over 500 people participated actively in the Ebaluatoia campaign and we were able to collect over 35,000 evaluations in a short period of 10 days. From the results, we complete the ranking of the systems under evaluation and establish whether the difference in quality between the systems is significant.

AB Neural transducers have been widely used in automatic speech recognition (ASR). In this paper, we introduce it to streaming end-to-end speech translation (ST), which aims to convert audio signals to texts in other languages directly. Compared with cascaded ST that performs ASR followed by text-based machine translation (MT), the proposed Transformer transducer (TT)-based ST model drastically reduces inference latency, exploits speech information, and avoids error propagation from ASR to MT. To improve the modeling capacity, we propose attention pooling for the joint network in TT. In addition, we extend TT-based ST to multilingual ST, which generates texts of multiple languages at the same time. Experimental results on a largescale 50 thousand (K) hours pseudo-labeled training set show that TT-based ST not only significantly reduces inference time but also outperforms non-streaming cascaded ST for English-German translation.

AB The search for conservative features that define the translation and transcription processes used by cells to interpret and express their genetic information is one of the great challenges in the molecular biology. Each transcribed mRNA sequence has only one part translated into proteins, called Coding Sequence. The detection of this region is what motivates the search for conservative characteristics in an mRNA sequence. In eukaryotes, this region usually begins with the first occurrence of the sequence of three nucleotides, being Adenine, Uracil and Guanine, the nucleotide set that it is called Translation Initiation Site. One way to look for conservative rules that define this region is to use the formal concept analysis that can have implications that indicate a coexistence between the positions of the sequence with the presence of the translation start site. This paper analyze the use of this technique to extract conservative rules to predict the translation initiation site in cukarvotes.

AB This paper describes the design and implementation of a research dynamic binary translation system, StarDBT, which runs many real-world applications. StarDBT is a multi-platform translation system that is capable of translating application level binaries on either Windows or Linux OSes. A system-level variant of StarDBT can also run on a bare machine by translating the whole system code. We evaluate performance of a user-mode system using both SPEC2000 and some challenging Windows applications. StarDBT runs the SPEC2000 benchmark competitively to other state-of-the-art binary translators. For Windows applications that are typically multi-threaded GUI-based interactive applications with large code footprint, the StarDBT system provides acceptable performance in many cases. However, there are important scenarios in which dynamic translation still incurs significant runtime overhead, raising issues for further research. The major overheads are caused by the translation overhead of large volume of infrequently-executed code and by the emulation overhead for indirect branches.

TI No Longer Lost in Translation: Evidence that Google Translate Works for
   Comparative Bag-of-Words Text Applications
SO POLITICAL ANALYSIS
AB Automated text analysis allows researchers to analyze large quantities of text. Yet, comparative researchers are presented with a big challenge: across countries people speak different languages. To address this issue, some analysts have suggested using Google Translate to convert all texts into English before starting the analysis (Lucas et al. 2015). But in doing so, do we get lost in translation? This paper evaluates the usefulness of machine translation for bag-of-words models such as topic models. We use the europarl dataset and compare term-document matrices (TDMs) as well as topic model results from gold standard translated text and machine-translated text. We evaluate results at both the document and the corpus level. We first find TDMs for both text corpora to be highly similar, with minor differences across languages. What is more, we find considerable overlap in the set of features generated from human-translated and machine-translated texts. With regard to LDA topic models, we find topical prevalence and topical content to be highly similar with again only small differences across languages. We conclude that Google Translate is a useful tool for comparative researchers when using bag-of-words text models.

AB Many endangered Uralic languages have multilingual machine readable dictionaries saved in an XML format. However, the dictionaries cover translations very inconsistently between language pairs, for instance, the Livonian dictionary has some translations to Finnish, Latvian and Estonian, and the Komi-Zyrian dictionary has some translations to Finnish, English and Russian. We utilize graph-based approaches to augment such dictionaries by predicting new translations to existing and new languages based on different dictionaries for endangered languages and Wiktionaries. Our study focuses on the lexical resources for Komi-Zyrian (kpv), Erzya (myv) and Livonian (liv). We evaluate our approach by human judges fluent in the three endangered languages in question. Based on the evaluation, the method predicted good or acceptable translations 77% of the time. Furthermore, we train a neural prediction model to predict the quality of the automatically predicted translations with an 81% accuracy. The resulting extensions to the dictionaries are made available on the online dictionary platform used by the speakers of these languages.

The goal of the VERBMOBIL project is the translation of spoken dialogues in the domains of appointment scheduling and travel planning. Starting with the Bayes decision rule as in speech recognition, we show how the required probability distributions can be structured into three parts: the language model, the alignment model and the lexicon model. We describe the components of the system and report results on the VERBMOBIL task. The experience obtained in the VERBMOBIL project, in particular a large-scale end-to-end evaluation, showed that the statistical approach resulted in significantly lower error rates than three competing translation approaches: the sentence error rate was 29% in comparison with 52% to 62% for the other translation approaches. Finally, we discuss the integrated approach to speech translation as opposed to the serial approach as it is widely used nowadays.

While multilingual models have shown to be useful for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT), this is the first time they are applied to the end-to-end ST problem. We show the effectiveness of multilingual end-to-end ST in two scenarios: one-to-many and many-to-many translations with publicly available data. We experimentally confirm that multilingual end-to-end ST models significantly outperform bilingual ones in both scenarios. The generalization of multilingual training is also evaluated in a transfer learning scenario to a very low-resource language pair. All of our codes and the database are publicly available to encourage further research in this emergent multilingual ST topic(1).

TI Data augmentation techniques in natural language processing
SO APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
AB Data Augmentation (DA) methods - a family of techniques designed for synthetic generation of training data - have shown remarkable results in various Deep Learning and Machine Learning tasks. Despite its widespread and successful adoption within the computer vision community, DA techniques designed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks have exhibited much slower advances and limited success in achieving performance gains. As a consequence, with the exception of applications of back -translation to machine translation tasks, these techniques have not been as thoroughly explored by the wider NLP community. Recent research on the subject still lacks a proper practical understanding of the relationship between the various existing DA methods. The connection between DA methods and several important aspects of its outputs, such as lexical diversity and semantic fidelity, is also still poorly understood. In this work, we perform a comprehensive study of NLP DA techniques, comparing their relative performance under different settings. We analyze the quality of the synthetic data generated, evaluate its performance gains and compare all of these aspects to previous existing DA procedures.(c) 2022 The Authors.

TI AUTOMATIC ALIGNMENT OF JAPANESE CHINESE BILINGUAL TEXTS
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB Automatic alignment of bilingual texts is useful to example-based machine translation by facilitating the creation of example pairs of translation for the machine.  Two main approaches to automatic alignment have been reported in the literature.  They are lexical approach and statistical approach.  The former looks for relationships between lexical contents of the bilingual texts in order to find alignment pairs, while the latter uses statistical correlation between sentence lengths of the bilingual texts as the basis of matching.  This paper describes a combination of the two approaches in aligning Japanese-Chinese bilingual texts by allowing kanji contents and sentence lengths in the texts to work together in achieving an alignment process.  Because of the sentential structure differences between Japanese and Chinese, matching at the sentence level may result in frequent matching between a number of sentences en masses.  In view of this, the current work also attempts to create shorter alignment pairs by permitting sentences to be matched with clauses or phrases of the other text if possible.  While such matching is more difficult and error-prone, the reliance on kanji contents has proven to be very useful in minimizing the errors.  The current research has thus found solutions to problems that are unique to the present work.

We collect key frames from several subjects at different times of day and for several days. We also collect testing Thai finger-spelling words video from 4 subjects. The system achieves 79.90% and 51.17% correct alphabet translation and the correct word translation, respectively, with the SIFT threshold of 0.7 and 1 nearest neighbor prototype. However, when we change the number of nearest neighbor prototypes to 3, the system yields 82.19% and 55.08% correct alphabet and correct word translation, respectively, at the same SIFT threshold. These results are comparable with the manually-picked Rframe translation system.

AB Most of the existing methods of document-level neural machine translation (NMT) integrate more textual information by extending the scope of sentence encoding. Usually, the sentence-level representation is incorporated (via attention or gate mechanism) in these methods, which makes them straightforward but rough, and it is difficult to distinguish useful contextual information from noises. Furthermore, the longer the encoding length is, the more difficult it is for the model to grasp the inter-dependency between sentences. In this paper, a document-level NMT method based on a routing algorithm is presented, which can automatically select context information. The routing mechanism endows the current source sentence with the ability to decide which words can become its context. This leads the method to merge the intersentence dependencies in a more flexible and elegant way, and model local structure information more effectively. At the same time, this structured information selection mechanism will also alleviate the possible problems caused by long-distance encoding. Experimental results show that our method is 2.91 BLEU higher than the Transformer model on the public dataset of ZH-EN, and is superior to most of the state-of-the-art document-level NMT models.

AB We propose a method for measuring communication efficiency from the viewpoint of conveying essential information in task-oriented spoken dialog translation. We present the results of one dialog experiment using speech-to-speech translation systems and a similar experiment using the Wizard of Oz method, which was carried out using hidden interpreters instead of a speech-to-speech translation system. We also present the relative performance score of the speech-to-speech translation system, which was obtained by comparing the machine's performance with that of humans, i.e., hidden interpreters. Finally, we discuss the relationship between users' linguistic behavior and system performance. We found that users of the system tended to make shorter utterances without decreasing the number of essential items needed to achieve a task and to improve transmission efficiency by using strategy to control dialogs.

TI Effective domain awareness and adaptation approach via mask substructure
   for multi-domain neural machine translation
SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
AB Multi-domain adaptation of neural machine translation (NMT) aims to learn a unified seq2seq framework based on multi-domain data. Domain corpus data mixing is one of the most important ways for multi-domain NMT, which has been widely explored in many recent works. However, due to the limitation of data mixing strategy, it often suffers from catastrophic forgetting problem or domain shift problem. To this end, we propose a domain-aware NMT with mask substructure. The mask substructure is employed in both Transformer-encoder and Transformer-decoder to capture domain-specific representations for each domain, then a domain fusion strategy is adopted to obtain a multi-domain adaptive NMT model. Our domain fusion framework could share domain-invariant knowledge and maintain domain-specific knowledge. We conduct extensive experiments on multi-domain NMT dataset, and the experimental results show significant improvements over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches by up to 1.1 BLEU points on 8 domains and up to 4.5 BLEU points on an unseen domain. Moreover, the in-depth analysis shows that our model can also effectively alleviate both catastrophic forgetting and domain shift problems.

AB In the present study, we propose novel sequence-to-sequence pre-training objectives for low-resource machine translation (NMT): Japanese-specific sequence to sequence (JASS) for language pairs involving Japanese as the source or target language, and English-specific sequence to sequence (ENSS) for language pairs involving English. JASS focuses on masking and reordering Japanese linguistic units known as bunsetsu, whereas ENSS is proposed based on phrase structure masking and reordering tasks. Experiments on ASPEC Japanese-English & Japanese-Chinese, Wikipedia Japanese-Chinese, News English-Korean corpora demonstrate that JASS and ENSS outperform MASS and other existing language-agnostic pre-training methods by up to +2.9 BLEU points for the Japanese-English tasks, up to +7.0 BLEU points for the Japanese-Chinese tasks and up to +1.3 BLEU points for English-Korean tasks. Empirical analysis, which focuses on the relationship between individual parts in JASS and ENSS, reveals the complementary nature of the subtasks of JASS and ENSS. Adequacy evaluation using LASER, human evaluation, and case studies reveals that our proposed methods significantly outperform pre-training methods without injected linguistic knowledge and they have a larger positive impact on the adequacy as compared to the fluency.

TI Image captioning: from structural tetrad to translated sentences
SO MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Generating semantic descriptions for images becomes more and more prevalent in recent years. Sentence which contains objects with their attributes and activity or scene involved is more informative and able to express more details of image semantic. In this paper, we focus on the generation of descriptions for images from the structural words we have generated, i.e., a semantically-layered structural tetrad of <object, attribute, activity, scene>. We propose to use deep machine translation method to generate semantically meaningful descriptions. In particular, the generated sentences describe objects with attributes, such as color, size, and corresponding activities or scenes involved. We propose to use a multi-task learning method to recognize structural words. Taking the words sequence as source language, we train a LSTM encoder-decoder machine translation model to output the target caption. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of using multi-task learning method to generate structural words, we do experiments on benchmark datasets, i.e., aPascal and aYahoo. We also use UIUC Pascal, Flickr8k, Flickr30k, and MSCOCO datasets to justify that translating structural words to sentences achieves promising performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods of image captioning in terms of language generation metrics.

TI Consolidation-Based Speech Translation and Evaluation Approach
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB The performance of speech translation systems combining automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) systems is degraded by redundant and irrelevant information caused by speaker disfluency and recognition errors. This paper proposes a new approach to translating speech recognition results through speech consolidation, which removes ASR errors and disfluencis and extracts meaningful phrases. A consolidation approach is spun off from speech summarization by word extraction from ASR I-best. We extended the consolidation approach for confusion network (CN) and tested the performance using TED speech and confirmed the consolidation results preserved more meaningful phrases in comparison with the original ASR results. We applied the consolidation technique to speech translation. To test the performance of consolidation-based speech translation. Chinese broadcast news (BN) speech in RT04 were recognized, consolidated and then translated. The speech translation results via consolidation cannot be directly compared with gold standards in which all words in speech are translated because consolidation-based translations are partial translations. We would like to propose a new evaluation framework for partial translation by comparing them with the most similar set of words extracted from a word network created by merging gradual summarizations of the gold standard translation. The performance of consolidation-based MT results was evaluated using BLEU. We also propose Information Preservation Accuracy (IPAccy) and Meaning Preservation Accuracy (MPAccy) to evaluate consolidation and consolidation-based MT. We confirmed that consolidation contributed to the performance of speech translation.

TI US voter rights in translation Semantic shifts in Spanish renderings of

SO TRANSLATION SPACES
AB Felons' voting rights have featured prominently in debates over voter suppression in the United States, particularly in Florida, where a 2018 state constitutional amendment reinstated voting rights to the state's 1.4 million former felons (Robles 2018). Florida also has a high concentration of Spanish-speaking voters with Limited English Proficiency (LEP), making Spanish-language voting information crucial. Inadequate translations of voter information may misrepresent voter eligibility for LEP Spanish-speaking former felons in Florida. Using a parallel corpus, this article's central research question investigates how semantic shifts occur in Spanish translations of "felony" and "felon" in online voter information for seven Florida counties. The results reveal a number of misrepresentative semantic shifts in both human- and machine-translated Spanish voter information. Such shifts may impinge on individuals' constitutional rights.

AB We analyze gait with the goal of identifying personal characteristics of individuals, such as gender. We use a novel representation to estimate the amount of translation and rotation in small patches throughout the image. Limb motion in a plane can be described using patterns of translation and rotation. We evaluate the usefulness of both rotation and translation to determine gender. Further, we wish to determine whether discrete portions of the gait cycle are best applied for gender recognition. We use independent components analysis to build a dictionary at each phase of the gait cycle. We train a support vector machine to classify male from female rising coefficients of independent components. Our experimental results suggest that determinants of gait play an important role in identifying gender. Further rotation and translation contains different information that is useful at different parts of the gait cycle.

AB In this paper, we propose a new approach for acquiring translation templates automatically from unannotated bilingual spoken language corpora. Two basic algorithms are adopted: a grammar induction algorithm, and an alignment algorithm using Bracketing Transduction Grammar. The approach is unsupervised, statistical, data-driven, and employs no parsing procedure. The acquisition procedure consists of two steps. First, semantic groups and phrase structure groups are extracted from both the source language and the target language through a boosting procedure, in which a synonym dictionary is used to generate the seed groups of the semantic groups. Second, an alignment algorithm based on Bracketing Transduction Grammar aligns the phrase structure groups. The aligned phrase structure groups are post-processed, yielding translation templates. Preliminary experimental results show that the algorithm is effective.

AB In the cross-language information retrieval environment, semantic ontology model matching and feature extraction are needed for semantic translation processing and semantic information analysis. Hence, the efficient model should be designed. There are some semantic conflicts in cross-semantic information retrieval database, which seriously affect the accuracy of language translation and information retrieval. Therefore, it is necessary to design the most relevant semantic translation in cross-language information retrieval. Voice is the most common way of communication so far. In this paper, speech signal analysis and extraction technology is used to improve the accuracy of art cross-language information retrieval. Experimental results show that the retrieval rate of the proposed method is higher than the traditional method. This study combines the art factor with the technology to reach the goal of the comprehensive analysis.

AB Autoregressive neural machine translation (NMT) models are often used to teach non-autoregressive models via knowledge distillation. However, there are few studies on improving the quality of autoregressive translation (AT) using non-autoregressive translation (NAT). In this work, we propose a novel Encoder-NAD-AD framework for NMT, aiming at boosting AT with global information produced by NAT model. Specifically, under the semantic guidance of source-side context captured by the encoder, the non-autoregressive decoder (NAD) first learns to generate target-side hidden state sequence in parallel. Then the autoregressive decoder (AD) performs translation from left to right, conditioned on source-side and target-side hidden states. Since AD has global information generated by low-latency NAD, it is more likely to produce a better translation with less time delay. Experiments on WMT14 En double right arrow De, WMT16 En double right arrow Ro, and IWSLT14 De double right arrow En translation tasks demonstrate that our framework achieves significant improvements with only 8% speed degeneration over the autoregressive NMT.

TI Directing and Understanding the Translation of a Single Molecule Dipole
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Understanding the directed motion of a single molecule on surfaces is not only important in the well-established field of heterogeneous catalysis but also for the design of artificial nanoarchitectures and molecular machines. Here, we report how the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) can be used to control the translation direction of a single polar molecule. Through the interaction of the molecular dipole with the electric field of the STM junction, it was found that both translations and rotations of the molecule occur. By considering the location of the tip with respect to the axis of the dipole moment, we can deduce the order in which rotation and translation take place. While the molecule-tip interaction dominates, computational results suggest that the translation is influenced by the surface direction along which the motion takes place.

AB Current research on spoken language translation (SLT) has to confront with the scarcity of sizeable and publicly available training corpora. This problem hinders the adoption of neural end-to-end approaches, which represent the state of the art in the two parent tasks of SLT: automatic speech recognition and machine translation. To fill this gap, we created MuST-C, a multilingual speech translation corpus whose size and quality will facilitate the training of end-to-end systems for SLT from English into 8 languages. For each target language, MuST-C comprises at least 385 hours of audio recordings from English TED Talks, which are automatically aligned at the sentence level with their manual transcriptions and translations. Together with a description of the corpus creation methodology (scalable to add new data and cover new languages), we provide an empirical verification of its quality and SLT results computed with strong baseline system on each language direction.

By translating any sequence of operations into a combinational circuit performing the same computation, one can speed up the system and reduce energy consumption, at the obvious price of extra area. We show what are the costs to implement this translation algorithm in hardware, and what are the performance and energy gains when using such technique. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this translation algorithm is particularly easy to be implemented in a stack machine, because of its particular computational method. Algorithms used in the embedded systems domain were accelerated 4.6 times in the mean, while spending almost 11 times less energy.

AB Neural Chat Translation (NCT) aims to translate conversational text between speakers of different languages. Despite the promising performance of sentence-level and context-aware neural machine translation models, there still remain limitations in current NCT models because the inherent dialogue characteristics of chat, such as dialogue coherence and speaker personality, are neglected. In this paper, we propose to promote the chat translation by introducing the modeling of dialogue characteristics into the NCT model. To this end, we design four auxiliary tasks including monolingual response generation, cross-lingual response generation, next utterance discrimination, and speaker identification. Together with the main chat translation task, we optimize the NCT model through the training objectives of all these tasks. By this means, the NCT model can be enhanced by capturing the inherent dialogue characteristics, thus generating more coherent and speaker-relevant translations. Comprehensive experiments on four language directions (English,German and English,Chinese) verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.

AB STEP-NC has the characteristics of workingsteps, which can be used easily in the intelligent CNC machining system. Based on the characteristics of STEP-NC data structure, an intelligent process planning system is presented in this paper. Geometric information translation, feature information extraction, process planning, STEP-NC file generation are all involved. The lexical analysis of the AP203 files, and the translation from AP203 to geometric information database are also studied. The proposed system maps a STEP AP224 data file, without using a complex feature recognition process, and produces the corresponding machining operations to generate the process plan and the corresponding STEP-NC file. The system carries out several stages of process planning such as operations selection, tool selection, machining parameters determination, machine tools selection and setup planning. A hybrid approach of most recent techniques (neural networks, fuzzy logic and rule-based) of artificial intelligence is used as the inference engine of the developed system. An example part is tested and the corresponding process plan is presented to demonstrate and verify the proposed intelligent CAPP system. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model produces state-of-the-art results in many question answering (QA) datasets, including the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD). This paper presents a query expansion (QE) method that identifies good terms from input questions, extracts synonyms for the good terms using a widely-used language resource, WordNet, and selects the most relevant synonyms from the list of extracted synonyms. The paper also introduces a novel QE method that produces many alternative sequences for a given input question using same-language machine translation (MT). Furthermore, we use a coreference resolution (CR) technique to identify anaphors or cataphors in paragraphs and substitute them with the original referents. We found that the QA system with this simple CR technique significantly outperforms the BERT baseline in a QA task. We also found that our best-performing QA system is the one that applies these three preprocessing methods (two QE and CR methods) together to BERT, which produces an excellent F-1 score (89.8 F-1 points) in a QA task. Further, we present a comparative analysis on the performances of the BERT QA models taking a variety of criteria into account, and demonstrate our findings in the answer span prediction task.

TI Multimodal Word Discovery and Retrieval With Spoken Descriptions and
   Visual Concepts
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB In the absence of dictionaries, translators, or grammars, it is still possible to learn some of the words of a new language by listening to spoken descriptions of images. If several images, each containing a particular visually salient object, each co-occur with a particular sequence of speech sounds, we can infer that those speech sounds are a word whose definition is the visible object. A multimodal word discovery system accepts, as input, a database of spoken descriptions of images (or a set of corresponding phone transcriptions) and learns a mapping from waveform segments (or phone strings) to their associated image concepts. In this article, four multimodal word discovery systems are demonstrated: three models based on statistical machine translation (SMT) and one based on neural machine translation (NMT). The systems are trained with phonetic transcriptions, MFCC and multilingual bottleneck features (MBN). On the phone-level, the SMT outperforms the NMT model, achieving a 61.6% F1 score in the phone-level word discovery task on Flickr30k. On the audio-level, we compared our models with the existing ES-KMeans algorithm for word discovery and present some of the challenges in multimodal spoken word discovery.

AB The present article discusses the use of Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) in a natural language processing task, namely the creation of a phrasing model which splits any sentence into linguistically-motivated phrases. This involves taking a limited-size training dataset, where sentences are split into syntactically motivated sentences, and learning how to best segment arbitrary sentences into their corresponding phrases. The extrapolation of phrases is needed in numerous applications involving the generation of texts in natural language. One such application is machine translation, namely the automatic translation of unconstrained text from a source language to a target language. The phrasing model to be learnt comprises a number of parameters which need to be optimized based on the training data. To that end, a machine learning approach has been developed, which is based on the concept of attractive and repulsive forces. Instead of previous efforts using manual tuning of the parameters, here PSO is used to achieve the optimization of the model parameters. Experimental results indicate that the proposed PSO approach is promising, giving the most accurate phrasing in this specific application, with statistically significant improvements over earlier results.

SO TRANSLATION SPACES
AB Translators have worked with the assistance of computers for many years, usually translating whole texts, divided into segments but in sequential order. In order to maximise efficiency and inspired by similar moves in the tech industry and predictions for Industry 4.0, large translation companies have begun to break tasks down into smaller chunks and to rigidly define and monitor translation processes. This is particularly true of platform-mediated work, highly collaborative workflows, and multimedia work that requires near-live turnaround times. This article considers such workflows in the context of measures of job satisfaction and discussion of sustainable work systems, proposing that companies prioritise long-term returns and attempt to balance the needs of all stakeholders in a translation process. Translators and translator trainers also have a role to play in achieving this balance.

AB We test the natural expectation that using MT in professional translation saves human processing time. The last such study was carried out by Sanchez-Torron and Koehn (2016) with phrase-based MT, artificially reducing the translation quality. In contrast, we focus on neural MT (NMT) of high quality, which has become the state-of-the-art approach since then and also got adopted by most translation companies.
   Through an experimental study involving over 30 professional translators for English!Czech translation, we examine the relationship between NMT performance and post-editing time and quality. Across all models, we found that better MT systems indeed lead to fewer changes in the sentences in this industry setting. The relation between system quality and post-editing time is however not straightforward and, contrary to the results on phrase-based MT, BLEU is definitely not a stable predictor of the time or final output quality.

AB This paper addresses a Korean-English machine translation system for scientific papers. The MT system is supported by CL (Controlled Language)-guided source language rewriting. After analyzing the translation errors of the system, we defined Korean rewriting rules to avoid the linguistic obstacles that may affect the translation accuracy. To support this, a Korean CL-checker was implemented. We showed that this CL-guided MT system can improve the translation accuracy by about 13% by adopting CL rewriting rules. However, this improvement is still not enough for various purposes, because most of the users of the MT system may want to submit the translated texts to a conference or an academic journal. As the MT output contains erroneous expressions, a language model module was added to the pattern-based MT engine. The system automatically detects expressions with low frequency and asks the authors to examine the translation. By adopting CL rewriting rules and language model module to the existing MT engine, almost "professional" translations can be obtained.

AB Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) enriches the source text with visual information for translation. It has gained popularity in recent years, and several pipelines have been proposed in the same direction. Yet, the task lacks quality datasets to illustrate the contribution of visual modality in the translation systems. In this paper, we propose our system under the team name Volta for the Multimodal Translation Task of WAT 20211 (Nakazawa et al., 2021) from English to Hindi. We also participate in the textual-only subtask of the same language pair for which we use mBART, a pretrained multilingual sequence-to-sequence model. For multimodal translation, we propose to enhance the textual input by bringing the visual information to a textual domain by extracting object tags from the image. We also explore the robustness of our system by systematically degrading the source text. Finally, we achieve a BLEU score of 44.6 and 51.6 on the test set and challenge set of the multimodal task.

AB End-to-end speech translation (ST), which directly translates from source language speech into target language text, has attracted intensive attentions in recent years. Compared to conventional pipeline systems, end-to-end ST model has potential benefits of lower latency, smaller model size and less error propagation. However, it is notoriously difficult to implement such model which combines automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) together. In this paper, we propose a knowledge distillation approach to improve ST by transferring the knowledge from text translation. Specifically, we first train a text translation model, regarded as the teacher model, and then ST model is trained to learn the output probabilities of teacher model through knowledge distillation. Experiments on English-French Augmented LibriSpeech and English-Chinese TED corpus show that end-to-end ST is possible to implement on both similar and dissimilar language pairs. In addition, with the instruction of the teacher model, end-toend ST model can gain significant improvements by over 3.5 BLEU points.

AB This paper outlines the first Asian network-based speech-to-speech translation system developed by the Asian Speech Translation Advanced Research (A-STAR) consortium. The system was designed to translate common spoken utterances of travel conversations from a certain source language into multiple target languages in order to facilitate multiparty travel conversations between people speaking different Asian languages. Each A-STAR member contributes one or more of the following spoken language technologies: automatic speech recognition, machine translation, and text-to-speech through Web servers. Currently, the system has successfully covered 9 languages - namely, 8 Asian languages (Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese) and additionally, the English language. The system's domain covers about 20,000 travel expressions, including proper nouns that are names of famous places or attractions in Asian countries. In this paper, we discuss the difficulties involved in connecting various different spoken language translation systems through Web servers. We also present speech-translation results on the first A-STAR demo experiments carried out in July 2009.

TI Beyond translation: engaging with foreign languages in a digital library
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON DIGITAL LIBRARIES
AB Digital libraries can enable their patrons to go beyond modern language translations and to engage directly with sources in more languages than any individual could study, much less master. Translations should be viewed not so much as an end but as an entry point into the sources that they represent. In the case of highly studied sources, one or more experts can curate the network of annotations that support such reading. A digital library should, however, automatically create a serviceable first version of such a multi-lingual edition. Such a service is possible but benefits (if it does not require) a new generation of increasingly well-designed machine-readable translations, lexica, grammars, and encyclopedias. This paper reports on exploratory work that uses the Homeric epics to explore this wider topic and on the more general application of the results.

The recent attention mechanism however removes the single point in the neural network from which the source sentence representation can be extracted. We propose several variations of the attentive NMT architecture bringing this meeting point back. Empirical evaluation suggests that the better the translation quality, the worse the learned sentence representations serve in a wide range of classification and similarity tasks.

AB Literary translation encompasses not only the communication of ideas across cultures but also the conversion of one word into another. The translation of Japanese literature will, therefore, undoubtedly convey this foreign culture. This study examines the semantic expression of words, the NN model for common sense reasoning, the method of building a common sense knowledge base, and the translation of Japanese literary language with an emphasis on the semantic expression and reasoning methods of natural language based on NN. The network structure, parameter processing, learning algorithm, and learning samples are all discussed in detail at the same time as the integrated NN model is presented. According to simulation results, this algorithm can achieve an accuracy of about 95% and a recall rate of about 96.5%. In addition to greatly enhancing the model's flexibility and popularity, this approach successfully addresses the issue of information loss. It can offer some references for both the translation of literary language and the understanding of natural language.

A person who is reading an English menu/sign and wants a Chinese translation of an English word or phrase or paragraph can use a Windows Phone to snap an image of the text, tap the word or swipe the phrase or circle the paragraph with a finger, and get a Chinese translation displayed on the screen of the phone. This is enabled by seamless integration of three Microsoft technologies: intelligent text extraction, OCR, and machine translation based on a client-plus-cloud architecture. The current prototype also supports Chinese OCR plus Chinese-to-English translation. In this paper, we highlight the UI design of the system and the corresponding user-intention guided text extraction approach to achieving a compelling user experience.

AB Machine learning algorithms learn a desired input-output relation from examples in order to interpret new inputs. This is important for tasks such as image and speech recognition or strategy optimisation, with growing applications in the IT industry. In the last couple of years, researchers investigated if quantum computing can help to improve classical machine learning algorithms. Ideas range from running computationally costly algorithms or their subroutines efficiently on a quantum computer to the translation of stochastic methods into the language of quantum theory. This contribution gives a systematic overview of the emerging field of quantum machine learning. It presents the approaches as well as technical details in an accessible way, and discusses the potential of a future theory of quantum learning.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely researched over the past decade. Recently, many research results of IoT related to emergency system, smart building and medical system, etc. The key for IoT applications are the ability to interact with physical world through computation, communication, and machine control. However, each sensor device in IoT cannot conveniently communicate with other terminal devices through internet protocol. So, it is necessary to establish protocol translation stack or equipment between two WSN groups. That is very inefficient and high overhead cost of network construction. The development of micro-IP (uIP) solves this problem. The uIP reduce cost of protocol translation and it also realizes the machine to machine (M2M) concept in wireless sensor network. Therefore, this paper proposes a solution for porting uIP library to the wireless sensor network devices and presents the integration of a speaker module and IPv6 ready sensor device.

AB Professional translators are highly multitasking agents whose job requires advanced language skills, advanced information literacy, and great technological and instrumental competence. Today they operate in and for an ever more technologized society, within a complex, competitive system of client and user expectations, tools, and new forms of organization and work conditions. This article explores the main industry-level, technological and social developments that have forced many translators to further resituate their practice as co-constructors of knowledge and co-communicators in today's media landscape. It argues that despite the challenges of powerful automatic implementation and the upsurge of volunteer crowdsourcers, professional translators will continue to adapt to evolving work conditions and emerging phenomena, moving the traditional boundaries of the practice and discipline of translation.

TI The mortal salto of deverbalisation
SO META
AB Contrary to what many linguists are led to think, and to what machine translation is bound to assume in its operations, the translation process does not follow a linear sequence of language transformations, presupposing phrasal equivalences from one language into another. The translation is characterized, most of the time, by discontinuity the transfer from the source language into the target language is operated by a rupture (saltus). A procedure of "deverbalization" (un-wording) occurs between the source text which is "no longer there" and the target text which is "not yet here." But the concept of "deverbalization" remains problematic, because meaning cannot exist without a medium, the nature of which is still to be determined. The prospective developments of cognitive sciences will have to afford the basis of an inductive translatology, meanwhile we have to think out the process of translation in the frame of a productive translatology.

AB Direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) models suffer from data scarcity issues as there exists little parallel S2ST data, compared to the amount of data available for conventional cascaded systems that consist of automatic speech recognition (ASR), machine translation (MT), and text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. In this work, we explore self-supervised pre-training with unlabeled speech data and data augmentation to tackle this issue. We take advantage of a recently proposed speech-to-unit translation (S2UT) framework that encodes target speech into discrete representations, and transfer pre-training and efficient partial finetuning techniques that work well for speech-to-text translation (S2T) to the S2UT domain by studying both speech encoder and discrete unit decoder pre-training. Our experiments on Spanish-English translation show that self-supervised pre-training consistently improves model performance compared with multitask learning with an average 6.6-12.1 BLEU gain, and it can be further combined with data augmentation techniques that apply MT to create weakly supervised training data.(1)

AB Reordering model adaptation remains a big challenge in statistical machine translation because reordering patterns of translation units often vary dramatically from one domain to another. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive discriminative reordering model (DRM) based on structural learning, which can capture correspondences among reordering features from two different domains. Exploiting both in-domain and out-of-domain monolingual corpora, our model learns a shared feature representation for cross-domain phrase reordering. Incorporating features of this representation, the DRM trained on out-of-domain corpus generalizes better to in-domain data. Experiment results on the NIST Chinese-English translation task show that our approach significantly outperforms a variety of baselines.

Sentence length models and lexicon-based models are combined under a maximum likelihood criterion. Specific models are proposed to handle insertions and deletions that are frequent in bilingual data collected from the web. The proposed approach is adaptive, updating the translation lexicon iteratively using the mined parallel data to get better vocabulary coverage and translation probability parameter estimation. Experiments are carried out on 10 years of Xinhua bilingual news collection. Using the mined data, we get significant improvement in word-to-word alignment accuracy in machine translation modeling.

TI Quality Assessment of SAR-to-Optical Image Translation
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images contain severe speckle noise and weak texture, which are unsuitable for visual interpretation. Many studies have been undertaken so far toward exploring the use of SAR-to-optical image translation to obtain near optical representations. However, how to evaluate the translation quality is a challenge. In this paper, we combine image quality assessment (IQA) with SAR-to-optical image translation to pursue a suitable evaluation approach. Firstly, several machine-learning baselines for SAR-to-optical image translation are established and evaluated. Then, extensive comparisons of perceptual IQA models are performed in terms of their use as objective functions for the optimization of image restoration. In order to study feature extraction of the images translated from SAR to optical modes, an application in scene classification is presented. Finally, the attributes of the translated image representations are evaluated using visual inspection and the proposed IQA methods.

In the proposed method, the pairs of new nominal MWEs and their possible translations are prioritized by referring to more than one thesaurus and considering the number of original MWEs from which a single new MWE is created. As a result, the pairs which are effective for improving translation quality, if registered in bilingual dictionaries, are acquired with an improvement of 55.0% for the top 500 prioritized pairs. This accuracy rate exceeds the one marked with the baseline method.

TI Understanding recurrent neural network for texts using English-Korean
   corpora
SO COMMUNICATIONS FOR STATISTICAL APPLICATIONS AND METHODS
AB Deep Learning is the most important key to the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). There are several distinguishable architectures of neural networks such as MLP, CNN, and RNN. Among them, we try to understand one of the main architectures called Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that differs from other networks in handling sequential data, including time series and texts. As one of the main tasks recently in Natural Language Processing (NLP), we consider Neural Machine Translation (NMT) using RNNs. We also summarize fundamental structures of the recurrent networks, and some topics of representing natural words to reasonable numeric vectors. We organize topics to understand estimation procedures from representing input source sequences to predict target translated sequences. In addition, we apply multiple translation models with Gated Recurrent Unites (GRUs) in Keras on English-Korean sentences that contain about 26,000 pairwise sequences in total from two different corpora, colloquialism and news. We verified some crucial factors that influence the quality of training. We found that loss decreases with more recurrent dimensions and using bidirectional RNN in the encoder when dealing with short sequences. We also computed BLEU scores which are the main measures of the translation performance, and compared them with the score from Google Translate using the same test sentences. We sum up some difficulties when training a proper translation model as well as dealing with Korean language. The use of Keras in Python for overall tasks from processing raw texts to evaluating the translation model also allows us to include some useful functions and vocabulary libraries as well.

TI Uses of Mobile Phone Language Translation Applications in Surgery
SO JOURNAL OF UROLOGICAL SURGERY
AB Globalization has resulted in the proliferation of multi-lingual communities worldwide. Local health agencies nowadays cater to the increasing demand for interpretation services, which can be an expensive effort. Professional interpretation services also have limitations in availability and convenience. With the widespread use of smartphones in the medical workplace, software applications with the ability to translate between languages represent a potentially convenient and inexpensive adjuvant to professional interpretation services. It may also be a useful option for clinicians working in rural areas devoid of professional interpreter services. Current data suggests that current translation software applications provide variable accuracy of translation depending on the language, some are acceptable and others are not. More research is required to improve the accuracy and consistency of these translation applications. Using these translation applications on mobile phones for minor or non-medicolegal tasks may help improve the efficiency of the health system by reserving professional interpreting services for important tasks with potential medicolegal implications.

AB Translation dynamics of field-reversed configuration (FRC) plasmas are studied in the FRC Injection Experiment (FIX) machine. FRC plasmas have been formed in, and launched from, a field-reversed theta-pinch source, and subsequently translated into reduced external magnetic fields. When translated into an adjacent confinement region, incident velocity of the formed FRC exceeds the Alfven velocity. Moreover, the translated FRC cools less than the prediction of an adiabatic theory. The plasma reflects from an external mirror, and some of its axial kinetic energy is lost during every reflection. In this reflection process, significant plasma heating is observed in the case where the translation velocity exceeds the sound velocity.

AB Traditional speech translation systems use a cascade manner that concatenates speech recognition (ASR), machine translation (MT), and text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis to translate speech from one language to another language in a step-by-step manner. Unfortunately, since those components are trained separately, MT often struggles to handle ASR errors, resulting in unnatural translation results. Recently, one work attempted to construct direct speech translation in a single model. The model used a multi-task scheme that learns to predict not only the target speech spectrograms directly but also the source and target phoneme transcription as auxiliary tasks. However, that work was only evaluated Spanish-English language pairs with similar syntax and word order. With syntactically distant language pairs, speech translation requires distant word order, and thus direct speech frame-to-frame alignments become difficult. Another direction was to construct a single deep-learning framework while keeping the step-by-step translation process. However, such studies focused only on speech-to-text translation. Furthermore, all of these works were based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) model. In this work, we propose a step-by-step scheme to a complete end-to-end speech-to-speech translation and propose a Transformer-based speech translation using Transcoder. We compare our proposed and multi-task model using syntactically similar and distant language pairs.

AB Alignment combination (symmetrization) has been shown to be useful for improving Machine Translation (MT) models. Most existing alignment combination techniques are based on heuristics, and can combine only two sets of alignments at a time. Recently in [1], we proposed a power mean based algorithm that can be optimized to combine an arbitrary number alignment tables simultaneously. In this paper we present an empirical investigation of the merits of the approach for combining a large number of alignments (more than 200 in total before pruning). The results of the study suggest that the algorithm can often improve the performance of speech to speech translation systems for low resource languages.

AB This paper presents a discriminative latent variable model (DPLVM) based classifier for improving the translation error detection performance for statistical machine translation (SMT). It uses latent variables to carry additional information which may not be expressed by those original labels and capture more complicated dependencies between translation errors and their corresponding features to improve the classification performance. Specifically, we firstly detail the mathematical representation of the proposed DPLVM method, and then introduce features, namely word posterior probabilities (WPP), linguistic features, syntactic features. Finally, we compare the proposed method with MaxEnt and SVM classifiers to verify its effectiveness. Experimental results show that the proposed DPLVM-based classifier reduce classification error rate (CER) by relative 1.75%, 1.69%, 2.61% compared to the MaxEnt classifier, and relative 0.17%, 0.91%, 2.12% compared to the SVM classifier over three different feature combinations.

TI Evaluating the Usefulness of Translation Technologies for Emergency
   Response Communication: A Scenario-Based Study
SO JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
AB Background: In the United States, language barriers pose challenges to communication in emergency response and impact emergency care delivery and quality for individuals who are limited English proficient (LEP). There is a growing interest among Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel in using automated translation tools to improve communications with LEP individuals in the field. However, little is known about whether automated translation software can be used successfully in EMS settings to improve communication with LEP individuals.
   Objective: The objective of this work is to use scenario-based methods with EMS providers and nonnative English-speaking users who identified themselves as LEP (henceforth referred to as LEP participants) to evaluate the potential of two automated translation technologies in improving emergency communication.
   Methods: We developed mock emergency scenarios and enacted them in simulation sessions with EMS personnel and Spanish-speaking and Chinese-speaking (Mandarin) LEP participants using two automated language translation tools: an EMS domain-specific fixed-sentence translation tool (QuickSpeak) and a statistical machine translation tool (Google Translate). At the end of the sessions, we gathered feedback from both groups through a postsession questionnaire. EMS participants also completed the System Usability Scale (SUS).
   Results: We conducted a total of 5 group sessions (3 Chinese and 2 Spanish) with 12 Chinese-speaking LEP participants, 14 Spanish-speaking LEP participants, and 17 EMS personnel. Overall, communications between EMS and LEP participants remained limited, even with the use of the two translation tools. QuickSpeak had higher mean SUS scores than Google Translate (65.3 vs 48.4; P=.04). Although both tools were deemed less than satisfactory, LEP participants showed preference toward the domain-specific system with fixed questions (QuickSpeak) over the free-text translation tool (Google Translate) in terms of understanding the EMS personnel's questions (Chinese 11/12, 92% vs 3/12, 25%; Spanish 12/14, 86% vs 4/14, 29%). While both EMS and LEP participants appreciated the flexibility of the free-text tool, multiple translation errors and difficulty responding to questions limited its usefulness.
   Conclusions: Technologies are emerging that have the potential to assist with language translation in emergency response; however, improvements in accuracy and usability are needed before these technologies can be used safely in the field.

AB In NMT, words are sometimes dropped from the source or generated repeatedly in the translation. We explore novel strategies to address the coverage problem that change only the attention transformation. Our approach allocates fertilities to source words, used to bound the attention each word can receive. We experiment with various sparse and constrained attention transformations and propose a new one, constrained sparsemax, shown to be differentiable and sparse. Empirical evaluation is provided in three languages pairs.

AB Statistical machine translation (SMT) is a fast-growing sub-field of computational linguistics. Until now, the most popular automatic metric to measure the quality of SMT is BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score. Lately, SMT along with the BLEU metric has been applied to a Software Engineering task named code migration. (In)Validating the use of BLEU score could advance the research and development of SMT-based code migration tools. Unfortunately, there is no study to approve or disapprove the use of BLEU score for source code. In this paper, we conducted an empirical study on BLEU score to (in)validate its suitability for the code migration task due to its inability to reflect the semantics of source code. In our work, we use human judgment as the ground truth to measure the semantic correctness of the migrated code. Our empirical study demonstrates that BLEU does not reflect translation quality due to its weak correlation with the semantic correctness of translated code. We provided counter-examples to show that BLEU is ineffective in comparing the translation quality between SMT-based models. Due to BLEU's ineffectiveness for code migration task, we propose an alternative metric RUBY, which considers lexical, syntactical, and semantic representations of source code. We verified that RUBY achieves a higher correlation coefficient with the semantic correctness of migrated code, 0.775 in comparison with 0.583 of BLEU score. We also confirmed the effectiveness of RUBY in reflecting the changes in translation quality of SMT-based translation models. With its advantages, RUBY can be used to evaluate SMT-based code migration models.

AB Generative machine learning models have recently been applied to source code, for use cases including translating code between programming languages, creating documentation from code, and auto-completing methods. Yet, state-of-the-art models often produce code that is erroneous or incomplete. In a controlled study with 32 software engineers, we examined whether such imperfect outputs are helpful in the context of Java-to-Python code translation. When aided by the outputs of a code translation model, participants produced code with fewer errors than when working alone. We also examined how the quality and quantity of AI translations affected the work process and quality of outcomes, and observed that providing multiple translations had a larger impact on the translation process than varying the quality of provided translations. Our results tell a complex, nuanced story about the benefits of generative code models and the challenges software engineers face when working with their outputs. Our work motivates the need for intelligent user interfaces that help software engineers effectively work with generative code models in order to under- stand and evaluate their outputs and achieve superior outcomes to working alone.

AB Back-translation has been proven to be an effective data augmentation method that translates target monolingual data into source-side to improve the performance of Neural Machine Translation (NMT), especially in low-resource scenarios. Previous researches show that diversity of the synthetic source sentences is essential for back-translation. However, the frequently used random methods such as sampling or noised beam search, although can output diverse back-translations, often generate noisy synthetic sentences. To alleviate this problem, we propose a simple but effective constraint random decoding method for back-translation. The proposed method is based on an automatic post-editing (APE) data augment framework, which incorporates fluency boost learning. Moreover, to increase the diversity of synthetic data and ensure quality, we proposed to use an evolution decoding algorithm. Compared with the original back-translation, our method can generate more diverse while less noisy synthetic sentences. The experimental results show that the proposed method can get 0.6 BLEU improvements on the WMT18 EN-DE news dataset and more than 0.4 BLEU improvements on the EN-ZH dataset which is in the medical field, respectively.

AB Recent work has shown that visual context improves cross-lingual sense disambiguation for nouns. We extend this line of work to the more challenging task of cross-lingual verb sense disambiguation, introducing the Multi-Sense dataset of 9,504 images annotated with English, German, and Spanish verbs. Each image in MultiSense is annotated with an English verb and its translation in German or Spanish. We show that cross-lingual verb sense disambiguation models benefit from visual context, compared to unimodal baselines. We also show that the verb sense predicted by our best disambiguation model can improve the results of a text-only machine translation system when used for a multimodal translation task.

AB Parse tree generation from supervised sentence is crucial as well as essential task necessary for natural language processing. Syntax analyzers play a vital role in natural language processing. Prevailing system for parse tree generation is subject to compromise on ambiguous situation. Our approach is to generate a parse tree using Hidden Markov bigram model from tagged sentence results in improved parse tree generation. The user will be given the sentence to be parsed after part of speech tagging. If the sentence is syntactically correct, the parser will generate a correct parse trace.

TI Analysis of Machine Translation and Post-Translation Editing Ability
   Using Semantic Information Entropy Technology
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Large-scale corpus application has presented MT with new opportunities as well as challenges in recent years. This study investigates MT and post-translation editing capability using AI technology. The grammar rules of the target language are first examined. Then, a significant amount of data on semantic information entropy are projected, and the semantic Gaussian marginal rectangular window function is obtained. The semantic correlation factors of words are added to the text information entropy and information gain, and the nonlinear spectral properties of adaptive matching semantics are obtained. In this way, it corrects the significant flaw in the way semantic features are extracted using conventional techniques. In order to speed up MT and enhance translation quality, this study proposes automatic post-translation editing to filter those common MT errors that occur frequently and regularly. According to the experimental findings, word translation and segmentation accuracy can both reach 95.27 and 93.12 percent, respectively. In terms of language translation, this approach is accurate and trustworthy. I hope it will serve as a useful source for subsequent research.

AB In this paper we focus on the effect of on-line speech segmentation and disfluency removal methods on conversational speech translation. In a real-time conversational speech to speech translation system, on-line segmentation of speech is required to avoid latency beyond few seconds. While sentential unit segmentation and disfluency removal have been heavily studied mainly for off-line speech processing, to the best of our knowledge, the combined effect of these tasks on conversational speech translation has not been investigated. Furthermore, optimization of performance given maximum allowable system latency to enable a conversation is a newer problem for these tasks. We show that the conventional assumption of doing segmentation followed by disfluency removal is not the best practice. We propose a new approach to do simple-disfluency removal followed by segmentation and then by complex-disfluency removal. The proposed approach shows a significant gain on translation performance of up to 3 Bleu points with only 6 second latency to look ahead, using state-of the art machine translation and speech recognition systems.

AB In order to improve the efficiency of human translation, there is an increasing interest in applying machine translation (MT) to computer assisted translation (CAT). The newly proposed CAT-oriented input method is such a typical approach, which can help translators significantly save keystrokes by exploiting MT deep information, such as n-best candidates, hypotheses and translation rules. In order to further save more keystrokes, we propose in this paper a novel MT evaluation metric for coordinating human translators with the input method. This evaluation metric takes MT deep information into account, and makes longer perfect fragments correspond to fewer keystrokes. Extensive experiments show that the novel evaluation metric makes MT substantially reduce the keystrokes of translating process by accurately grasping deep information for the CAT-oriented input method, and it significantly improves the productivity of human translation compared with BLEU and TER.

Therefore, the adjustment of byte packing order (endianness) is indispensable in cross-architecture binary translation if the source and target machines are of heterogeneous endianness, which may otherwise cause system failure. The issue is inconspicuous but may lead to significant performance bottleneck. This paper investigates the key aspects of endianness and finds several solutions to endian adjustment for cross-architecture binary translation. In particular, it considers the two principal methods of this field - byte swapping and address swizzling, and gives a comparison of them in our DBT (Dynamic Binary Translator) - CrossBit.

This paper proposes a simple method of fuzzy matching between query names and phones of candidate audio segments. This approach has the advantage of avoiding some word decoding errors in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Experiments on Mandarin-English CLSSR show that phone-based searching and conventional translation-based searching are complementary. Adding phone matching achieved 26.29% improvement on F-measure over searching on state-of-the-art Machine Translation (MT) output and 8.83% over Entity Translation (ET) output.

Regardless of the way we communicate that is via emails, website short tweets, video conferencing systems, social networking, blogs, instant messaging through websites or mobile applications, or texting only, we use a language that is processed by computer system. Thus, the keynote paper discusses language processing technologies as the core of any other communication between human beings or human-machine. From the user's perspective communication technologies simply integrate computer science and linguistics, but that is a very broad scope of knowledge. Technologies of a particular language rely on computational linguistics, natural language processing including also speech processing, information retrieval, knowledge acquisition and machine translation tools.

   Information
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB Neural network language models (LMs) are shown to be effective in improving the performance of statistical machine translation (SMT) systems. However, state-of-the-art neural network LMs usually use words before the current position as context and neglect global topic information, which can helpmachine translation (MT) systems to select better translation candidates from a higher perspective. In this work, we propose improvement of the state-of-the-art feedforward neural language model with topic information. Two main issues need to be tackled when adding topics into neural network LMs for SMT: one is how to incorporate topics to the neural network; the other is how to get target-side topic distribution before translation. We incorporate topics by appending topic distribution to the input layer of a feedforward LM. We adopt a multinomial logistic-regression (MLR) model to predict the target-side topic distribution based on source side information. Moreover, we propose a feedforward neural network model to learn joint representations on the source side for topic prediction. LM experiments demonstrate that the perplexity on validation set can be greatly reduced by the topic-enhanced feedforward LM, and the prediction of target-side topics can be improved dramatically with the MLR model equipped with the joint source representations. A final MT experiment, conducted on a large-scale Chinese-English dataset, shows that our feedforward LM with predicted topics improves the translation performance against a strong baseline.

Consequently, many Bangla-speaking people, who have limited command of English, face hurdles to utilize English resources. To bridge the gap between limited support and increasing demand, researchers conducted many experiments and developed valuable tools and techniques to create and process Bangla language materials. Many efforts are also ongoing to make it easy to use the Bangla language in the online and technical domains. There are some review papers to understand the past, previous, and future Bangla Natural Language Processing (BNLP) trends. The studies are mainly concentrated on the specific domains of BNLP, such as sentiment analysis, speech recognition, optical character recognition, and text summarization. There is an apparent scarcity of resources that contain a comprehensive review of the recent BNLP tools and methods. Therefore, in this paper, we present a thorough analysis of 75 BNLP research papers and categorize them into 11 categories, namely Information Extraction, Machine Translation, Named Entity Recognition, Parsing, Parts of Speech Tagging, Question Answering System, Sentiment Analysis, Spam and Fake Detection, Text Summarization, Word Sense Disambiguation, and Speech Processing and Recognition. We study articles published between 1999 to 2021, and 50% of the papers were published after 2015. Furthermore, we discuss Classical, Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches with different datasets while addressing the limitations and current and future trends of the BNLP.

AB How did the theory and practice of computing interact to generate a new discipline, computer science? Studying the French scene, in comparison with other countries, reveals that in most cases computing developed initially as an ancillary technique of applied mathematics, with little awareness of the path-breaking theories of computability elaborated in the 1930s. This was particularly clear in France, where mathematical logic was almost inexistent and disregarded by the Bourbaki group.
   It was only in the early 1960s that researchers in the emerging field of computing felt the need for theoretical models, and discovered the Turing machine and recursive functions. Simultaneously, an interest for language theories and information structures, fostered by practical projects such as machine translation, converged with issues raised by software development and the nascent theory of automata.
   The convergence of these diverse intellectual agenda was central in the process of construction of the new discipline.

AB Multimodal Neural Machine Translation is focusing on using visual information to translate sentences in the source language into the target language. The main idea is to utilise information from visual modalities to promote the output quality of the text-based translation model. Although the recent multimodal strategies extract the most relevant visual information in images, the effectiveness of using visual information on translation quality changes based on the text dataset. Due to this, this work studies the impact of leveraging visual information in multimodal translation models of ambiguous sentences. Our experiments analyse the Multi30k evaluation dataset and calculate ambiguity scores of sentences based on the WordNet hierarchical structure. To calculate the ambiguity of a sentence, we extract the ambiguity scores for all nouns based on the number of senses in WordNet. The main goal is to find in which sentences, visual content can improve the text-based translation model. We report the correlation between the ambiguity scores and translation quality extracted for all sentences in the English-German dataset.

AB To enable knowledge access across languages, ontologies that are often represented only in English, need to be translated into different languages. The main challenge in translating ontologies is to disambiguate an ontology label with respect to the domain modelled by ontology itself. Machine translation services may help in this task; however, a crucial requirement is to have translations validated by experts before the ontologies are deployed. For this reason, real-world applications must implement a support system addressing this task to relieve experts in validating all translations. In this paper we present the Expert Supporting System for Ontology Translation, called ESSOT, which exploits the semantic information of the label's context for improving the quality of label translations. The system has been tested within the Organic. Lingua project by translating the ontology labels in three languages. In order to evaluate further the effectiveness of the system on handling different domains, additional ontologies were translated and evaluated. The results have been compared with translations provided by the Microsoft Translator API and the improvements demonstrate a better performance of the proposed approach for automatic ontology translation.

TI Learning Neural Sequence-to-Sequence Models from Weak Feedback with
   Bipolar Ramp Loss
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB In many machine learning scenarios, supervision by gold labels is not available and consequently neural models cannot be trained directly by maximum likelihood estimation. In a weak supervision scenario, metric-augmented objectives can be employed to assign feedback to model outputs, which can be used to extract a supervision signal for training. We present several objectives for two separate weakly supervised tasks, machine translation and semantic parsing. We show that objectives should actively discourage negative outputs in addition to promoting a surrogate gold structure. This notion of bipolarity is naturally present in ramp loss objectives, which we adapt to neural models. We show that bipolar ramp loss objectives outperform other non-bipolar ramp loss objectives and minimum risk training on both weakly supervised tasks, as well as on a supervised machine translation task. Additionally, we introduce a novel token-level ramp loss objective, which is able to outperform even the best sequence-level ramp loss on both weakly supervised tasks.

It relies on a machine-learning technique that infers transducers from examples of bilingual word pairs; no additional resource or knowledge is needed. Then, these transducers, making the most of the high regularity of translation discovered in the examples, can be used to translate unseen French terms into English or vice versa. We report evaluations that show that this technique achieves high precision, reaching up to 85% of correct translations for both French to English and English to French tasks.

The computer-assisted translating process is not intended to create a perfect interpretation of a text but to produce a rough rendering of the content of a paper. Starting with the original text, a continuous data flow is effected into the translated version by means of hardware (scanner, personal computer, printer) and software (OCR, translation, word processing, DTP). An essential component of the system is a photogrammetric microdictionary which is being established at present. It is based on several sources, including e.g. the ISPRS Multilingual Dictionary.

SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Human evaluation of modern high-quality machine translation systems is a difficult problem, and there is increasing evidence that inadequate evaluation procedures can lead to erroneous conclusions. While there has been considerable research on human evaluation, the field still lacks a commonly accepted standard procedure. As a step toward this goal, we propose an evaluation methodology grounded in explicit error analysis, based on theMultidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework. We carry out the largest MQM research study to date, scoring the outputs of top systems from the WMT 2020 shared task in two language pairs using annotations provided by professional translators with access to full document context. We analyze the resulting data extensively, finding among other results a substantially different ranking of evaluated systems from the one established by the WMT crowd workers, exhibiting a clear preference for human over machine output. Surprisingly, we also find that automatic metrics based on pre-trained embeddings can outperform human crowd workers. We make our corpus publicly available for further research.

SO LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
AB Around the world, a growing interest has been seen in learner translator corpora, which are invaluable resources for teaching and research. This paper introduces a new resource to support researchers from different interdisciplinary areas such as computational linguistics, descriptive translation studies, computer-aided translation technology, Arabic machine translation applications, cognitive science, and translation pedagogy. Motivated by the lack of learner translator resources that provide data about learners of translation from and into Arabic, the undergraduate learner translator corpus (ULTC) is an ongoing, error-tagged sentence-aligned parallel corpus of English, Arabic, and French, with Arabic as its main language. The present corpus, consisting of parallel texts of female learners of translation from English or French into Arabic, is the first of its kind in terms of the languages represented, tasks covered, and number of students involved. It is also unique in terms of combining many complementary corpora of cross-lingual data, each of which has its own web-based query interface and corpus analysis tools. This paper describes the ULTC compilation process, preliminary findings, and planned future expansion and research.

AB The inconsistent distribution and representation of image and text make it quite challenging to measure their similarity, and construct correlation between them. Inspired by neural machine translation to establish a corresponding relationship between two entirely different languages, we attempt to treat images as a special kind of language to provide visual descriptions, so that translation can be conduct between bilingual pair of image and text to effectively explore cross-modal correlation. Thus, we propose Cross-modal Bidirectional Translation (CBT) approach, and further explore the utilization of reinforcement learning to improve the translation process. First, a cross-modal translation mechanism is proposed, where image and text are treated as bilingual pairs, and cross-modal correlation can be effectively captured in both feature spaces of image and text by bidirectional translation training. Second, cross-modal reinforcement learning is proposed to perform a bidirectional game between image and text, which is played as a round to promote the bidirectional translation process. Besides, both inter-modality and intra-modality reward signals can be extracted to provide complementary clues for boosting cross-modal correlation learning. Experiments are conducted to verify the performance of our proposed approach on cross-modal retrieval, compared with 11 state-of-the-art methods on 3 datasets.

TI A Novel Morphological Analysis based Approach for Dynamic Detection of
   Inflected Gujarati Idioms
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB The Gujarati language is primarily spoken by Gujarati people living in the state of Gujarat, India. It is the medium of communication in the state of Gujarat. In the Gujarati language, 'rudhiprayog' i.e. idiom is a very much popular form of expression. It represents the real flavour of the Gujarati language. The idiom is a group of words saying one thing literally but means something else when we explored it in context. Like Gujarati verbs, idioms can be written in many forms. Due to different morphological forms of the same Gujarati idiom, Gujarati idiom identification is a challenging task for any machine translation system (MTS). Accordingly many forms also make idiom translation more complicated. In the current paper, Gujarati idioms in their different inflected forms are collected, analyzed and classified based on ending words. After classifying idioms, their base or root forms are identified. Base idiom form and their possible idioms forms are morphologically analyzed and rules are generated based on the relationship between base form and possible inflected forms of idioms. These rules are used to generate possible idiom forms from the base idiom form. Gujarati idiom in any valid inflected form can be dynamically detected from the Gujarati input text using the proposed novel morphological analysis based approach. The results are encouraging enough to implement the proposed model of rules for natural language processing tasks as well as a machine translation system for Gujarati language idioms.

AB Unauthorized network address translation (NAT) devices may be a significant security problem. They provide unrestricted access to any number of hosts connecting to them. Some attackers may use computers hidden behind NAT devices to conduct malicious activities such as denial of service. An algorithm is proposed in this work to detect hosts hidden behind NAT. Different from previous researches, the algorithm does not depend on any special field in any packet header. It is based on analyzing traffic features with directed acyclic graph support vector machine (DAGSVM). Firstly, traffic models of hosts are selected from training samples with DAGSVM. Then the models and classifier are used for predicting host number of unknown traces. What revealed by the experiment includes that the proposed algorithm is effective, even when there are more hosts in the test set than it is in the training set, and the accuracy will fall when there are more unknown hosts in the test traces.

Machine Transliteration has been used extensively to assist machine translation, data mining, information retrieval and more recently in popular web portals, SMS and chat systems. In this paper, we propose a new method where transliteration problem is modeled as a sequence labeling problem and proceed to solve this by using Support Vector Machines (SVM). We have applied this technique for transliterating English to Tamil and achieved exact Tamil transliterations for 80% of English names. We get an accuracy of 88% when we choose from the first five ranked transliterations.

AB Dare to claim that the present age is the age of information and the need to use machine for processing and translating texts has become an undeniable need. One of the most important tasks which mostly affect the accuracy and quality of machine translation is word sense disambiguation (WSD) or choosing an appropriate sense for words that have multiple meanings. There are different views and a variety of methods that have been proposed for WSD. In this paper, we try to take advantage of supplementary information on ambiguous words included in the context and provide a scoring method to resolve the ambiguity in a knowledge based manner. For this purpose, we gather two lists of words; From WordNet, we extract related words of a sense and from the corpus, we select the words surrounding the target word. Finally, we achieved 80.1 % accuracy by applying the proposed method on TWA corpus, which is promising compared to the results obtained by similar methods in the literature.

TI Micrometer-Scale Translation and Monitoring of Individual Nanocars on
   Glass
SO ACS NANO
AB Nanomachines designed to exhibit controlled mechanical motions on the molecular scale present new possibilities of building novel functional materials. Single molecule fluorescence imaging of dye-labeled nanocars on a glass surface at room temperature showed a coupled translational and rotational motion of these nanoscale machines with an activation energy of 42 +/- 5 kJ/mol. The 3 nm-long dye-labeled carborane-wheeled nanocars moved by as much as 2.5 mu m with an average speed of 4.1 nm/s. Translation of the nanocars due a wheel-like rolling mechanism is proposed and this is consistent with the absence of movement for a three-wheeled nanocar analogue and the stationary behavior of unbound dye molecules. These findings are an important first step toward the rational design and ultimate control of surface-operational molecular machines.

TI Research on Intelligent Calibration of English Long Sentence Translation
   Based on Corpus
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB With the continuous promotion and development of the new curriculum reform, English teaching is becoming more practical and comprehensive. As an indispensable part of daily English topics, the use rate and scope of English attributive clauses are extensive. Moreover, due to English attributive provisions, the length of the whole English sentence will inevitably increase; therefore, we can accurately understand and translate sentences by mastering the translation and understanding details of attributive clauses. In addition, there are noticeable differences between English and Chinese in attributive clauses. Chinese will not add a variety of modifiers like English but will directly put them in front of them as attributives, so we should pay attention to this in translation. This process increases the difficulty of the English translation. Therefore, this paper proposes a Corpus-based intelligent calibration of English long sentence translation. Based on the construction of the English long sentence Corpus, an intelligent calibration algorithm for English long sentence translation is designed, and experiments verify the effectiveness of this method.

TI Fiber directional position sensor based on multimode interference
   imaging and machine learning
SO APPLIED OPTICS
AB A fiber directional position sensor based on multimode interference and image processing by machine learning is presented. Upon single-mode injection, light in multimode fiber generates a multi-ring-shaped interference pattern at the end facet, which is susceptible to the amplitude and direction of the fiber distortions. The fiber is mounted on an automatic translation stage, with repeating movement in four directions. The images are captured from an infrared camera and fed to a machine-learning program to train, validate, and test the fiber conditions. As a result, accuracy over 97% is achieved in recognizing fiber positions in these four directions, each with 10 classes, totaling an 8 mm span. The number of images taken for each class is merely 320. Detailed investigation reveals that the system can achieve over 60% accuracy in recognizing positions on a 5 mu m resolution with a larger dataset, approaching the limit of the chosen translation stage.

TI Brain-Computer Interface-Based Humanoid Control: A Review
SO SENSORS
AB A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) acts as a communication mechanism using brain signals to control external devices. The generation of such signals is sometimes independent of the nervous system, such as in Passive BCI. This is majorly beneficial for those who have severe motor disabilities. Traditional BCI systems have been dependent only on brain signals recorded using Electroencephalography (EEG) and have used a rule-based translation algorithm to generate control commands. However, the recent use of multi-sensor data fusion and machine learning-based translation algorithms has improved the accuracy of such systems. This paper discusses various BCI applications such as tele-presence, grasping of objects, navigation, etc. that use multi-sensor fusion and machine learning to control a humanoid robot to perform a desired task. The paper also includes a review of the methods and system design used in the discussed applications.

TI The Applicability of Artificial Intelligence in International Law
SO JOURNAL OF EAST ASIA AND INTERNATIONAL LAW
AB Law reacts to the progression of scientific technology in the end. Though conservative, changes are beginning to take place due to Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is automating conventional legal works, creating a new industry namely Legal-Tech. This paper investigates the characteristics and flow of legal-AI and computational law while focusing on the applicability of AI to international law. Mainly, the paper reviews three critical areas: dispute resolution, trial prediction, and machine translation, respectively. International law has different characteristics than the domestic law applied in each country. Unlike domestic law, international law has not been aggregated from a pandect, and it is a still daunting task to draw any meaningful insights for further analysis due mainly to limited data (i.e., trial cases and precedents). Nevertheless, AI is already penetrating the legal ecology system, and international law would eventually accept the influx of such changes exhibiting greater force.

AB Even the most cutting-edge communication-mediated technology like satellite navigation for orbit positioning, pedestrian movement recognition systems based on inertial sensors, 5G systems, let alone medical devices for coordination of human organs functionality would not be invented without technologies for language processing as an information source between humans and communication systems. Regardless of the way we communicate that is via emails, website short tweets, video conferencing systems, social networking, blogs, instant messaging through websites or mobile applications, or texting only, we use a language that is processed by computer system. Thus, the keynote paper discusses language processing technologies as the core of any other communication between human beings or human-machine. From the user's perspective communication technologies simply integrate computer science and linguistics, but that is a very broad scope of knowledge. Technologies of a particular language rely on computational linguistics, natural language processing including also speech processing, information retrieval, knowledge acquisition and machine translation tools.

AB Translation systems require a huge amount of parallel data to produce quality translations, but acquiring one for low-resource languages is difficult. To counter this, recent research has been shown to combine languages and use them to augment the low resource data, through transfer learning. While the gain in performance is apparent using transfer learning, we try to investigate the correlation between the performance gain and position of the concerned languages within a language family. We further probe and try to coordinate the performance gain with the degree of vocabulary sharing between the concerned languages.

AB Many English words appear in Asian language texts, especially in the news reports and technical documents. Although a foreign term and its counterpart in English refer to the same concept, they are erroneously treated as independent index units in traditional monolingual IR. For CLIR, one of the major hindrances to achieving retrieval performance at the level of monolingual information retrieval is the translation of terms in queries, which are not found in a bilingual dictionary. This paper describes the degree to which these problems arise in Korean Information Retrieval and suggests a novel approach to solve it. Experimental results based on NTCIR and KT-Set test collections show that the high translation precision of our approach greatly improves the IR performance.

AB Dynamic binary translation (DBT) transforms machine code at runtime into an optimzed form. DBT can have cross platform compatibility, better energy efficiency or improved performance as its goals. The goal of this work is to improve performance by executing perfomance critical parts of the binary code on a Coarse Grained Reconfigurable Array (CGRA). We show how the CGRA is integrated into the system and explain how performance critical parts of the binary code can be identified. We demonstrate the feasibility of a dynamic binary translation from RISC-V ISA to a CGRA, give details about the employed optimizations and show that the performance of a whole benchmark set can be improved by a factor of 1.7 without the need for any user intervention.

We first introduce features derived internal to the translation decoding process as well as externally from the source sentence analysis. We show the effectiveness of such features in both classification and regression of MT quality. By dynamically training the QE model for the document-specific MT model, we are able to achieve consistency and prediction quality across multiple documents, demonstrated by the higher correlation coefficient and F-scores in finding Good sentences. Additionally, the proposed method is applied to IBM English-to-Japanese MT post editing field study and we observe strong correlation with human preference, with a 10% increase in human translators' productivity.

AB We present an approach to improve statistical machine translation of image descriptions by multimodal pivots defined in visual space. The key idea is to perform image retrieval over a database of images that are captioned in the target language, and use the captions of the most similar images for crosslingual reranking of translation outputs. Our approach does not depend on the availability of large amounts of in-domain parallel data, but only relies on available large datasets of monolingually captioned images, and on state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks to compute image similarities. Our experimental evaluation shows improvements of 1 BLEU point over strong baselines.

AB The inability to model long-distance dependency has been handicapping SMT for years. Specifically, the context independence assumption makes it hard to capture the dependency between translation rules. In this paper, we introduce a novel recurrent neural network based rule sequence model to incorporate arbitrary long contextual information during estimating probabilities of rule sequences. Moreover, our model frees the translation model from keeping huge and redundant grammars, resulting in more efficient training and decoding. Experimental results show that our method achieves a 0.9 point BLEU gain over the baseline, and a significant reduction in rule table size for both phrase-based and hierarchical phrase-based systems.

TI Machine translation-assisted language learning: writing for beginners
SO COMPUTER ASSISTED LANGUAGE LEARNING
AB The few studies that deal with machine translation (MT) as a language learning tool focus on its use by advanced learners, never by beginners. Yet, freely available MT engines (i.e. Google Translate) and MT-related web initiatives (i.e. Gabble-on. com) position themselves to cater precisely to the needs of learners with a limited command of a second language (L2). Anecdotal classroom evidence points to beginners availing themselves of MT help, even against the advice of teachers. In order to find out whether MT could help develop learners' writing skills in L2, we ran some tests asking participants to write directly into L2 in one instance and into L1 in another, while pre-editing the L1 and post-editing the L2 within the MT's Tradukka. com interface. Analysis of the output produced has found that MT helps beginners to communicate more, particularly when they had a lesser mastery of the language. The less their mastery of the L2, the greater the difference between the number of words composed with the help of MT and the number of those written directly into L2. It also helped them to communicate better, with blind marking indicating higher quality when writing with MT mediation. Looking at the screen recordings, on the other hand, we found that writing directly into L2 requires more effort, as measured by number of pauses, and involves more engagement with the task, as measured by the number of editing interventions.

AB Image-to-image translation is a task of mapping an image in one domain to a corresponding image in another domain. The task includes various types of problems such as super-resolution, colorization, and artistic style transfer. In recent years, with the advent of deep learning, the technology has been rapidly advanced. The main purpose of this paper is to propose a tile art image generation method using machine learning approach based on conditional generative adversarial networks. To make the training data set of tile art images, we adopted a square-pointillism image generation method using the greedy approach. After training, the proposed network can generate tile art images that have the structure of tiles and reproduce the original images well. As regards generating time, the greedy approach takes 1322 seconds to generate tile art image of size 4096 x 3072, while the proposed machine learning approach takes 0.593 seconds.

TI Filament winding. Part 2: generic kinematic model and its solutions
SO COMPOSITES PART A-APPLIED SCIENCE AND MANUFACTURING
AB This paper (Part II) provides the continuation of 'Filament Winding Part I'. The main issue in Part II is the formulation and solution of the kinematic equations associated with filament winding. The basic geometry is a generic one; this implies that the method presented here should be suitable to deal with every possible winding machine configuration. However, in order to create a well-determined solution, various assumptions have been made, mainly regarding the coupling between the involved machine movements (translations and rotations). These couplings should preferably be derived by optimisation techniques. The solution method presented here can be characterised by robustness, improved accuracy and short calculation times. These properties make the method suitable for optimisation purposes. The obtained results clearly indicate that for a particular wound object geometry, the most suitable winding machine configuration is not always the lathe winder. In addition, the use of a lathe winder without cross-carriage is generally not feasible due to excessive feed eye translations. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We design a cascade system consisted of an ASR model, machine translation model and TTS model to convert the speech from one language into another language(en-de). For the ASR part, we find that better performance can be obtained by ensembling multiple heterogeneous ASR models and performing reranking on beam candidates. And we find that the combination of context-aware reranking strategy and MT model fine-tuned on the in-domain dataset is helpful to improve the performance. Because it can mitigate the problem that the inconsistency in transcripts caused by the lack of context. Finally, we use VITS model provided officially to reproduce audio files from the translation hypothesis.

AB Sentiment Analysis has been a keen research area for past few years. Though much of the exploration that has been done supports English language only. This paper proposes a method using which one can analyze different languages to find sentiments in them and perform sentiment analysis. The method leverages different techniques of machine learning to analyze the text. Machine translation is used in the system to provide with the feature of dealing with different languages. After the machine translation, text is processed for finding the sentiments in the text. With the advent of blogs, forums and online reviews there is substantial text present on internet that can be used to analyze the sentiment about a particular subject or an object. Hence to reduce the processing it is beneficial to extract the important text present in it. So the system proposed uses text summarization process to extract important parts of text and then uses it to analyze the sentiments about the particular subject and its aspects.

We participated in all five language tasks, placing first in each. Our approach involved a language-agnostic pipeline of three components: (1) building strong machine translation systems on general-domain data, (2) fine tuning on Duolingo-provided data, and (3) generating n-best lists which arc then filtered with various score-based techniques. In addition to the language-agnostic pipeline, we at tempted a number of linguistically-motivated approaches, with, unfortunately, little success. We also find that improving BLEU performance of the beam-search generated translation does not necessarily improve on the task metric-weighted macro F1 of an n-best list.

We focus on the interlingua design changes which were necessary to achieve high quality output in view of the language mismatches between English and Italian. The representation we propose contains features that are interpreted differently, depending on the translation direction. This decision simplified the process of creating the interlingua for individual sentences, and allows the system to defer mapping of language-specific features (such as tense and aspect), which axe realized when the target syntactic feature structure is created. We also describe a set of problems we encountered in translating modal verbs, and discuss the representation of modality in our interlingua.

TI Evaluating MT for massive open online courses: A multifaceted comparison
   between PBSMT and NMT systems
SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB This article reports a multifaceted comparison between statistical and neural machine translation (MT) systems that were developed for translation of data from massive open online courses (MOOCs). The study uses four language pairs: English to German, Greek, Portuguese, and Russian. Translation quality is evaluated using automatic metrics and human evaluation, carried out by professional translators. Results show that neural MT is preferred in side-by-side ranking, and is found to contain fewer overall errors. Results are less clear-cut for some error categories, and for temporal and technical post-editing effort. In addition, results are reported based on sentence length, showing advantages and disadvantages depending on the particular language pair and MT paradigm.

AB The wide use of abbreviations in modern texts poses interesting challenges and opportunities in the field of NLP. In addition to their dynamic nature, abbreviations are highly polysemous with respect to regular words. Technologies that exhibit some level of language understanding may be adversely impacted by the presence of abbreviations. This paper addresses two related problems: (I) expansion of abbreviations given a context, and (2) translation of sentences with abbreviations. First, an efficient retrieval-based method for English abbreviation expansion is presented. Then, a hybrid system is used to pick among simple abbreviation-translation methods. The hybrid system achieves an improvement of 1.48 BLEU points over the baseline MT system, using sentences that contain abbreviations as a test set.

TI Assessing gender bias in machine translation: a case study with Google
   Translate
SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
AB Recently there has been a growing concern in academia, industrial research laboratories and the mainstream commercial media about the phenomenon dubbed as machine bias, where trained statistical models-unbeknownst to their creators-grow to reflect controversial societal asymmetries, such as gender or racial bias. A significant number of Artificial Intelligence tools have recently been suggested to be harmfully biased toward some minority, with reports of racist criminal behavior predictors, Apple's Iphone X failing to differentiate between two distinct Asian people and the now infamous case of Google photos' mistakenly classifying black people as gorillas. Although a systematic study of such biases can be difficult, we believe that automated translation tools can be exploited through gender neutral languages to yield a window into the phenomenon of gender bias in AI. In this paper, we start with a comprehensive list of job positions from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and used it in order to build sentences in constructions like "He/She is an Engineer" (where "Engineer" is replaced by the job position of interest) in 12 different gender neutral languages such as Hungarian, Chinese, Yoruba, and several others. We translate these sentences into English using the Google Translate API, and collect statistics about the frequency of female, male and gender neutral pronouns in the translated output. We then show that Google Translate exhibits a strong tendency toward male defaults, in particular for fields typically associated to unbalanced gender distribution or stereotypes such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) jobs. We ran these statistics against BLS' data for the frequency of female participation in each job position, in which we show that Google Translate fails to reproduce a real-world distribution of female workers. In summary, we provide experimental evidence that even if one does not expect in principle a 50:50 pronominal gender distribution, Google Translate yields male defaults much more frequently than what would be expected from demographic data alone. We believe that our study can shed further light on the phenomenon of machine bias and are hopeful that it will ignite a debate about the need to augment current statistical translation tools with debiasing techniques-which can already be found in the scientific literature.

AB We propose Bilingually-constrained Recursive Auto-encoders (BRAE) to learn semantic phrase embeddings (compact vector representations for phrases), which can distinguish the phrases with different semantic meanings. The BRAE is trained in a way that minimizes the semantic distance of translation equivalents and maximizes the semantic distance of non-translation pairs simultaneously. After training, the model learns how to embed each phrase semantically in two languages and also learns how to transform semantic embedding space in one language to the other. We evaluate our proposed method on two end-to-end SMT tasks (phrase table pruning and decoding with phrasal semantic similarities) which need to measure semantic similarity between a source phrase and its translation candidates. Extensive experiments show that the BRAE is remarkably effective in these two tasks.

AB This paper defines the class of time-constrained applications: applications in which the user has limited time to process the system output. This class is differentiated from real-time systems, where it is production time rather than comprehension time that is constrained. Examples of time-constrained MT applications include the translation of multi-party dialogue and the translation of closed-captions. The constraints on comprehension time in such systems have significant implications for the system's objectives, its design, and its evaluation. In this paper we outline these challenges and discuss how they have been met in an English-Spanish MT system designed to translate the closed-captions used on television.

The approach consists of two main steps: First, a natural language processing method that deals with the rich morphology of Arabic language and second, the translation including word sense disambiguation. The main innovative features of this approach are the adaptation of the Naive Bayesian approach with new features to consider the Arabic language properties and the exploitation of a large parallel corpus to find the correct sense based on its cohesion with words in the training corpus. We expect that the resulting system will overcome the problem of the absence of the vowel signs, which is the main reason for the translation ambiguity between Arabic and other languages.

TI Human versus automatic quality evaluation of NMT and PBSMT
SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB Neural machine translation (NMT) has recently gained substantial popularity not only in academia, but also in industry. For its acceptance in industry it is important to investigate how NMT performs in comparison to the phrase-based statistical MT (PBSMT) model, that until recently was the dominant MT paradigm. In the present work, we compare the quality of the PBSMT and NMT solutions of KantanMTa commercial platform for custom MTthat are tailored to accommodate large-scale translation production, where there is a limited amount of time to train an end-to-end system (NMT or PBSMT). In order to satisfy the time requirements of our production line, we restrict the NMT training time to 4 days; to train a PBSMT system typically requires no longer than one day with the current training pipeline of KantanMT. To train both NMT and PBSMT engines for each language pair, we strictly use the same parallel corpora and the same pre- and post-processing steps (when applicable). Our results show that, even with time-restricted training of 4 days, NMT quality substantially surpasses that of PBSMT. Furthermore, we challenge the reliability of automatic quality evaluation metrics based on n-gram comparison (in particular F-measure, BLEU and TER) for NMT quality evaluation. We support our hypothesis with both analytical and empirical evidence. We investigate how suitable these metrics are when comparing the two different paradigms.

AB We present an unsupervised method for word sense disambiguation that exploits translation correspondences in parallel corpora. The technique takes advantage of the fact that cross-language lexicalizations of the same concept tend to be consistent, preserving some core element of its semantics, and yet also variable, reflecting differing translator preferences and the influence of context. Working with parallel corpora introduces an extra complication for evaluation, since it is difficult to find a corpus that is both sense tagged and parallel with another language; therefore we use pseudo-translations, created by machine translation systems, in order to make possible the evaluation of the approach against a standard test set. The results demonstrate that word-level translation correspondences are a valuable source of information for sense disambiguation.

TI Uniformly Interpolated Balancing for Robust Prediction in Translation
   eQuality Estimation: A Case Study of English-Korean Translation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB There has been growing interest among researchers in quality estimation (QE), which attempts to automatically predict the quality of machine translation (MT) outputs. Most existing works on QE are based on supervised approaches using quality-annotated training data. However, QE training data quality scores readily become imbalanced or skewed: QE data are mostly composed of high translation quality sentence pairs but the data lack low translation quality sentence pairs. The use of imbalanced data with an induced quality estimator tends to produce biased translation quality scores with "high" translation quality scores assigned even to poorly translated sentences. To address the data imbalance, this article proposes a simple, efficient procedure called uniformly interpolated balancing to construct more balanced QE training data by inserting greater uniformness to training data. The proposed uniformly interpolated balancing procedure is based on the preparation of two different types of manually annotated QE data: (1) default skewed data and (2) nearuniform data. First, we obtain default skewed data in a naive manner without considering the imbalance by manually annotating qualities on MT outputs. Second, we obtain near-uniform data in a selective manner by manually annotating a subset only, which is selected from the automatically quality-estimated sentence pairs. Finally, we create uniformly interpolated balanced data by combining these two types of data, where one half originates from the default skewed data and the other half originates from the near-uniform data. We expect that uniformly interpolated balancing reflects the intrinsic skewness of the true quality distribution and manages the imbalance problem. Experimental results on an English-Korean quality estimation task show that the proposed uniformly interpolated balancing leads to robustness on both skewed and uniformly distributed quality test sets when compared to the test sets of other non-balanced datasets.

AB Named entity translation plays an important role in many applications, such as information retrieval and machine translation. In this paper, we focus on translating person names, the most common type of name entity in Korean-Chinese cross language information retrieval (KCIR). Unlike other languages, Chinese uses characters (ideographs), which makes person name translation difficult because one syllable may map to several Chinese characters. We propose an effective hybrid person name translation method to improve the performance of KCIR. First, we use Wikipedia as a translation tool based on the inter-language links between the Korean edition and the Chinese or English editions. Second, we adopt the Naver people search engine to find the query name's Chinese or English translation. Third, we extract Korean-English transliteration pairs from Google snippets, and then search for the English-Chinese transliteration in the database of Taiwan's Central News Agency or in Google. The performance of KCIR using our method is over five times better than that of a dictionary-based system. The mean average precision is 0.3490 and the average recall is 0.7534. The method can deal with Chinese, Japanese, Korean, as well as non-CJK person name translation from Korean to Chinese. Hence, it substantially improves the performance of KCIR.

TI Detecting Symptom Errors in Neural Machine Translation of Patient Health
   Information on Depressive Disorders: Developing Interpretable Bayesian
   Machine Learning Classifiers
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
AB Background: Due to its convenience, wide availability, low usage cost, neural machine translation (NMT) has increasing applications in diverse clinical settings and web-based self-diagnosis of diseases. Given the developing nature of NMT tools, this can pose safety risks to multicultural communities with limited bilingual skills, low education, and low health literacy. Research is needed to scrutinise the reliability, credibility, usability of automatically translated patient health information.Objective: We aimed to develop high-performing Bayesian machine learning classifiers to assist clinical professionals and healthcare workers in assessing the quality and usability of NMT on depressive disorders. The tool did not require any prior knowledge from frontline health and medical professionals of the target language used by patients.Methods: We used Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) to increase generalisability and clinical interpretability of classifiers. It is a typical sparse Bayesian classifier less prone to overfitting with small training datasets. We optimised RVM by leveraging automatic recursive feature elimination and expert feature refinement from the perspective of health linguistics. We evaluated the diagnostic utility of the Bayesian classifier under different probability cut-offs in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios against clinical thresholds for diagnostic tests. Finally, we illustrated interpretation of RVM tool in clinic using Bayes' nomogram.Results: After automatic and expert-based feature optimisation, the best-performing RVM classifier (RVM_DUFS12) gained the highest AUC (0.8872) among 52 competing models with distinct optimised, normalised features sets. It also had statistically higher sensitivity and specificity compared to other models. We evaluated the diagnostic utility of the best-performing model using Bayes' nomogram: it had a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 4.62 (95% C.I.: 2.53, 8.43), and the associated posterior probability (odds) was 83% (5.0) (95% C.I.: 73%, 90%), meaning that approximately 10 in 12 English texts with positive test are likely to contain information that would cause clinically significant conceptual errors if translated by Google; it had a negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.18 (95% C.I.: 0.10,0.35) and associated posterior probability (odds) was 16% (0.2) (95% C.I: 10%, 27%), meaning that about 10 in 12 English texts with negative test can be safely translated using Google.

AB Large pose variation is considered a major research concern due to its significant impact on the performance of face recognition systems. In this paper, we present a new efficient Machine-Learning Based System that identifies a person's face in 3D under Large pose variation. The proposed system can automatically detect and recognize people under translations and rotation by leveraging the anthropometric methodology and geometric descriptors. We evaluated our system on three well-known 3D face databases: 3DFPE, GAVAB, and 3DFRAV. These databases have a considerable change in the position of the face, even for the same individual. Additionally, we use the ICP algorithm to align the face to the front view. Our experimental simulation results show that the proposed system posed great robustness for significant changes in the pose and proved its advantages over state-of-the-art systems in terms of identification accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity.

AB Providing access to information is the main and most important purpose of the Web. However, despite available easy-to-use tools (e.g., search engines, chatbots, question answering) the accessibility is typically limited by the capability of using the English language. This excludes a huge amount of people. In this work, we discuss Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems that aim at providing natural language access to data stored in Knowledge Graphs (KG). While several KGQA systems have been proposed, only very few have dealt with a language other than English. In this work, we follow our research agenda of enabling speakers of any language to access the knowledge stored in KGs. Because of the lack of native support for many languages, we use machine translation (MT) tools to evaluate KGQA systems regarding questions in languages that are unsupported by a KGQA system. In total, our evaluation is based on 8 different languages (including some that never were evaluated before). For the intensive evaluation, we extend the QALD-9 dataset for KGQA with Wikidata queries and high-quality translations. The extension was done in a crowdsourcing manner by native speakers of the different languages. By using multiple KGQA systems for the evaluation, we were enabled to investigate and answer the main research question: "Can MT be an alternative for multilingual KGQA systems?". The evaluation results demonstrated that the monolingual KGQA systems can be effectively ported to the new languages with MT tools.

SO ENTROPY
AB In recent years, the task of translating from one language to another has attracted wide attention from researchers due to numerous practical uses, ranging from the translation of various texts and speeches, including the so-called "machine" translation, to the dubbing of films and numerous other video materials. To study this problem, we propose to use the information-theoretic method for assessing the quality of translations. We based our approach on the classification of sources of text variability proposed by A.N. Kolmogorov: information content, form, and unconscious author's style. It is clear that the unconscious "author's" style is influenced by the translator. So researchers need special methods to determine how accurately the author's style is conveyed, because it, in a sense, determines the quality of the translation. In this paper, we propose a method that allows us to estimate the quality of translation from different translators. The method is used to study translations of classical English-language works into Russian and, conversely, Russian classics into English. We successfully used this method to determine the attribution of literary texts.

AB A lexical gap easily leads to word alignment errors, which impairs a translation quality. This paper proposes some simple ideas to resolve the difficulty of handling the lexical gap. In morphologically rich languages, a predicate has a complex structure consisting of many morphemes, so we mainly address the issue of how to group the component morphemes by employing morpho-syntactic filters and statistical information from the SMT phrase table. In addition, we abstract grouping results depending on a lexical choice of the target side to enhance translation probabilities. In the experiment, we not only investigate how each method has an effect on Korean-to-Vietnamese SMT, but also show a promising improvement of BLEU score.

AB In spoken communication, a speaker may convey their message in words (linguistic cues) with supplemental information (paralinguistic cues) such as emotion and emphasis. Transforming all spoken information into a written or verbal form is not trivial, especially if the transformation has to be done across languages. Most existing speech-to-text translation systems focus only on translating linguistic information while ignoring paralinguistic information. A few recent studies that proposed paralinguistic translation used a machine translation with hidden Markov model (HMM)-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) that were complicated and suboptimal. Furthermore, paralinguistic information was kept in the acoustic form. Here, we focused on transcribing paralinguistic acoustic cues of emphasis in the target language text. Specifically, we constructed cascade and direct neural Transformer-based speech-to-text translation, and we investigated various methods of expressing emphasis information in the written form of the target language. We performed our experiments on a Japanese-to-English linguistic and paralinguistic speech-to-text translation framework. The results revealed that our proposed method can translate both linguistic and paralinguistic information while keeping the performance as in standard linguistic translation.

We view MT models at various training stages (i.e., checkpoints) as human learners at different levels. Hence, we employ an ensemble of multi-checkpoints from the same model to generate translation sequences with various levels of fluency. From each checkpoint, for our best model, we sample n-Best sequences (n = 10) with a beam width = 100. We achieve 37.57 macro F-1 with a 6 checkpoint model ensemble on the official English to Portuguese shared task test data, outperforming a baseline Amazon translation system of 21.30 macro F-1 and ultimately demonstrating the utility of our intuitive method.

AB We present an efficient incremental top-down parsing method for preordering based on Bracketing Transduction Grammar (BTG). The BTG-based preordering framework (Neubig et al., 2012) can be applied to any language using only parallel text, but has the problem of computational efficiency. Our top-down parsing algorithm allows us to use the early update technique easily for the latent variable structured Perceptron algorithm with beam search, and solves the problem.
   Experimental results showed that the top-down method is more than 10 times faster than a method using the CYK algorithm. A phrase-based machine translation system with the top-down method had statistically significantly higher BLEU scores for 7 language pairs without relying on supervised syntactic parsers, compared to baseline systems using existing preordering methods.

TI Low-resource neural character-based noisy text normalization
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
AB User generated data in social networks is often not written in its standard form. This kind of text can lead to large dispersion in the datasets and can lead to inconsistent data. Therefore, normalization of such kind of texts is a crucial preprocessing step for common Natural Language Processing tools. In this paper we explore the state-of-the-art of the machine translation approach to normalize text under low-resource conditions. We also propose an auxiliary task for the sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) neural architecture novel to the text normalization task, that improves the base seq2seq model up to 5%. This increase of performance closes the gap between statistical machine translation approaches and neural ones for low-resource text normalization.

AB API documentation is useful for developers to better understand how to correctly use the libraries. However, not all libraries provide good documentation on API usages. To provide better documentation, existing techniques have been proposed including program analysis-based and data mining-based approaches. In this work, instead of mining, we aim to generate behavioral exception documentation for any given code. We treat the problem of automatically generating documentation from a novel perspective: statistical machine translation (SMT). We consider the documentation and source code for an API method as the two abstraction levels of the same intention. We use SMT to translate documentation from source code and vice versa. Our preliminary results show that the direction of statistical learning for inference between implementations and documentation is very promising.

It provides a description of the Information Structure Transfer (IST), a machine translation prototype designed within the framework of the Spoken Language Translator (SLT by SRI, Cambridge/Palo Alto) and based on the Core Language Engine ([I]). The IST includes two discourse-processing modules: the pre-transfer Information Structure Activator (ISA) and the post-transfer Information Structure Generator (ISG). The IST prototype calculates and processes vital features of information structure explored in context of structural differences between positional and non-positional languages. It offers algorithmic solutions and an implementation framework for local discourse processing in machine translation. Under scrutiny is a web of interrelated factors such as pronominalization, anaphora resolution, zero anaphors, definiteness and constituent order.

AB The scarcity of parallel data is a major obstacle for training high-quality machine translation systems for low-resource languages. Fortunately, some low-resource languages are linguistically related or similar to high-resource languages; these related languages may share many lexical or syntactic structures. In this work, we exploit this linguistic overlap to facilitate translating to and from a low-resource language with only monolingual data, in addition to any parallel data in the related high-resource language. Our method, NMT-Adapt, combines denoising autoencoding, back-translation and adversarial objectives to utilize monolingual data for low-resource adaptation. We experiment on 7 languages from three different language families and show that our technique significantly improves translation into low-resource language compared to other translation baselines.

TI AI-Based Heterogenous Large-Scale English Translation Strategy
SO MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB English has become one of the most widely used languages in the world. If there is no good translation mechanism for such a widely used language, it will bring trouble to both study and life. At present, the world's major platforms are committed to the study of English translation strategies. There are translation platforms from different regions and different translation mechanisms. These translation data from different translation platforms have the characteristics of large-scale, multisource, heterogeneity, high dimensions, and poor quality. However, such inconsistent translation data will increase the translation difficulty and translation time. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the quality of translation data to achieve a better translation effect. How to provide a large-scale and efficient translation strategy needs to integrate the translation strategies of various platforms to perform heterogeneous translation data cleaning and fusion based on machine learning. At first, this paper represents the multisource, heterogeneous translation data model as tree-augmented naive Bayes networks (TANs) and naturally captures the relationship between the datasets through the learning of TANs structure and the probability distribution of input attributes and tuples, using data probability value to complete the classification of translation data cleaning. Then, a multisource, heterogeneous translation data fusion model based on recurrent neural network (RNN) is constructed, and RNN is used to control the node data of hidden layer to enhance the fault-tolerant ability in the fusion process and complete the construction of fusion model. Finally, experimental results show that TANs-based translation data cleaning method can effectively improve the cleaning rate with an average improvement of approximately 10% and cleaning time with an average reduce about 5%. In addition, RNN-based multisource translation data fusion method improves the shortcomings of the traditional fusion model and improves the practicability of the fusion model in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), fusion time, and integrity.

AB In this paper, a systematic methodology, based on the theory of reciprocal screws, is presented for structure synthesis of 3-DoF translation parallel manipulators without singularities, which are main defaults of parallel manipulators. By given a system of orthogonal wrenches of constraints, the corresponding reciprocal basis screws are determined according to this method. Then, the joint screw of a limb is obtained by a linear combination of these basis screws. Feasible limbs that can be used for structure of translation platform without singularities are enumerated according to the type of constraint and the number of joints making up the limbs. Further, geometrical conditions for parallel manipulators to possess finite translation motion without singularities are presented. Several novel machines that satisfied design requirements are sketched as example.

AB The ability to reason about tabular or semi-structured knowledge is a fundamental problem for today's Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. While significant progress has been achieved in the direction of tabular reasoning, these advances are limited to English due to the absence of multilingual benchmark datasets for semi-structured data. In this paper, we use machine translation methods to construct a multilingual tabular natural language inference (TNLI) dataset, namely XINFOTABS, which expands the English TNLI dataset of INFOTABS to ten diverse languages. We also present several baselines for multilingual tabular reasoning, e.g., machine translation-based methods and cross-lingual TNLI. We discover that the XINFOTABS evaluation suite is both practical and challenging. As a result, this dataset will contribute to increased linguistic inclusion in tabular reasoning research and applications.

Firstly, we connect the phenomenon of hallucinations under source perturbation to the Long-Tail theory of Feldman (2020), and present an empirically validated hypothesis that explains hallucinations under source perturbation. Secondly, we consider hallucinations under corpus-level noise (without any source perturbation) and demonstrate that two prominent types of natural hallucinations (detached and oscillatory outputs) could be generated and explained through specific corpus-level noise patterns. Finally, we elucidate the phenomenon of hallucination amplification in popular data-generation processes such as Backtranslation and sequence-level Knowledge Distillation. We have released the datasets and code to replicate our results at https: //github . com/vyraun/hallucinations.

Following the approach of PARANMT (Wieting and Gimpel, 2018), we train a Czech-English neural machine translation (NMT) system to generate novel paraphrases of English reference sentences. By adding lexical constraints to the NMT decoding procedure, however, we are able to produce multiple high-quality sentential paraphrases per source sentence, yielding an English paraphrase resource with more than 4 billion generated tokens and exhibiting greater lexical diversity. Using human judgments, we also demonstrate that PARABANK's paraphrases improve over PARANMT on both semantic similarity and fluency. Finally, we use PARABANK to train a monolingual NMT model with the same support for lexically-constrained decoding for sentence rewriting tasks.

The adding machine f (K) is the addition-by-one map on Sigma(K) .

In this paper, we have a further discussion about semi-conjugate relationship between adding machines, and give some necessary and sufficient conditions for an adding machine to be semi-conjugate to another one. Moveover, we also prove that a transitive translation on a compact subgroup of Sigma(K) is isometrically conjugate to an adding machine.

AB Parallel kinematics machines (PKM) are interesting alternative designs for high-speed machining applications since they offer several advantages over their serial counterparts like high stiffness, improved dynamic characteristics, high accuracy and high structural rigidity. Conventional parallel kinematic machines are designed to have 3-DOF; however, in this work, two additional degrees of freedom have been incorporated with the movement of the base in X- and Y-direction. The configuration of 3-DOF parallel manipulator used here is 3-RPS. This paper presents a type of 5-DOF parallel kinematic machine tool architecture on which the parallel manipulator with 3-DOF sliding on the frame structure of machine tool is responsible for the translation along X-direction and Y-direction. Workspace analysis of this mechanism is proposed so as to know the reach of the tool for complex machining operations. Quantitative improvement in reachable volume over conventional 3-DOF is presented.

AB Machine learning has transformed domains like vision and translation, and is now increasingly used in science, where the correctness of such code is vital. Python is popular for machine learning, in part because of its wealth of machine learning libraries, and is felt to make development faster; however, this dynamic language has less support for error detection at code creation time than tools like Eclipse. This is especially problematic for machine learning: given its statistical nature, code with subtle errors may run and produce results that look plausible but are meaningless. This can vitiate scientific results. We report on Ariadne: applying a static framework, WALA, to machine learning code that uses TensorFlow. We have created static analysis for Python, a type system for tracking tensors-Tensorflow's core data structures-and a data flow analysis to track their usage. We report on how it was built and present some early results.

AB The categorical combinatory logic CCL/beta eta SP is a combinatory logic motivated by the cartesian closed category, proposed by Pierre-Louis Curien. The combinatory logic is used for modeling of the lambda calculus and gives a design of an abstract machine, the Categorical Abstract Machine (CAM). The first-class environment is a mechanism in programming languages which enables us to manipulate an environment, that is, a mapping of variables to bound values. We have studied the lambda calculus with first-class environments for several years.
   In this paper, we depict that the first-class environment indwells in the categorical combinatory logic, giving the translation of the simply -typed lambda calculus with first-class environments into the categorical combinatory logic. We show the translation respects the typing and the reduction.

AB We describe a streamlined knowledge acquisition method for semi-automatically constructing knowledge bases for a knowledge Based Machine Translation (KBMT) system. This method forms the basis of a very simple Java-based user interface that enables a language expert to build lexical and syntactic transfer knowledge bases without extensive specialized training as an MT system builder. Following [Wu 1997], we assume that the permutation of binary-branching structures is a sufficient reordering mechanism for MT. Our syntactic knowledge is based on a novel, highly constrained grammar construction environment in which the only re-ordering mechanism is the permutation of binary-branching structures (Twisted Pair Grammar). We describe preliminary results for several fully implemented components of a Hindi/Urdu to English MT prototype being built with this interface.(1)

AB When performing cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) for lower-resourced languages, a common approach is to retrieve over the output of machine translation (MT). However, there is no established guidance on how to optimize the resulting MT-IR system. In this paper, we examine the relationship between the performance of MT systems and both neural and term frequency-based IR models to identify how CLIR performance can be best predicted from MT quality. We explore performance at varying amounts of MT training data, byte pair encoding (BPE) merge operations, and across two IR collections and retrieval models. We find that the choice of IR collection can substantially affect the predictive power of MT tuning decisions and evaluation, potentially introducing dissociations between MT-only and overall CLIR performance.

TI Binarization of Synchronous Context-Free Grammars
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB Systems based on synchronous grammars and tree transducers promise to improve the quality of statistical machine translation output, but are often very computationally intensive. The complexity is exponential in the size of individual grammar rules due to arbitrary re-orderings between the two languages. We develop a theory of binarization for synchronous context-free grammars and present a linear-time algorithm for binarizing synchronous rules when possible. In our large-scale experiments, we found that almost all rules are binarizable and the resulting binarized rule set significantly improves the speed and accuracy of a state-of-the-art syntax-based machine translation system. We also discuss the more general, and computationally more difficult, problem of finding good parsing strategies for non-binarizable rules, and present an approximate polynomial-time algorithm for this problem.

Language technology solutions are particularly important for languages that are small in size. This paper aims to analyze representation of languages of Baltic countries Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian in digital environment. We analyze technological challenges for these languages and most important achievements (recently created language resources and tools) that help to narrow technological gap with widely used languages, facilitate use of the natural language in interaction between computer and human, and minimize threat of digital extinction. Special attention is paid to the natural language understanding task, machine translation and speech technologies.

TI Syntax-Based Translation With Bilingually Lexicalized Synchronous Tree
   Substitution Grammars
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Syntax-based models can significantly improve the translation performance due to their grammatical modeling on one or both language side(s). However, the translation rules such as the non-lexical rule "VP -> (x(0)x(1), VP : x(1)PP : x(0))" in string-to-tree models do not consider any lexicalized information on the source or target side. The rule is so generalized that any subtree rooted at VP can substitute for the nonterminal VP : x(1). Because rules containing nonterminals are frequently used when generating the target-side tree structures, there is a risk that rules of this type will potentially be severely misused in decoding due to a lack of lexicalization guidance. In this article, inspired by lexicalized PCFG, which is widely used in monolingual parsing, we propose to upgrade the STSG (synchronous tree substitution grammars)-based syntax translation model with bilingually lexicalized STSG. Using the string-to-tree translation model as a case study, we present generative and discriminative models to integrate lexicalized STSG into the translation model. Both small- and large-scale experiments on Chinese-to-English translation demonstrate that the proposed lexicalized STSG can provide superior rule selection in decoding and substantially improve the translation quality.

AB For over ten years, Ford Vehicle Operations has utilized an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system to assist in the creation and maintenance of process build instructions for our vehicle assembly plants. This system, known as the Direct Labor Management System, utilizes a restricted subset of English called Standard Language as a tool for the writing of process build instructions for the North American plants. The expansion of DLMS beyond North America as part of the Global Study Process Allocation System (GSPAS) required us to develop a method to translate these build instructions from English to other languages. This Machine Translation process, developed in conjunction with SYSTRAN, has allowed us to develop a system to automatically translate vehicle assembly build instructions for our plants in Europe and South America.

AB Human translators often resort to different non-literal translation techniques besides the literal translation, such as idiom equivalence, generalization, particularization, semantic modulation, etc., especially when the source and target languages have different and distant origins. Translation techniques constitute an important subject in translation studies, which help researchers to understand and analyse translated texts. However, they receive less attention in developing Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. To fill this gap, one of our long term objectives is to have a better semantic control of extracting paraphrases from bilingual parallel corpora. Based on this goal, we suggest this hypothesis: it is possible to automatically recognize different sub-sentential translation techniques. For this original task, since there is no dedicated data set for English-Chinese, we manually annotated a parallel corpus of eleven genres. Fifty sentence pairs for each genre have been annotated in order to consolidate our annotation guidelines. Based on this data set, we conducted an experiment to classify between literal and non-literal translations. The preliminary results confirm our hypothesis. The corpus and code are available. We hope that this annotated corpus will be useful for linguistic contrastive studies and for fine-grained evaluation of NLP tasks, such as automatic word alignment and machine translation.

Two sets of CT devices were installed at the upstream and downstream sides of the confinement chamber of the FIX machine. Each CT device was composed of three arrays of detectors sensitive to the near-infrared radiation. The Fourier-Bessel expansion technique was employed to reconstruct the two-dimensional distributions of the light emissivity of the FRC plasma. After the completion of the translation, the intensity of emission decreased significantly, probably because the density and the temperature of the plasma were decreased due to the plasma expansion induced by the translation.

Earlier literature in linguistic studies has gathered and established several syntactic categories of Nominal Compounds, which can be used for automatic syntactic categorization of these compounds. This paper is focused on Nominal Compounds of head-modifier construction because experiments show that most Nominal Compounds are head-modifier constructions. Based on the combination of templates and word similarity, this paper proposes an algorithm for automatic semantic interpretation which improves the recall ratio while maintaining the precision ratio. The results of syntactic categorization and automatic semantic interpretation of the Nominal Compounds are also applied in dependency parsing and machine translation.

We further perform a comparative study among the joint frameworks, the isolated prediction and the pipeline methods that link the two tasks sequentially, on a social media corpus. Our experimental results show that joint models improve performance of CWS and affect PU marginally. We also study the effects of CWS and PU on Chinese-to-English machine translation (MT) quality by evaluating on a parallel social media corpus. It is shown that joint models are superior to the isolated prediction and the pipeline approaches.

We followed through with the ideas in our 2005 paper by creating a more detailed workflow, translating actual images, and analyzing the translation time. Our experience in translating more than 2,300 figures from 4 textbooks demonstrates that figures can be translated in ten minutes or less of human time on average. We describe our experience with training tactile graphics specialists to use the new TGA technology.

We investigate a wide variety of supervised and unsupervised morphological segmentation methods for four polysynthetic languages: Nahuatl, Raramuri, Shipibo-Konibo, and Wixarika. Then, we compare the morphologically inspired segmentation methods against Byte-Pair Encodings (BPEs) as inputs for machine translation (MT) when translating to and from Spanish. We show that for all language pairs except for Nahuatl, an unsupervised morphological segmentation algorithm outperforms BPEs consistently and that, although supervised methods achieve better segmentation scores, they under-perform in MT challenges. Finally, we contribute two new morphological segmentation datasets for Raramuri and Shipibo-Konibo, and a parallel corpus for Raramuri-Spanish.

TI Kinematic analysis of a serial-parallel machine tool: The VERNE machine
SO MECHANISM AND MACHINE THEORY
AB The paper derives the inverse and the forward kinematic equations of a serial-parallel 5-axis machine tool: the VERNE machine. This machine is composed of a three-degree-of-freedom (DOF) parallel module and a two-DOF serial tilting table. The parallel module consists of a moving platform that is connected to a fixed base by three non-identical legs. These legs are connected in a way that the combined effects of the three legs leadver-constrained mechanism with complex motion. This motion is defined as a simultaneous combination of rotation and translation. In this paper we propose symbolical methods that able to calculate all kinematic solutions and identify the acceptable one by adding analytical constraint on the disposition of legs of the parallel module.

Despite the gender inequalities present in Wikipedia, the toolkit has been designed to extract corpus balanced in gender. While our toolkit is customizable to any number of languages (and to other domains than biographical entries), in this work we present a corpus of 2,000 sentences in English, Spanish and Catalan, which has been post-edited by native speakers to become a high-quality dataset for machine translation evaluation. While GeBioCorpus aims at being one of the first non-synthetic gender-balanced test datasets, GeBioToolkit aims at paving the path to standardize procedures to produce gender-balanced datasets.

AB Sarcasm is a form of speech in which the the implied sentiment is the opposite of literal meaning. In this paper, we present the task of sarcasm interpretation, defined as converting a sarcastic utterance into its non-sarcastic (literal) interpretation. We present three approaches for the task: (a) a rule-based approach that considers sarcasm as a form of dropped negation and associate negation words with verbs present in the sarcastic utterance, (b) statistical machine translation-based (SMT) approach that address the sarcasm interpretation task as monolingual machine translation and (c) three deep learning-based (DL) architectures, Encoder-Decoder Network, Attention Network and Pointer Generator Network. We also discuss the scope of future work to further enhance the proposed models for sarcasm interpretation.

AB Research augmenting B machines presented at B2007 has demonstrated how fragments of control flow expressed as annotations can be added to associated machine operations, and shown to be consistent. This enables designers' understanding about local relationships between successive operations to be captured at the point the operations are written, and used later when the controller is developed. This paper introduces several new annotations and I/O into the framework to take advantage of hardware's parallelism and to facilitate refinement and translation. To support the new annotations additional CSP control operations are added to the control language that now includes: recursion, prefixing, external choice, if-then-else, and sequencing. We informally sketch out a translation to Handel-C for prototyping.

TI PANINIAN FRAMEWORK AND ITS APPLICATION TO ANUSARAKA
SO SADHANA-ACADEMY PROCEEDINGS IN ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB The Paninian* framework proposes karakas as semantico-syntactic relations that play a crucial role in mediating between surface form and meaning. The framework accounts for theta-role assignment, active passive, and control in a uniform manner. It has been successfully used in building an extremely fast prototype machine-translation system between two Indian languages. The constraint parser and the generator are designed with information theoretic considerations. Paninian framework is particularly suited to free word order languages. As most human languages are relatively word-order free, the Paninian framework should be explored as a serious contender for such languages. Based on the Paninian theory, the concept of language accessor or anusaraka has emerged, which has the potential to overcome the language barrier in India.

In this algorithm, we apply a semi-supervised SVM, which builds a SVM classifier based on small amounts of labeled data and large amounts of unlabeled data, to translating the features extracted from the electrical recordings of brain into control signals. For reducing the time to train the semi-supervised SVM we improve it by introducing an batch-mode incremental training method, which also can be used to enhance the adaptability of online BCI systems. The off-line data analysis results demonstrated the effectiveness of our algorithm.

AB This paper proposes a design of verb entries in Interlingua to facilitate the machine translation (MT) of two languages with transitivity divergence as derived from their shared and individual linguistic characteristics. It suggests that the transitivity difference is best treated with verb entries containing information of the causal relation of the expressed events. It also demonstrates how the proposed design of verb entries gives a principled treatment of aspect divergence in semantically corresponding verbs of a source language (SL) and a target language (TL). Although the current paper focuses on English and Japanese, the proposed treatment should be applicable to the MT of similarly divergent languages, since the proposed lexicon in language-independent Interlingua contains information on causal relations of events as necessary to bridge the transitivity difference.

AB Improvements in text generation technologies such as machine translation have necessitated more costly and time-consuming human evaluation procedures to ensure an accurate signal. We investigate a simple way to reduce cost by reducing the number of text segments that must be annotated in order to accurately predict a score for a complete test set. Using a sampling approach, we demonstrate that information from document membership and automatic metrics can help improve estimates compared to a pure random sampling baseline. We achieve gains of up to 20% in average absolute error by leveraging stratified sampling and control variates. Our techniques can improve estimates made from a fixed annotation budget, are easy to implement, and can be applied to any problem with structure similar to the one we study.

AB While traditional corpus-level evaluation metrics for machine translation (MT) correlate well with fluency, they struggle to reflect adequacy. Model-based MT metrics trained on segment-level human judgments have emerged as an attractive replacement due to strong correlation results. These models, however, require potentially expensive re-training for new domains and languages. Furthermore, their decisions are inherently non-transparent and appear to reflect unwelcome biases. We explore the simple type-based classifier metric, MACROF(1), and study its applicability to MT evaluation. We find that MACROF(1) is competitive on direct assessment, and outperforms others in indicating downstream cross-lingual information retrieval task performance. Further, we show that MACROF(1) can be used to effectively compare supervised and unsupervised neural machine translation, and reveal significant qualitative differences in the methods' outputs.

AB The Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) is a popular language for architectural modeling and analysis of software intensive systems in application domains such as automotive, avionics, railway and medical systems. These systems often have stringent real-time requirements. This paper presents an extension to AADL's behavior model using time annotations in order to improve the evaluation of timing properties in AADL. The translational semantics of this extension is based on mappings to the Timed Abstract State Machines (TASM) language. As a result, timing analysis with timed simulation or timed model checking is possible. The translation is supported by art Eclipse-based plug-in and the approach is validated with a case study of an industrial production cell system.

AB With the rapid increase of data set size of cloud and big data applications, conventional regular 4KB pages can cause high pressure on hardware address translations. The pressure becomes more prominent in a virtualized system, which adds an additional layer of address translation. Virtual to physical address translations reply on a hardware Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) to cache address mappings. However, even modern hardware offers a very limited number of TLB entries. Meanwhile, TLB misses can cause significant performance degradation. Using 2MB or 1GB hugepages can improve TLB coverage and reduce TLB miss penalty. Therefore, recent operation systems, such as Linux, start to adopt hugepages. However, using hugepages bring new challenges, among which is working set size prediciton. In a virtualized system, working set size (WSS) estimation, which predicts the actual memory demand of a virtual machine, is often applied to guide virtual machine memory management and memory allocation. We find that traditional WSS estimation methods with regular pages cannot be simply ported to a system adopting hugepages. We estimate the working set size of a virtual machine by constructing a miss ratio curve (MRC), which relates page miss ratio to the virtual machine memory allocation. Using hugepages increases the overhead to track page accesses for MRC construction and also demands much higher precision in representing the miss ratios as a hugepage miss leads to a much higher penalty than a regular page miss. In this paper, we propose an accurate WSS estimation method in a virtual execution environment with hugepages. We design and implement a low-overhead dynamic memory tracking mechanism by utilizing a hot set to filter frequent short-reuse accesses. Our approach is able to output a hugepage miss ratio at high precision. The experimental results show that our method can predict WSS accurately with an average overhead of 1.5%.

AB We propose a lexicalized syntactic reordering framework for cross-language word aligning and translating researches, In this framework, we first flatten hierarchical source-language parse trees into syntactically-motivated linear string representations, which can easily be input to many feature-like probabilistic models. During model training, these string representations accompanied with target-language word alignment information are leveraged to learn systematic similarities and differences in languages' grammars. At run-time, syntactic constituents of source-language parse trees will be reordered according to automatically acquired lexicalized reordering rules in previous step, to closer match word orientations of the target language. Empirical results show that, as a preprocessing component, bilingual word aligning and translating tasks benefit from our reordering methodology.

AB Recent works in spoken language translation (SLT) have attempted to build end-to-end speech-to-text translation without using source language transcription during learning or decoding. However, while large quantities of parallel texts (such as Europarl, OpenSubtitles) are available for training machine translation systems, there are no large (>100h) and open source parallel corpora that include speech in a source language aligned to text in a target language. This paper tries to fill this gap by augmenting an existing (monolingual) corpus: LibriSpeech. This corpus, used for automatic speech recognition, is derived from read audiobooks from the LibriVox project, and has been carefully segmented and aligned. After gathering French e-books corresponding to the English audio-books from LibriSpeech, we align speech segments at the sentence level with their respective translations and obtain 236h of usable parallel data. This paper presents the details of the processing as well as a manual evaluation conducted on a small subset of the corpus. This evaluation shows that the automatic alignments scores are reasonably correlated with the human judgments of the bilingual alignment quality. We believe that this corpus (which is made available online) is useful for replicable experiments in direct speech translation or more general spoken language translation experiments.

   information retrieval
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB This study proposes and explores a natural language processing-(NLP) based strategy to address out-of-dictionary and vocabulary mismatch problems in query translation based English-Chinese Cross-Language Information Retrieval (EC-CLIR). The strategy, named the LKB approach, is to construct a lexical knowledge base (LKB) and to use it for query translation. In this article, the author describes the LKB construction process, which customizes available translation resources based on the document collection of the EC-CLIR system. The evaluation shows that the LKB approach is very promising. It consistently increased the percentage of correct translations and decreased the percentage of missing translations in addition to effectively detecting the vocabulary gap between the document collection and the translation resource of the system. The comparative analysis of the top EC-CLIR results using the LKB and two other translation resources demonstrates that the LKB approach has produced significant improvement in EC-CLIR performance compared to performance using the original translation resource without customization. It has also achieved the same level of performance as a sophisticated machine translation system. The study concludes that the LKB approach has the potential to be an empirical model for developing real-world CLIR systems. Linguistic knowledge and NLP techniques, if appropriately used, can improve the effectiveness of English-Chinese cross-language information retrieval.

TI Interactive translation of conversational speech
SO COMPUTER
AB Speech recognition performance has come a long way in the past 10 years. Present technology permits speaker independent, continuous-speech, large-vocabulary dictation systems with word error rates of about 10 percent. Machine translation has also improved, but merely combining these technologies cannot produce good speech translation.
   Providing useful speech translation means attempting more than a sentence-by-sentence translation: It means interpreting an utterance or extracting its main intent. This often involves summarizing, which requires semantic and pragmatic interpretation within a domain of discourse. The Janus-II system described in this article not only extracts intent but also deals with problems such as ill-formed sentences, noise, and speech recognition errors. It does so by successively applying all sources of knowledge-from acoustic to discourse-to narrow the search for the most plausible translation. The system's main modules are speech recognition, parsing, discourse processing, and generation. Each is language-independent, consisting of a general processor that can be loaded with language-specific knowl, edge. Deriving an Interlingua-a language-independent representation of meaning-is key to system versatility.
   The Janus-II team is experimenting with spoken-language interpretation in an interactive videoconferencing environment, portable speech translation, and simultaneous dialogue translation. Questions concerning the human factors of interactive spoken-language translation await further study in actual field use.

AB Neural machine translation (MT) models obtain state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a simple, end-to-end architecture. However, little is known about what these models learn about source and target languages during the training process. In this work, we analyze the representations learned by neural MT models at various levels of granularity and empirically evaluate the quality of the representations for learning morphology through extrinsic part-of-speech and morphological tagging tasks. We conduct a thorough investigation along several parameters: word-based vs. character-based representations, depth of the encoding layer, the identity of the target language, and encoder vs. decoder representations. Our data-driven, quantitative evaluation sheds light on important aspects in the neural MT system and its ability to capture word structure.(1)

AB In this paper, we present a simple and effective method to systematically derive an ensemble of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems from one baseline linear SMT model for use in system combination. Each system in the resulting ensemble is based on a feature set derived from the features of the baseline model (typically a subset of it). We will discuss the principles to determine the feature sets for derived systems, and present in detail the system combination model used in our work. Evaluation is performed on the data sets for NIST 2004 and NIST 2005 Chinese-to-English SMT tasks. Experimental results show that our method can bring significant improvements to baseline systems with state-of-the-art performance.

AB In spite of many languages being spoken in India, it is difficult for the people to understand foreign languages like English, Spanish, Italian, etc. The recognition and synthesis of speech are prominent emerging technologies in natural language processing and communication domains. This paper aims to leverage the open source applications of these technologies, machine translation, text-to-speech system (TTS), and speech-to-text system (STT) to convert available online resources to Indian languages. This application takes an English language video as an input and separates the audio from video. It then divides the audio file into several smaller chunks based on the timestamps. These audio chunks are then individually converted into text using IBM Watson's speech-to-text (STT) module. The obtained text chunks are then concatenated and passed to Google's machine translate API for conversion to the requested Indian language. After this translation, a TTS system is required to convert the text into the desired audio output. Not many open source TTS systems are available for Indian regional languages. One such available application is the flite engine (a lighter version of Festival engine developed by Prof. Alan Black at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)). This flite engine is used as TTS for generating audio from translated text. The accuracy of the application developed can be as high as 91 percent for a single video and averages about 79 percent. This accuracy is verified by comparing naturality of the audio with the general spoken language. This application is beneficial to visually impaired people as well as individuals who are not capable of reading text to acquire knowledge in their native language. In future, this application aims to achieve ubiquitous communication enabling people of different regions to communicate with each other breaking the language barriers.

AB Objective of the paper is to evaluate metrics of automatic evaluation of machine translation output using manual metrics - fluency and adequacy. We tried to answer the question to which extent the manual evaluation correlates with the automatic evaluation of MT output from/to Slovak to/from English. We focused on metrics based on the similarity and statistical principles (WER, PER, CDER and BLEU-n). We found out, that the manual evaluation, namely fluency and adequacy metrics correlates with automatic metrics of MT evaluation for less spoken language and low resource language such as Slovak. The contribution also consists of system proposal for both, manual (based on POS tagging) and automatic (based on reference) evaluation of MT output.

AB The automatic estimation of machine translation (MT) output quality is a hard task in which the selection of the appropriate algorithm and the most predictive features over reasonably sized training sets plays a crucial role. When moving from controlled lab evaluations to real-life scenarios the task becomes even harder. For current MT quality estimation (QE) systems, additional complexity comes from the difficulty to model user and domain changes. Indeed, the instability of the systems with respect to data coming from different distributions calls for adaptive solutions that react to new operating conditions. To tackle this issue we propose an online framework for adaptive QE that targets reactivity and robustness to user and domain changes. Contrastive experiments in different testing conditions involving user and domain changes demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

AB Of the 57 basic sentence categories (SC) defined in the HNC theory, action-effect SC is an important one with distinctive features. In the light of the HNC conceptual network, action-effect sentences in the Chinese language arise directly from causative verbs and compelling verbs, and indirectly from general acting verbs, i.e. via the use of the "de(sic)" construction. In Chinese-English machine translation, action-effect sentences follow different SC and SF (sentence format) transfer rules. Therefore, different transfer frames should be adopted so as to ensure the generation of TL sentences with proper syntactico-semantic structures. Experiments show that the rules underlying the SC-SF transfer of action-effect sentences from Chinese to English can cover 90.3% of all the sentences in question.

   Machine
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB We report on the synthesis and operation of a three-barrier, rotaxane-based, artificial molecular machine capable of sequence-specific beta-homo (beta(3)) peptide synthesis. The machine utilizes nonproteinogenic beta(3)-amino acids, a class of amino acids not generally accepted by the ribosome, particularly consecutively. Successful operation of the machine via native chemical ligation (NCL) demonstrates that even challenging 15- and 19-membered ligation transition states are suitable for information translation using this artificial molecular machine. The peptide-bond-forming catalyst region can be removed from the transcribed peptide by peptidases, artificial and biomachines working in concert to generate a product that cannot be made by either machine alone.

AB This Paper reveals the information about Deep Neural Network (DNN) and concept of deep learning in field of natural language processing i.e. machine translation. Now day's DNN is playing major role in machine leaning technics. Recursive recurrent neural network (R2NN) is a best technic for machine learning. It is the combination of recurrent neural network and recursive neural network (such as Recursive auto encoder). This paper presents how to train the recurrent neural network for reordering for source to target language by using Semi-supervised learning methods. Word2vec tool is required to generate word vectors of source language and Auto encoder helps us in reconstruction of the vectors for target language in tree structure. Results of word2vec play an important role in word alignment of the input vectors. RNN structure is very complicated and to train the large data file on word2vec is also a time- consuming task. Hence, a powerful hardware support (GPU) is required. GPU improves the system performance by decreasing training time period.

AB To improve low-resource Neural Machine Translation (NMT) with multilingual corpora, training on the most related high-resource language only is often more effective than using all data available (Neubig and Hu, 2018). However, it is possible that an intelligent data selection strategy can further improve low-resource NMT with data from other auxiliary languages. In this paper, we seek to construct a sampling distribution over all multilingual data, so that it minimizes the training loss of the low-resource language. Based on this formulation, we propose an efficient algorithm, Target Conditioned Sampling (TCS), which first samples a target sentence, and then conditionally samples its source sentence. Experiments show that TCS brings significant gains of up to 2 BLEU on three of four languages we test, with minimal training overhead(1).

AB Human machine interaction is an evolving research area which deals with interactions with machines that will be as natural as an interaction between humans. Vision based motion estimation can also be said as the interpretation of motions via mathematical algorithms. This system have applications in domains such as sign language translation, virtual environments, smart surveillance, controlling robots, control of machines, medical systems etc. The task is challenging due to the accuracy, further the items in the background or distinct features of the users may make recognition more difficult. In this survey, we address these challenges. We provide an overview of current advances in the field. Further, we discuss limitations and outline promising directions of research. A brief overview of methodologies implemented by earlier researcher on vision based gesture recognition for human machine interaction is discussed here.

AB Machine translation would be very useful in cooperative information environments or integrated into enterprise application IF it was reliable, understandable and acceptable enough. Unfortunately it is not any of these, but to find out where it stands it has to be evaluated The current research would like to try out an experimental evaluation method based on the internet and focussing on acceptability. It would like to find out whether this evaluation method can be valid, reliable and effective. The method uses the internet as a reference corpus and measures to what extent can sentences and sections of sentences be found in this reference.
   The findings show that although the methods may have to be refined and human evaluation also has to be carried out, the method justified our hypothesis and gave reliable results.

AB This paper describes SentencePiece, a language-independent subword tokenizer and detokenizer designed for Neural-based text processing, including Neural Machine Translation. It provides open-source C++ and Python implementations for subword units. While existing subword segmentation tools assume that the input is pre-tokenized into word sequences, SentencePiece can train subword models directly from raw sentences, which allows us to make a purely end-to-end and language independent system. We perform a validation experiment of NMT on English-Japanese machine translation, and find that it is possible to achieve comparable accuracy to direct subword training from raw sentences. We also compare the performance of subword training and segmentation with various configurations. SentencePiece is available under the Apache 2 license at https://github.com/google/sentencepiece.

In this paper, we are proposing a method to generate well-formed natural language question from a given keyword-based query, which has the same question intent as the query. Conversion of keyword based web query into a well formed question has lots of applications in search engines, Community Question Answering (CQA) website and bots communication. We found a synergy between query-to-question problem with standard machine translation (MT) task. We have used both Statistical MT (SMT) and Neural MT (NMT) models to generate the questions from query. We have observed that MT models performs well in terms of both automatic and human evaluation.

AB Word sense disambiguation (WSD) can be thought of as the most challenging task in the process of machine translation. Various supervised and unsupervised learning methods have already been proposed for this purpose. In this paper, we propose a new efficient fuzzy classification system in order to be applied for WSD. In order to optimize the generalization accuracy, we use rule-weight as a simple mechanism to tune the classifier and propose a new learning method to iteratively adjust the weight of fuzzy rules. Through computer simulations on TWA data as a standard corpus, the proposed scheme shows a uniformly good behavior and achieves results which are comparable or better than other classification systems, proposed in the past.

AB In this paper, a novel algorithm for incorporating morphological knowledge into statistical machine translation (SMT) systems is proposed. First, word stems are acquired automatically for the source and target languages using an unsupervised morphological acquisition algorithm. Then a word-stem based SMT system is built and combined with a phrase-based word level SMT system using a general statistical framework. The combined lexical and morphological SMT system is implemented using late integration and lattice re-scoring. The system is then evaluated on the Europarl corpus, using automatic evaluation methods for various training corpus sizes. It is shown, that both the BLEU and NIST scores of the lexical-morphological system improve by about 14% over the baseline English to Greek tranlation system when using a 1M word training corpus.

AB In this article, we present the results of our experiments on sentiment and emotion recognition for English and Polish texts, aiming to work in the context of a therapeutic chatbot. We created a dedicated dataset by adding samples of neutral texts to an existing English-language emotion-labeled corpus. Next, using neural machine translation, we developed a Polish version of the English database. A bilingual, parallel corpus created in this way, named CORTEX (CORpus of Translated Emotional teXts), labeled with three sentiment polarity classes and nine emotion classes, was used for experiments on classification. We employed various classifiers: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, fastText, and BERT. The results obtained were satisfactory: we achieved the best scores for the BERT-based models, which yielded accuracy of over 90% for sentiment (3-class) classification and almost 80% for emotion (9-class) classification. We compared the results for both languages and discussed the differences. Both the accuracy and the F1-scores for Polish turned out to be slightly inferior to those for English, with the highest difference visible for BERT.

AB Fully Attentional Networks (FAN) like Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) has shown superior results in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) tasks and has become a solid baseline for translation tasks. More recent studies also have reported experimental results that additional contextual sentences improve translation qualities of NMT models (Voita et al. 2018; Muller et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2018). However, those studies have exploited multiple context sentences as a single long concatenated sentence, that may cause the models to suffer from inefficient computational complexities and long-range dependencies. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Context Encoder (HCE) that is able to exploit multiple context sentences separately using the hierarchical FAN structure. Our proposed encoder first abstracts sentence-level information from preceding sentences in a self-attentive way, and then hierarchically encodes context-level information. Through extensive experiments, we observe that our HCE records the best performance measured in BLEU score on English-German, English-Turkish, and English-Korean corpus. In addition, we observe that our HCE records the best performance in a crowd-sourced test set which is designed to evaluate how well an encoder can exploit contextual information. Finally, evaluation on English-Korean pronoun resolution test suite also shows that our HCE can properly exploit contextual information.

AB This paper evaluates the impact of different types of data sources in developing a domain-specific statistical machine translation (SMT) system for the domain of official government letters, between the low-resourced language pair Sinhala and Tamil. The baseline was built with a small in-domain parallel dataset containing official government letters. The translation system was evaluated with two different test data sets. Test data from the same sources as training and tuning gave a higher score due to over-fitting, while the test data from a different source resulted in a considerably lower score. With the motive to improve translation, more data was collected from, (a) different government sources other than official letters (pseudo in-domain), and (b) online sources such as blogs, news and wiki dumps (out-domain). Use of pseudo in-domain data showed an improvement for both the test sets as the language is formal and context was similar to that of the in-domain though the writing style varies. Out-domain data, however, did not give a positive impact, either in filtered or unfiltered forms, as the writing style was different and the context was much more general than that of the official government documents.

AB What are proper names? Are proper names translatable? A clear answer to those two questions should be prior to any attempt of machine translation of the proper names. Some authors claim that the proper name is untranslatable, while the practice shows the opposite.
   Different criteria such as the textual genre, the historic context, the source language or the ontological nature of the bearer play a significant role in the decision to modify or to preserve the proper name in its original shape.

AB Successful methods for unsupervised neural machine translation (UNMT) employ cross-lingual pretraining via self-supervision, often in the form of a masked language modeling or a sequence generation task, which requires the model to align the lexical- and high-level representations of the two languages. While cross-lingual pretraining works for similar languages with abundant corpora, it performs poorly in low-resource and distant languages. Previous research has shown that this is because the representations are not sufficiently aligned. In this paper, we enhance the bilingual masked language model pretraining with lexical-level information by using type-level cross-lingual subword embeddings. Empirical results demonstrate improved performance both on UNMT (up to 4.5 BLEU) and bilingual lexicon induction using our method compared to a UNMT baseline.

AB This paper presents a study of the negative effect of Machine Translation (MT) on the precision of Cross-Lingual Question Answering (CL-QA). For this research, a English-Spanish Question Answering (QA) system is used. Also, the sets of 200 official questions from CLEF 2004 and 2006 are used. The CL experimental evaluation using MT reveals that the precision of the system drops around 30% with regard to the monolingual Spanish task. Our main contribution consists on a taxonomy of the identified errors caused by using MT and how the errors can be overcome by using our proposals. An experimental evaluation proves that our approach performs better than MT tools, at the same time contributing to this CL-QA system being ranked first at English-Spanish QA CLEF 2006.

We constrained the translated trees to the reordering of the children and the replacement of the leaf nodes with appropriate glosses. We also report the tools that we built and used in our tree translation task.

The first approach is derived from the field of statistical machine translation (MT), whereas the other uses the maximum entropy (ME) framework. Starting with an annotated corpus, we describe the problem of NLU as a translation from a source sentence to a formal language target sentence. We mainly focus on the quality of the different alignment and ME models and show that the direct ME approach outperforms the alignment templates method.

AB Machine Translation (MT) system is a complex natural language processing (NLP) system composed of large number of heterogeneous modules. Deployment of such a complex system even on a stand alone system is a cumbersome, knowledge intensive and time consuming task, taking hours to load, configure and run the system. As an MT system goes through frequent and regular updates, mainly to improve its accuracy and performance, the cumbersome task of its deployment is required to be repeated on release of each new version. Further, when such a system is needed to be deployed on a cloud infrastructure, mainly to facilitate auto-scaling of computational resources for varying load conditions, the task of deployment gets even more complicated and more time consuming.
   This paper proposes that every software version of a complex NLP application like MT system should be built and released as a virtual appliance that can be deployed with a very little setup time and with ease even by a common user. It discusses the experiments performed to build the MT system into a virtual appliance, for stand alone system deployment as well as for cloud deployment, and reports the deployment time measurements in both the scenario. Deployment of the virtual MT appliance took 130 seconds in stand alone system; its deployment on a large number of virtual machines in the cloud environment took 150 seconds on an average, in contrast to several hours taken for the deployment of MT applications earlier.

TI Pseudotext Injection and Advance Filtering of Low-Resource Corpus for

SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB Scaling natural language processing (NLP) to low-resourced languages to improve machine translation (MT) performance remains enigmatic. This research contributes to the domain on a low-resource English-Twi translation based on filtered synthetic-parallel corpora. It is often perplexing to learn and understand what a good-quality corpus looks like in low-resource conditions, mainly where the target corpus is the only sample text of the parallel language. To improve the MT performance in such low-resource language pairs, we propose to expand the training data by injecting synthetic-parallel corpus obtained by translating a monolingual corpus from the target language based on bootstrapping with different parameter settings. Furthermore, we performed unsupervised measurements on each sentence pair engaging squared Mahalanobis distances, a filtering technique that predicts sentence parallelism. Additionally, we extensively use three different sentence-level similarity metrics after round-trip translation. Experimental results on a diverse amount of available parallel corpus demonstrate that injecting pseudoparallel corpus and extensive filtering with sentence-level similarity metrics significantly improves the original out-of-the-box MT systems for low-resource language pairs. Compared with existing improvements on the same original framework under the same structure, our approach exhibits tremendous developments in BLEU and TER scores.

AB A software application has been developed to aid law enforcement and government intelligence gathering organizations in the translation and analysis of foreign language documents with potential intelligence content. The Automated Document Analysis System (ADAS) provides the capability to search (data or text mine) documents in English and the most commonly encountered foreign languages, including Arabic. Hardcopy documents are scanned by a high-speed scanner and are optical character recognized (OCR). Documents obtained in an electronic format bypass the OCR and are copied directly to a working directory. For translation and analysis, the script and the language of the documents are first determined. If the document is not in English, the document is machine translated to English. The documents are searched for keywords and key features in either the native language or translated English. The user can quickly review the document to determine if it has any intelligence content and whether detailed, verbatim human translation is required. The documents and document content are cataloged for potential future analysis. The system allows nonlinguists to evaluate foreign language documents and allows for the quick analysis of a large quantity of documents. All document processing can be performed manually or automatically on a single document or a batch of documents.

AB Machine translation has proved itself to be easier between languages that are closely related, such as German and English, while far apart languages, such as Chinese and English, encounter much more problems. The present study focuses upon Swedish and Norwegian; two languages so closely related that they would be referred to as dialects if it were not for the fact that they had a Royal house and an army connected to each of them. Despite their similarity though, some differences make the translation phase much less straight-forward than what could be expected. Taking the outset in sentence aligned parallel texts, this study aims at highlighting some of the differences, and to formalise the results. In order to do so, the texts have been aligned on smaller units, by a simple cognate alignment method. Not at all surprising, the longer words were easier to align, while shorter and often high-frequent words became a problem. Also when trying to align to a specific word sense in a dictionary, content words rendered better results. Therefore, we abandoned the use of single-word units, and searched for multi-word units whenever possible. This study reinforces the view that Machine Translation should rest upon methods based on multiword unit searches.

TI Cardiac point-of-care to cart-based ultrasound translation using
   constrained CycleGAN
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY
AB Purpose The emerging market of cardiac handheld ultrasound (US) is on the rise. Despite the advantages in ease of access and the lower cost, a gap in image quality can still be observed between the echocardiography (echo) data captured by point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) compared to conventional cart-based US, which limits the further adaptation of POCUS. In this work, we aim to present a machine learning solution based on recent advances in adversarial training to investigate the feasibility of translating POCUS echo images to the quality level of high-end cart-based US systems. Methods We propose a constrained cycle-consistent generative adversarial architecture for unpaired translation of cardiac POCUS to cart-based US data. We impose a structured shape-wise regularization via a critic segmentation network to preserve the underlying shape of the heart during quality translation. The proposed deep transfer model is constrained to the anatomy of the left ventricle (LV) in apical two-chamber (AP2) echo views. Results A total of 1089 echo studies from 841 patients are used in this study. The AP2 frames are captured by POCUS (Philips Lumify and Clarius) and cart-based (Philips iE33 and Vivid E9) US machines. The dataset of quality translation comprises a total of 441 echo studies from 395 patients. Data from both POCUS and cart-based systems of the same patient were available in 122 cases. The deep-quality transfer model is integrated into a pipeline for an automated cardiac evaluation task, namely segmentation of LV in AP2 view. By transferring the low-quality POCUS data to the cart-based US, a significant average improvement of 30% and 34 mm is obtained in the LV segmentation Dice score and Hausdorff distance metrics, respectively. Conclusion This paper presents the feasibility of a machine learning solution to transform the image quality of POCUS data to that of high-quality high-end cart-based systems. The experiments show that by leveraging the quality translation through the proposed constrained adversarial training, the accuracy of automatic segmentation with POCUS data could be improved.

TI Improving Statistical Machine Translation for a Resource-Poor Language
   Using Related Resource-Rich Languages
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
AB We propose a novel language-independent approach for improving machine translation for resource-poor languages by exploiting their similarity to resource-rich ones. More precisely, we improve the translation from a resource-poor source language X-1 into a resource-rich language Y given a bi-text containing a limited number of parallel sentences for X-1-Y and a larger bi-text for X-2-Y for some resource-rich language X-2 that is closely related to X-1. This is achieved by taking advantage of the opportunities that vocabulary overlap and similarities between the languages X-1 and X-2 in spelling, word order, and syntax offer: (1) we improve the word alignments for the resource-poor language, (2) we further augment it with additional translation options, and (3) we take care of potential spelling differences through appropriate transliteration. The evaluation for Indonesian -> English using Malay and for Spanish -> English using Portuguese and pretending Spanish is resource-poor shows an absolute gain of up to 1.35 and 3.37 BLEU points, respectively, which is an improvement over the best rivaling approaches, while using much less additional data. Overall, our method cuts the amount of necessary "real" training data by a factor of 2-5.

AB We propose a new method for extracting pseudo-parallel sentences from a pair of large monolingual corpora, without relying on any document-level information. Our method first exploits word embeddings in order to efficiently evaluate trillions of candidate sentence pairs and then a classifier to find the most reliable ones. We report significant improvements in domain adaptation for statistical machine translation when using a translation model trained on the sentence pairs extracted from in-domain monolingual corpora.

AB We present an approach to cross-language retrieval that combines dense knowledge-based features and sparse word translations. Both feature types are learned directly from relevance rankings of bilingual documents in a pairwise ranking framework. In large-scale experiments for patent prior art search and cross-lingual retrieval in Wikipedia, our approach yields considerable improvements over learning-to-rank with either only dense or only sparse features, and over very competitive baselines that combine state-of-the-art machine translation and retrieval.

AB In this paper, we define a formal approach for translating internal tests derived for a component embedded within a modular system into external tests defined over the external observable alphabets of the system. The system is represented as two communicating complete deterministic finite state machines, an embedded component machine to be tested and a context machine that represents the remaining part of the system. The context is assumed to be fault free and the interactions between the component machines are observable. When an internal test can not be translated in the given context, we demonstrate how another test with the guaranteed fault detection power could be determined (if such a test exists) that can be translated in the given context.

AB The subject of this paper is the design of a new concept of modular parallel mechanisms for three, four or five-axis machining applications. Most parallel mechanisms are designed for three- or six-axis machining applications. In the last case, the position and the orientation of the tool are coupled and the shape of the workspace is complex. The aim of this paper is to use a simple parallel mechanism with two-degree-of-freedom (dof) for translation motions and to add one or two legs to add one or two-dofs for rotation motions. The kinematics and singular configurations are studied for each mechanism.

TI A Fast and Compact Language Model Implementation Using Double-Array
   Structures
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB The language model is a widely used component in fields such as natural language processing, automatic speech recognition, and optical character recognition. In particular, statistical machine translation uses language models, and the translation speed and the amount of memory required are greatly affected by the performance of the language model implementation.
   We propose a fast and compact implementation of n-gram language models that increases query speed and reduces memory usage by using a double-array structure, which is known to be a fast and compact trie data structure. We propose two types of implementation: one for backward suffix trees and the other for reverse tries. The data structure is optimized ler space efficiency by embedding model parameters into otherwise unused spaces in the double-array structure.
   We show that the reverse trio version of our method is among the smallest state-of-the-art implementations in terms of model size with almost the same speed as the implementation that performs fastest on perplexity calculation tasks. Similarly, we achieve faster decoding while keeping compact, model sizes, and we confirm that our method can utilize the efficiency of the double-array structure to achieve a balance between speed and size on translation tasks.

TI Exploration of Effective Attention Strategies for Neural Automatic
   Post-editing with Transformer
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB Automatic post-editing (APE) is the study of correcting translation errors in the output of an unknown machine translation (MT) system and has been considered as a method of improving translation quality without any modification to conventional MT systems. Recently, several variants of Transformer that take both the MT output and its corresponding source sentence as inputs have been proposed for APE; and models introducing an additional attention layer into the encoder to jointly encode the MT output with its source sentence recorded a high-rank in the WMT19 APE shared task. We examine the effectiveness of such joint-encoding strategy in a controlled environment and compare four types of decoder multi-source attention strategies that have been introduced into previous APE models. The experimental results indicate that the joint-encoding strategy is effective and that taking the final encoded representation of the source sentence is the more proper strategy than taking such representation within the same encoder stack. Furthermore, among the multi-source attention strategies combined with the joint-encoding, the strategy that applies attention to the concatenated input representation and the strategy that adds up the individual attention to each input improve the quality of APE results over the strategy using the joint-encoding only.

TI Using syntax for improving phrase-based SMT in low-resource languages
SO DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP IN THE HUMANITIES
AB Data driven approaches for machine translation, such as statistical and neural machine translation, suffer from sparsity when dealing with low-resource languages. In these cases, using other sources of information including linguistic information could alleviate the problem. In this article, we focus on the problem of word ordering in translation from a high-resource to a low-resource language and try to improve the quality by using syntactic information from the high-resource side. We propose some syntactic features based on Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) to be employed in a phrase-based SMT model in order to improve the word ordering. In this work, a set of synchronous TAG rules is extracted and used to estimate the probability of the phrase orders suggested by the phrase-based model. The main idea of the article is to handle the word ordering by using the extended domain of locality property of TAG and abstracting the long distance dependencies into a local view, which is a TAG elementary tree. The experiments on English-Persian and English-German translation showed that, by combining the proposed TAG-based reordering features with lexical and hierarchical reordering models, we gain significant improvements over the baseline and in comparison with a neural reordering model and a pre-reordering model.

TI Suggested Solutions for the Bilingual Internet Lexicography Problems in
   the LexSite Dictionary Project
SO VOPROSY LEKSIKOGRAFII-RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF LEXICOGRAPHY
AB This article discusses identification of problems faced by the contemporary bilingual Internet lexicography and describes the LexSite dictionary the authors developed in the search for solutions. Data used in this research was obtained from four most popular Internet dictionaries users turn to for translations in the English-Russian language pair: Google Translate, Yandex.Translator, ABBYY Lingvo and Multitran. The first two are combined dictionaries-automatic translators while the other two are strictly dictionaries. The authors ran quantitative and qualitative comparison of translations offered by these dictionaries against the meanings of the same lexical units found in English thesauri. They also subjected examples of usage provided by the dictionaries to contextual analysis. They evaluated the completeness of translations given by those dictionaries and the quality of translations of individual lexemes and idioms. To test the translation veracity, the authors queried words that have homoforms and non-existing words made up for these tests followed by the analysis of methods applied to simulate translations for these non-existing words. They also investigated comments of grammatical and lexical nature included in the lexical entries, as well as the impact of users' involvement in adding entries to the dictionaries in terms of presentation and content. This research identified the following major issues faced by bilingual Internet dictionaries: (1) Combined dictionaries provide too few translations while 'pure' dictionaries produce poorly systematized numerous results. (2) Translations of multi-word strings and idioms made by combined dictionaries are of low quality. (3) Combined dictionaries often make up translations of words that they cannot find. (4) Both types of dictionaries often fail to recognize homoforms and give translations of wrong source words. (5) Many entries in these dictionaries come with non-systematic or wrong grammatical and lexical comments. (6) Th. departure of these dictionaries from a reference source is aggravated due to attempts to involve users in creation of dictionary entries. The outcome of the study suggests that the surveyed online dictionaries are inappropriate sources of the language base information since they produce data of unpredictable quality. The solutions found by the authors have been implemented in the Internet dictionary LexSite. When unable to find translations for the user query, the dictionary informs the user on its inability to find the word. It translates phrases that include the requested word and its usage in the linguistic context. LexSite shows translations of idioms if exact matches are found. The dictionary recognizes morphological specifics of the languages and, if the requested word has homoforms, provides relevant comments. To disambiguate requested polysemic words, LexSite offers reverse translations while keeping the search results.

AB Machine Translation is a mature technology for many high-resource language pairs. However in the context of low-resource languages, there is a paucity of parallel data datasets available for developing translation models. Furthermore, the development of datasets for low-resource languages often focuses on simply creating the largest possible dataset for generic translation. The benefits and development of smaller in-domain datasets can easily be overlooked. To assess the merits of using in-domain data, a dataset for the specific domain of health was developed for the low-resource English to Irish language pair. Our study outlines the process used in developing the corpus and empirically demonstrates the benefits of using an in-domain dataset for the health domain. In the context of translating health-related data, models developed using the gaHealth corpus demonstrated a maximum BLEU score improvement of 22.2 points (40%) when compared with top performing models from the LoResMT2021 Shared Task. Furthermore, we define linguistic guidelines for developing gaHealth, the first bilingual corpus of health data for the Irish language, which we hope will be of use to other creators of low-resource data sets. gaHealth is now freely available online and is ready to be explored for further research.

AB In encoder-decoder based sequence-to-sequence modeling, the most common practice is to stack a number of recurrent, convolutional, or feed-forward layers in the encoder and decoder. While the addition of each new layer improves the sequence generation quality, this also leads to a significant increase in the number of parameters. In this paper, we propose to share parameters across all layers thereby leading to a recurrently stacked sequence-to-sequence model. We report on an extensive case study on neural machine translation (NMT) using our proposed method, experimenting with a variety of datasets. We empirically show that the translation quality of a model that recurrently stacks a single-layer 6 times, despite its significantly fewer parameters, approaches that of a model that stacks 6 different layers. We also show how our method can benefit from a prevalent way for improving NMT, i.e., extending training data with pseudo-parallel corpora generated by back-translation. We then analyze the effects of recurrently stacked layers by visualizing the attentions of models that use recurrently stacked layers and models that do not. Finally, we explore the limits of parameter sharing where we share even the parameters between the encoder and decoder in addition to recurrent stacking of layers.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Machine learning is becoming widely used in analyzing the thermodynamics of many-body condensed matter systems. Restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) aided Monte Carlo simulations have sparked interest recently, as they manage to speed up classical Monte Carlo simulations. Here we employ the convolutional restricted Boltzmann machine (CRBM) method and show that its use helps to reduce the number of parameters to be learned drastically by taking advantage of translation invariance. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to train the CRBM at smaller lattice sizes, and apply it to larger lattice sizes. To demonstrate the efficiency of CRBM we apply it to the paradigmatic Ising and Kitaev models in two dimensions.

TI Reliability coupling mechanism analyses of T-translation-type
   contemporaneous meta-action in CNC machine tools
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB In the process of reliability comprehensive evaluation based on meta-action theory, the structural interactions between contemporaneous meta-action (CMA) will have a great impact on the whole evaluation process. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the reliability coupling mechanism between T-translation-type CMA in conducting reliability comprehensive evaluation of CNC machine tools. In light of this fact, this paper first introduces the structure and the reliability coupling reasons of T-translation-type CMA briefly. Then, the forces and deformation of the worktable movement meta-action unit under two cases that the frame deforms along the length direction and the width direction of rail are analyzed, and the dynamic models of the target meta-action unit based on a simplified single-degree-of-freedom model are constructed. What is more, the active learning Kriging-Monte Carlo simulation (ALK-MCS) method is utilized to calculate the reliability of target meta-action. At last, the rationality and effectiveness of the dynamic model and the reliability calculation method proposed in this paper are verified by numerical simulation and experiment, and the reliability coupling mechanism of T-translation-type CMA under two kinds of frame deformation is analyzed.

AB Autoregressive sequence models achieve state-of-the-art performance in domains like machine translation. However, due to the autoregressive factorization nature, these models suffer from heavy latency during inference. Recently, non-autoregressive sequence models were proposed to reduce the inference time. However, these models assume that the decoding process of each token is conditionally independent of others. Such a generation process sometimes makes the output sentence inconsistent, and thus the learned non-autoregressive models could only achieve inferior accuracy compared to their autoregressive counterparts. To improve the decoding consistency and reduce the inference cost at the same time, we propose to incorporate a structured inference module into the non-autoregressive models. Specifically, we design an efficient approximation for Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for non-autoregressive sequence models, and further propose a dynamic transition technique to model positional contexts in the CRF. Experiments in machine translation show that while increasing little latency (8 similar to 14ms), our model could achieve significantly better translation performance than previous non-autoregressive models on different translation datasets. In particular, for the WMT14 En-De dataset, our model obtains a BLEU score of 26.80, which largely outperforms the previous non-autoregressive baselines and is only 0.61 lower in BLEU than purely autoregressive models.(1)

AB Pre-editing is the process of modifying the source text (ST) so that it can be translated by machine translation (MT) in a better quality. Despite the unpredictability of black-box neural MT (NMT), pre-editing has been deployed in various practical MT use cases. Although many studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of pre-editing methods for particular settings, thus far, a deep understanding of what pre-editing is and how it works for black-box NMT is lacking. To elicit such understanding, we extensively investigated human pre-editing practices. We first implemented a protocol to incrementally record the minimum edits for each ST and collected 6,652 instances of pre-editing across three translation directions, two MT systems, and four text domains. We then analysed the instances from three perspectives: the characteristics of the pre-edited ST, the diversity of pre-editing operations, and the impact of the pre-editing operations on NMT outputs. Our findings include the following: (1) enhancing the explicitness of the meaning of an ST and its syntactic structure is more important for obtaining better translations than making the ST shorter and simpler, and (2) although the impact of pre-editing on NMT is generally unpredictable, there are some tendencies of changes in the NMT outputs depending on the editing operation types.

AB This paper shows the modeling and performance in deep learning computation for an Assistant Conversational Agent (Chatbot). The utilization of Tensorflow software library, particularly Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model. Acquiring knowledge for modeling is one of the most important task and quite difficult to preprocess it. The Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (BRNN) containing attention layers is used, so that input sentence with large number of tokens (or sentences with more than 20-40 words) can be replied with more appropriate conversation. The dataset used in the paper for training of model is used from Reddit. The model is developed to perform English to English translation. The main purpose of this work is to increase the perplexity and learning rate of the model and find Bleu Score for translation in same language. The experiments are conducted using Tensorflow using python 3.6. The perplexity, leaning rate, Bleu score and Average time per 1000 steps are 56.10, 0.0001, 30.16 and 4.5 respectively. One epoch is completed at 23,000 steps. The paper also study MacBook Air as a system for neural network and deep learning. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper introduces the KyotoEBMT Example-Based Machine Translation framework. Our system uses a tree-to-tree approach, employing syntactic dependency analysis for both source and target languages in an attempt to preserve non-local structure. The effectiveness of our system is maximized with online example matching and a flexible decoder. Evaluation demonstrates BLEU scores competitive with state-of-the-art SMT systems such as Moses. The current implementation is intended to be released as open-source in the near future.

TI Towards modeling user behavior in interactions mediated through an
   automated bidirectional speech translation system
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB This paper addresses modeling user behavior in interactions between two people who do not share a common spoken language and communicate with the aid of an automated bidirectional speech translation system. These interaction settings are complex. The translation machine attempts to bridge the language gap by mediating the verbal communication, noting however that the technology may not be always perfect. In a step toward understanding user behavior in this mediated communication scenario, usability data from doctor-patient dialogs involving a two way English-Persian speech translation system are analyzed. We specifically consider user behavior in light of potential uncertainty in the communication between the interlocutors. We analyze the Retry (Repeat and Rephrase) versus Accept behaviors in the mediated verbal channel and as a result identify three user types - Accommodating, Normal and Picky, and propose a dynamic Bayesian network model of user behavior. To validate the model, we performed offline and online experiments. The experimental results using offline data show that correct user type is clearly identified as a user keeps his/her consistent behavior in a given interaction condition. In the online experiment, agent feedback was presented to users according to the user types. We show high user satisfaction and interaction efficiency in the analysis of user interview, video data, questionnaire and log data. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The article refers to a spatial mechanism for precise rectilinear displacement, formed only from levers articulated by rotation joints, assuring kinematical precision, safe sealing conditions and reduced friction forces in hard environmental conditions abrasive dust, shocks, reduced lubrication and maintenance. The main advantage for solution exhibited below is the fact that this mechanism type requires less demanding manufacturing conditions then those imposed by translation guides and it allows better sealing, in constructive, efficient and safe terms for rotation joints, also exhibiting much smaller moving masses. The spatial mechanism is integrated on a NC multipurpose machine-tool for performing special multiple machining applications.

AB Compared to fully manual translation, postediting (PE) machine translation (MT) output can save time and reduce errors. Automatic word-level quality estimation (QE) aims to predict the correctness of words in MT output and holds great promise to aid PE by flagging problematic output. Quality of QE is crucial, as incorrect QE might lead to translators missing errors or wasting time on already correct MT output. Achieving accurate automatic word-level QE is very hard, and it is currently not known (i) at what quality threshold QE is actually beginning to be useful for human PE, and (ii), how to best present wordlevel QE information to translators. In particular, should word-level QE visualization indicate uncertainty of the QE model or not? In this paper, we address both research questions with real and simulated word-level QE, visualizations, and user studies, where time, subjective ratings, and quality of the final translations are assessed. Results show that current wordlevel QE models are not yet good enough to support PE. Instead, quality levels of similar to 80% F1 are required. For helpful quality levels, a visualization reflecting the uncertainty of the QE model is preferred. Our analysis further shows that speed gains achieved through QE are not merely a result of blindly trusting the QE system, but that the quality of the final translations also improves. The threshold results from the paper establish a quality goal for future wordlevel QE research.

AB Pattern Recognition systems are not error-free. Human intervention is typically needed to verify and/or correct the result of such systems. To formalize this fact, a new framework, which integrates the human activity into the recognition process taking advantage of the user's feedback, is described. Several applications, involving Interactive Speech Transcription and Multimodal Interactive Machine Translation, have recently been considered under this framework. These applications are reviewed in this paper, and some experiments, showing that the proposed framework can save significant amounts of human effort; are also presented.

AB This paper presents a virtual translation technique for current regulation for AC machines. A virtual physical parameter is employed to effectively translate the system pole to achieve fast and robust dynamics. Applying this technique to conventional synchronous frame current regulators reduces parameter sensitivity and improves robustness. The current controllers are redesigned in the virtually translated system. Current regulators adopting the technique have been analyzed in complex vector form for symmetric AC machines and in scalar form for salient-pole AC machines. Several current regulators using this technique have been experimentally evaluated for different operating conditions in an IPMSM drive.

AB This research extends our earlier work on using machine translation (MT) and word-based recurrent neural networks to augment language model training data for keyword search in conversational Cantonese speech. MT-based data augmentation is applied to two language pairs: English-Lithuanian and English-Amharic. Using filtered N-best MT hypotheses for language modeling is found to perform better than just using the 1 best translation. Target language texts collected from the Web and filtered to select conversational-like data are used in several manners. In addition to using Web data for training the language model of the speech recognizer, we further investigate using this data to improve the language model and phrase table of the MT system to get better translations of the English data. Finally, generating text data with a character-based recurrent neural network is investigated. This approach allows new word forms to be produced, providing a way to reduce the out-of-vocabulary rate and thereby improve keyword spotting performance. We study how these different Methods of language model data augmentation impact speech-to-text and keyword spotting performance for the Lithuanian and Amharic languages. The best results are obtained by combining all of the explored methods.

TI Jumping on the Bandwagon: Thai Students' Perceptions and Practices of
   Implementing Google Translate in their EFL Classrooms
SO ENGLISH TEACHING AND LEARNING
AB It is generally accepted that many of today's classrooms have been nurtured by technological advances. Similarly, in language teaching contexts, automated machine translation is widely recognised as one of the most significant breakthroughs in digital technology, contributing to an increase in L2 students' use of Google Translate (GT) to cope with language issues. Previous research found that, despite other technology already incorporated into classrooms, language teachers were still skeptical of students' use of GT to do assignments. This study therefore explored students' perceptions of the explicit use of GT to solve language problems in their classrooms. Data were obtained from an online survey distributed to students in an English course that gives them the freedom to make use of tools and deploy any strategy that enables intelligible communication. The findings from the keyword analysis indicated that the students held a positive attitude towards getting permission to use GT in their classrooms, and that they used GT for a wide range of purposes, in addition to translation. Given the real-world use of GT, this study posits that rather than restricting the use of the tool, teachers should adopt GT in their classes and guide students through the critical use of GT.

AB Token-level adaptive training approaches can alleviate the token imbalance problem and thus improve neural machine translation, through re-weighting the losses of different target tokens based on specific statistical metrics (e.g., token frequency or mutual information). Given that standard translation models make predictions on the condition of previous target contexts, we argue that the above statistical metrics ignore target context information and may assign inappropriate weights to target tokens. While one possible solution is to directly take target contexts into these statistical metrics, the target-context-aware statistical computing is extremely expensive, and the corresponding storage overhead is unrealistic. To solve the above issues, we propose a target-context-aware metric, named conditional bilingual mutual information (CBMI), which makes it feasible to supplement target context information for statistical metrics. Particularly, our CBMI can be formalized as the log quotient of the translation model probability and language model probability by decomposing the conditional joint distribution. Thus CBMI can be efficiently calculated during model training without any pre-specific statistical calculations and large storage overhead. Furthermore, we propose an effective adaptive training approach based on both the token- and sentence-level CBMI. Experimental results on WMT14 English-German and WMT19 Chinese-English tasks show our approach can significantly outperform the Transformer baseline and other related methods.
