AB Document-level machine translation (MT) remains challenging due to the difficulty in efficiently using document context for translation. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical model to learn the global context for documentlevel neural machine translation (NMT). This is done through a sentence encoder to capture intra-sentence dependencies and a document encoder to model document-level intersentence consistency and coherence. With this hierarchical architecture, we feedback the extracted global document context to each word in a top-down fashion to distinguish different translations of a word according to its specific surrounding context. In addition, since largescale in-domain document-level parallel corpora are usually unavailable, we use a twostep training strategy to take advantage of a large-scale corpus with out-of-domain parallel sentence pairs and a small-scale corpus with in-domain parallel document pairs to achieve the domain adaptability. Experimental results on several benchmark corpora show that our proposed model can significantly improve document-level translation performance over several strong NMT baselines.

AB Adverbial phrase (AdP) contains rich and indispensable information, however, translating them properly is one of big challenges for machine translation (MT) systems. In this paper, we systematically present a contrastive analysis of MT of AdPs from Chinese to Portuguese. Our study is conducted on The International Chinese Newsweekly corpus which consists of 46 Chinese texts (ST) with their respective Portuguese translations given by a state-of-the-art Portuguese-Chinese MT system and human beings (HT). By comparing the syntactic structures of these texts in ST, PCT, and HT sides, we found that nearly 90% MT outputs suffer structural inconsistency with poor translation qualities. Therefore, we discuss and finally propose a series of grammar rules to address the problem. We believe that this work could inspire both MT researchers and industries to boost the performance of Portuguese-Chinese MT systems.

AB In order to explore the detailed error types of English-Chinese machine translation (MT), especially at clause-complex level, to improve MT output quality, an experiment of 489 complicated English sentences was input into five mainstream MT systems to generate Chinese translation. The translation output was analyzed and labeled based on the clause-complex scheme, and the probable error reasons were analyzed from the perspective of clause-complex scheme. The results show that there is a relationship between clause-complex level errors in English-Chinese MT output and the different clause-complex structure of English and Chinese languages. This relationship means the improvement of MT cannot rely solely on data learning and linguistic knowledge application and linguistic knowledge. Specifically, the structural knowledge at clause-complex level should play a significant role in future MT research.

AB Unsupervised neural machine translation (UNMT) has recently achieved remarkable results [20] with only large monolingual corpora in each language. However, the uncertainty of associating target with source sentences makes UNMT theoretically an ill-posed problem. This work investigates the possibility of utilizing images for disambiguation to improve the performance of UNMT. Our assumption is intuitively based on the invariant property of image, i.e., the description of the same visual content by different languages should be approximately similar. We propose an unsupervised multi-modal machine translation (UMNMT) framework based on the language translation cycle consistency loss conditional on the image, targeting to learn the bidirectional multi-modal translation simultaneously. Through an alternate training between multi-modal and uni-modal, our inference model can translate with or without the image. On the widely used Multi30K dataset, the experimental results of our approach are significantly better than those of the text-only UNMT on the 2016 test dataset.

Through S2S, a text spoken in one language is automatically recognized, translated and synthesized in another language. This article presents an overview of the first version of our Android-based Romanian-English bi-directional speech translation system and covers the methods and technologies used for implementing it. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first bidirectional S2S for Romanian-English implemented on mobile devices.

AB While we live in an increasingly interconnected world, different places still exhibit strikingly different cultures and many events we experience in our every day life pertain only to the specific place we live in. As a result, people often talk about different things in different parts of the world. In this work we study the effect of local context in machine translation and postulate that this causes the domains of the source and target language to greatly mismatch. We first formalize the concept of source-target domain mismatch, propose a metric to quantify it, and provide empirical evidence for its existence. We conclude with an empirical study of how source-target domain mismatch affects training of machine translation systems on low resource languages. While this may severely affect back-translation, the degradation can be alleviated by combining back-translation with self-training and by increasing the amount of target side monolingual data.

AB Technology and translation are closely linked through the rapid development of CAT tools, machine translation (MT) and artificial intelligence (AI). These elements are undoubtedly leading to a redefinition of the traditional concept of "translation" and of the translator's role(s). Specialized languages are essential in this development as they that are the testing platform in its overwhelming expansion. Behind this process, there are translators, linguists, engineers, terminologists, web designers, programmers and so on. An endless list of professionals whose limits of their activity are no longer clear. Thus, new profiles or adaptations of the existing ones arise to cover the new demands and market needs. The aim of this article is to analyze some of these new challenges and their consequences on the basis of studies on the training of translators, expert reports on the development of MT and the results of market studies.

We present a study that aims to uncover relevant perceptual quality dimensions for one type of machine-generated text, that is, Machine Translation. We conducted a crowd-sourcing survey in the style of a Semantic Differential to collect attribute ratings for German MT outputs. An Exploratory Factor Analysis revealed the underlying perceptual dimensions. As a result, we extracted four factors that operate as relevant dimensions for the Quality of Experience of MT outputs: precision, complexity, grammaticality, and transparency.

AB This study tested the effectiveness of employing translation tasks to enhance students' use of collocations in spoken English. Two intact classes from a university in Taiwan participated in this study. Both classes first were taught a reading text with a focus on comprehension. Afterwards, while the control group had a free discussion on topics related to the reading, the experimental group completed two translation tasks. The first was a post-editing task in which students edited a Chinese translation of the reading generated by Google Translate. The second was a sight translation task in which the students orally translated part of the Chinese translation back into English. In the posttest, the experimental group used more target vocabulary correctly than the control group. Through a questionnaire, students in the experimental group reported that the two translation activities were helpful for learning to use collocations correctly in spoken English.

TI TRANSLATING LAW: A COMPARISON OF HUMAN AND POST-EDITED TRANSLATIONS FROM
   GREEK TO ENGLISH
SO REVISTA DE LLENGUA I DRET-JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE AND LAW
AB Advances in neural machine translation (NMT) models have led to reported improvements in machine translation (MT) outputs, especially for resource-rich language pairs (Deng & Liu, 2018), mainly at the level of fluency (Castilho et al., 2017a, 2017b). NMT systems have been used particularly for the translation of technical and life science texts with short, repetitive, formulaic, and unambiguous sentence types. In contrast, legal translation studies scholars have depicted legal translation as not particularly compatible with MT, mainly because legal texts include features that pose significant challenges to MT (Killman, 2014; Prieto Ramos, 2015; Matthiesen, 2017). As such, the quality of the output varies according to the legal genre and language pair. Using MQM-DQF error typology, this study evaluates the quality of the post-edited and human translation (HT) products of two normative property law texts from Greek to English, a language pair considered to be under-resourced. The time taken by the two translators who participated in the study to complete these products was monitored, and information was collected on their attitudes towards MT and post-editing (PE). The findings indicate neither productivity gains in the case of PE, nor major differences in accuracy or fluency between the post-edited and HT texts, although the number of errors was slightly higher overall in the case of HT, with most occurring at the level of accuracy. Conversely, the post-edited versions contained more errors at the levels of style and verity. Finally, the translators' views on MT and PE were dependent on the MT output quality, while their trust level in the output may have affected the end-product quality.

AB Current state-of-the-art neural machine translation (NMT) uses a deep multi-head self-attention network with no explicit phrase information. However, prior work on statistical machine translation has shown that extending the basic translation unit from words to phrases has produced substantial improvements, suggesting the possibility of improving NMT performance from explicit modeling of phrases. In this work, we present multi-granularity self-attention (MG-SA): a neural network that combines multi-head self-attention and phrase modeling. Specifically, we train several attention heads to attend to phrases in either n-gram or syntactic formalism. Moreover, we exploit interactions among phrases to enhance the strength of structure modeling - a commonly-cited weakness of self-attention. Experimental results on WMT14 English-to-German and NIST Chinese-to-English translation tasks show the proposed approach consistently improves performance. Targeted linguistic analysis reveals that MG-SA indeed captures useful phrase information at various levels of granularities.

AB Non-autoregressive translation models (NAT) have achieved impressive inference speedup. A potential issue of the existing NAT algorithms, however, is that the decoding is conducted in parallel, without directly considering previous context. In this paper, we propose an imitation learning framework for non-autoregressive machine translation, which still enjoys the fast translation speed but gives comparable translation performance compared to its auto-regressive counterpart. We conduct experiments on the IWSLT16, WMT14 and WMT16 datasets. Our proposed model achieves a significant speedup over the autoregressive models, while keeping the translation quality comparable to the autoregressive models. By sampling sentence length in parallel at inference time, we achieve the performance of 31.85 BLEU on WMT16 Ro -> En and 30.68 BLEU on IWSLT16 En -> De.

TI Defence and illustration of the hermeneutic approach in translation
SO META
AB During the last fifty years translation studies have been dominated by analytical approaches, victims of the "myth of objectivism" and an illusory belief in machine translation. The hermeneutic tradition lived an underground life. The relative failure of machine translation has raised questions about the validity of analytical approaches. But what furthered a new interest in an hermeneutic approach to translations studies most were the results of cognitive research which furnished a scientific legitimating to the descriptions from the heuristic perspective of translational activities, the more so as these descriptions are confirmed by the testimony of practitioners in translation. Thus cognitivistic research provides the basis for the new evaluation criterion of "intersubjektive Nachvollziehbarkeit" (intersubjective understanding) exacted by the epistemological revolution as demanded by Stefanink (1997).

AB Despite the many proposals to solve the neural machine translation (NMT) problem of low-resource languages, it continues to be difficult. The issue becomes even more complicated when few resources cover only a single domain. In this paper, we discuss the applicability of a source-side monolingual dataset of low-resource languages to improve the NMT system for such languages. In our experiments, we used Wolaytta-English translation as a low-resource language. We discuss the use of self-learning and fine-tuning approaches to improve the NMT system for Wolaytta-English translation using both authentic and synthetic datasets. The self-learning approach showed +2.7 and +2.4 BLEU score improvements for Wolaytta-English and English-Wolaytta translations, respectively, over the best-performing baseline model. Further fine-tuning the best-performing self-learning model showed +1.2 and +0.6 BLEU score improvements for Wolaytta-English and English-Wolaytta translations, respectively. We reflect on our contributions and plan for the future of this difficult field of study.

AB Knowledge graphs (KGs) store much structured information on various entities, many of which are not covered by the parallel sentence pairs of neural machine translation (NMT). To improve the translation quality of these entities, in this paper we propose a novel KGs enhanced NMT method. Specifically, we first induce the new translation results of these entities by transforming the source and target KGs into a unified semantic space. We then generate adequate pseudo parallel sentence pairs that contain these induced entity pairs. Finally, NMT model is jointly trained by the original and pseudo sentence pairs. The extensive experiments on Chinese-to-English and English-to-Japanese translation tasks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the strong baseline models in translation quality, especially in handling the induced entities.

AB Freely available tools and language resources were used to build the VoiceTRAN statistical machine translation (SMT) system. Various configuration variations of the system are presented and evaluated. The VoiceTRAN SMT system outperformed the baseline conventional rule-based NIT system in both English-Slovenian in-domain test setups. TO further increase the generalization capability of the translation model for lower-coverage out-of-domain test sentences, an "MSD-recombination" approach was proposed. This approach not only allows a better exploitation of conventional translation models, but also performs well in the more demanding translation direction: that is, into a highly inflectional language. Using this approach in the out-of-domain setup of the English-Slovenian JRC-ACQUIS task, we have achieved significant improvements in translation quality.

TI A Character Level Based and Word Level Based Approach for
   Chinese-Vietnamese Machine Translation
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB Chinese and Vietnamese have the same isolated language; that is, the words are not delimited by spaces. In machine translation, word segmentation is often done first when translating from Chinese or Vietnamese into different languages (typically English) and vice versa. However, it is a matter for consideration that words may or may not be segmented when translating between two languages in which spaces are not used between words, such as Chinese and Vietnamese. Since Chinese-Vietnamese is a low-resource language pair, the sparse data problem is evident in the translation system of this language pair. Therefore, while translating, whether it should be segmented or not becomes more important. In this paper, we propose a new method for translating Chinese to Vietnamese based on a combination of the advantages of character level and word level translation. In addition, a hybrid approach that combines statistics and rules is used to translate on the word level. And at the character level, a statistical translation is used. The experimental results showed that our method improved the performance of machine translation over that of character or word level translation.

AB In machine translation, the re-ordering of word from source to target language is one of the major steps that affect mainly the performance of the system. Among many approaches for this type of problem, syntactic is an effective method for handling word-order in a statistical machine translation (SMT) system. In this paper, we introduce a word re-ordering approach that makes use the syntactic rules extracted from parse tree for the English-Vietnamese SMT system. Our word re-ordering rule set includes rules in noun phrase, verb phrase and adjective phrase. According to the experiment result, the noun phrase rules are the most significant rules of all. Compared with the MOSES phrase-based SMT system [1], these rules can improve BLEU score of 3.24 on our testing corpus. Moreover, we also conduct other experiments by using different combinations of rules to Study their effectiveness. And we find that the translation performance for each corpus can be tuned by different ways of combination.

This paper provides a survey of Machine Translation (MT) systems developed for Indian languages. It also provides an idea regarding the approaches and evaluation techniques used for translation. From this paper, a researcher can have a glance regarding the work carried out for Indian languages and enhance the work from where it stops. Until now, a lot of work has been carried out for MT. Some systems are developed for general domain whereas others are for specific domain like administrative documents translation, news translation, children stories, weather narration and conference papers, etc., and still some languages require more attention.

TI Mining monolingual and bilingual corpora
SO INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS
AB In this paper, we describe two new methods of mining monolingual and bilingual text corpora that heavily rely on the use of association rules and triggers. The association rules based method is firstly applied in query expansion. The conducted experiments on French newspapers and on a set of scientific documents show that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline model. The second method focuses on the machine translation and is motivated by the results of triggers on statistical language modeling. In order to build up a translation table, association rules and triggers are then generalized to mine bilingual corpora. In this respect, we propose respectively the concepts of inter-lingual association rules and inter-lingual triggers. Both methods have been integrated in a real statistical machine translation. Carried out experiments highlight the practical feasibility of the introduced approaches in the context of machine translation and show that inter-lingual triggers achieve better results than those obtained using the third IBM model.

TI Towards human linguistic machine translation evaluation
SO DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP IN THE HUMANITIES
AB When evaluating machine translation outputs, linguistics is usually taken into account implicitly. Annotators have to decide whether a sentence is better than another or not, using, for example, adequacy and fluency criteria or, as recently proposed, editing the translation output so that it has the same meaning as a reference translation, and it is understandable. Therefore, the important fields of linguistics of meaning (semantics) and grammar (syntax) are indirectly considered. In this study, we propose to go one step further towards a linguistic human evaluation. The idea is to introduce linguistics implicitly by formulating precise guidelines. These guidelines strictly mark the difference between the sub-fields of linguistics such as: morphology, syntax, semantics, and orthography. We show our guidelines have a high inter-annotation agreement and wide-error coverage. Additionally, we examine how the linguistic human evaluation data correlate with: among different types of machine translation systems (rule and statistical-based); and with adequacy and fluency.

TI Public service interpreting and translation training: a path towards
   digital adaptation to machine translation and post-editing
SO INTERPRETER AND TRANSLATOR TRAINER
AB The ever-increasing demand for immediate access to information means interpreters and translators are increasingly using, and relying on, digital technology in their work. In the migratory context, machine translation (MT) and post-editing (PE) have the potential to greatly increase the efficiency of public service interpreting and translation (PSIT), which is currently experiencing huge demand. This article describes and evaluates the implementation of a module focused on MT and PE within a postgraduate PSIT programme at a Spanish university. A mixed-methods methodology was used to collect both quantitative data (via a questionnaire) and qualitative data (via a reflective essay) from a group of 42 students during the 2020-2021 academic year. The results show that students were satisfied overall with both the content of the module and its implementation. However, they also felt that the module needed to be better integrated within the postgraduate PSIT programme as a whole in order to fully prepare them for their professional careers.

AB Several studies (covering many language pairs and translation tasks) have demonstrated that translation quality has improved enormously since the emergence of neural machine translation systems. This raises the question whether such systems are able to produce high-quality translations for more creative text types such as literature and whether they are able to generate coherent translations on document level. Our study aimed to investigate these two questions by carrying out a document-level evaluation of the raw NMT output of an entire novel. We translated Agatha Christie's novel The Mysterious Affair at Styles with Google's NMT system from English into Dutch and annotated it in two steps: first all fluency errors, then all accuracy errors. We report on the overall quality, determine the remaining issues, compare the most frequent error types to those in general-domain MT, and investigate whether any accuracy and fluency errors co-occur regularly. Additionally, we assess the inter-annotator agreement on the first chapter of the novel.

AB Hierarchical phrase based translation model is state-of-the-art statistical machine translation (SMT) method with the advantage of both phrase-based SMT models and syntax-based MT models. However, this model is defected in neglecting the word correlations during the automatic hierarchical phrase extraction from word-aligned bilingual corpus: an idiomatic expression of an input sentence may be split into several fragments and thus prone to false translation concatenation. To address this issue, this paper proposes to integrate statistical collocation model to calculate collocation probabilities for hierarchical phrases to improve the qualities of the hierarchical phrases. The experimental results show that our methods effectively improve the performance of SMT systems. As compared with baseline systems, our methods achieve absolute improvements of 0.39 and 0.60 BLEU score on Chinese-to-English test sets (NIST-MT04 and NIST-MT08), respectively.

TI Translation Quality Estimation Using Only Bilingual Corpora
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB In computer-aided translation scenarios, quality estimation of machine translation hypotheses plays a critical role. Existing methods for word-level translation quality estimation (TQE) rely on the availability of manually annotated TQE training data obtained via direct annotation or postediting. However, due to the cost of human labor, such data are either limited in size or is only available for few tasks in practice. To avoid the reliance on such annotated TQE data, this paper proposes an approach to train word-level TQE models using bilingual corpora, which are typically used in machine translation training and is relatively easier to access. We formalize the training of our proposed method under the framework of maximum marginal likelihood estimation. To avoid degenerated solutions, we propose a novel regularized training objective whose optimization is achieved by an efficient approximation. Extensive experiments on both written and spoken language datasets empirically show that our approach yields comparable performance to the standard training on annotated data.

TI Learning dependency transduction models from unannotated examples
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON SERIES
   A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB We present a method for constructing a statistical machine translation system automatically from unannotated examples in a manner consistent with the principles of dependency grammar. The method involves learning a generative statistical model of paired dependency derivations of source and target sentences. Such a dependency transduction model consists of collections of weighted head transducers.
   Head transducers are finite-state machines with different formal properties from 'standard' finite-state transducers. When applied to machine translation, the acquired head transducers are applied 'middle out', efficiently converting source head words and dependents directly into their counterparts in the target language. We present experimental results on the accuracy of our models for English-Spanish and English-Japanese translation, the training examples being pairs of transcribed spontaneous utterances and their translations.
   A hierarchical decomposition of bi-language strings emerges from our training process; this decomposition may or may not correspond to familiar linguistic phrase structure. However, no explicit semantic representations are involved, suggesting an approach to language processing in which natural language itself is the semantic representation.

TI Japanese Argument Reordering Based on Dependency Structure for
   Statistical Machine Translation
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB While phrase-based statistical machine translation systems prefer to translate with longer phrases, this may cause errors in a free word order language, such as Japanese, in which the order of the arguments of the predicates is not solely determined by the predicates and the arguments can be placed quite freely in the text. In this paper, we propose to reorder the arguments but not the predicates in Japanese using a dependency structure as a kind of reordering. Instead of a single deterministically given permutation, we generate multiple reordered phrases for each sentence and translate them independently Then we apply a re-ranking method using a discriminative approach by Ranking Support Vector Machines (SVM) to re-score the multiple reordered phrase translations. In our experiment with the travel domain corpus BTEC, we gain a 1.22% BLEU score improvement when only 1-best is used for re-ranking and 4.12% BLEU score improvement when n-best is used for Japanese-English translation.

Translation of social media is a very challenging problem, since its style is very different from normal parallel corpora (e.g. News) and also include various types of noises. To make it worse, the amount of social media parallel corpora is extremely limited. In this paper, we use a domain sensitive training method which leverages a large amount of parallel data from popular domains together with a little amount of parallel data from social media. Furthermore, we generate a parallel dataset with pseudo noisy source sentences which are back-translated from monolingual data using a model trained by a similar domain sensitive way. We achieve more than 10 BLEU improvement in both En-Fr and Fr-En translation compared with the baseline methods.

AB Statistical machine translation (SMT) plays more and more important role now. The performance of the SMT is largely dependent on the size and quality of training data. But the demands for translation is rich, how to make the best of limited in-domain data to satisfy the needs of translation coming from different domains is one of the hot focus in current SMT. Domain adaption aims to obviously improve the specific-domain performance by bringing much out-of-domain parallel corpus at the absence of in-domain parallel corpus. Domain adaption is one of the keys to get the SMT into practical application. This paper introduces mainstream methods of domain adaption for SMT, compares advantages and disadvantages of representative methods based on the result of the same data and shows personal views about the possible future direction of domain adaption for SMT.

   language
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB The rapid globalisation in language technology and the Internet's fast expansion have brought nations and their cultures close together, and the demand for inter-language interactions has risen enormously. However, in many low-resource languages (LRL) pairings and areas, Machine Translation (MT) is still not viable because of a lack of parallel data. The challenge of MT is still unsolved. Recent studies employing monolingual datasets have shown excellent outcomes in Phrase-based Statistical MT (PBSMT) and Neural MT (NMT) systems. However, earlier researchers have demonstrated that unsupervised Statistical MT surpasses unsupervised NMT, especially for different language pairings. The study unveils the compendium of ten unsupervised SMT systems translation tasks utilizing a monolingual dataset from the Dravidian and Indo-Aryan language families; and a low-resource endangered language. The machine-translated experimental outcomes examined the system using different tokenizers and investigated them for various language pairs using different evaluation metrics for various iterations. The statistical significance of test results has been computed for each evaluation metric to check the true system quality of the translation tasks.

TI Layer-Wise De-Training and Re-Training for ConvS2S Machine Translation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB The convolutional sequence-to-sequence (ConvS2S) machine translation system is one of the typical neural machine translation (NMT) systems. Training the ConvS2S model tends to get stuck in a local optimum in our pre-studies. To overcome this inferior behavior, we propose to de-train a trained ConvS2S model in a mild way and retrain to find a better solution globally. In particular, the trained parameters of one layer of the NMT network are abandoned by re-initialization while other layers' parameters are kept at the same time to kick off re-optimization from a new start point and safeguard the new start point not too far from the previous optimum. This procedure is executed layer by layer until all layers of the ConvS2S model are explored. Experiments show that when compared to various measures for escaping from the local optimum, including initialization with random seeds, adding perturbations to the baseline parameters, and continuing training (con-training) with the baseline models, our method consistently improves the ConvS2S translation quality across various language pairs and achieves better performance.

AB Research in speech recognition and machine translation is boosting the use of large scale n-gram language models. We present an open source toolkit that permits to efficiently handle language models with billions of n-grams on conventional machines. The IRSTLM toolkit supports distribution of n-gram collection and smoothing over a computer cluster, language model compression through probability quantization, lazy-loading of huge language models from disk. IRSTLM has been so far successfully deployed with the Moses toolkit for statistical machine translation and with the FBK-irst speech recognition system. Efficiency of the tool is reported on a speech transcription task of Italian political speeches using a language model of 1.1 billion four-grams.

The framework of the application focuses on assisting deaf people to apply for the passport or related information. In this context, the main aim is to automatically translate the spontaneous speech, uttered by an officer, into Spanish Sign Language (SSL).
   In order to get the best translation quality, three alternative techniques have been evaluated: a rule-based approach, a phrase-based statistical approach, and a approach that makes use of stochastic finite state transducers. The best speech translation experiments have reported a 32.0% SER (Sign Error Rate) and a 7.1 BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy) including speech recognition errors.

TI Forecasting Erroneous Neural Machine Translation of Disease Symptoms:
   Development of Bayesian Probabilistic Classifiers for Cross-Lingual
   Health Translation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Background: Machine translation (MT) technologies have increasing applications in healthcare. Despite their convenience, cost-effectiveness, and constantly improved accuracy, research shows that the use of MT tools in medical or healthcare settings poses risks to vulnerable populations. Objectives: We aimed to develop machine learning classifiers (MNB and RVM) to forecast nuanced yet significant MT errors of clinical symptoms in Chinese neural MT outputs. Methods: We screened human translations of MSD Manuals for information on self-diagnosis of infectious diseases and produced their matching neural MT outputs for subsequent pairwise quality assessment by trained bilingual health researchers. Different feature optimisation and normalisation techniques were used to identify the best feature set. Results: The RVM classifier using optimised, normalised (L-2 normalisation) semantic features achieved the highest sensitivity, specificity, AUC, and accuracy. MNB achieved similar high performance using the same optimised semantic feature set. The best probability threshold of the best performing RVM classifier was found at 0.6, with a very high positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 27.82 (95% CI: 3.99, 193.76), and a low negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.19 (95% CI: 0.08, 046), suggesting the high diagnostic utility of our model to predict the probabilities of erroneous MT of disease symptoms to help reverse potential inaccurate self-diagnosis of diseases among vulnerable people without adequate medical knowledge or an ability to ascertain the reliability of MT outputs. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated the viability, flexibility, and efficiency of introducing machine learning models to help promote risk-aware use of MT technologies to achieve optimal, safer digital health outcomes for vulnerable people.

AB This paper proposes a mechanism for learning lexical level correspondences between two languages from a set of translated sentence pairs. The proposed mechanism is based on an analogical reasoning between two translation examples. Given two translation examples, the similar parts of the sentences in the source language must correspond to the similar parts of the sentences in the target language. Similarly, the different parts should correspond to the respective parts in the translated sentences. The correspondences between the similarities, and also differences are learned in the form of translation templates. The approach has been implemented and tested on a small training dataset and produced promising results for further investigation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The progress of translation technologies has presented new opportunities and challenges to translation education, and the application of machine translation in education has received growing attention among researchers. This paper reviewed a total of 40 studies (19 empirical studies and 21 position papers) published in five SSCI-indexed and three CSSCIindexed journals during 2011 to 2020. The SSCI-indexed journals include Perspectives, The Interpreter and Translator Trainer, Babel, Across Languages and Cultures, The Journal of Specialized Translation. And the three CSSCI-indexed journals are Chinese Translators Journal, Shanghai Journal of Translators and Technology Enhanced Foreign Language Education. At first, this paper explored the yearly publication trend and the research themes of the journals. Then, it summarized the methodologies of empirical studies and found that a majority of the studies employed the mixed or qualitative methods with data analysis based on qualitative summaries and descriptive quantitative analysis. Major findings and pedagogical implications were provided at the end.

AB Neural machine translation (NMT) often suffers from the vulnerability to noisy perturbations in the input. We propose an approach to improving the robustness of NMT models, which consists of two parts: (1) attack the translation model with adversarial source examples; (2) defend the translation model with adversarial target inputs to improve its robustness against the adversarial source inputs. For the generation of adversarial inputs, we propose a gradient-based method to craft adversarial examples informed by the translation loss over the clean inputs. Experimental results on Chinese-English and English-German translation tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements (2.8 and 1.6 BLEU points) over Transformer on standard clean benchmarks as well as exhibiting higher robustness on noisy data.

TI Development of Telugu-Tamil Transfer-Based Machine Translation System:
   An Improvization Using Divergence Index
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB Building an automatic, high-quality, robust machine translation (MT) system is a fascinating yet an arduous task, as one of the major difficulties lies in cross-linguistic differences or divergences between languages at various levels. The existence of translation divergence precludes straightforward mapping in theMT system. An increase in the number of divergences also increases the complexity, especially in linguistically motivated transfer-based MT systems. This paper discusses the development of Telugu-Tamil transfer-based MT and how a divergence index (DI) is built to quantify the number of parametric variations between languages in order to improve the success rate of MT. The DI facilitates MT in proposing where to put efforts for the given language pair to attain better and faster results. In addition, handling strategies of different types of divergences in a transfer-based approach to MT are discussed. The paper also includes the evaluation method and how an improvization takes place with the application of DI in MT.

TI Detecting errors in machine translation using residuals and metrics of
   automatic evaluation
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
AB Errors and residuals are closely related measures of the deviation. An error is a deviation of the observed value (PEMT output) from the expected value (MT output), while the residual of the observed value is the difference between the observed and predicted value of quality. We propose an exploratory data technique representing an ideal instrument to evaluate and improve machine translation (MT) systems. The main contribution consists of a rigorous technique (a statistical method), novel to the research of MT evaluation given by residual analysis to identify differences between MT output and post-edited machine translation output regarding human translation (reference). The residual analysis of the automatic metrics can help us to discover significant differences between MT and PEMT and to identify questionable issues regarding the one reference. In this study, we show the usage of residuals in MT evaluation. Using residual analysis, we identified sentences, in which significant differences were found in the scores of automatic metrics between MT output and post-edited (PE) MT output from Slovak into English.

SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
AB Although, Chinese and Spanish are two of the most spoken languages in the world, not much research has been done in machine translation for this language pair. This paper focuses on investigating the state-of-the-art of Chinese-to-Spanish statistical machine translation (SMT), which nowadays is one of the most popular approaches to machine translation. For this purpose, we report details of the available parallel corpus which are Basic Traveller Expressions Corpus (BTEC), Holy Bible and United Nations (UN). Additionally, we conduct experimental work with the largest of these three corpora to explore alternative SMT strategies by means of using a pivot language. Three alternatives are considered for pivoting: cascading, pseudo-corpus and triangulation. As pivot language, we use either English, Arabic or French. Results show that, for a phrase-based SMT system, English is the best pivot language between Chinese and Spanish. We propose a system output combination using the pivot strategies which is capable of outperforming the direct translation strategy. The main objective of this work is motivating and involving the research community to work in this important pair of languages given their demographic impact.

AB This paper has as its main goal investigating the errors and non-errors made by three machine translation (MT) systems in translating gender-bound constructs from English to Arabic in four selected technical texts. The three MT systems used in this study were Systran's Pure Neural Machine Translation (PNMT), Google Translate (GT) and Microsoft Bing (MB). The target gender-bound constructs were subject-verb agreement, adjectival-noun agreement and pronoun-antecedent agreement, which occurred naturally in four purposefully selected technical texts. The idea behind the choice of technical texts was to reduce the linguistic load found in other genres, such as literary texts, which involve utilising creative linguistic tools that are out of the scope of the present paper. Upon the qualitative examination of the target language texts, the findings revealed that the three MT systems had errors and non-errors in rendering gender-bound constructs from English to Arabic, and that errors transpired in certain co-textual environments.

TI Improving neural machine translation with POS-tag features for
   low-resource language pairs
SO HELIYON
AB Integrating linguistic features has been widely utilized in statistical machine translation (SMT) systems, resulting in improved translation quality. However, for low-resource languages such as Thai and Myanmar, the integration of linguistic features in neural machine translation (NMT) systems has yet to be implemented. In this study, we propose transformer-based NMT models (transformer, multi-source transformer, and shared-multi-source transformer models) using linguistic features for two-way translation of Thai-to-Myanmar, Myanmar-to-English, and Thai-to-English. Linguistic features such as part-of-speech (POS) tags or universal part-of-speech (UPOS) tags are added to each word on either the source or target side, or both the source and target sides, and the proposed models are conducted. The multi-source transformer and shared-multi-source transformer models take two inputs (i.e., string data and string data with POS tags) and produce string data or string data with POS tags. A transformer model that utilizes only word vectors was used as the first baseline model for comparison with the proposed models. The second baseline model, an Edit-Based Transformer with Repositioning (EDITOR) model, was also used to compare with our proposed models in addition to the baseline transformer model. The findings of the experiments show that adding linguistic features to the transformer-based models enhances the performance of a neural machine translation in low-resource language pairs. Moreover, the best translation results were yielded using shared-multi-source transformer models with linguistic features resulting in more significant Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) scores and character n-gram F-score (chrF) scores than the baseline transformer and EDITOR models.

AB The rise and dominance of Information Technology in urban areas has created a gap between urban and rural India; and this gap is referred as the Digital Divide. The need of the hour is to bridge this gap. The various factors responsible for this divide as studied in the literature review of Digital Divide are: the language barrier, cost factor, technology awareness, lack of resources etc. To study the factors responsible for the digital divide in Jammu region, a pilot survey was conducted which revealed many factors to be same as those found in the literature survey; language being one of the major factors responsible for this divide]. Many initiatives have been taken by the government to bridge this divide i.e. costs of computing have been cut down, computer facilities have been provided and a lot of work has been done even in the language field. In today's time, the web supports multilingualism. English is not the only language supported by computers today.
   In the state of Jammu and Kashmir, languages are majorly spoken arey: Urdu, Kashmiri, Hindi and Dogri. Machine Translation systems for translating Hindi and English text to Urdu are available; Kashmir University is working on the development of translation tools for Dogri; but no work of translation is done for the Dogri language. This paper discusses the various phases in the development of Machine Translation System for the Hindi-Dogri language pair.
   The organization of the paper is as follows: The section I gives a brief introduction to Machine Translation and the various approaches of machine translation, section II, explains in brief the phases in the translation of Hindi language to Dogri language. For the transliteration of Hindi text IAST is used.

AB Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) based Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models under an encoder-decoder framework show significant improvements in translation quality recently. Given the encoded representations of source sentence, the NMT systems generate translated sentence word by word, dependent on the hidden states of the decoder. The hidden states of the decoder update at each decoding step, deciding the next translation to be generated. In this case, the transitions of the hidden states between successive steps contribute to the decisions of the next token of the translation, which draws less attention in previous work. In this work, we propose an explicit supervised objective on the transitions of the decoder hidden states, aiming to help our model to learn the transitional patterns better. We first attempt to model the increment of the transition by the proposed subtraction operation. Then, we require the increment to be predictive of the word to translate. The proposed approach strengthens the relationship between the transition of the decoder and the translation. Empirical evaluation shows considerable improvements on Chinese-English, German-English, and English-German translation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB Integration of in-domain knowledge into an out-of-domain statistical machine translation (SMT) system poses challenges due to the lack of resources. Lack of in-domain bilingual corpora is one such issue. In this paper, we propose a simplification translation-restoration (STR) framework for domain adaptation in SMT systems. An SMT system to translate medical records from English to Chinese is taken as a case study. We identify the critical segments in a medical sentence and simplify them to alleviate the data sparseness problem in the out-of-domain SMT system. After translating the simplified sentence, the translations of these critical segments are restored to their proper positions. Besides the simplification pre-processing step and the restoration post processing step, we also enhance the translation and language models in the STR framework by using pseudo bilingual corpora generated by the background MT system. In the experiments, we adapt an SMT system from a government document domain to a medical record domain. The results show the effectiveness of the STR framework. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Limited machine translation (LMT) is an unliterate automatic translation based on bilingual dictionary and sentence bank, and related algorithms can be widely used in natural language processing applications. This paper addresses the Japanese-Chinese LMT problem, proposes two syntactic hypotheses about Japanese language, and designs a fast-syntax-matching-based Japanese-Chinese (FSMJC) LMT algorithm. In which, the fast syntax matching function, a modified version of Levenshtein function, can approximately get the syntactic similarity after the efficient calculating of the formal similarity between two Japanese sentences. The experimental results show that the FSMJC LMT algorithm can achieve the preferable performance with greatly reduced time costs, and prove that our two syntactic hypotheses are effective on Japanese text.

Error back propagation training algorithm is used for training the neural net-works. Such translation neural networks (TNNs) can be trained to perform translation between any two natural languages provided dictionaries for these natural languages are designed very carefully. We have considered translation from English to Hindi (Indian Language). Each word in both the languages are assigned 20-bit binary code. The sentences in these languages are represented by series of 20-bits binary codes. TNNs simply learns mapping from one language to another language. The system is implemented in Visual C++ on pentium platform. The scope of translation is simple sentences (all forms) of three tenses (past, present future).

AB Machine Translation (MT) is one of the most important natural language processing applications. Independently of the applied MT approach, a MT system automatically generates an equivalent version (in some target language) of an input sentence (in some source language). Recently, a new MT approach has been proposed: neural machine translation (NMT). NMT systems have already outperformed traditional phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBSMT) systems for some pairs of languages. However, any MT approach outputs errors. In this work we present a comparative study of MT errors generated by a NMT system and a PBSMT system trained on the same English - Brazilian Portuguese parallel corpus. This is the first study of this kind involving NMT for Brazilian Portuguese. Furthermore, the analyses and conclusions presented here point out the specific problems of NMT outputs in relation to PBSMT ones and also give lots of insights into how to implement automatic post-editing for a NMT system. Finally, the corpora annotated with MT errors generated by both PBSMT and NMT systems are also available.

TI Sentence Selection and Weighting for Neural Machine Translation Domain
   Adaptation
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Neural machine translation (NMT) has been prominent in many machine translation tasks. However, in some domain-specific tasks, only the corpora from similar domains can improve translation performance. If out-of-domain corpora are directly added into the in-domain corpus, the translation performance may even degrade. Therefore, domain adaptation techniques are essential to solve the NMT domain problem. Most existing methods for domain adaptation are designed for the conventional phrase-based machine translation. For NMT domain adaptation, there have been only a few studies on topics such as fine tuning, domain tags, and domain features. In this paper, we have four goals for sentence level NMT domain adaptation. First, the NMT's internal sentence embedding is exploited and the sentence embedding similarity is used to select out-of-domain sentences that are close to the in-domain corpus. Second, we propose three sentence weighting methods, i.e., sentence weighting, domain weighting, and batch weighting, to balance the data distribution during NMT training. Third, in addition, we propose dynamic training methods to adjust the sentence selection and weighting during NMT training. Fourth, to solve the multidomain problem in a real-world NMT scenario where the domain distributions of training and testing data often mismatch, we proposed a multidomain sentence weighting method to balance the domain distributions of training data and match the domain distributions of training and testing data. The proposed methods are evaluated in international workshop on spoken language translation (IWSLT) English-to-French/German tasks and a multidomain English-to-French task. Empirical results show that the sentence selection and weighting methods can significantly improve the NMT performance, outperforming the existing baselines.

AB Although multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) enables multiple language translations, the training process is based on independent multilingual objectives. Most multilingual models can not explicitly exploit different language pairs to assist each other, ignoring the relationships among them. In this work, we propose a novel agreement-based method to encourage multilingual agreement among different translation directions, which minimizes the differences among them. We combine the multilingual training objectives with the agreement term by randomly substituting some fragments of the source language with their counterpart translations of auxiliary languages. To examine the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on the multilingual translation task of 10 language pairs. Experimental results show that our method achieves significant improvements over the previous multilingual baselines.

TI ANN and Rule Based Method for English to Arabic Machine Translation
SO INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Machine translation is the process by which computer software is used to translate a text from one natural language into another language with or without minimal human intervention. This definition involves accounting for the grammatical structure of each language and using rules and grammars to transfer the grammatical structure of the source language into the target language. This paper presents an English into Arabic Machine Translation (MT) system for translating simple well-structured English sentences into well-structured Arabic sentences using a rule-based approach and feed-forward back-propagation Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Our system is able to translate sentences having gerunds, infinitives, prepositions and prepositional objects, direct objects, indirect objects, etc. Neural network works as bilingual dictionary, which does not only store the meaning of English word in Arabic but it also stores linguistic features attached to the word. The performance is evaluated by different MT evaluation methods. The n-gram blue score achieved by the system is 0.6029, METEOR score achieved is 0.8221 and 0.8386 on F-measure.

AB Computer-aided translation (CAT) system is the most popular tool which helps human translators perform language translation efficiently. To further improve the efficiency, there is an increasing interest in applying the machine translation (MT) technology to upgrade CAT. Post-editing is a standard approach: human translators generate the translation by correcting MT outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach deeply integrating MT into CAT systems: a well-designed input method which makes full use of the knowledge adopted by MT systems, such as translation rules, decoding hypotheses and n-best translation lists. Our proposed approach allows human translators to focus on choosing better translation results with less time rather than just complete translation themselves. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our method saves more than 14% time and over 33% keystrokes, and it improves the translation quality as well by more than 3 absolute BLEU scores compared with the strong baseline, i.e., post-editing using Google Pinyin.

TI The Operation Sequence ModelCombining N-Gram-Based and Phrase-Based
   Statistical Machine Translation
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB In this article, we present a novel machine translation model, the Operation Sequence Model (OSM), which combines the benefits of phrase-based and N-gram-based statistical machine translation (SMT) and remedies their drawbacks. The model represents the translation process as a linear sequence of operations. The sequence includes not only translation operations but also reordering operations. As in N-gram-based SMT, the model is: (i) based on minimal translation units, (ii) takes both source and target information into account, (iii) does not make a phrasal independence assumption, and (iv) avoids the spurious phrasal segmentation problem. As in phrase-based SMT, the model (i) has the ability to memorize lexical reordering triggers, (ii) builds the search graph dynamically, and (iii) decodes with large translation units during search. The unique properties of the model are (i) its strong coupling of reordering and translation where translation and reordering decisions are conditioned on n previous translation and reordering decisions, and (ii) the ability to model local and long-range reorderings consistently. Using BLEU as a metric of translation accuracy, we found that our system performs significantly better than state-of-the-art phrase-based systems (Moses and Phrasal) and N-gram-based systems (Ncode) on standard translation tasks. We compare the reordering component of the OSM to the Moses lexical reordering model by integrating it into Moses. Our results show that OSM outperforms lexicalized reordering on all translation tasks. The translation quality is shown to be improved further by learning generalized representations with a POS-based OSM.

AB The commonly used framework for unsupervised machine translation builds initial translation models of both translation directions, and then performs iterative back-translation to jointly boost their translation performance. The initialization stage is very important since bad initialization may wrongly squeeze the search space, and too much noise introduced in this stage may hurt the final performance. In this paper, we propose a novel retrieval and rewriting based method to better initialize unsupervised translation models. We first retrieve semantically comparable sentences from monolingual corpora of two languages and then rewrite the target side to minimize the semantic gap between the source and retrieved targets with a designed rewriting model. The rewritten sentence pairs are used to initialize SMT models which are used to generate pseudo data for two NMT models, followed by the iterative back-translation. Experiments show that our method can build better initial unsupervised translation models and improve the final translation performance by over 4 BLEU scores.

AB Natural Language Processing has improved tremendously with the success of Deep Learning. Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has arisen as the most powerful with the power of Deep Learning. The same idea has been recently applied to source code. Code Generation (CG) is the task of generating source code from natural language input. This paper introduces a Python parallel corpus of natural language intent and source code pairs. It also proposes a Code Generation model based on Transformer architecture used for NMT by using code tokenization and code embeddings on the custom parallel corpus. The proposed architecture achieved a good BLEU score of 32.4 and Rouge-L of 82.1, which is on par with natural language translation.

Based on the work for cross-language information retrieval evaluation task in the 9(th) Text Retrieval Conference, a Chinese-English cross-language information retrieval pattern has been constructed. In this pattern, Chinese-English query translation is adopted as the dominant strategy, Chinese queries are used as translation objects, and Chinese-English machine readable dictionaries are utilized as the important knowledge source to acquire correct translations. By combining English monolingual information retrieval module constructed, the Chinese-English cross-language information retrieval process can be implemented successfully.

AB In order to improve the quality of English translation teaching, this paper combines the theory of multiple intelligence to classify the English translation teaching process. Moreover, this paper adopts Fisher's discriminant method and Bayesian discriminant method to classify the English translation teaching samples. In order to improve the discrimination accuracy of the extreme learning machine algorithm, this paper applies the particle swarm optimization extreme learning machine algorithm to the research on the classification of English translation teaching samples and proposes an intelligent English classification teaching model based on the actual situation of English translation teaching. In addition, this paper verifies the system model proposed in this paper by evaluating the teaching method. The research shows that the classification model of English translation teaching mode based on the theory of multiple intelligence proposed in this paper has a certain effect, which can promote the effect of English translation teaching.

AB Recently, the use of syntax has very effectively improved machine translation (MT) quality in many text translation tasks. However, using syntax in speech translation poses additional challenges because of disfluencies and other spoken language phenomena, and of errors introduced by automatic speech recognition (ASR). In this paper, we investigate the effect of using syntax in a large-scale audio document translation task targeting broadcast news and broadcast conversations. We do so by comparing the performance of three synchronous context-free grammar based translation approaches: 1) hierarchical phrase-based translation, 2) syntax-augmented MT, and 3) string-to-dependency MT. The results show a positive effect of explicitly using syntax when translating broadcast news, but no benefit when translating broadcast conversations. The results indicate that improving the robustness of syntactic systems against conversational language style is important to their success and requires future effort.

TI Human evaluations of machine translation in an ethically charged
   situation
SO NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY
AB Despite the immense influence of machine translation (MT) on cross-cultural communication worldwide, little is known about end users' predispositions toward MT. Our online experiment (N = 284) compares people's perceptions of MT and human translation in an ethically charged situation, in which the translation serves an immigrant worker in an interaction defined by power imbalance. Using hierarchical linear regression, we found that an otherwise identical translation was evaluated differently when it was attributed to MT or human translation. Results reveal that translators and non-translators alike exhibit a negative bias toward the MT product when asked to assess its accuracy and reliability, its ability to convey cultural and emotional otherness, and its potential effectiveness in helping the disadvantaged immigrant in need of the translation. We also demonstrate how lower evaluations of the MT product lead to a stronger wish to intervene in the translation by introducing changes to the original message. Our results suggest that predispositions toward MT must be taken into account in any consideration of MT-mediated communication, as these predispositions may shape the communicative act itself.

TI N-gram Based WSD for Improving Accuracy of Machine Translation using TM
SO HELIX
AB Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) concerns with selecting an accurate sense of a term automatically in the ken situation. It is very significant and challenging problem in several applications of natural language processing. We have used a probabilistic model in our system. Word Sense Disambiguation is done based on n-grams (bigrams and trigrams). The objective is to evaluate the performance of the system with various kinds of an input string which have an ambiguous word. For resolving the probability of the sense of an ambiguous word in the given sentence we use a Naive Bayes classifier. We have use translation memory (TM) to speed up the translation process. A classical translation memory chooses contender translations into a target language (Hindi) by getting similar translations to an entered text from available pairs of earlier translated segments.

TI Translating perceptions and managing expectations: an analysis of
   management and production perspectives on machine translation
SO PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATION THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB The use of machine translation (MT) in professional translation tasks can change not only how translators work, but also how projects are managed and the expectations they entail across translation supply chains. Previous research has looked extensively into translators' attitudes to MT but has often ignored important aspects of how translators' views interact with those of other language industry stakeholders. This article presents a contrastive analysis of attitudes to MT which covers management and production perspectives. The discussion draws on semi-structured interviews which were thematically coded and qualitatively examined. The study shows how MT adds uncertainty to translation production networks. It argues that the challenges posed by MT are exacerbated by how the current makeup of the language industry restricts translators' field of influence to texts while possibly alienating them from wider aspects of business strategy. The article makes two suggestions. First, it calls for increased translator involvement in the management aspects of service provision. Second, it emphasises the need for a deeper discussion of MT which, rather than framing the technology itself as a potential 'threat', addresses broader societal issues involving misguided perceptions and mismatched expectations.

AB Recent work on non-autoregressive neural machine translation (NAT) aims at improving the efficiency by parallel decoding without sacrificing the quality. However, existing NAT methods are either inferior to Transformer or require multiple decoding passes, leading to reduced speedup. We propose the Glancing Language Model (GLM) for single-pass parallel generation models. With GLM, we develop Glancing Transformer (GLAT) for machine translation. With only single-pass parallel decoding, GLAT is able to generate high-quality translation with 8x-15x speedup. Note that GLAT does not modify the network architecture, which is a training method to learn word interdependency. Experiments on multiple WMT language directions show that GLAT outperforms all previous single pass non-autoregressive methods, and is nearly comparable to Transformer, reducing the gap to 0.25-0.9 BLEU points.

AB Although their use in training quality machine translation systems has been proven, parallel corpora-large collections of translated texts-are generally hard to come by for the majority of languages. To counteract this fact, a relatively small collection may be processed in more depth by further cleaning and more accurately splitting and aligning the texts. We apply this to an existing English/Zulu parallel corpus that has been used for statistical machine translation experiments. After these preprocessing steps, we run the same experiments for comparative purposes. Our results suggest that compatibility of bitexts, the choice of sentence splitters used on different parts of the text, as well as manual work, may have a notable effect on both the corpus size and on automatic translation quality.

AB Neural machine translation achieves impressive results in high-resource conditions, but performance often suffers when the input domain is low-resource. The standard practice of adapting a separate model for each domain of interest does not scale well in practice from both a quality perspective (brittleness under domain shift) as well as a cost perspective (added maintenance and inference complexity). In this paper, we propose a framework for training a single multi-domain neural machine translation model that is able to translate several domains without increasing inference time or memory usage. We show that this model can improve translation on both high- and low-resource domains over strong multidomain baselines. In addition, our proposed model is effective when domain labels are unknown during training, as well as robust under noisy data conditions.

AB Here, a novel method for extracting parallel sub-sentential fragments from comparable corpora is presented. The proposed method aims to extract bilingual sentence fragments from noisy sentence pairs. We define a similarity measure between bilingual sentence fragments which is actually a linear combination of some new features. The features used are fragment length, LLR score, alignment path specifications in the block and translation coverage fraction. This method enables us to extract useful machine translation training data from comparable corpora that contain no parallel sentence pairs. Evaluations indicate that proposed method is very efficient and not only outperforms the existing similar systems in the measure of precision and recall; it also helps to improve the performance of a statistical machine translation system.

AB While neural machine translation (NMT) has made remarkable progress in recent years, it is hard to interpret its internal workings due to the continuous representations and non-linearity of neural networks. In this work, we propose to use layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to compute the contribution of each contextual word to arbitrary hidden states in the attention-based encoder-decoder framework. We show that visualization with LRP helps to interpret the internal workings of NMT and analyze translation errors.

AB Recently, end-to-end speech translation (ST) has gained significant attention as it avoids error propagation. However, the approach suffers from data scarcity. It heavily depends on direct ST data and is less efficient in making use of speech transcription and text translation data, which is often more easily available. In the related field of multilingual text translation, several techniques have been proposed for zero-shot translation. A main idea is to increase the similarity of semantically similar sentences in different languages. We investigate whether these ideas can be applied to speech translation, by building ST models trained on speech transcription and text translation data. We investigate the effects of data augmentation and auxiliary loss function. The techniques were successfully applied to few-shot ST using limited ST data, with improvements of up to +12.9 BLEU points compared to direct end-to-end ST and +3.1 BLEU points compared to ST models fine-tuned from ASR model.

AB Utterance classification is an important task in spoken-dialog systems. The response of the system is dependent on category assigned to the speaker's utterance by the classifier. However often the input speech is spontaneous and noisy which results in high word error rates. This results in unsatisfactory system performance. In this paper we describe a method to improve the natural language call classification task using statistical machine translation (SMT). We utilize the translation model in SMT to capture the relation between truth and the ASR transcribed text. The model is trained using the human transcribed text and the ASR transcribed text. During deployment SMT is used to sanitize the ASR transcribed text. Our experiments with IBM model 2 shows significant improvement in call classification accuracy.

AB When translating from a language that does not morphologically mark information such as gender and number into a language that does, translation systems must "guess" this missing information, often leading to incorrect translations in the given context. We propose a black-box approach for injecting the missing information to a pre-trained neural machine translation system, allowing to control the morphological variations in the generated translations without changing the underlying model or training data. We evaluate our method on an English to Hebrew translation task, and show that it is effective in injecting the gender and number information and that supplying the correct information improves the translation accuracy in up to 2.3 BLEU on a female-speaker test set for a state-of-the-art online black-box system.

AB Patent machine translation is one of main target areas of current practical MT systems. Patent documents have their own peculiar description style. Especially, abstracts or claims in patent documents are characterized by their long and complex syntactic structures, which are often caused by coordination. So, syntactic analysis of patent documents requires special treatment for coordination. This paper describes a method to deal with long sentences in patent documents by recognizing coordinate structures. Coordinate structures are recognized using a similarity table which reflects parallelism between conjuncts. Our method is applied to a practical MT system and improves its quality and efficiency.

AB The conventional approach in text-based machine translation (MT) is to translate complete sentences, which are conveniently indicated by sentence boundary markers. However, since such boundary markers are not available for speech, new methods are required that define an optimal unit for translation. Our experimental results show that with a segment length optimized for a particular MT system, intra-sentence segmentation can improve translation performance (measured in BLEU) by up to 11% for Arabic Broadcast Conversation (BC) and 6% for Arabic Broadcast News (BN). We show that acoustic segmentation that minimizes Word Error Rate (WER) may not give the best translation performance. We improve upon it by automatically resegmenting the ASR output in a way that is optimized for translation and argue that it might be necessary for different stages of a Spoken Language Translation (SLT) system to define their own optimal units.

AB Small perturbations in the input can severely distort intermediate representations and thus impact translation quality of neural machine translation (NMT) models. In this paper, we propose to improve the robustness of NMT models with adversarial stability training. The basic idea is to make both the encoder and decoder in NMT models robust against input perturbations by enabling them to behave similarly for the original input and its perturbed counterpart. Experimental results on Chinese-English, English-German and English-French translation tasks show that our approaches can not only achieve significant improvements over strong NMT systems but also improve the robustness of NMT models.

AB Machine translation plays an essential role in people's daily international communication. However, machine translation systems are far from perfect. To tackle this problem, researchers have proposed several approaches to testing machine translation. A promising trend among these approaches is to use word replacement, where only one word in the original sentence is replaced with another word to form a sentence pair. However, precise control of the impact of word replacement remains an outstanding issue in these approaches.
   To address this issue, we propose CAT, a novelword-replacement-based approach, whose basic idea is to identify word replacement with controlled impact (referred to as isotopic replacement). To achieve this purpose, we use a neural-based language model to encode the sentence context, and design a neural-network-based algorithm to evaluate context-aware semantic similarity between two words. Furthermore, similar to TransRepair, a state-of-the-art word-replacement-based approach, CAT also provides automatic fixing of revealed bugs without model retraining.
   Our evaluation on Google Translate and Transformer indicates that CAT achieves significant improvements over TransRepair. In particular, 1) CAT detects seven more types of bugs than TransRepair; 2) CAT detects 129% more translation bugs than TransRepair; 3) CAT repairs twice more bugs than TransRepair, many of which may bring serious consequences if left unfixed; and 4) CAT has better efficiency than TransRepair in input generation (0.01s v.s. 0.41s) and comparable efficiency with TransRepair in bug repair (1.92s v.s. 1.34s).

AB Post-editing is the most popular approach to improve accuracy and speed of human translators by applying the machine translation (MT) technology. During the translation process, human translators generate the translation by correcting MT outputs in the postediting scenario. To avoid repeating the same MT errors, in this paper, we propose an efficient framework to update MT in real-time by learning from user feedback. This framework includes: (1) an anchor-based word alignment model, being specially designed to get correct alignments for unknown words and new translations of known words, for extracting the latest translation knowledge from user feedback; (2) an online translation model, being based on random forests (RFs), updating translation knowledge in real-time for later predictions and having a strong adaptability with temporal noise as well as context changes. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves translation quality as the number of feedback sentences increasing, and the translation quality is comparable to that of the off-line baseline system with all training data.

AB Text simplification (TS) is the technique of reducing the lexical, syntactical complexity of text. Existing automatic TS systems can simplify text only by lexical simplification or by manually defined rules. Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a recently proposed approach for Machine Translation (MT) that is receiving a lot of research interest. In this paper, we regard original English and simplified English as two languages, and apply a NMT model-Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) encoder-decoder on TS to make the neural network to learn text simplification rules by itself. Then we discuss challenges and strategies about how to apply a NMT model to the task of text simplification.

AB Mobile robots that interact with humans in an intuitive way must be able to follow directions provided by humans in unconstrained natural language. In this work we investigate how statistical machine translation techniques can be used to bridge the gap between natural language route instructions and a map of an environment built by a robot. Our approach uses training data to learn to translate from natural language instructions to an automatically-labeled map. The complexity of the translation process is controlled by taking advantage of physical constraints imposed by the map. As a result, our technique can efficiently handle uncertainty in both map labeling and parsing. Our experiments demonstrate the promising capabilities achieved by our approach.

AB We investigate the problem of simultaneous machine translation of long-form speech content. We target a continuous speech-to-text scenario, generating translated captions for a live audio feed, such as a lecture or play-by-play commentary. As this scenario allows for revisions to our incremental translations, we adopt a re-translation approach to simultaneous translation, where the source is repeatedly translated from scratch as it grows. This approach naturally exhibits very low latency and high final quality, but at the cost of incremental instability as the output is continuously refined. We experiment with a pipeline of industry-grade speech recognition and translation tools, augmented with simple inference heuristics to improve stability. We use TED Talks as a source of multilingual test data, developing our techniques on English-to-German spoken language translation. Our minimalist approach to simultaneous translation allows us to scale our final evaluation to several other target languages, dramatically improving incremental stability for all of them.

Evaluation of SMT systems in Baltic countries is mostly done by using automatic metrics. In this paper we present a linguistic analysis for the output of an English-Latvian SMT system.

In this paper, two length models along with two parameter estimation methods and two alternative parametrisations for statistical machine translation (SMT) are presented. More precisely, we incorporate explicit bilingual length modelling in a state-of-the-art log-linear SMT system as an additional feature function in order to prove the contribution of length information. Finally, a systematic evaluation on reference SMT tasks considering different language pairs proves the benefits of explicit length modelling. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Multilingual approaches such as mBART (Liu et al., 2020) are capable of pre-training a complete, multilingual sequence-to-sequence model through denoising objectives, making it a great starting point for building multilingual translation systems. Our main focus in this work is to investigate the effectiveness of multilingual finetuning on such a multilingual language model on various translation tasks, including low-resource, multimodal, and mixed-domain translation. We further explore a multimodal approach based on universal visual representation (Zhang et al., 2019) and compare its performance against a unimodal approach based on mBART alone.

AB Multimodal machine translation is an attractive application of neural machine translation (NMT). It helps computers to deeply understand visual objects and their relations with natural languages. However, multimodal NMT systems suffer from a shortage of available training data, resulting in poor performance for translating rare words. In NMT, pretrained word embeddings have been shown to improve NMT of low-resource domains, and a search-based approach is proposed to address the rare word problem. In this study, we effectively combine these two approaches in the context of multimodal NMT and explore how we can take full advantage of pretrained word embeddings to better translate rare words. We report overall performance improvements of 1.24 METEOR and 2.49 BLEU and achieve an improvement of 7.67 F-score for rare word translation.

TI How to evaluate machine translation: A review of automated and human
   metrics
SO NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING
AB This article presents the most up-to-date, influential automated, semiautomated and human metrics used to evaluate the quality of machine translation (MT) output and provides the necessary background for MT evaluation projects. Evaluation is, as repeatedly admitted, highly relevant for the improvement of MT. This article is divided into three parts: the first one is dedicated to automated metrics; the second, to human metrics; and the last, to the challenges posed by neural machine translation (NMT) regarding its evaluation. The first part includes reference translation-based metrics; confidence or quality estimation (QE) metrics, which are used as alternatives for quality assessment; and diagnostic evaluation based on linguistic checkpoints. Human evaluation metrics are classified according to the criterion of whether human judges directly express a so-called subjective evaluation judgment, such as 'good' or 'better than', or not, as is the case in error classification. The former methods are based on directly expressed judgment (DEJ); therefore, they are called 'DEJ-based evaluation methods', while the latter are called 'non-DEJ-based evaluation methods'. In the DEJ-based evaluation section, tasks such as fluency and adequacy annotation, ranking and direct assessment (DA) are presented, whereas in the non-DEJ-based evaluation section, tasks such as error classification and postediting are detailed, with definitions and guidelines, thus rendering this article a useful guide for evaluation projects. Following the detailed presentation of the previously mentioned metrics, the specificities of NMT are set forth along with suggestions for its evaluation, according to the latest studies. As human translators are the most adequate judges of the quality of a translation, emphasis is placed on the human metrics seen from a translator-judge perspective to provide useful methodology tools for interdisciplinary research groups that evaluate MT systems.

AB E-commerce platforms categorize their products into a multi-level taxonomy tree with thousands of leaf categories. Conventional methods for product categorization are typically based on machine learning classification algorithms. These algorithms take product information as input (e.g., titles and descriptions) to classify a product into a leaf category. In this article, we propose a new paradigm based on machine translation. In our approach, we translate a product's natural language description into a sequence of tokens representing a root-to-leaf path in a product taxonomy. In our experiments on two large real-world datasets, we show that our approach achieves better predictive accuracy than a state-of-the-art classification system for product categorization. In addition, we demonstrate that our machine translation models can propose meaningful new paths between previously unconnected nodes in a taxonomy tree, thereby transforming the taxonomy into a directed acyclic graph. We discuss how the resultant taxonomy directed acyclic graph promotes user-friendly navigation, and how it is more adaptable to new products.

The main focus is on techniques to adapt MT to increase translation quality; however, we also explore MT adaptation to improve effectiveness of cross-lingual IR.
   Methods and data: Our MT system is Moses, a state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical machine translation system. The IR system is based on the BM25 retrieval model implemented in the Lucene search engine. The MT techniques employed in this work include in-domain training and tuning, intelligent training data selection, optimization of phrase table configuration, compound splitting, and exploiting synonyms as translation variants. The IR methods include morphological normalization and using multiple translation variants for query expansion. The experiments are performed and thoroughly evaluated on three language pairs: Czech-English, German-English, and French-English. MT quality is evaluated on data sets created within the Khresmoi project and IR effectiveness is tested on the CLEF eHealth 2013 data sets.
   Results: The search query translation results achieved in our experiments are outstanding - our systems outperform not only our strong baselines, but also Google Translate and Microsoft Bing Translator in direct comparison carried out on all the language pairs. The baseline BLEU scores increased from 26.59 to 41.45 for Czech-English, from 23.03 to 40.82 for German-English, and from 32.67 to 40.82 for French-English. This is a 55% improvement on average. In terms of the IR performance on this particular test collection, a significant improvement over the baseline is achieved only for French-English. For Czech-English and German-English, the increased MT quality does not lead to better IR results.
   Conclusions: Most of the MT techniques employed in our experiments improve MT of medical search queries. Especially the intelligent training data selection proves to be very successful for domain adaptation of MT. Certain improvements are also obtained from German compound splitting on the source language side. Translation quality, however, does not appear to correlate with the IR performance - better translation does not necessarily yield better retrieval. We discuss in detail the contribution of the individual techniques and state-of-the-art features and provide future research directions.. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Improving the performance of statistical machine translation is often a significant problem, especially in low language resource scenarios such as Chinese-Mongolian SMT. In this paper, we propose a method to improve the performance of Chinese-Mongolian SMT system using multi-word expressions, which is also a pilot study for this language pair. We extract MWEs from the phrase-table then integrate the MWEs into SMT system by various strategies. Experimental results indicate our method outperforms a baseline model by 0.81 BLEU points on Test-All and 1.54 BLEU points on Test-MWE.

AB Machine Translation, (hereafter in this document referred to as the "MT") faces a lot of complex problems from its origination. Extracting multiword expressions is also one of the complex problems in MT. Finding multiword expressions during translating a sentence from English into Urdu, through existing solutions, takes a lot of time and occupies system resources. We have designed a simple relational data approach, in which we simply set a bit in dictionary (database) for multiword, to find and handle multiword expression. This approach handles multiword efficiently.

AB Schema translation is the task of automatically translating headers of tabular data from one language to another. High-quality schema translation plays an important role in cross-lingual table searching, understanding and analysis. Despite its importance, schema translation is not well studied in the community, and state-of-the-art neural machine translation models cannot work well on this task because of two intrinsic differences between plain text and tabular data: morphological difference and context difference. To facilitate the research study, we construct the first parallel dataset for schema translation, which consists of 3,158 tables with 11,979 headers written in 6 different languages, including English, Chinese, French, German, Spanish, and Japanese. Also, we propose the first schema translation model called CAST, which is a header-to-header neural machine translation model augmented with schema context. Specifically, we model a target header and its context as a directed graph to represent their entity types and relations. Then CAST encodes the graph with a relational-aware transformer and uses another transformer to decode the header in the target language. Experiments on our dataset demonstrate that CAST significantly outperforms state-of-the-art neural machine translation models. Our dataset will be released at https://github.com/microsoft/ContextualSP.

AB In neural machine translation (NMT), monolingual data are usually exploited through a so-called back-translation: sentences in the target language are translated into the source language to synthesize new parallel data. While this method provides more training data to better model the target language, on the source side, it only exploits translations that the NMT system is already able to generate using a model trained on existing parallel data. In this work, we assume that new translation knowledge can be extracted from monolingual data, without relying at all on existing parallel data. We propose a new algorithm for extracting from monolingual data what we call partial translations: pairs of source and target sentences that contain sequences of tokens that are translations of each other. Our algorithm is fully unsupervised and takes only source and target monolingual data as input. Our empirical evaluation points out that our partial translations can be used in combination with back-translation to further improve NMT models. Furthermore, while partial translations are particularly useful for low-resource language pairs, they can also be successfully exploited in resource-rich scenarios to improve translation quality.

AB Automatic error detection is desired in the post-processing to improve machine translation quality. The previous work is largely based on confidence estimation using system-based features, such as word posterior probabilities calculated from Nbest lists or word lattices. We propose to incorporate two groups of linguistic features, which convey information from outside machine translation systems, into error detection: lexical and syntactic features. We use a maximum entropy classifier to predict translation errors by integrating word posterior probability feature and linguistic features. The experimental results show that 1) linguistic features alone outperform word posterior probability based confidence estimation in error detection; and 2) linguistic features can further provide complementary information when combined with word confidence scores, which collectively reduce the classification error rate by 18.52% and improve the F measure by 16.37%.

AB Quality estimation (QE) of machine translation (MT) systems is a task of growing importance. It reduces the cost of post-editing, allowing machine-translated text to be used in formal occasions. In this work, we describe our submission system in WMT 2019 sentence-level QE task. We mainly explore the utilization of pre-trained translation models in QE and adopt a bi-directional translation-like strategy. The strategy is similar to ELMo, but additionally conditions on source sentences. Experiments on WMT QE dataset show that our strategy, which makes the pre-training slightly harder, can bring improvements for QE. In WMT-2019 QE task, our system ranked in the second place on En-De NMT dataset and the third place on En-Ru NMT dataset.

   Translation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Paraphrase generation has been shown useful for various natural language processing tasks, including statistical machine translation. A commonly used method for paraphrase generation is pivoting [Callison-Burch et al. 2006], which benefits from linguistic knowledge implicit in the sentence alignment of parallel texts, but has limited applicability due to its reliance on parallel texts. Distributional paraphrasing [Marton et al. 2009a] has wider applicability, is more language-independent, but doesn't benefit from any linguistic knowledge. Nevertheless, we show that using distributional paraphrasing can yield greater gains in translation tasks. We report method improvements leading to higher gains than previously published, of almost 2 BLEU points, and provide implementation details, complexity analysis, and further insight into this method.

AB Sign language is the primary mode of communication for the hearing and speech impaired and there is a need for systems to translate sign languages to spoken languages. Prior research has been focused on providing glove based solutions which are intrusive and expensive. We propose a sign language translation system based solely on visual cues and deep learning for accurate translation. Our system applies Computer Vision and Neural Machine Translation for American Sign Language (ASL) gloss recognition and translation respectively. In this paper, we show that an end to end neural network system is not only capable of recognition of individual ASL glosses but also translation of continuous sign language videos into complete English sentences, making it an effective and practical tool for sign language communication.

AB Previous studies have investigated the characteristics of machine translation(MT)-mediated communication in lab settings and suggested various ways to improve it [1]. Unfortunately, we still lack an understanding of how MT is used in real-world settings, particularly when people use it to support face-to-face communication. In this paper, we report on a field study of a multilingual workshop where children from various language regions used MT to communicate with each other. We investigate how children use various information such as nonverbal cues and drawings to compensate for the mistranslations of MT. For example, children tried to understand the mistranslated messages by reading alternative translations and used web browsers to search for pictures of unknown objects. Such findings provide insights for designing future multilingual support systems.

AB How do we perform efficient inference while retaining high translation quality? Existing neural machine translation models, such as Transformer, achieve high performance, but they decode words one by one, which is inefficient. Recent non-autoregressive translation models speed up the inference, but their quality is still inferior. In this work, we propose DSLP, a highly efficient and high-performance model for machine translation. The key insight is to train a non-autoregressive Transformer with Deep Supervision and feed additional Layer-wise Predictions. We conducted extensive experiments on four translation tasks (both directions of WMT'14 EN-DE and WMT'16 EN-RO). Results show that our approach consistently improves the BLEU scores compared with respective base models. Specifically, our best variant outperforms the autoregressive model on three translation tasks, while being 14.8 times more efficient in inference.

AB Existing approaches to neural machine translation are typically autoregressive models. While these models attain state-of-the-art translation quality, they are suffering from low parallelizability and thus slow at decoding long sequences. In this paper, we propose a novel model for fast sequence generation the semi-autoregressive Transformer (SAT). The SAT keeps the autoregressive property in global but relieves in local and thus are able to produce multiple successive words in parallel at each time step. Experiments conducted on English-German and ChineseEnglish translation tasks show that the SAT achieves a good balance between translation quality and decoding speed. On WMT'14 English-German translation, the SAT achieves 5.58x speedup while maintaining 88% translation quality, significantly better than the previous non-autoregressive methods. When produces two words at each time step, the SAT is almost lossless (only 1% degeneration in BLEU score).

AB Word based translation models in particular and phrase based translation models in general assume that a word in any context is equivalent to the same word in any other context. Yet, this is not always true. The words in a sentence are not generated independently. The usage of each word is strongly affected by its immediate neighboring words. The state-of-the-art machine translation (MT) methods use words and phrases as basic modeling units. This paper introduces Context Dependent Words (CDWs)(1) as the new basic translation units. The context classes are defined using Part-of-Speech (POS) tags. Experimental results using CDW based language models demonstrate encouraging improvements in the translation quality for the translation of dialectal Arabic to English. Analysis of the results reveals that improvements are mainly in fluency.

AB Simultaneous Machine Translation is the task of incrementally translating an input sentence before it is fully available. Currently, simultaneous translation is carried out by translating each sentence independently of the previously translated text. More generally, Streaming MT can be understood as an extension of Simultaneous MT to the incremental translation of a continuous input text stream. In this work, a state-of-the-art simultaneous sentencelevel MT system is extended to the streaming setup by leveraging the streaming history. Extensive empirical results are reported on IWSLT Translation Tasks, showing that leveraging the streaming history leads to significant quality gains. In particular, the proposed system proves to compare favorably to the best performing systems.

We present a method to rapidly integrate POS information without adding complexity to the decoder. We show how we can re-estimate the lexicalized reordering probability estimates with POS tags during the training time without having to use POS tagger at the decoding phase. We present our empirical results for two different MT decoding algorithms that use lexicalized reordering models.

AB In this paper we focus on the important role of human language technology as one of the key technologies for the universal access to worldwide digital libraries. In particular, linguistic barriers caused by the multilingual nature of the global information pool require solutions from cross-language information retrieval and machine translation. In our research we developed a machine translation environment for the automatic translation of Japanese documents into German. An important point regarding the implementation of the translation environment is that it is completely embedded in the, widely used text processing program Word to ensure its easy use by any potential end user.

AB Building the first Russian-Vietnamese neural machine translation system, we faced the problem of choosing a translation unit system on which source and target embeddings are based. Available homogeneous translation unit systems with the same translation unit on the source and target sides do not perfectly suit the investigated language pair. To solve the problem, in this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous translation unit system, considering linguistic characteristics of the synthetic Russian language and the analytic Vietnamese language. Specifically, we decrease the embedding level on the source side by splitting token into subtokens and increase the embedding level on the target side by merging neighboring tokens into supertoken. The experiment results show that the proposed heterogeneous system improves over the existing best homogeneous Russian-Vietnamese translation system by 1.17 BLEU. Our approach could be applied to building translation bots for language pairs with different linguistic characteristics.

AB This paper describes the University of Maryland's submission to the Duolingo Shared Task on Simultaneous Translation And Paraphrase for Language Education (STAPLE). Unlike the standard machine translation task, STAPLE requires generating a set of outputs for a given input sequence, aiming to cover the space of translations produced by language learners. We adapt neural machine translation models to this requirement by (a) generating n-best translation hypotheses from a model fine-tuned on learner translations, oversampled to reflect the distribution of learner responses, and (b) filtering hypotheses using a feature-rich binary classifier that directly optimizes a close approximation of the official evaluation metric. Combination of systems that use these two strategies achieves F1 scores of 53.9% and 52.5% on Vietnamese and Portuguese, respectively ranking 2nd and 4th on the leaderboard.

AB In order to do a global evaluation of translation software and compare their differences within specific indicators, the study applied Euclidean distance and cosine similarity to evaluate 4 commonly used translation software tools, based on the analysis of the data from the questionnaire. The results suggest that software A and B are good in general, especially at the vocabulary translation. However, there are still some shortcomings in the discourse translation. Therefore, they should accumulate more materials in the Chinese corpus. It is concluded that Euclidean distance covers the shortage of randomness and the limitations to the micro level of the present evaluation methods such as BLEU. Meanwhile, Euclidean distance has higher accuracy and more convenient calculation than the cosine similarity. It can be used to evaluate translation software effectively.

AB Lexical normalization is an important task to be performed on noisy data, such as social media posts, before using the data for further analysis. We examine the potential of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) for normalization of Indonesian text using the translation unit on both phrase and character levels. We also used an external corpus to generate additional language model data and pre-normalization rules to enhance the SMT system. The result shows the SMT systems on both phrase and character levels are outperforming various baseline in Word Error Rate (WER) score and Bilingual Understudy Evaluation (BLEU) score. This research also demonstrates the effect of using an external language model and applying pre-normalization rules can further enhance the effectiveness of SMT systems in normalizing Indonesian text.

However, while they succeed in their goal, these modernizations are far from perfect. Thus, in order to help scholars generate error-free modernizations when the quality is essential, we propose an interactive language modernization framework based on interactive machine translation. In this work, we deployed two successful interactive protocols into language modernization. We evaluated our proposal on a simulated environment observing significant reductions of the human effort.

TI Corpus Augmentation for Neural Machine Translation with Chinese-Japanese
   Parallel Corpora
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The translation quality of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems depends strongly on the training data size. Sufficient amounts of parallel data are, however, not available for many language pairs. This paper presents a corpus augmentation method, which has two variations: one is for all language pairs, and the other is for the Chinese-Japanese language pair. The method uses both source and target sentences of the existing parallel corpus and generates multiple pseudo-parallel sentence pairs from a long parallel sentence pair containing punctuation marks as follows: (1) split the sentence pair into parallel partial sentences; (2) back-translate the target partial sentences; and (3) replace each partial sentence in the source sentence with the back-translated target partial sentence to generate pseudo-source sentences. The word alignment information, which is used to determine the split points, is modified with shared Chinese character rates in segments of the sentence pairs. The experiment results of the Japanese-Chinese and Chinese-Japanese translation with ASPEC-JC (Asian Scientific Paper Excerpt Corpus, Japanese-Chinese) show that the method substantially improves translation performance. We also supply the code (see Supplementary Materials) that can reproduce our proposed method.

AB In recent years, brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has emerged very rapidly. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) bring us a new communication interface technology which can translate brain activities into control signals of devices like computers, robots. The preprocessing of electroencephalographic (EEG) signal and translation algorithms play an important role in EEG-based BCIs. In this study, we employed an independent component analysis (ICA)-based preprocessing method and a committee machine-based translation algorithm for the offline analysis of a cursor control experiment. The results show that ICA is an efficient preprocessing method and the committee machine is a good choice for translation algorithm.

AB Corpus-based approaches to machine translation rely on the availability of clean parallel corpora. Such resources are scarce, and because of the automatic processes involved in their preparation, they are often noisy. This paper describes an unsupervised method for detecting translation divergences in parallel sentences. We rely on a neural network that computes cross-lingual sentence similarity scores, which are then used to effectively filter out divergent translations. Furthermore, similarity scores predicted by the network are used to identify and fix some partial divergences, yielding additional parallel segments. We evaluate these methods for English-French and English-German machine translation tasks, and show that using filtered/corrected corpora actually improves MT performance.

AB Whether it is learning a language or traveling abroad, translation is a skill that must be mastered. Traditional human translation is too slow and expensive. Therefore, in the integration and development of artificial intelligence and translation industry, intelligent translation has become the main direction of scientific research and exploration. On the basis of understanding the current development status of intelligent translation, this paper designs the content of intelligent recognition English translation model based on improved machine translation algorithm and analyzes its application value from the perspective of practical application. In this paper, an intelligent recognition model for English translation is proposed to solve the problem of the low accuracy of the traditional algorithm model. Based on the improved algorithm framework, an intelligent recognition model of automatic search, data acquisition, processing, and output planning is designed to collect and process English signals in a planned way and extract characteristic parameters to realize intelligent recognition of English translation. Experimental analysis shows that the designed English translation recognition model has high accuracy and can meet the needs of English translation work.

This paper presents a kind of construction strategy for knowledge source which contains affluent grammatical and syntactical information. Firstly, taking Lexical Function Grammar as the theoretical basis, treebank including parse trees converted from every sentence in the source language corpus is acquired. Secondly, based on the decomposition algorithm, the corresponding fragment-bank composed of all the legal fragments extracted from the treebank is constructed. Finally, based on the combination algorithm, the fragment-combination-bank including all the possible fragment-combination forms of every parse tree in the treebank is built. Based on the successful construction of the knowledge source, the whole machine translation process can be implemented efficiently and accurately.

Entropy, in this case, offers an alternative to determining the ratio of auxiliary pages that is important for this method. With the approach introduced in this paper, the need of a sitemap becomes void. On the other hand, the paper looks at entropy in the case of reliability analysis of Machine Translation metrics. In this case, entropy offers also an alternative mean to validate the metrics.

Our method correctly determines the matching words between two sentences using corresponding noun phrases. Moreover, our method determines the similarity between two sentences in terms of the noun-phrase order of appearance. Evaluation experiments were conducted to calculate the correlation among human judgments, along with the scores produced using automatic evaluation methods for MT outputs obtained from the 12 machine translation systems in NTCIR7. Experimental results show that our method obtained the highest correlations among the methods in both sentence-level adequacy and fluency.

AB Translation between Finnish and Swedish is a common yet time-consuming and expensive task. In this paper, we train new neural machine translation models and compare them with publicly available tools for automatic translation of Finnish to Swedish. Furthermore, we analyze if fusing BERT models with traditional Transformer models produces better translations. We train a base Transformer and a large Transformer model using Fairseq and compare the results with BERT-fused versions of the models. Our large transformer model matches the state-of-the-art performance in Finnish-Swedish translation and slightly improves the BLEU score from 29.4 to 29.8. In our experiments, fusing the smaller Transformer model with a pre-trained BERT improves the quality of the translations. Surprisingly, the larger Transformer model in contrast does not benefit from being fused with a BERT model.

TI An Enhanced RBMT: When RBMT Outperforms Modern Data-Driven Translators
SO IETE TECHNICAL REVIEW
AB Although prominent translators, such as Google, Yahoo Babel Fish, Bing, etc., perform better when translating most widely used languages, they tend to commit fundamental mistakes in working with low-resource languages such as Bengali, Romanian, Arabic, etc. Such translators (e.g. Google Translate) use different data-driven translation approaches, such as neural machine translation (NMT), statistical machine translation (SMT), etc., to develop their polyglot translation system. However, performances of these data-driven approaches entirely rely on the attainability of significantly large parallel corpora of the translating language pairs. As a consequence, numerous popular languages, such as Bengali, remain barely explored not only in machine translation but also in other fields of natural language processing. Therefore, the target of this study is to explore effective translation from Bengali to English by accomplishing several Bengali language processing tasks. To be precise, we adopt a basic rule-based machine translator for translating from Bengali to English. Next, we enhance its performance by considering the veracious interpretation of the Bengali names as subjects (and nouns) in a sentence. Besides, we propose a Bengali verb identification and optimization technique by root-word detection (stemming) of the Bengali verbs. Finally, we unfold the efficacy of our proposed techniques through a comparative analysis with popular data-driven translators using a novel customized dataset focusing on Bengali-to-English translation.

AB Contextual information is very important to select the appropriate phrases in statistical machine translation (SMT). The selection of different target phrases is sensitive to different parts of source contexts. Previous approaches based on either local contexts or global contexts neglect impacts of different contexts and are not always effective to disambiguate translation candidates. As a matter of fact, the indicative contexts are expected to play more important roles for disambiguation. In this paper, we propose to leverage the indicative contexts for translation disambiguation. Our model assigns phrase pairs confidence scores based on different source contexts which are then intergraded into the SMT log-linear model to help select translation candidates. Experimental results show that our proposed method significantly improves translation performance on the NIST Chinese-to-English translation tasks compared with the state-of-the-art SMT baseline.

AB English is the official language of only seven countries comprising little more than five percent of the world's population. Yet the majority of online content is in English. While many business people speak English as a second language, most prefer to communicate in their native tongue. Using machine translation one could easily translate the content in one language to the other largely in real time. This paper describes the role of an Intermediate language in machine translation of natural languages, how modular the work can be accomplished in translating a one language to other.

AB Translation of noun compounds has been a challenging task in machine translation for many years. Noun compounds are used very productively and constitute a large amount of the text vocabulary. We present a work on translation of noun compounds from English to German, focusing on identifying the nominal structures in English which represent compounds. This work is part of developing a speech-to-speech translation system, and the input to the machine translation component comes from automatic speech recognition. This brings in a further difficulty to the translation of noun compounds because the input might introduce recognition errors and it does not have typical features of a written text such as punctuation and capitalization. We present a method of noun compound identification based on syntactic analysis and lexical information and discuss the challenges that we encountered during the compound identification process.

AB Most machine translation systems construct translations from a closed vocabulary of target word forms, posing problems for translating into languages that have productive compounding processes. We present a simple and effective approach that deals with this problem in two phases. First, we build a classifier that identifies spans of the input text that can be translated into a single compound word in the target language. Then, for each identified span, we generate a pool of possible compounds which are added to the translation model as "synthetic" phrase translations. Experiments reveal that (i) we can effectively predict what spans can be compounded; (ii) our compound generation model produces good compounds; and (iii) modest improvements are possible in end-to-end English German and English Finnish translation tasks. We additionally introduce KomposEval, a new multi-reference dataset of English phrases and their translations into German compounds.

SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB Synchronous context-free grammars (SCFGs) can be learned from parallel texts that are annotated with target-side syntax, and can produce translations by building target-side syntactic trees from source strings. Ideally, producing syntactic trees would entail that the translation is grammatically well-formed, but in reality, this is often not the case. Focusing on translation into German, we discuss various ways in which string-to-tree translation models over- or undergeneralise. We show how these problems can be addressed by choosing a suitable parser and modifying its output, by introducing linguistic constraints that enforce morphological agreement and constrain subcategorisation, and by modelling the productive generation of German compounds.

AB With the rapid development of Internet technology and the development of economic globalization, international exchanges in various fields have become increasingly active, and the need for communication between languages has become increasingly clear. As an effective tool, automatic translation can perform equivalent translation between different languages while preserving the original semantics. This is very important in practice. This paper focuses on the Chinese-English machine translation model based on deep neural networks. In this paper, we use the end-to-end encoder and decoder framework to create a neural machine translation model, the machine automatically learns its function, and the data is converted into word vectors in a distributed method and can be directly through the neural network perform the mapping between the source language and the target language. Research experiments show that, by adding part of the voice information to verify the effectiveness of the model performance improvement, the performance of the translation model can be improved. With the superimposition of the number of network layers from two to four, the improvement ratios of each model are 5.90%, 6.1%, 6.0%, and 7.0%, respectively. Among them, the model with an independent recurrent neural network as the network structure has the largest improvement rate and a higher improvement rate, so the system has high availability.

AB In CLEF 2004, the SINAI group participated in the multilingual task. Our main interest was to test Machine Translation (MT) with a mixed 2-step RSV merging algorithm. Since 2-step RSV requires grouping the document frequency for each term with the translations for that term, and MT translates whole phrases better than working word for word, it is not directly feasible to use MT with a 2-step RSV merging algorithm. To solve this problem, we have tested an algorithm which aligns the original query and its translation(s) at term level.

TI A Fuzzy Training Framework for Controllable Sequence-to-Sequence
   Generation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The generation of music lyrics by artificial intelligence (AI) is frequently modeled as a language-targeted sequence-to-sequence generation task. Formally, if we convert the melody into a word sequence, we can consider the lyrics generation task to be a machine translation task. Traditional machine translation tasks involve translating between cross-lingual word sequences, whereas music lyrics generation tasks involve translating between music and natural language word sequences. The theme or key words of the generated lyrics are usually limited to meet the needs of the users when they are generated. This requirement can be thought of as a restricted translation problem. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy training framework that allows a model to simultaneously support both unrestricted and restricted translation by adopting an additional auxiliary training process without constraining the decoding process. This maintains the benefits of restricted translation but greatly reduces the extra time overhead of constrained decoding, thus improving its practicality. The experimental results show that our framework is well suited to the Chinese lyrics generation and restricted machine translation tasks, and that it can also generate language sequence under the condition of given restricted words without training multiple models, thereby achieving the goal of green AI.

TI Facile Solutions to the Problems Associated with Chemical Information
   and Mathematical Symbolism While Using Machine Translation Tools
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING
AB Advances in computer-aided translation technology have made tremendous progress in accuracy in the past few years. Chemical Abstracts Service of the American Chemical Society summarizes scientific works from more than 50 languages and allows the users to search papers in nine selected languages. Currently, only the abstracts are rendered into English by human experts or by machine translation because full text translation of millions of articles is beyond the human capacity today. An English translation of a research paper, scientific book, or patent is often required for research, data mining, and for historical purposes from various foreign languages. Many fundamental papers in chemistry, quantum chemistry, physics, and mathematics contain a significant number of chemical or mathematical equations. One of the major known problems in machine translation of such symbolically dense texts is incorrect or meaningless output. This article describes how to optimize the existing machine translation tools to read foreign language papers embedded with chemical/mathematical equations. German and French languages have been selected for illustrative purposes for English translation. Direct upload of text with extensive symbolism is possible with certain services, but this also occasionally produces erroneous rendition into English. A facile solution to the associated problems with embedded equations and mathematical formulas is replacing the equations and notations with "dummy" variables. The placeholder or dummy symbols can be removed after translation, and the original equations are substituted again. This approach, which can be automated in future, relies on the idea that chemical formulas and mathematical notations are universal. Following the guidelines in the article, excellent translations can be produced from a text having interspersed equations and chemical symbols.

AB Often, the training procedure for statistical machine translation models is based on maximum likelihood or related criteria. A general problem of this approach is that there is only a loose relation to the final translation quality on unseen text. In this paper, we analyze various training criteria which directly optimize translation quality. These training criteria make use of recently proposed automatic evaluation metrics. We describe a new algorithm for efficient training an unsmoothed error count. We show that significantly better results can often be obtained if the final evaluation criterion is taken directly into account as part of the training procedure.

TI Conversational Model Using Neural Machine Translation
SO BIOSCIENCE BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
AB The idea of creating a conversational model has been around for decades but due to restraints in computational power and lack of well-documented data, most of these ideas remained as such until the recent growth in the field of Artificial Intelligence (Al) and information processing systems like Neural Networks. In regards to conversational models, the Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) models have shown wild success. These models have shown notable success in Neural Machine Translation (NMT), the most popular implementation of it would be Google's Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) that is used to translate between languages. This brought about the thought of using a Seq2Seq NMT model that, rather than translating between languages, would converse with the user in the same language. With the growth of the interne, it is now an easy task to gather well-documented data in order to train the neural network, in this case, we have used datasets that cover a wide range of topics. This paper proposes the use of a Seq2Seq NMT Model in order to create a conversational model that delivers responses to the user in the same language and implement it on the Facebook Messenger.

TI Document-Level Neural Machine Translation with Hierarchical Modeling of
   Global Context
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Document-level machine translation (MT) remains challenging due to its difficulty in efficiently using document-level global context for translation. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical model to learn the global context for document-level neural machine translation (NMT). This is done through a sentence encoder to capture intra-sentence dependencies and a document encoder to model document-level inter-sentence consistency and coherence. With this hierarchical architecture, we feedback the extracted document-level global context to each word in a top-down fashion to distinguish different translations of a word according to its specific surrounding context. Notably, we explore the effect of three popular attention functions during the information backward-distribution phase to take a deep look into the global context information distribution of our model. In addition, since large-scale in-domain document-level parallel corpora are usually unavailable, we use a two-step training strategy to take advantage of a large-scale corpus with out-of-domain parallel sentence pairs and a small-scale corpus with in-domain parallel document pairs to achieve the domain adaptability. Experimental results of our model on Chinese-English and English-German corpora significantly improve the Transformer baseline by 4.5 BLEU points on average which demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed hierarchical model in document-level NMT.

AB Resource-limited and morphologically rich languages pose many challenges to natural language processing tasks. Their highly inflected surface forms inflate the vocabulary size and increase sparsity in an already scarce data situation. In this article, we present an unsupervised learning approach to vocabulary reduction through morphological segmentation. We demonstrate its value in the context of machine translation for dialectal Arabic (DA), the primarily spoken, orthographically unstandardized, morphologically rich and yet resource poor variants of Standard Arabic. Our approach exploits the existence of monolingual and parallel data. We show comparable performance to state-of-the-art supervised methods for DA segmentation.

TI Exploiting reverse target-side contexts for neural machine translation
   via asynchronous bidirectional decoding
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Based on a unified encoder-decoder framework with attentional mechanism, neural machine translation (NMT) models have attracted much attention and become the mainstream in the community of machine translation. Generally, the NMT decoders produce translation in a left-to-right way. As a result, only left-to-right target-side contexts from the generated translations are exploited, while the right-to-left target-side contexts are completely unexploited for translation. In this paper, we extend the conventional attentional encoder-decoder NMT framework by introducing a backward decoder, in order to explore asynchronous bidirectional decoding for NMT. In the first step after encoding, our backward decoder learns to generate the target-side hidden states in a right-to-left manner. Next, in each timestep of translation prediction, our forward decoder concurrently considers both the source-side and the reverse target-side hidden states via two attention models. Compared with previous models, the innovation in this architecture enables our model to fully exploit contexts from both source side and target side, which improve translation quality altogether. We conducted experiments on NIST Chinese-English, WMT English-German and Finnish-English translation tasks to investigate the effectiveness of our model. Experimental results show that (1) our improved RNN-based NMT model achieves significant improvements over the conventional RNNSearch by 1.44/-3.02, 1.11/-1.01, and 1.23/-1.27 average BLEU and TER points, respectively; and (2) our enhanced Transformer outperforms the standard Transformer by 1.56/-1.49, 1.76/-2.49, and 1.29/-1.33 average BLEU and TER points, respectively.

SO JOURNAL OF SPECIALISED TRANSLATION
AB This article reports on a key-logging study carried out to test the benefits of post-editing Machine Translation (MT) for the professional translator within a hypothetico-deductive framework, contrasting the outcomes of a number of variables which are inextricably linked to the professional translation process. Given the current trend of allowing the professional translator to connect to Google Translate services within the main Translation Memory (TM) systems via an API, a between-groups design is utilised in which cognitive, technical and temporal effort are gauged between translation and post-editing the statistical MT engine Google Translate. The language pair investigated is English and Welsh. Results show no statistical difference between post-editing and translation in terms of processing time. Using a novel measure of cognitive effort focused on pauses, the cognitive effort exerted by post-editors and translators was, however, found to be statistically different. Results also show that a complex relationship exists between post-editing, translation and technical effort, in that aspects of text production processes were seen to be eased by post-editing. Finally, a bilingual review by two different translators found little difference in quality between the translated and post-edited texts, and that both sets of texts were acceptable according to accuracy and fidelity.

   translation for multilingual sentiment analysis
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB Sentiment analysis is the natural language processing task dealing with sentiment detection and classification from texts. In recent years, due to the growth in the quantity and fast spreading of user-generated contents online and the impact such information has on events, people and companies worldwide, this task has been approached in an important body of research in the field. Despite different methods having been proposed for distinct types of text, the research community has concentrated less on developing methods for languages other than English. In the above-mentioned context, the present work studies the possibility to employ machine translation systems and supervised methods to build models able to detect and classify sentiment in languages for which less/no resources are available for this task when compared to English, stressing upon the impact of translation quality on the sentiment classification performance. Our extensive evaluation scenarios show that machine translation systems are approaching a good level of maturity and that they can, in combination to appropriate machine learning algorithms and carefully chosen features, be used to build sentiment analysis systems that can obtain comparable performances to the one obtained for English.

We specifically participated in the document-level MT track. The system used as a primary submission is a context-aware Transformer capable of both rich modeling of limited contextual information and integration of large-scale document-level context with a less rich representation. We train this model by fine-tuning a big Transformer baseline. Our experimental results show that document-level context provides for large improvements in translation quality, and adding a rich representation of the previous sentence provides a small additional gain.

AB One significant resource for language translation using Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) is parallel corpora. SMT model works well with timing aligned parallel corpora. However, imperfectly aligned sentences in the bilingual corpus typically leads to poorer translation in the final translation after training the SMT model. A major challenge in effectively applying non timing aligned parallel corpora in the SMT model has not been thoroughly researched. The goal of this paper is to improve the accuracy of an English to Thai Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) model by improving the sentence alignment of parallel corpora. This work proposes an improved English-Thai translation framework for non-timing aligned Parallel corpora using an improved alignment algorithm: Bleualign with explicit user feedback. The generated model can then be applied to the Moses SMT training system to generate English-Thai translation. This experiment uses both English and Thai subtitles obtained from TED (www.ted.com) to build the parallel corpora. The TED corpora sentences are not timing aligned, and this research will try to generate an alignment model to be applied on the Moses SMT training system. The result shows that the model using our proposed algorithm outperforms two traditional alignment models: Gale-Church, Bleualign with the highest BLEU score of 0.36.

AB There are lots of negative sentences in both Japanese and Chinese, which are varing from meanings and phrasings. Especially the negative sentences always express complex relationships in Chinese language. So it is easy to make ambiguity when translating Japanese into Chinese. At present, it's very common that the translation softwares sold on the market make errors due to wrong translation of the negative sentences. This paper investigates the difference of existential negative sentences in Chinese and Japanese, then formulates translation rules and comes up with several translation ways for existential negative sentences based on characteristics of Japanese sentences, the corresponding attributes of the terms, the phrasings of Chinese sentences and so on. When testing on 150 negative sentences, the experiment confirms the effectiveness of the method introduced in the paper.

TI Machine translation from text to sign language: a systematic review
SO UNIVERSAL ACCESS IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY
AB An equal opportunity for all is the basic right of every human being. The deaf society of the world needs to have access to all the information just like hearing people do. For this to happen there should be a mode of direct communication between hearing and deaf people. The need at this time is to automate this communication so as the deaf society is not dependent upon human interpreters. This paper deals with the systematic survey of conventional and state-of-the-art sign language machine translation and sign language generation projects. We used a standard procedure of carrying out a systematic literature review on 148 studies published in 30 reputed journals and 40 premium conferences and workshops. Existing literature about sign language machine translation is broadly classified into three different categories. These categories are further sub-classified into different classifications depending upon the type of machine translation. Studies pertaining to the specified classifications have been presented with their advantages and limitations. Different methods for sign language generation are reported with their benefits and limitations. Manual and automatic evaluation methods used in every study is presented along with their respective performance metrics. We call for increased efforts in presentation of signs to make them an easy and comfortable mode of communication for deaf society. There is also a requirement to improve translation methods and include the contribution of advanced technologies such as deep learning and neural networks to make an optimal translation process between text and sign language.

AB To improve machine translation system's translation quality and accurate rate, a Case-Based Reasoning translation strategy was presented. Laying emphasis on the case reasoning part, a structure and semantic similarity algorithm was designed to calculate the sentence similarity. First, a dynamic filter is used to select the translation pattern roughly. Then, based on dynamic programming(DP) algorithm, the structure similarity was decided by the calculation of edit distance. In the process of path recall, an optimization function was defined to select the best matching path. Last, to match the pattern more exactly, the semantic similarity is calculated by the semantic tree structure. The experiment shows that the score of translation quality is 70.11 and the accurate rate can reach 89.4%.

AB Thesauri and ontologies provide important value in facilitating access to digital archives by representing underlying principles of organization. Translation of such resources into multiple languages is an important component for providing multilingual access. However, the specificity of vocabulary terms in most ontologies precludes fully-automated machine translation using general-domain lexical resources. In this paper, we present an efficient process for leveraging human translations when constructing domain-specific lexical resources. We evaluate the effectiveness of this process by producing a probabilistic phrase dictionary and translating a thesaurus of 56,000 concepts used to catalogue a large archive of oral histories. Our experiments demonstrate a cost-effective technique for accurate machine translation of large ontologies.

TI Topic-Based Coherence Modeling for Statistical Machine Translation
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Coherence that ties sentences of a text into a meaningfully connected structure is of great importance to text generation and translation. In this paper, we propose topic-based coherence models to produce coherence for document translation, in terms of the continuity of sentence topics in a text. We automatically extract a coherence chain for each source text to be translated. Based on the extracted source coherence chain, we adopt a maximum entropy classifier to predict the target coherence chain that defines a linear topic structure for the target document. We build two topic-based coherence models on the predicted target coherence chain: 1) a word level coherence model that helps the decoder select coherent word translations and 2) a phrase level coherence model that guides the decoder to select coherent phrase translations. We integrate the two models into a state-of-the-art phrase-based machine translation system. Experiments on large-scale training data show that our coherence models achieve substantial improvements over both the baseline and models that are built on either document topics or sentence topics obtained under the assumption of direct topic correspondence between the source and target side. Additionally, further evaluations on translation outputs suggest that target translations generated by our coherence models are more coherent and similar to reference translations than those generated by the baseline.

TI Translation Skill-Sets in a Machine-Translation Age
SO META
AB The integration of data from statistical machine translation into translation memory suites (giving a range of TM/MT technologies) can be expected to replace fully human translation in many spheres of activity. This should bring about changes in the skill sets required of translators. With increased processing done by area experts who are not trained translators, the translator's function can be expected to shift to linguistic postediting, without requirements for extensive area knowledge and possibly with a reduced emphasis on foreign-language expertise. This reconfiguration of the translation space must also recognize the active input roles of TM/MT databases, such that there is no longer A binary organization around a "source" and a "target": we now have a "start text" (ST) complemented by source materials that take the shape of authorized translation memories, glossaries, terminology bases, and machine-translation feeds. In order to identify the skills required for translation work in such a space, a minimalist and "negative" approach may be adopted: first locate the most important decision-making problems resulting from the use of TM/MT, and then identify the corresponding skills to be learned. A total often such skills can be identified, arranged under three heads: learning to learn, learning to trust and mistrust data, and learning to revise with enhanced attention to detail. The acquisition of these skills can be favored by a pedagogy with specific desiderata for the design of suitable classroom spaces, the transversal use of TM/MT, students' self-analyses of translation processes, and collaborative projects with area experts.

However, it is difficult to train and turn parameters. In this paper, we focus on decoding techniques that boost translation performance by utilizing existing models. We address the problem from three aspects-parameter, word and sentence level, corresponding to checkpoint averaging, model ensembling and candidates reranking which all do not need to retrain the model. Experimental results have shown that the proposed decoding approaches can significantly improve the performance over baseline model.

AB Prior researches suggest that neural machine translation (NMT) captures word alignment through its attention mechanism, however, this paper finds attention may almost fail to capture word alignment for some NMT models. This paper thereby proposes two methods to induce word alignment which are general and agnostic to specific NMT models. Experiments show that both methods induce much better word alignment than attention. This paper further visualizes the translation through the word alignment induced by NMT. In particular, it analyzes the effect of alignment errors on translation errors at word level and its quantitative analysis over many testing examples consistently demonstrate that alignment errors are likely to lead to translation errors measured by different metrics.

AB A scheme for machine translation of texts between sign language and phonic language is proposed in the paper. The approach is based on the creation of substitution grammar of the sign language through the realization of semantic markers in the database of the Polish language and the application of graph structures implemented in the Prolog language. A modular architecture of the translation system implemented using this approach is described in the paper. Communication and interoperation between the system's modules is explained. Details of the principles of operation of the translation system are discussed. As a proof of concept an example of the translation process is presented.

AB The five axes capabilities used on Computer Numerical Controlled (CNC) machine tools are becoming increasingly common in the manufacturing industry. However, the problem of modeling of combined linear and rotary axes through the kinematic chain, and their effect on the translation and rotation errors of the cutting tool to the machine has not been addressed. A study of developing the error modeling on an industrial five-axis CNC machine tool will enable the understanding of the accuracy performance of machine and therefore to minimize the error by mechanical adjustment or error compensation methods. A mathematical modeling to determine the volumetric error can be developed from the kinematic error models accounting for the unique structural configuration of a CNC machine tool. Since there were discussions on the modeling of three-axis CNC machine tool done by previous research publications [1-3] hence, the rotary table modeling of five-axis CNC machine tool and the combination of both will be the main subject in this paper. The effects of the positioning errors of machine's axes on the accuracy (translation and rotation) of the cutting tool in its workspace will also be discussed. The development of the mathematical model shows that the angular deviations are independent of translation errors. However, the tool point deviations are dependent on both translational and rotational errors. Moreover, the rotational and translation errors are divided separately into the 3x3 and 3x1 transform matrix respectively. The construction of this mathematical model will be then verified by various experiments, showing the validity and effectiveness of the presented methods. This is important to indicate that it can be used for multi-axis machine tools as a means of calibration and precision purpose.

AB In this paper we describe current search technologies available on the web, explain underlying difficulties and show their limits, related to either current technologies or to the intrinsic properties of all natural languages. We then analyze the effectiveness of freely available machine translation services and demonstrate that under certain conditions these translation systems can operate at the same performance levels as manual translators. Searching for factual information with commercial search engines also allows the retrieval of facts, user comments and opinions on target items. In the third part we explain how the principle machine learning strategies are able to classify short passages of text extracted from the blogosphere as factual or opinionated and then classify their polarity (positive, negative or mixed).

AB Multiples translations can be computed by one machine translation (MT) system or by different MT systems. We may assume that different MT systems make different errors due to using different models, generation strategies, or tweaks. An investigated technique, inherited from automatic speech recognition (ASR), is the so-called system combination that is based on combining the outputs of multiples MT systems. We combine the outputs of a phrase-and Ngram-based Statistical MT (SMT) systems using statistical criteria and additional rescoring features.

It is shown that the Cartesian arrangement of the 3 limbs assures simple kinematic relations and an isotropic workspace, without any rotation or translation singularity. Such good features should allow the design of parallel robots that are characterized by simple controllers and good performances, as an alternative to current mechanical schemes.

Feature values were combined in a log-linear model to select the highest scoring candidate translation from an n-best list. Feature weights were optimized directly against the BLEU evaluation metric on held-out data. We present results for a small selection of features at each level of syntactic representation.

TI A Novel Natural Language Processing (NLP)-Based Machine Translation
   Model for English to Pakistan Sign Language Translation
SO COGNITIVE COMPUTATION
AB Background/Introduction The deaf community in the world uses a gesture-based language, generally known as sign language. Every country has a different sign language; for instance, USA has American Sign Language (ASL) and UK has British Sign Language (BSL). The deaf community in Pakistan uses Pakistan Sign Language (PSL), which like other natural languages, has a vocabulary, sentence structure, and word order. Majority of the hearing community is not aware of PSL due to which there exists a huge communication gap between the two groups. Similarly, deaf persons are unable to read text written in English and Urdu. Hence, the provision of an effective translation model can support the cognitive capability of the deaf community to interpret natural language materials available on the Internet and in other useful resources. Methods This research involves exploiting natural language processing (NLP) techniques to support the deaf community by proposing a novel machine translation model that translates English sentences into equivalent Pakistan Sign Language (PSL). Though a large number of machine translation systems have been successfully implemented for natural to natural language translations, natural to sign language machine translation is a relatively new area of research. State-of-the-art works in natural to sign language translation are mostly domain specific and suffer from low accuracy scores. Major reasons are specialised language structures for sign languages, and lack of annotated corpora to facilitate development of more generalisable machine translation systems. To this end, a grammar-based machine translation model is proposed to translate sentences written in English language into equivalent PSL sentences. To the best of our knowledge, this is a first effort to translate any natural language to PSL using core NLP techniques. The proposed approach involves a structured process to investigate the linguistic structure of PSL and formulate the grammatical structure of PSL sentences. These rules are then formalised into a context-free grammar, which, in turn, can be efficiently implemented as a parsing module for translation and validation of target PSL sentences. The whole concept is implemented as a software system, comprising the NLP pipeline and an external service to render the avatar-based video of translated words, in order to compensate the cognitive hearing deficit of deaf people. Results and Conclusion The accuracy of the proposed translation model has been evaluated manually and automatically. Quantitative results reveal a very promising Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score of 0.78. Subjective evaluations demonstrate that the system can compensate for the cognitive hearing deficit of end users through the system output expressed as a readily interpretable avatar. Comparative analysis shows that our proposed system works well for simple sentences but struggles to translate compound and compound complex sentences correctly, which warrants future ongoing research.

AB Machine Translation (MT) refers to the automated software-based translation of natural language text. The embedded complexities and incompatibilities of natural languages have made MT a daunting task facing numerous challenges, especially when it is to be compared to a manual translation. With the emergence of deep-learning AI approaches, the Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has pushed MT results closer to human expectations. One of the newest deep learning approaches is the sequence-to-sequence approach based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), complex convolutions, and transformers, and employing encoders/decoder pairs. In this study, an attention-based deep learning architecture is proposed for MT, with all layers focused exclusively on multi-head attention and based on a transformer that includes multi-layer encoders/decoders. The main contributions of the proposed model lie in the weighted combination of layers' primary input and output of the previous layers, feeding into the next layer. This mechanism results in a more accurate transformation compared to non-hybrid inputs. The model is evaluated using two datasets for German/English translation, the WMT'14 dataset for training, and the newstest' 2012 dataset for testing. The experiments are run on GPU-equipped Google Colab instances and the results show an accuracy of 36.7 BLEU, a 5% improvement over the previous work without the hybrid-input technique.

AB One of the aims of Assistive Technologies is to help people with disabilities to communicate with others and to provide means of access to information. As an aid to Deaf people, we present in this work a production-quality rule-based machine system for translating from Spanish to Spanish Sign Language (LSE) glosses, which is a necessary precursor to building a full machine translation system that eventually produces animation output. The system implements a transfer-based architecture from the syntactic functions of dependency analyses. A sketch of LSE is also presented. Several topics regarding translation to sign languages are addressed: the lexical gap, the bootstrapping of a bilingual lexicon, the generation of word order for topic-oriented languages, and the treatment of classifier predicates and classifier names. The system has been evaluated with an open-domain testbed, reporting a 0.30 BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy) and 42% TER (Translation Error Rate). These results show consistent improvements over a statistical machine translation baseline, and some improvements over the same system preserving the word order in the source sentence. Finally, the linguistic analysis of errors has identified some differences due to a certain degree of structural variation in LSE. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Meta-evaluation is a method to assess machine translation (MT) evaluation metrics according to certain theories and standards. This paper addresses an automatic meta-evaluation method of machine translation evaluation based on ORANGE - Limited ORANGE, which is applied in low -resource machine translation evaluation. It is adopted when the resources are limited. And take the three n-gram-based metrics - BLEUS, ROUGE-L and ROUGE-S for experiment, which is called horizontal comparison. Also, vertical comparison is used to compare the different forms of the same evaluation metric. Compared with the traditional human method, this method can evaluate metrics automatically without extra human involvement except for a set of references. It only needs the average rank of the references, and will not be influenced by the subjective factors. And it costs less and expends less time than the traditional one. It is good for the machine translation system parameter optimization and shortens the system development period. In this paper, we use this automatic meta-evaluation method to evaluate BLEUS, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-S and their different forms based on Cilin on the Russian-Chinese dataset. The result shows the same as that of the traditional human meta-evaluation. In this way, the consistency and effectiveness of Limited ORANGE are verified.

AB Soft-attention based Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models have achieved promising results on several translation tasks. These models attend all the words in the source sequence for each target token, which makes them ineffective for long sequence translation. In this work, we propose a hard-attention based NMT model which selects a subset of source tokens for each target token to effectively handle long sequence translation. Due to the discrete nature of the hard-attention mechanism, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm coupled with reward shaping strategy to efficiently train it. Experimental results show that the proposed model performs better on long sequences and thereby achieves significant BLEU score improvement on English-German (EN-DE) and English-French (EN-FR) translation tasks compared to the soft-attention based NMT.

The PoS tagging problem can be viewed as a special translation process where the source language is the set of strings being considered and the target language is the sequence of POS tags. In this work, we have used phrase-based machine translation technology to tackle the PoS tagging problem. Experiments on the Penn Treebank WSJ task were carried out and very good results were obtained.

Specifically, we maintain a timely updated key-memory to keep track of attention history and a fixed value-memory to store the representation of source sentence throughout the whole translation process. Via nontrivial transformations and iterative interactions between the two memories, the decoder focuses on more appropriate source word(s) for predicting the next target word at each decoding step, therefore can improve the adequacy of translations. Experimental results on Chinese double right arrow English and WMT17 German double left right arrow English translation tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model.

   analysis of translator educators' beliefs
SO TRANSLATION & INTERPRETING-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSLATION AND
   INTERPRETING
AB Discussions on the teaching of machine translation (Mr) have usually remained confined to translation technology pedagogy. Syllabus design, models for competence development, methodologies and evaluation procedures in this area have benefited from advances in translation pedagogy, but findings relating to the teaching of MT have been slow to be implemented in the translation classroom. Numerous studies have reflected translators' perspectives on MT, including those of professional associations, employers, and institutional organizations. Students' perspectives have also been collected, but the voice of the translation instructors is yet to be heard. A number of questions arise: What do translator educators think of MT? Would they be willing to use it in the translation classroom? If so, how and to what purpose'? To answer these and related questions, we present the results of a qualitative study conducted with a group of translation educators at Universitat de Valencia (University of Valencia, Spain) in the context of a broader research project. We specifically investigated their beliefs and perspectives towards the introduction of MT into the translation classroom. We used open-ended questions to collect qualitative data, and subsequently analysed responses within the framework of Grounded Theory. Findings provide valuable insights for discussion on the following topics: MT literacy, the blurring of MT key concepts and categorizations, the effect of MT on the development of translation competences, agency in MT reaching a stage where there is no longer a place for the human translator, and the eventual eclipse of the translator.

AB Though sparse features have produced significant gains over traditional dense features in statistical machine translation, careful feature selection and feature engineering are necessary to avoid overfitting in optimizations. However, many sparse features are highly overlapping with each other; that is, they cover the same or similar information of translational equivalence from slightly different points of view, and eventually overfit easily with only very feature training samples in given bilingual stochastic context-free grammar (SCFG) rules. We propose a natural autoencoder that maps all the discrete and overlapping sparse features for each SCFG rule into a continuous vector, so that the information encoded in sparse feature vectors becomes a dense vector that may enjoy more samples during training and avoid overfitting. Our experiments showed that for a 33-million bilingual SCFG rules statistical machine translation system, the autoencoder generalizes much better than sparse features alone using the same optimization framework.

AB This paper presents our submission for the shared task on isometric neural machine translation at International Conference on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT). There are numerous state-of-art models for translation problems. However, these models lack any length constraint to produce short or long outputs from the source text. This paper proposes a hierarchical approach to generate isometric translation on the MUST-C dataset. We achieve a BERTscore of 0.85, a length ratio of 1.087, a BLEU score of 42.3, and a length range of 51.03%. On the blind dataset provided by the task organizers, we obtained a BERTscore of 0.80, a length ratio of 1.10, and a length range of 47.5%.

AB In this paper, we investigate the use of linguistically motivated and computationally efficient structured language models for reranking N-best hypotheses in a statistical machine translation system. These language models, developed from Constraint Dependency Grammar parses, tightly integrate knowledge of words, morphological and lexical features, and syntactic dependency constraints. Two structured language models are applied for N-best rescoring, one is an almost-parsing language model, and the other utilizes more syntactic features by explicitly modeling syntactic dependencies between words. We also investigate effective and efficient language modeling methods to use N-grams extracted from up to 1 teraword of web documents. We apply all these language models for N-best re-ranking on the NIST and DARPA GALE program(1) 2006 and 2007 machine translation evaluation tasks and find that the combination of these language models increases the BLEU score up to 1.6% absolutely on blind test sets.

AB Morphological segmentation is an effective sparsity reduction strategy for statistical machine translation (SMT) involving morphologically complex languages. When translating into a segmented language, an extra step is required to desegment the output; previous studies have desegmented the 1-best output from the decoder. In this paper, we expand our translation options by desegmenting n-best lists or lattices. Our novel lattice desegmentation algorithm effectively combines both segmented and desegmented views of the target language for a large subspace of possible translation outputs, which allows for inclusion of features related to the desegmentation process, as well as an unsegmented language model (LM). We investigate this technique in the context of English-to-Arabic and English-to-Finnish translation, showing significant improvements in translation quality over desegmentation of 1-best decoder outputs.

AB Reordering is of a challenging issue in phrase-based statistical machine translation systems. This paper proposed three techniques to optimize classification-based reordering models for phrase-based translation under the bracket transduction grammar framework. First, a forced decoding technique is adopted to learn reordering samples for maximum entropy model training. Secondly, additional features are learned from the context of two consecutive phrases to enhance the prediction ability of the reordering classifier. Thirdly, the reordering model score is integrated as two feature functions (STRAIGHT and INVERTED) into the log-linear model to improve its discriminative ability. Experimental result demonstrates significant improvements over the baseline in two translation tasks such as Chinese to English and Chinese to Japanese translation.

SO KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING REVIEW
AB Statistical machine translation (SMT) is gaining interest given that it can easily be adapted to any pair of languages. One of the main challenges in SMT is domain adaptation because the performance in translation drops when testing conditions deviate from training conditions. Many research works are arising to face this challenge. Research is focused on trying to exploit all kinds of material, if available. This paper provides an overview of research, which copes with the domain adaptation challenge in SMT.

TI Translational (De)construction in Contemporary Chinese Poetics A Case
   Study of Hsia Yu's Pink Noise
SO TRANSLATOR
AB In his essay 'Typewriter Ribbon: Limited Ink (2)', Derrida presents us with an epistemological puzzle: the dilemma of considering in tandem the event and the machine. Derrida's question is: how can we reconcile a thinking of the event and that of the machine at the same time, in other words, both what happens/arrives and what is a calculable, machinelike repetition? What if Derrida's 'machine' takes the form of a computer program that performs translation tasks? How could we then contemplate the relationship between this translation machine, or machine translator; and creative writing as a textual event? To consider these questions, the article presents the case of a linguistic experiment that involves a textual event and a machine translator. The textual event in question is the bilingual poetry collection Fenhongse zaoyin/Pink Noise, 'written' by contemporaiy Taiwanese author Hsia Yu (b. 1956). Specifically, the article taps into ideas from deconstruction to illustrate the discursive operations between creative writing (as an event) and (machine) translating in this bilingual collection, with a view to understanding how the machine as translator participates in the negotiation and dissemination of meaning in bilingual writing.

TI Video Pivoting Unsupervised Multi-Modal Machine Translation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB The main challenge in the field of unsupervised machine translation (UMT) is to associate source-target sentences in the latent space. As people who speak different languages share biologically similar visual systems, various unsupervised multi-modal machine translation (UMMT) models have been proposed to improve the performances of UMT by employing visual contents in natural images to facilitate alignment. Commonly, relation information is the important semantic in a sentence. Compared with images, videos can better present the interactions between objects and the ways in which an object transforms over time. However, current state-of-the-art methods only explore scene-level or object-level information from images without explicitly modeling objects relation; thus, they are sensitive to spurious correlations, which poses a new challenge for UMMT models. In this paper, we employ a spatial-temporal graph obtained from videos to exploit object interactions in space and time for disambiguation purposes and to promote latent space alignment in UMMT. Our model employs multi-modal back-translation and features pseudo-visual pivoting, in which we learn a shared multilingual visual-semantic embedding space and incorporate visually pivoted captioning as additional weak supervision. Experimental results on the VATEX Translation 2020 and HowToWorld datasets validate the translation capabilities of our model on both sentence-level and word-level and generalizes well when videos are not available during the testing phase.

TI An Efficient Framework for Extracting Parallel Sentences from

SO FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE
AB Automatically building a large bilingual corpus that contains millions of words is always a challenging task. In particular in case of low-resource languages, it is difficult to find an existing parallel corpus which is large enough for building a real statistical machine translation. However, comparable non-parallel corpora are richly available in the Internet environment, such as in Wikipedia, and from which we can extract valuable parallel texts. This work presents a framework for effectively extracting parallel sentences from that resource, which results in significantly improving the performance of statistical machine translation systems. Our framework is a bootstrapping-based method that is strengthened by using a new measurement for estimating the similarity between two bilingual sentences. We conduct experiment for the language pair of English and Vietnamese and obtain promising results on both constructing parallel corpora and improving the accuracy of machine translation from English to Vietnamese.

We focus on Arabic dialects of the Maghreb, namely Algerian, Moroccan and Tunisian. We first adapt a well-known statistical word segmenter to segment Algerian dialect texts written in both Arabic and Latin scripts. We demonstrate that unsupervised morphological segmentation could be applied to Arabic dialects regardless of used script. Next, we use this kind of segmentation to improve statistical machine translation scores between the tree Maghrebi dialects and French. We use a parallel multidialectal corpus that includes six Arabic dialects in addition to MSA and French. We achieved interesting results. Regards to word segmentation, the rate of correctly segmented words reached 70% for those written in Latin script and 79% for those written in Arabic script. For machine translation, the unsupervised morphological segmentation helped to decrease out-of-vocabulary words rates by a minimum of 35%.

AB Various methods have been proposed and evaluated for the automatic evaluation of machine translation. Their meta evaluations are usually performed only at the document level, which consists of many translated sentences. However, meta-evaluations for methods on the segment level are also extremely important because human judgment can evaluate both the document level and segment level. This paper proposes a calculation method of a document-level score for IMPACT, an automatic evaluation method for machine translation. In previous experiments, IMPACT exhibited the highest correlation with human judgment among several methods at the segment level. It is important for IMPACT to obtain high correlation also at the document level. Furthermore, we describe results of a meta-evaluation for IMPACT at both the document level and segment level through comparison with other methods. Meta-evolutional experiments show that IMPACT can obtain the highest value among several methods in F values based on document-level and segment-level correlations.

AB Languages evolve and change over time. Accordingly, texts that were written a hundred years ago may become incomprehensible, such as hundred-year-old Turkish texts. Additionally, making old written work accessible to today's generation requires qualified writers, who are responsible for the process of conversion. Unfortunately, that is costly in both time and resources. To work out this problem, we develop an automatic style conversion system. We formulate our problem as a machine translation problem and use the recently popularized Neural Machine Translation techniques. Furthermore, we introduce a data-driven approach to align source and target word vectors. Although we do not introduce new model components over the standard RNN encoder-decoder, the way we utilize monolingual data to pre-train our word vectors lead to significant improvements. Despite the simplicity of our approach, we outperform complex approaches. We achieve a BLEU score of 33.8 points, improving our baseline by 12 points.

TI Incremental transfer in English-Japanese machine translation
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB Since spontaneously spoken language expressions appear continuously, the transfer stage of a spoken language machine translation system have to work incrementally. In such the system. the high degree of incrementality Is also strongly required rather than that of quality. This paper proposes an incremental machine translation system. which translates English spoken words into Japanese in accordance with the order of appearances of them. The system is composed of three modules: incremental parsing, transfer and generation, which work synchronously. The transfer module utilizes some features and phenomena characterizing Japanese spoken language: flexible word-order, ellipses, repetitions and so forth. This is influenced by the observational facts that such characteristics frequently appear in Japanese uttered by English-Japanese interpreters. Their frequent utilization is the kev to success of the exceedingly incremental translation between English and Japanese, which have different word-order. We have implemented a prototype system Sync/Trans, which parses English dialogues incrementally and generates Japanese immediately. To evaluate Sync/Trans we have made an experiment with the conversations consisting of 27 dialogues and 218 sentences. 190 of the sentences are correct, providing a success rate of 87.2%. This result shows our incremental method to be a promising technique for spoken language translation with acceptable accuracy and high real-time nature.

PAN is different from, and simpler than, previous implementations of ambient-like calculi, mainly because: the underlying calculus is typed Safe Ambients (SA) rather than the untyped Ambient calculus and therefore does not present certain forms of interferences among processes (the grave interferences). In PAN the logical structure of an ambient system and its physical distribution are separated. A translation from SA terms to PAN terms is defined. The correctness of such a translation, which asserts that an SA term and its translation exhibit the same observational behavior, is proved.

SO IEEE ACCESS
AB We have implemented a machine translation system, the PolyMath Translator, for LaTeX documents containing mathematical text. The current implementation translates English LaTeX to French LaTeX, attaining a BLEU score of 53.6 on a held-out test corpus of mathematical sentences. It produces LaTeX documents that can be compiled to PDF without further editing. The system first converts the body of an input LaTeX document into English sentences containing math tokens, using the pandoc universal document converter to parse LaTeX input. We have trained a Transformer-based translator model, using OpenNMT, on a combined corpus containing a small proportion of domain-specific sentences. Our full system uses this Transformer model and also Google Translate with a custom glossary, the latter being used as a backup to better handle linguistic features that do not appear in our training dataset. Google Translate is used when the Transformer model does not have confidence in its translation, as determined by a high perplexity score. Ablation testing demonstrates that the tokenization of symbolic expressions is essential to the high quality of translations produced by our system. We have published our test corpus of mathematical text. The PolyMath Translator is available as a web service at http://www.polymathtrans.ai.

AB Building conversational speech recognition systems for new languages is constrained by the availability of utterances capturing user-device interactions. Data collection is expensive and limited by speed of manual transcription. In order to address this, we advocate the use of neural machine translation as a data augmentation technique for bootstrapping language models. Machine translation (MT) offers a systematic way of incorporating collections from mature, resource-rich conversational systems that may be available for a different language. However, ingesting raw translations from a general purpose MT system may not be effective owing to the presence of named entities, intra sentential code-switching and the domain mismatch between the conversational data being translated and the parallel text used for MT training. To circumvent this, we explore following domain adaptation techniques: (a) sentence embedding based data selection for MT training, (b) model finetuning, and (c) rescoring and filtering translated hypotheses. Using Hindi language as the experimental testbed, we supplement transcribed collections with translated US English utterances. We observe a relative word error rate reduction of 7.8-15.6%, depending on the bootstrapping phase. Fine grained analysis reveals that translation particularly aids the interaction scenarios underrepresented in the transcribed data.

AB This paper describes a machine translation system that is capable of translating a grammatically correct Sinhala sentence in to its corresponding English sentence. This is the first Sinhala to English machine translation system, which comes with features such as an inbuilt keyboard, an inbuilt dictionary, an integrated word processor based on Unicode fonts, a grammar tool, a Sinhalese grammar checker, an add word tool, and a debugging tool. With the expansion of the world, English has become an important language that people should learn, as the majority of the worldwide population understand and carry out their day-to-day work in English. In addressing this need, we thought of taking up the challenge of building, a Sinhala to English language translator. To build this system, we used the Transfer-based machine translation approach, which is a Rule-based approach. At present, the system has achieved a success rate of 75% with a corpus of 150 sentences.

TI Synchronously Improving Multi-user English Translation Ability by Using
   AI
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS
AB English has become the most widely used language in the world. Everything we do in study, life and work is closely linked with English. With the continuous development of computer technology, machine translation is becoming more and more mature. The convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and language learning is getting increasingly close, which brings great impact and challenge to the language education industry, but also provides an opportunity for the synchronous promotion of the development of the language education industry. With the further development of AI, machine translation can better meet the needs of most general translation, but in the face of professional, diversified, detailed and complex communication translation tasks containing human emotion, machine translation is still difficult to replace human translation. In order to improve the English translation ability of university students, this paper uses AI to propose the innovative factor based Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization-Convolutional Neural Network (QPSO-CNN) algorithm. Through the experiment, at first, the obtained dataset can ensure the accuracy and diversity of the collected results of English translation feature samples to the maximum extent, and the trained QPSO-CNN can be used to analyze the accuracy of the English translation ability of university students. Then, by comparing the convergence curve of QPSO-CNN and back propagation-CNN (BP-CNN), it is concluded that the proposed QPSO-CNN in this paper has been greatly improved in terms of model accuracy and convergence speed.

AB We propose a data augmentation method for neural machine translation. It works by interpreting language models and phrasal alignment causally. Specifically, it creates augmented parallel translation corpora by generating (path-specific) counterfactual aligned phrases. We generate these by sampling new source phrases from a masked language model, then sampling an aligned counterfactual target phrase by noting that a translation language model can be interpreted as a GumbelMax Structural Causal Model (Oberst and Sontag, 2019). Compared to previous work, our method takes both context and alignment into account to maintain the symmetry between source and target sequences. Experiments on IWSLT15 English -> Vietnamese, WMT'17 English -> German, WMT' 18 English Turkish, and WMT'19 robust English -> French show that the method can improve the performance of translation, backtranslation and translation robustness.

AB The translation task of social media comments has attracted researchers in recent times because of the challenges to understand the nature of the comments and its representation and the need of its translation into other target languages. In the present work, we attempt two approaches of translating the Facebook comments - one using a language identifier and other without using the language identifier. We also attempt to handle some form of spelling variation of these comments towards improving the translation quality with the help of state-of-the-art statistical machine translation techniques. Our approach employs n-best-list generation of the source language of the training dataset to address the spelling variation in the comments and also enrich the resource for translation. A small in-domain dataset could further boost the performance of the translation system. Our translation task focuses on Hindi-English mixed comments collected from Facebook and our systems show improvement of translation quality over the baseline system in terms of automatic evaluation scores.

AB Modern neural machine translation (NMT) models have achieved competitive performance in standard benchmarks such as WMT. However, there still exist significant issues such as robustness, domain generalization, etc. In this paper, we study NMT models from the perspective of compositional generalization by building a benchmark dataset, CoGnition, consisting of 216k clean and consistent sentence pairs. We quantitatively analyze effects of various factors using compound translation error rate, then demonstrate that the NMT model fails badly on compositional generalization, although it performs remarkably well under traditional metrics.

AB Recently, the idea of "domain tuning" or customizing lexicons to improve results in machine translation and summarization tasks has driven the need for better testing and training corpora. Traditional methods of automated document identification rely on word-based methods to find the genre, domain, or authorship of a document. However, the ability to select good training corpora, especially when it comes to machine translation systems, requires automated document selection methods that do not rely on the traditional lexically-based techniques. Because syntactic structures and syntactic feature densities can heavily affect machine translation quality, syntactic feature-based methods of document selection should be used in choosing training and testing corpora. This paper provides evidence that document genres can be distinguished on the basis of syntactic-tag densities alone, supporting the idea that automated document identification is possible using alternative methods. Such methods would be ideal for creating syntactically as well as lexically balanced corpora for both genre and subject matter.

AB Language translation is one of the most research and development oriented topic in today's world because of its increasing demand and application. Knowledge of grammar structure of source and target languages is must for translating one language to other. Clauses are an integral part of any language and helps in constructing complex sentences in different contexts. This complication leads to a low score of translation in almost every machine translation engine existing in the world. In this work, we are focusing on relative clause identification and extraction for text simplification. The generated simple sentences are then fed to the existing translation engines for translation. Link Parser based parsing techniques are used to parse the sentence tree. In this work we have focused on achieving better quality of English-Hindi translations. The proposed approach is tested manually on a sufficiently large dataset and shows promising and better translation score than the conventional approaches.

AB Speech-to-speech translation system enables in translation of speech signals in a source language A to target language B. A good speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) system can be characterized by its ability to keep intact the fluency and meaning of the original speech input. An S2ST system to enable translation between Hindi and English is the main idea of the proposed work. A preliminary dataset concentrating on basic travel expressions in both the languages considered is used for this work. In order to develop a successful S2ST system three subsystems are required namely, automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, machine translation (MT) system and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) system. Hidden Markov models based ASR system is developed for both the languages and their performances are analyzed based on the word error rate (WER). The MT subsystem makes use of the statistical machine translation (SMT) approach for the purpose of translating the text between the two languages involved. The SMT makes use of IBM alignment models and language models to enable proper translation. The performance of MT is analyzed based on translated edit rate (TER) and analysis of the translation table. HMM-based speech synthesis system (HTS) is used to synthesize the translated text. Performance of the synthesizer is analyzed based on mean opinion score (MOS) from a group of listeners.

AB This paper proposes a novel attention mechanism for Transformer Neural Machine Translation, "Synchronous Syntactic Attention," inspired by synchronous dependency grammars. The mechanism synchronizes source-side and target-side syntactic self-attentions by minimizing the difference between target-side self-attentions and the source-side self-attentions mapped by the encoder-decoder attention matrix. The experiments show that the proposed method improves the translation performance on WMT14 En-De, WMT16 En-Ro, and AS-PEC Ja-En (up to +0.38 points in BLEU).

AB Cherokee is a highly endangered Native American language spoken by the Cherokee people. The Cherokee culture is deeply embedded in its language. However, there are approximately only 2,000 fluent first language Cherokee speakers remaining in the world, and the number is declining every year. To help save this endangered language, we introduce ChrEn, a Cherokee-English parallel dataset, to facilitate machine translation research between Cherokee and English. Compared to some popular machine translation language pairs, ChrEn is extremely low-resource, only containing 14k sentence pairs in total. We split our parallel data in ways that facilitate both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluation. We also collect 5k Cherokee monolingual data to enable semi-supervised learning. Besides these datasets, we propose several Cherokee-English and English-Cherokee machine translation systems. We compare SMT (phrase-based) versus NMT (RNN-based and Transformer-based) systems; supervised versus semi-supervised (via language model, back-translation, and BERT/Multilingual-BERT) methods; as well as transfer learning versus multilingual joint training with 4 other languages. Our best results are 15.8/12.7 BLEU for in-domain and 6.5/5.0 BLEU for out-of-domain Chr-En/En-Chr translations, respectively, and we hope that our dataset and systems will encourage future work by the community for Cherokee language revitalization.(1)

TI Improved Unsupervised Statistical Machine Translation via Unsupervised
   Word Sense Disambiguation for a Low-Resource and Indic Languages
SO IETE JOURNAL OF RESEARCH
AB Besides word order, word choice is a key stumbling block for machine translation (MT) in morphologically rich languages due to homonyms and polysemous difficulties. On the other hand, un-translated/improperly translated words are a severe issue for Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) models. The quantity of parallel training corpus has limited unsupervised SMT (USMT) systems. Still, current research lines have successfully trained SMT systems in an unsupervised manner using monolingual data alone. However, there is still a need to enhance the translation quality of the MT output due to unaligned and improperly sensed words. This problem is addressed by incorporating unsupervised Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) into the decoding phase of USMT. The work provided a compendium of SMT systems for five translation tasks, i.e. En -> Indic languages for the WMT test dataset and evaluated on BLEU and METEOR evaluation metrics. The studies were performed on En -> Hi, En -> Kn, En -> Ta, En -> Te, and En -> Be tasks and showed an improvement in BLEU points by 2.3, 2.68, 0.78, 2.32, and 1.79, respectively, and METEOR points by 1.07, 1.34, 0.72, 0.693, and 1.191, respectively, over the baseline model.

AB In simultaneous machine translation, finding an agent with the optimal action sequence of reads and writes that maintain a high level of translation quality while minimizing the average lag in producing target tokens remains an extremely challenging problem. We propose a novel supervised learning approach for training an agent that can detect the minimum number of reads required for generating each target token by comparing simultaneous translations against full-sentence translations during training to generate oracle action sequences. These oracle sequences can then be used to train a supervised model for action generation at inference time. Our approach provides an alternative to current heuristic methods in simultaneous translation by introducing a new training objective, which is easier to train than previous attempts at training the agent using reinforcement learning techniques for this task. Our experimental results show that our novel training method for action generation produces much higher quality translations while minimizing the average lag in simultaneous translation.

AB To improve the quality of a machine translation system, it is useful to extract and store words and phrases which are salient in a domain and should be translated in a specific way. We tried several existing technologies for salient word extraction and compared their mechanisms and quality. Based on the comparison, we propose a new method which includes preprocessing of sentences in corpora and utilization of syntactic information. We evaluated the usefulness of our new method.

TI Machine translation systems and quality assessment: a systematic review
SO LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
AB Nowadays, in the globalised context in which we find ourselves, language barriers can still be an obstacle to accessing information. On occasions, it is impossible to satisfy the demand for translation by relying only in human translators, therefore, tools such as Machine Translation (MT) are gaining popularity due to their potential to overcome this problem. Consequently, research in this field is constantly growing and new MT paradigms are emerging. In this paper, a systematic literature review has been carried out in order to identify what MT systems are currently most employed, their architecture, the quality assessment procedures applied to determine how they work, and which of these systems offer the best results. The study is focused on the specialised literature produced by translation experts, linguists, and specialists in related fields that include the English-Spanish language combination. Research findings show that neural MT is the predominant paradigm in the current MT scenario, being Google Translator the most used system. Moreover, most of the analysed works used one type of evaluation-either automatic or human-to assess machine translation and only 22% of the works combined these two types of evaluation. However, more than a half of the works included error classification and analysis, an essential aspect for identifying flaws and improving the performance of MT systems.

AB In this paper, we deal with two problems in Japanese-English machine translation of news articles. The first problem is the quality of parallel corpora. Neural machine translation (NMT) systems suffer degraded performance when trained with noisy data. Because there is no clean Japanese-English parallel data for news articles, we build a novel parallel news corpus consisting of Japanese news articles translated into English in a content-equivalent manner. This is the first content-equivalent Japanese-English news corpus translated specifically for training NMT systems. The second problem involves the domain-adaptation technique. NMT systems suffer degraded performance when trained with mixed data having different features, such as noisy data and clean data. Though existing domainadaptation methods try to overcome this problem by using tags to distinguish the differences between corpora, it is not sufficient. We thus extend a domain-adaptation method by using multiple tags to train an NMT model effectively with both the clean corpus and existing parallel news corpora with some types of noise. Experimental results show that our corpus increases the translation quality, and that our domain-adaptation method is more effective for learning with multiple types of corpora than existing domain-adaptation methods are.

AB The paper argues for the viability and utility of partial machine translation (MT) in multilingual information systems. The notion of partial MT is modelled on partial parsing and involves a bottomup pattern matching approach where the finite-state transducers assign translation equivalents locally. The article focuses on the linguistic underpinnings of the approach and gives illustrations of its implementation within the NooJ finite-state linguistic development system.

A number of small, dedicated transducers is applied to convert sentence pairs from a bilingual corpus into generalized translation patterns. These patterns, together with the transducers are then used as a hierarchical translation memory for fully automatic translation. Results on the German-English VERBMOBIL Corpus are given.

AB In several areas of NLP evaluation, test suites have been used to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of systems. Today, Machine Translation (MT) quality is usually assessed by shallow automatic comparisons of MT outputs with reference corpora resulting in a number. Especially the trend towards neural MT has renewed peoples' interest in better and more analytical diagnostic methods for MT quality. In this paper we present TQ-AutoTest, a novel framework that supports a linguistic evaluation of (machine) translations using test suites. Our current test suites comprise about 5000 handcrafted test items for the language pair German-English. The framework supports the creation of tests and the semi-automatic evaluation of the MT results using regular expressions. The expressions help to classify the results as correct, incorrect or as requiring a manual check. The approach can easily be extended to other NLP tasks where test suites can be used such as evaluating (one-shot) dialogue systems.

AB Arabic is a Semitic language that is rich in its morphology. Arabic has very numerous and complex morphological rules. Arabic morphological analysis has gained the focus of Arabic natural language processing research for a long time in order to achieve the automated understanding of Arabic. With the recent technological advances, Arabic natural language generation has received attentions in order to allow for a room for wider applications such as machine translation. For machine translation systems that Support a large number of languages, interlingua-based machine translation approaches are particularly attractive. In this paper, we report our attempt at developing a rule-based Arabic morphological generator for task-oriented interlingua-based spoken dialogues. Examples of morphological generation results from the Arabic morphological generator will be given and will illustrate how the system works. Nevertheless, we will discuss the issues related to the morphological generation of Arabic words from all interlingua representation, and present how we have handled them.

AB Although many end-to-end context-aware neural machine translation models have been proposed to incorporate inter-sentential contexts in translation, these models can be trained only in domains where parallel documents with sentential alignments exist. We therefore present a simple method to perform context-aware decoding with any pre-trained sentence-level translation model by using a document-level language model. Our context-aware decoder is built upon sentence-level parallel data and target-side document-level monolingual data. From a theoretical viewpoint, our core contribution is the novel representation of contextual information using point-wise mutual information between context and the current sentence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on English to Russian translation, by evaluating with BLEU and contrastive tests for context-aware translation.

AB This paper address the issue of dealing with named entities in statistical machine translation (SMT). Named entities (NEs) tend to become out-of-vocabulary of the translation models so that the translation quality of sentences including them are often degraded. For this problem, we propose to take advantage of class-based translation models. We employ a named entity recognizer to replace the named entities on the training corpus with a unique class label, then train the translation and language models. The input sentence is also NE-replaced and translated into the target sentence, whose class labels are then converted back into their original names. The experimental evaluation revealed that the proposed approach was effective on OOV named entities. We also found that acombination of class-based and standard SMTs further improved performance.

AB Machine translation (MT) evaluation plays an important task in the translation industry. The main issue in evaluating the MT quality is an unclear definition of translation quality. Several methods and techniques for measuring MT quality have been designed. Our study aims at interconnecting manual error classification with automatic metrics of MT evaluation. We attempt to determine the degrees of association between automatic MT metrics and error classes from English into inflectional Slovak. We created a corpus, which consists of English journalistic texts, taken from the British online newspaper The Guardian and their human and machine translations. The MT outputs, produced by Google translate, were manually annotated by three professionals using a categorical framework for error analysis and evaluated using reference proximity through the metrics of automated MT evaluation. The results showed that not all examined automatic metrics based on n-grams or edit distance should be implemented into a model for determining the MT quality. When determining the quality of machine translation in respect to syntactic-semantic correlativeness, it is sufficient to consider only the Recall, BLEU-4 or F-measure, ROUGE-L and NIST (based on n-grams) and the metric CharacTER, which is based on edit distance.

This makes it difficult for readers to understand old texts. The goal of text simplification task is to increase the readability and understandability of the text by preserving the meaning. In this study, it is aimed to reduce the complexity of the texts written in republican period Turkish with text simplification methods. First, a parallel dataset is build using Nutuk, then a statistical machine translation model is trained. The results are measured using BLEU metric that is used in evaluation of machine translation systems. With this work, the complexity of old texts is reduced and the target audience of these texts is increased.

AB In the field of machine translation, parallel corpus serves as the most important prerequisite for learning complex mappings between targeted language pairs. However, in practice, the scale of parallel corpus is not necessarily the only factor to be taken into consideration for improving performance of translation models due to the quality of parallel data itself also has tremendous impact on model capacity. In recent years, neural machine translation systems have become the de facto choice of implementation in MT research, but they are more vulnerable to noisy disturbance presented in training data compared with traditional statistical machine translation models. Therefore, data filtering is an indispensable procedure in NMT pre-processing pipeline. Instead of utilizing discrete feature representations of basic language units to build a ranking function of given sentence pairs, in this work, we proposed a fully end-to-end parallel sentence classifier to estimate the probability of given sentence pairs being equivalent translation for each other. Our model was tested in three scenarios, namely, classification, sentence extraction and NMT data filtering tasks. All testing experiments showed promising results, and especially in Tibetan-Chinese NMT experiments, 3.7 BLEU boost was observed after applying our data filtering method, indicating the effectiveness of our model.

AB Availability of quality parallel data is a major requirement to build a reasonably well performing statistical machine translation (SMT) system. Thus, developing a decent SMT system for a low-resourced language pair like Sinhala and Tamil that does not have a large parallel corpus is rather challenging. Past research for other different language pairs has shown that different terminoloy / bilingual list integration methodologies can be used to improve the quality of SMT systems, for domain-specific SMT in particular. In this paper, we explore if this can be effective for Sinhala-Tamil machine translation for the domain of official government documents. We evaluate the impact of three types of bilingual lists, namely, a list of government organizations and official designations, a glossary related to government administration and operations, and a general bilingual dictionary, based on four different methodologies (three static and one dynamic). Out of four, one methodology gave notable improvements for all three types of list over the baseline.

The emphasis is placed on the machine translation models that determine output quality of these systems. In order to achieve our goal, a couple of MT systems have been tested on different text types prepared in two languages: English and French. The procedure of our evaluation is in strict conformity with a Framework for the Evaluation of Machine Translation in ISLE (International Standards for Language Engineering)[7]. In our study, we also consider user population as a factor that indicates different levels of the adequacy-oriented output to the users' needs. In conclusion, the backbone is made of the further study on incorporation of the database types and both the target as well as the source-language formalism which should be critical for designing universally usable MT system.

AB Translating documents from a source to a target language is a repetitive activity. The attempt to automate such a difficult task has been a long-term scientific dream. Among the several types of approaches in Machine Translation (MT), one of the most promising paradigms is Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT). An EBMT system translates by analogy, using past translations to translate other similar source-language material into the target language.
   In this paper we introduce EXTPA (EXample-based TRanslation Assistant), a complete EBMT system that exploits some innovative ideas in information retrieval and multilingual text management to effectively and efficiently extract useful suggestions from past translations and present them to the translator This work has been developed as a joint work with the LOGOS group, a worldwide leader in multilingual document translation.

AB In European-funded project MIS under the MLIS programme, the authors attempted a computer-driven translation package for tourism texts in 5 languages. It was believed such a package would be possible due to the highly formulaic language of tourism brochures and business communication in this sector, which ought to allow translation equivalences at the phrase or sentence level to be identified and used. While this proved to be broadly true the multilanguage format produced errors of agreement and ordering normally avoided by human and computer translators working between two languages. Even at the phrase and sentence level problems of interlanguage equivalence persisted Awareness of these problems should aid the planning of translation packages of this kind so errors can be avoided.

TI Reduction of Morpho-Syntactic Features in Statistical Machine
   Translation of Highly Inflective Language
SO INFORMATICA
AB We address the problem of statistical machine translation from highly inflective language to less inflective one. The characteristics of inflective languages are generally not taken into account by the statistical machine translation system. Existing translation systems often treat different inflected word forms of the same lemma as if they were independent of each other, although some interdependencies exist. On the other hand we know that if we reduce inflected word forms to common lemmas, some information is lost. It would be reasonable to eliminate only the variations in inflected word forms, which are not relevant for translation. Inflectional features of words are defined by morpho-syntactic descriptions (MSD) tags and we want reduce them. To do this the explicit knowledge about both languages (source and target language) is needed. The idea of the paper is to find the information-bearing MSDs in source language by data-driven approach. The task is performed by a global optimization algorithm, named Differential Evolution. The experiments were performed using freely available parallel English Slovenian corpus SVEZ-IJS, which is lemmatized and annotated with MSD tags. The results show a promising direction toward optimal subset of morpho-syntactic features.

TI An Assistant System for Translation Flipped Classroom
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB To achieve the goal of training translators that meet the current social needs, the innovation of translation teaching methods is necessary. Studies have proven that students in flipped classrooms (FCs) have greater performance than students in traditional classrooms. However, the preparation time for FCs could be three times higher than that of traditional classrooms, which leads to the reluctance of teachers to conduct FCs. Machine translation (MT) is believed to be a useful tool to improve the translation efficiency of human translators. However, in practice, teachers found that many students cannot work with MT effectively. To solve the above problems, this paper designs a Translation Flipped Classroom Assistance System (TFCAS) based on cloud computing and MT. A parameter is proposed to measure students' ability to translate evaluation. TFCAS has reduced the burden of teachers in the FC mode and helped students become accustomed to working with MT. Application data stored in the MySQL database, such as sentence pairs, will be used to optimize the neural machine translation model we developed for the system. The system makes MT and the training of translators support each other's sustainable development and conforms to the trend of deepening teaching reform.

AB More and more linguistic information has been employed to improve the performance of machine translation, such as part of speech, syntactic structures, discourse contexts, and so on. However, conventional approaches typically ignore the key information beyond the text such as prosody. In this paper, we exploit and employ three prosodic features: pronunciation (phonetic alphabet and tone), prosodic boundaries and emphasis. Based on the annotated data, a conditional random fields (CRF) sequential tagger is used to label the prosodic tags for Chinese sentences, and three methods are presented to integrate these features: (1) factored translation models where the prosodic features are incorporated as factors; (2) a word lattice decoding model where the prosodic boundaries are considered to be an alternative to the tokenization boundaries; (3) re-ranking models where the prosodic features are integrated in the language model to re-score the n-best translation candidates. We evaluate the proposed methods with bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) score both in English-to-Chinese (E2C) and Chinese-to-English (C2E) translation directions. Experiments show that with prosodic features, the re-ranking model achieves significant improvement, while the word lattice decoding and the factored translation models also improve the performance.

TI A review of the state-of-the-art in automatic post-editing
SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB This article presents a review of the evolution of automatic post-editing, a term that describes methods to improve the output of machine translation systems, based on knowledge extracted from datasets that include post-edited content. The article describes the specificity of automatic post-editing in comparison with other tasks in machine translation, and it discusses how it may function as a complement to them. Particular detail is given in the article to the five-year period that covers the shared tasks presented in WMT conferences (2015-2019). In this period, discussion of automatic post-editing evolved from the definition of its main parameters to an announced demise, associated with the difficulties in improving output obtained by neural methods, which was then followed by renewed interest. The article debates the role and relevance of automatic post-editing, both as an academic endeavour and as a useful application in commercial workflows.

AB Filipino is a changing language that poses several challenges. Our goal is to develop a bidirectional English-Filipino Machine Translation (MT) system using a hybrid approach to learn rules from examples. The first phase was an English to Filipino MT system that required several. language resources. The problem lies on its dependency over the annotated grammar which is currently unavailable for Filipino, which makes reverse translation impossible. Phase 2 addresses this limitation by using information taken from English and Filipino POS Taggers. The seed rules are generated by aligning the POS tags from English and Filipino examples, including their constraints. To perform compositionality, the system deduces the constituent labels by using the longest adjacent POS tags found in both the English and Filipino rule. The system groups together similar rules and generalizes it to encompass a wider range of unseen examples.

AB Machine translation is a way to become communication difficulties between people of different languages. Since such difficulties can arise even within a company, or in communicating with clients or business partners, a machine translation system that is able to produce acceptable translations could be very useful for companies, even integrated into enterprise applications. The problem is that according to our survey and informal interviews, Hungarian HT is not Yet in the state that it can he used without post-editing. In the article I will shortly present the main principles and approaches of MT and the error categories applied in the analysis. Then the categories are presented in an order of gravity. The aim of the study is to discover the deficiencies of the software to find the most urgent improvements and also to be a basis for a post-editing software.

TI Machine learning based english-to-Korean transliteration using grapheme

SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB Machine transliteration is an automatic method to generate characters or words in one alphabetical system for the corresponding characters in another alphabetical system. Machine transliteration can play an important role in natural language application such as information retrieval and machine translation, especially for handling proper nouns and technical terms. The previous works focus on either a grapheme-based or phoneme-based method. However, transliteration is an orthographical and phonetic converting process. Therefore, both grapheme and phoneme information should be considered in machine transliteration. In this paper, we propose a grapheme and phoneme-based transliteration model and compare it with previous grapheme-based and phoneme-based models using several machine learning techniques. Our method shows about 13 similar to 78% performance improvement.

AB Growing needs in localising audiovisual content in multiple languages through subtitles call for the development of automatic solutions for human subtitling. Neural Machine Translation (NMT) can contribute to the automatisation of subtitling, facilitating the work of human subtitlers and reducing turn-around times and related costs. NMT requires high-quality, large, task-specific training data. The existing subtitling corpora, however, are missing both alignments to the source language audio and important information about subtitle breaks. This poses a significant limitation for developing efficient automatic approaches for subtitling, since the length and form of a subtitle directly depends on the duration of the utterance. In this work, we present MuST-Cinema, a multilingual speech translation corpus built from TED subtitles. The corpus is comprised of (audio, transcription, translation) triplets. Subtitle breaks are preserved by inserting special symbols. We show that the corpus can be used to build models that efficiently segment sentences into subtitles and propose a method for annotating existing subtitling corpora with subtitle breaks, conforming to the constraint of length.

SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB Parallel feature weight decay algorithms, parfwd, are engineered for language- and task-adaptive instance selection to build distinct machine translation (MT) models and enable the fast development of accurate MT using less data and computation. parfwd decay the weights of both source and target features to increase their average coverage. In a conference on MT (WMT), parfwd achieved the lowest translation error rate from French to English in 2015, and a rate 11.7% less than the top phrase-based statistical MT (PBSMT) in 2017. parfwd also achieved a rate 5.8% less than the top in TweetMT and the top from Catalan to English. BLEU upper bounds identify the translation directions that offer the largest room for relative improvement and MT models that use additional data. Performance trend angles show the power of MT models to convert unit data into unit translation results or more BLEU for an increase in coverage. The source coverage angle of parfwd in the 2013-2019 WMT reached + 6 degrees better than the top with 35 degrees for translation into English, and it was + 1.4 degrees better than the top with 22 degrees overall.

TI Improving on-line handwritten recognition in interactive machine
   translation
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION
AB On-line handwriting text recognition (HTR) could be used as a more natural way of interaction in many interactive applications. However, current HTR technology is far from developing error-free systems and, consequently, its use in many applications is limited. Despite this, there are many scenarios, as in the correction of the errors of fully-automatic systems using HTR in a post-editing step, in which the information from the specific task allows to constrain the search and therefore to improve the HTR accuracy. For example, in machine translation (MT), the on-line HTR system can also be used to correct translation errors. The HTR can take advantage of information from the translation problem such as the source sentence that is translated, the portion of the translated sentence that has been supervised by the human, or the translation error to be amended. Empirical experimentation suggests that this is a valuable information to improve the robustness of the on-line HTR system achieving remarkable results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Syntax-based reordering for statistical machine translation
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB In this paper, we develop an approach called syntax-based reordering (SBR) to handling the fundamental problem of word ordering for statistical machine translation (SMT). We propose to alleviate the word order challenge including morphosyntactical and statistical information in the context of a pre-translation reordering framework aimed at capturing short- and long-distance word distortion dependencies. We examine the proposed approach from the theoretical and experimental points of view discussing and analyzing its advantages and limitations in comparison with some of the state-of-the-art reordering methods. In the final part of the paper, we describe the results of applying the syntax-based model to translation tasks with a great need for reordering (Chinese-to-English and Arabic-to-English). The experiments are carried out on standard phrase-based and alternative N-gram-based SMT systems. We first investigate sparse training data scenarios, in which the translation and reordering models are trained on a sparse bilingual data, then scaling the method to a large training set and demonstrating that the improvement in terms of translation quality is maintained.

AB Transformer based encoder has been the state-of-the-art model for the latest neural machine translation, which relies on the key design called self-attention. Multi-head attention of self-attention network (SAN) plays a significant role in extracting information of the given input from different subspaces among each pair of tokens. However, that information captured by each token on a specific head, which is explicitly represented by the attention weights, is independent from other heads and tokens, which means it does not take the global structure into account. Besides, since SAN does not apply an RNN-like network structure, its ability of modeling relative position and sequential information is weakened. In this paper, we propose a method named Cross Aggregation with an iterative routing-by-agreement algorithm to alleviate these problems. Experimental results on the machine translation task show that our method help the model outperform the strong Transformer baseline significantly.

AB Current domain-specific machine translation (MT) suffers from the lack of high-quality bilingual corpora. Existing work in this field has shown the advantage of Adaptation data selection (Ada-selection) for enriching the corpora. Encouraged by the empirical finding that topic distribution is conductive to characterizing a distinctive domain, we propose to use topic model to improve Ada-selection. Based on a joint LDA approach, we incorporate topic distribution in measuring the relevance between the target domain and the candidate parallel sentence pairs. On the basis, we select the highly relevant candidates as the high-quality domain-specific bilingual corpora. In practice, we apply our method for the acquisition of domain-specific corpora from the general-domain. Experiments on an end-to-end domain-specific MT task show that our method outperforms the state of the art, yielding at least 1.5 BLEU points at different scales of training data.

TI Uses and perceptions of machine translation at the European Commission
SO JOURNAL OF SPECIALISED TRANSLATION
AB Current research on translation technology seeks to integrate physical, cognitive and organisational ergonomics, and uses insights from the situated cognition paradigm to bring together social and technical perspectives on fast-evolving human-computer interactions. Even though these trends imply that a wider variety of professional contexts should be considered, studies of institutional translation are still scarce. This paper reports on a three-week research stay in the French language department of the European Commission (DGT-Fr2), aimed at understanding current uses and perceptions of machine translation (MT) and post-editing within Europe's biggest translation institution. Based on ethnographic data, we established a survey that we tested among French translators before translating it into English and submitting it to all DGT translators. Our quantitative data include 89 respondents from 15 language departments. We perform multiple linear regressions to assess technology acceptance, before focusing on the variance that the model leaves unexplained. Our findings show that perceptions of control, subjective norm and image, as well as insecurity (fear of MT) have an impact on professional MT acceptance.

AB When translating from speech, special consideration for conversational speech phenomena such as disfluencies is necessary. Most machine translation training data consists of well-formed written texts, causing issues when translating spontaneous speech. Previous work has introduced an intermediate step between speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) to remove disfluencies, making the data better-matched to typical translation text and significantly improving performance. However, with the rise of end-to-end speech translation systems, this intermediate step must be incorporated into the sequence-to-sequence architecture. Further, though translated speech datasets exist, they are typically news or rehearsed speech without many disfluencies (e.g. TED), or the disfluencies are translated into the references (e.g. Fisher). To generate clean translations from disfluent speech, cleaned references are necessary for evaluation. We introduce a corpus of cleaned target data for the Fisher Spanish-English dataset for this task. We compare how different architectures handle disfluencies and provide a baseline for removing disfluencies in end-to-end translation.

AB This empirical corpus study explores the quality of neural machine translations (NMT) and their post-edits (NMTPE) at the German Department of the European Commission's Directorate-General for Translation (DGT) by evaluating NMT outputs, NMTPE, and respective revisions (REV) with the automatic error annotation tool Hjerson (Popovic 2011) and the more fine-grained manual MQM framework (Lommel 2014). Results show that quality assurance measures by post-editors and revisors at the DGT are most often necessary for lexical errors. More specifically, if post-editors correct mistranslations, terminology or stylistic errors in an NMT sentence, revisors are likely to correct the same type of error in the same sentence, suggesting a certain transitivity between the NMT system and human post-editors.

AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has been widely used in recent years with significant improvements for many language pairs. Although state-of-the-art NMT systems are generating progressively better translations, idiom translation remains one of the open challenges in this field. Idioms, a category of multiword expressions, are an interesting language phenomenon where the overall meaning of the expression cannot be composed from the meanings of its parts. A first important challenge is the lack of dedicated data sets for learning and evaluating idiom translation. In this paper we address this problem by creating the first large-scale data set for idiom translation. Our data set is automatically extracted from a widely used German <-> English translation corpus and includes, for each language direction, a targeted evaluation set where all sentences contain idioms and a regular training corpus where sentences including idioms are marked. We release this data set and use it to perform preliminary NMT experiments as the first step towards better idiom translation.

AB Non-Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation (NAT) achieves significant decoding speedup through generating target words independently and simultaneously. However, in the context of non-autoregressive translation, the word-level cross-entropy loss cannot model the target-side sequential dependency properly, leading to its weak correlation with the translation quality. As a result, NAT tends to generate influent translations with over-translation and under-translation errors. In this paper, we propose to train NAT to minimize the Bag-of-Ngrams (BoN) difference between the model output and the reference sentence. The bag-of-ngrams training objective is differentiable and can be efficiently calculated, which encourages NAT to capture the target-side sequential dependency and correlates well with the translation quality. We validate our approach on three translation tasks and show that our approach largely outperforms the NAT baseline by about 5.0 BLEU scores on WMT14 En <-> De and about 2.5 BLEU scores on WMT16 En <-> Ro.

TI Machine translation and audiovisual products: a case study
SO JOURNAL OF SPECIALISED TRANSLATION
AB Much has been said and written about the effects that machine translation (MT) is having on all kinds of published products. This paper discusses the introduction of MT in the localisation of audiovisual products in general and particularly voiceover documentaries. Incorporating MT into the translation of voiceover documentaries would boost the dissemination of non-commercial or minority products, and could enhance the spread of culture. While it might at first seem that MT could be easily integrated into translation for documentaries, some particular aspects make it difficult to use MT to translate for dubbing or for voice-overs. We therefore designed an exploratory study using a corpus containing different texts of a film, in order to compare the results of different automatic measures. The preliminary results show that different results are obtained for different types of speech and that the application of automatic metrics produces similar results. In this article, we will present furthermore the methodological design, which might be considered useful for other studies of this kind.

AB The Research on machine translation has been lasting for many years, and now this research field is increasingly a thoroughly refined. In practical machine translation system, the processing of a simple and short Chinese sentence has somewhat good results. However, but the complex long Chinese sentence translation still has difficulties. In this paper a new hierarchical approach processing for Chinese complex long sentence through analysis of Chinese punctuation, conjunctive words and syntax function is proposed. The method syrithetically, uses semantic characteristic of source Chinese sentence, which includes grammatical features, the length of the source sentence. 10, punctuation and functional words. First phase is conjunctive words for simplified segmentation, and then the syntax analysis. in order to process complex long sentence by the multi-hierarchical approach. A long sentence is divided into several parts; even, part gets the correct translation of the result separately, and then is combined by the comprehensive approach to gain the complex long sentence translation result. Experiments show that our approach can significantly reduce the time consumption and numbers of ambiguity, and also improve the accuracy and readability when parsing Chinese complex long sentence.

TI Machine Translation Infrastructure for Turkic Languages (MT-Turk)
SO INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB In this study, a multilingual, extensible machine translation infrastructure for grammatically similar Turkic languages "MT-Turk" is presented. MT-Turk infrastructure has multi-word support and is designed using a combined rule-based translation approach thatunites the strengths of interlingual and transfer approaches. This resulted in achieving ease of extensibility by adding new Turkic languages. The new language can be used both as destination and as source language achieving two-way extensibility. In addition, the infrastructure is strengthened with the ability of learning from previous translations and using the suggestions of previous users for disambiguation. Finally, the success of MT-Turk for three Turkic languages -Turkish, Kirghiz and Kazan- is evaluated using BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) metric and it is seen that the suggestion system improved the success by 43.66% in average. Although the lack of linguistic resources affected the success of the system negatively, this study led to the introduction of an extensible infrastructure that can learn from previous translations.

AB Specialist high-quality information is typically first available in English, and it is written in a language that may be difficult to understand by most readers. While Machine Translation technologies contribute to mitigate the first issue, the translated content will most likely still contain complex language. In order to investigate and address both problems simultaneously, we introduce Simple TICO-19, a new language resource containing manual simplifications of the English and Spanish portions of the TICO-19 corpus for Machine Translation of COVID-19 literature. We provide an in-depth description of the annotation process, which entailed designing an annotation manual and employing four annotators (two native English speakers and two native Spanish speakers) who simplified over 6,000 sentences from the English and Spanish portions of the TICO-19 corpus. We report several statistics on the new dataset, focusing on analysing the improvements in readability from the original texts to their simplified versions. In addition, we propose baseline methodologies for automatically generating the simplifications, translations and joint translation and simplifications contained in our dataset.

SO SAGE OPEN
AB This study focuses on the influence of quality of Machine Translation (MT) output on a translator's performance. We analyze the translator's effort by product analysis and process analysis. The product analysis consists of MT quality evaluation according to the Dynamic Quality Framework; using error typology and the criteria such as fluency and adequacy. We examine translator's effort from the point of view of typing time, in the context of MT quality-focusing on error rate in language, accuracy, terminology, and style, and also in fluency and adequacy to the source text. We have found that the translator's performance is influenced by MT quality. The typing time is very closely related to errors in language, accuracy, terminology, and style as well as to fluency and adequacy. We used the Mann-Whitney test to compare the productivity of post-editing of MT with human translation. The results of the study have shown that post-editing-compared to human translation of journalistic text from English into the inflectional Slovak language is more effective.

TI A Hierarchy-to-Sequence Attentional Neural Machine Translation Model
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Although sequence-to-sequence attentional neural machine translation (NMT) has achieved great progress recently, it is confronted with two challenges: learning optimal model parameters for long parallel sentences and well exploiting different scopes of contexts. In this paper, partially inspired by the idea of segmenting a long sentence into short clauses, each of which can be easily translated by NMT, we propose a hierarchy-to-sequence attentional NMT model to handle these two challenges. Our encoder takes the segmented clause sequence as input and explores a hierarchical neural network structure tomodel words, clauses, and sentences at different levels, particularly with two layers of recurrent neural networks modeling semantic compositionality at the word and clause level. Correspondingly, the decoder sequentially translates segmented clauses and simultaneously applies two types of attention models to capture contexts of interclause and intraclause for translation prediction. In this way, we can not only improve parameter learning, but also well explore different scopes of contexts for translation. Experimental results on Chinese-English and English-German translation demonstrate the superiorities of the proposed model over the conventional NMT model.

AB In this paper, a new approach for machine translation of simple sentences from Kannada to English language is presented. Initially, the method performs lexical analysis to process input transliterated Kannada sentence to recognize and classify tokens using newly constructed source language lexicon Kannada WordNet. Then, newly designed recursive descent parser for the domain validates the transliterated Kannada sentence with the syntactic constructs/grammar rules. Further, the phrase mapper and output generation mechanisms are employed to obtain translated English sentence. The proposed methodology is evaluated on a data set containing transliterated Kannada sentences of text written in low resolution images of display boards of Karnataka government offices in India. The method achieves an average translation accuracy of 97.56%. The proposed method is robust and efficient in dealing with various issues such as construction of source lexicon, syntactic/semantic representation of language constructs, design of efficient parser, resolving differences between syntactic/semantic constructs of source and target language, construction of bilingual dictionary. The method also resolves word sense ambiguity, translation ambiguity, and provides accurate translation without errors.

AB Quality estimation (QE) is a non-trivial issue for machine translation (MT) and the neural approach appears a promising solution to this task. Annotating QE training corpora is a costly process but necessary for supervised QE systems. To provide informative large scale training data for the MT quality estimation model, this paper proposes an approach to generate pseudo QE training data. By leveraging the provided labeled corpus in this task, our method generates pseudo training samples with a purpose of similar distribution of translation error of the labeled corpus. It also describes a sentence specific data expansion strategy to incrementally boost the model performance. The experiments on the different open datasets and models confirm the effectiveness of the method, and indicate that our proposed method can significantly improve the QE performance.

AB Recent work has shown the effectiveness of neural probabilistic language models(NPLMs) in statistical machine translation(SMT) through both reranking the n-best outputs and direct decoding. However there are still some issues remained for application of NPLMs. In this paper we further investigate through detailed experiments and extension of state-of-art NPLMs. Our experiments on large-scale datasets show that our final setting, i.e., decoding with conventional n-gram LMs plus un-normalized feedforward NPLMs extended with word clusters could significantly improve the translation performance by up to averaged 1.1 Bleu on four test datasets, while decoding time is acceptable. And results also show that current NPLMs, including feedforward and RNN still cannot simply replace n-gram LMs for SMT.

Most e-learning platforms provide speech-based contents, which makes them inaccessible to the Deaf. To solve this issue, we have developed a MT system that translates Spanish speech-based contents into LSE.
   To test our MT system, we have integrated it into an e-learning tool. The e-learning tool sends the audio to our platform. The platform sends back the subtitles and a video stream with the signed translation to the e-learning tool.
   Preliminary results, evaluating the sign language synthesis module, show an isolated sign recognition accuracy of 97%. The sentence recognition accuracy was of 93%.

AB Image captioning is an NLP task that has many applications such as image search and retrieval. This Task is a challenging task, and it needs a lot of data (image data and their text captions), which might not be available for some languages. In this work, we investigate the use of a machine translation system to provide resources for a low-resourced language (Arabic) for the imaging captioning task. We train a model on captions automatically translated using Google machine translation service. The performance is measured using the BLEU, ROUGE, CIDEr, METEOR metrics. We compare to English model's performance. We also evaluate the generated captions on manually translated captions. The results show that machine translation can be good enough for creating resources for low-resourced languages for the image captioning task and translating training data and building a new model is better than translating the model's output.

AB This paper presented a Thai to Isarn dialect machine translation, named ThaiIsarn -MT, using rule-based and example based. To develop the system, a Thai - Isarn dialect dictionary and linguistics rules database were constructed. The dictionary contained 8,050 Thai words. Moreover, an example bilingual corpus was constructed. Since Thai is non-segmented language, input sentence was segmented to sequence of word using longest matching algorithm. The Thai word was looked for the corresponding Isarn word from the dictionary. For word that may has several meanings, we used the rule based and example based to select the most suitable meaning. In order to evaluate the performance of the purposed system, 854 Thai sentences were translated by the system. The result shows that the translation accuracy is 82.44%.

AB Designing better machine translation systems by considering auxiliary inputs such as images has attracted much attention in recent years. While existing methods show promising performance over the conventional text-only translation systems, they typically require paired text and image as input during inference, which limits their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a visual hallucination framework, called VALHALLA, which requires only source sentences at inference time and instead uses hallucinated visual representations for mult-imodal machine translation. In particular, given a source sentence an autoregressive hallucination transformer is used to predict a discrete visual representation from the input text, and the combined text and hallucinated representations are utilized to obtain the target translation. We train the hallucination transformer jointly with the translation transformer using standard backpropagation with cross-entropy losses while being guided by an additional loss that encourages consistency between predictions using either ground-truth or hallucinated visual representations. Extensive experiments on three standard translation datasets with a diverse set of language pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over both text-only baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

TI Korean-Vietnamese Neural Machine Translation with Named Entity
   Recognition and Part-of-Speech Tags
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB Since deep learning was introduced, a series of achievements has been published in the field of automatic machine translation (MT). However, Korean-Vietnamese MT systems face many challenges because of a lack of data, multiple meanings of individual words, and grammatical diversity that depends on context. Therefore, the quality of Korean-Vietnamese MT systems is still sub-optimal. This paper discusses a method for applying Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging to Vietnamese sentences to improve the performance of Korean-Vietnamese MT systems. In terms of implementation, we used a tool to tag NER and POS in Vietnamese sentences. In addition, we had access to a Korean-Vietnamese parallel corpus with more than 450K paired sentences from our previous research paper. The experimental results indicate that tagging NER and POS in Vietnamese sentences can improve the quality of Korean-Vietnamese Neural MT (NMT) in terms of the Bi-Lingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) and Translation Error Rate (TER) score. On average, our MT system improved by 1.21 BLEU points or 2.33 TER scores after applying both NER and POS tagging to the Vietnamese corpus. Due to the structural features of language, the MT systems in the Korean to Vietnamese direction always give better BLEU and TER results than translation machines in the reverse direction.

TI Generation of Compound Words in Statistical Machine Translation into
   Compounding Languages
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB In this article we investigate statistical machine translation (SMT) into Germanic languages, with a focus on compound processing. Our main goal is to enable the generation of novel compounds that have not been seen in the training data. We adopt a split-merge strategy, where compounds are split before training the SMT system, and merged after the translation step. This approach reduces sparsity in the training data, but runs the risk of placing translations of compound parts in non-consecutive positions. It also requires a postprocessing step of compound merging, where compounds are reconstructed in the translation output. We present a method for increasing the chances that components that should be merged are translated into contiguous positions and in the right order and show that it can lead to improvements both by direct inspection and in terms of standard translation evaluation metrics. We also propose several new methods for compound merging, based on heuristics and machine learning, which outperform previously suggested algorithms. These methods can produce novel compounds and a translation with at least the same overall quality as the baseline. For all subtasks we show that it is useful to include part-of-speech based information in the translation process, in order to handle compounds.

TI Effectively training neural machine translation models with monolingual
   data
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
AB Improving neural machine translation models (NMT) with monolingual data has aroused more and more interests in this area and back-translation for monolingual data augmentation Sennrich et al. (2016) has been taken as a promising development recently. While the naive back-translation approach improves the translation performance substantially, we notice that its usage for monolingual data is not so effective because traditional NMT models make no distinction between the true parallel corpus and the back translated synthetic parallel corpus. This paper proposes a gate-enhanced NMT model which makes use of monolingual data more effectively. The central idea is to separate the data flow of monolingual data and parallel data into different channels by the elegant designed gate, which enables the model to perform different transformations according to the type of the input sequence, i.e., monolingual data and parallel data. Experiments on Chinese-English and English-German translation tasks show that our approach achieves substantial improvements over strong baselines and the gate-enhanced NMT model can utilize the source-side and target-side monolingual data at the same time.

AB The softmax layer in neural machine translation is designed to model the distribution over mutually exclusive tokens. Machine translation, however, is intrinsically uncertain: the same source sentence can have multiple semantically equivalent translations. Therefore, we propose to replace the softmax activation with a multi-label classification layer that can model ambiguity more effectively. We call our loss function Single-label Contrastive Objective for Non-Exclusive Sequences (SCONES). We show that the multi-label output layer can still be trained on single reference training data using the SCONES loss function. SCONES yields consistent BLEU score gains across six translation directions, particularly for mediumresource language pairs and small beam sizes. By using smaller beam sizes we can speed up inference by a factor of 3.9x and still match or improve the BLEU score obtained using softmax. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SCONES can be used to train NMT models that assign the highest probability to adequate translations, thus mitigating the "beam search curse". Additional experiments on synthetic language pairs with varying levels of uncertainty suggest that the improvements from SCONES can be attributed to better handling of ambiguity.

TI HMM word and phrase alignment for statistical machine translation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Estimation and alignment procedures for word and phrase alignment hidden Markov models (HMMs) are developed for the alignment of parallel text. The development of these models is motivated by an analysis of the desirable features of IBM Model 4, one of the original and most effective models for word alignment. These models are formulated to capture the desirable aspects of Model 4 in an HMM alignment formalism. Alignment behavior is analyzed and compared to human-generated reference alignments, and the ability of these models to capture different types of alignment phenomena is evaluated. In analyzing alignment performance, Chinese-English word alignments are shown to be comparable to those of IBM Model 4 even when models are trained over large parallel texts. In translation performance, phrase-based statistical machine translation systems based on these HMM alignments can equal and exceed systems based on Model 4 alignments, and this is shown in Arabic-English and Chinese-English translation. These alignment models can also be used to generate posterior statistics over collections of parallel text, and this is used to refine and extend phrase translation tables with a resulting improvement in translation quality.

AB Mechanical translation using neural networks in natural language processing is making rapid progress. With the development of natural language processing model and tokenizer, accurate translation is becoming possible. In this paper, we will create a transformer model that shows high performance recently and compare the performance of English Korean according to tokenizer. We made a traditional neural network-based Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model using a transformer and compared the Korean translation results according to the tokenizer. The Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)-based Tokenizer showed a small vocabulary size and a fast learning speed, but due to the nature of Korean, the translation result was not good. The morphological analysis-based Tokenizer showed that the parallel corpus data is large and the vocabulary is large, the performance is higher regardless of the characteristics of the language.

AB In statistical machine translation system, automatically extracted phrase table inevitably contains a large number of errors and redundant phrase pairs, which causes excessive waste of time and space in decoding and affects translation quality. In order to solve this problem, we propose a method for filtering phrase table based in which virtual context is introduced to calculate an incremental quantity in language model for score of phrase pair. By considering the maximum and minimum incremental quantity in score from the virtual context, we design a filtering strategy by re-ranking phrase pairs. We conducted experiments on NTCIR-9 data to verify the method. The experimental results show that when the size of phrase table was reduced to 47% of the original, the translation quality was improved slightly; when the size was reduced to 30% of the original, only slight decline occurred in translation quality. The experimental results indicate that this method can effectively filter out the redundant phrase pairs of the phrase table.

In most cases machine translation systems generate a single output from the input sentence. however, in order to assist language learners in their journey with better and more diverse feedback, it is helpful to create a machine translation system that is able to produce diverse translations of each input sentence. However, creating such systems would require complex modifications in a model to ensure the diversity of outputs. In this paper, we investigated if it is possible to create such systems in a simple way and whether it can produce desired diverse outputs. In particular, we combined the outputs from forward and backward neural translation models (NMT). Our system achieved third place in En -> Ja track, despite adopting only a simple approach.

AB Machine translation quality has improved substantially in recent years. Many researchers have contributed and developed quite good algorithms, frameworks and models for various languages. Processing of natural language involves various levels, complexities, ambiguities arise at each of those levels. Some pragmatic and semantic approaches can be used to tackle these issues. Generally, prepositions are plays sound role in meaningful translation for any languages. While translating from English to Tamil, preposition in English sentences should be translated to postposition to have meaningful sentences. Thus the prepositional phase errors and orthographic errors are the major issue in machine translation. The main goal of this paper is to improve the translation quality. To achieve the goal, we use some semantic rule to correct the prepositional and orthographic errors in this English-Tamil translation. The proposed approach takes as input an English sentence containing a preposition and the correct postposition and correct spelling in Tamil for that particular sentence context as output. The rules are evaluated with corpus data and the performance is good. The outcomes of the results are compared with Google Translate.

AB Background: Parallel corpora are used to train and evaluate machine translation systems. To alleviate the cost of producing parallel resources for evaluation campaigns, existing corpora are leveraged. However, little information may be available about the methods used for producing the corpus, including translation direction. Objective: To gain insight on MEDLINE parallel corpus used in the biomedical task at the Workshop on Machine Translation in 2019 (WMT 2019). Material and Methods: Contact information for the authors of MEDLINE articles included in the English/Spanish (EN/ES), English/French (EN/FR), and English/Portuguese (EN/PT) WMT 2019 test sets was obtained from PubMed and publisher websites. The authors were asked about their abstract writing practices in a survey. Results: The response rate was above 20%. Authors reported that they are mainly native speakers of languages other than English. Although manual translation, sometimes via professional translation services, was commonly used for abstract translation, authors of articles in the EN/ES and EN/PT sets also relied on post-edited machine translation. Discussion: This study provides a characterization of MEDLINE authors' language skills and abstract writing practices. Conclusion: The information collected in this study will be used to inform test set design for the next WMT biomedical task.

In this paper, we propose a translation validation method to verify code motion transformations involving loops applied during the scheduling phase of high-level synthesis (HLS). Our method is capable of ignoring false computations during translation validation. We have also identified a scenario involving code motion across loops where the state-of-the-art translation validation method gives false positive results. Our method can prove the nonequivalence of the concerned finite state machines with data paths in this scenario. We detected a bug in the HLS tool SPARK involving loop invariant code motion using our method. Experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of our method.

AB we present new ways for Farsi to English topic adaptation for statistical machine translation. We incorporate topic in the phrase table in the form of sparse phrasal features and make use of sparse lexical features by determining the topic distribution of source sentences in the development and test corpus. These sparse features cover a lot of source to target topic related translations. We also develop systems with features that measure the topical similarity of the source sentence and each hypothesis. These features include features based on distributional profiles and two types of features which make use of bilingual topic models to measure the similarity of the source sentence and the hypothesis using topic vectors in source and target languages. Domain and topic adaptation is also combined to improve the translation quality. Different experiments are carried out on Farsi to English Verbmobil and CNN datasets. BLEU score shows up to 2.0 improvement on Verbmobil dataset. Up to 1.17 BLEU improvement and several individual translation corrections are observed in CNN dataset.

TI Dependency-to-Dependency Neural Machine Translation
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Recent research has proven that syntactic knowledge is effective to improve the performance of neural machine translation (NMT). Most previous work focuses on leveraging either source or target syntax in the recurrent neural network (RNN) based encoder-decoder model. In this paper, we simultaneously use both source and target dependency tree to improve the NMT model. First, we propose a simple but effective syntax-aware encoder to incorporate source dependency tree into NMT. The new encoder enriches each source state with dependence relations from the tree. Then, we propose a novel sequence-to-dependence framework. In this framework, the target translation and its corresponding dependence tree are jointly constructed and modeled. During decoding, the tree structure is used as context to facilitate word generations. Finally, we extend the sequence-to-dependence framework with the syntax-aware encoder to build a dependence-NMT model and apply the dependence-based framework to the Transformer. Experimental results on several translation tasks show that both source and target dependence structures can improve the translation quality and their effects can be accumulated.

AB We present a self-attention based bilingual adversarial text generator (B-GAN) which can learn to generate text from the encoder representation of an unsupervised neural machine translation system. B-GAN is able to generate a distributed latent space representation which can be paired with an attention based decoder to generate fluent sentences. When trained on an encoder shared between two languages and paired with the appropriate decoder, it can generate sentences in either language. B-GAN is trained using a combination of reconstruction loss for auto-encoder, a cross domain loss for translation and a GAN based adversarial loss for text generation. We demonstrate that B-GAN, trained on monolingual corpora only using multiple losses, generates more fluent sentences compared to monolingual baselines while effectively using half the number of parameters.

AB We present experimental results showing that integrating cross-lingual semantic frame similarity into the semantic frame based automatic MT evaluation metric MEANT improves its correlation with human judgment on evaluating translation adequacy. Recent work shows that MEANT more accurately reflects translation adequacy than other automatic MT evaluation metrics such as BLEU or TER, and that moreover, optimizing SMT systems against MEANT robustly improves translation quality across different output languages. However, in some cases the human reference translation employs different scoping strategies from the input sentence and thus standard monolingual MEANT, which only assesses translation quality via the semantic frame similarity between the reference and machine translations, fails to fairly and accurately reward the adequacy of the machine translation. To address this issue we propose a new bilingual metric, BiMEANT, that correlates with human judgment more closely than MEANT by incorporating new cross-lingual semantic frame similarity assessments into MEANT.

AB Parallel corpus is a critical resource in machine learning based translation. The task of collecting, extracting, and aligning texts in order to build an acceptable corpus for doing translation is very tedious most especially for low-resource languages. In this paper, we present the efforts made to build a parallel corpus for Cebuano and Filipino from two different domains: biblical texts and the web. For the biblical resource, subword unit translation for verbs and copy-able approach for nouns were applied to correct inconsistencies in translation. This correction mechanism was applied as a preprocessing technique. On the other hand, for Wikipedia being the main web resource, commonly occurring topic segments were extracted from both the source and the target languages. These observed topic segments are unique in 4 different categories. The identification of these topic segments may be used for automatic extraction of sentences. A Recurrent Neural Network was used to implement the translation using OpenNMT sequence modeling tool in TensorFlow. The two different corpora were then evaluated by using them as two separate inputs in the neural network. Results have shown a difference in BLEU score in both corpora.

This paper presents the submissions of our team for the sentence-level Quality Estimation shared task of CCMT19. Considering the good performance of neural models in previous shared tasks of WMT, our submissions also include two neural-based models: one is Bi-Transformer which proposes the model as a feature extractor with a bidirectional transformer and then processes the semantic representations of source and the translation output with a Bi-LSTM predictive model for automatic quality estimation, and the other BiRNN architecture uses only two bi-directional RNNs (bi-RNN) with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUB) as encoders, and learns representation of the source and translation sentence pairs to predict the quality of translation outputs.

TI Improving Semantic Parsing with Enriched Synchronous Context-Free
   Grammars in Statistical Machine Translation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB Semantic parsing maps a sentence in natural language into a structured meaning representation. Previous studies show that semantic parsing with synchronous context-free grammars (SCFGs) achieves favorable performance over most other alternatives. Motivated by the observation that the performance of semantic parsing with SCFGs is closely tied to the translation rules, this article explores to extend translation rules with high quality and increased coverage in three ways. First, we examine the difference between word alignments for semantic parsing and statistical machine translation (SMT) to better adapt word alignment in SMT to semantic parsing. Second, we introduce both structure and syntax informed nonterminals, better guiding the parsing in favor of well-formed structure, instead of using a uninformed nonterminal in SCFGs. Third, we address the unknown word translation issue via synthetic translation rules. Last but not least, we use a filtering approach to improve performance via predicting answer type. Evaluation on the standard GeoQuery benchmark dataset shows that our approach greatly outperforms the state of the art across various languages, including English, Chinese, Thai, German, and Greek.

AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has achieved great developments in recent years, but we still have to face two challenges: establishing a high-quality corpus and exploring optimal parameters of models for long text translation. In this paper, we first attempt to set up a paragraph-parallel corpus based on English and Chinese versions of the novels and then design a hierarchical model for it to handle these two challenges. Our encoder and decoder take all the sentences of a paragraph as input to process the words, sentences, paragraphs at different levels, particularly with a two-layer transformer. The bottom transformer of encoder and decoder is used as another level of abstraction, conditioning on its own previous hidden states. Experimental results show that our hierarchical model significantly outperforms seven competitive baselines, including ensembles.

AB The phrase-table plays an important role in traditional phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) system. During translation, a phrase-based SMT system relies heavily on phrase-table to generate outputs. In this paper, we propose two methods for enhancing the quality of phrase-table. The first method is to recompute phrase-table weights by using vector representations similarity. The remaining method is to enrich the phrase-table by integrating new phrase-pairs from an extended dictionary and projections of word vector presentations on the target-language space. Our methods produce an attainment of up to 0.21 and 0.44 BLEU scores on in-domain and cross-domain (Asian Language Treebank - ALT) English - Vietnamese datasets respectively.

AB Reordering model is the crucial component in statistical machine translation (SMT), since it plays an important role in the generation of fluent translation results. However, the data sparseness is the key factor that greatly affects the performance of reordering model in SMT. In this paper, we exploit synonymous information to alleviate the data sparseness and take Chinese-Mongolian SMT as example. First, a synonym-based reordering model with Chinese synonym is proposed for Chinese-Mongolian SMT. Then, we flexibly integrate synonym-based reordering model into baseline SMT as additional feature functions. Besides, we present source-side reordering as the pre-processing module to verify the extensibility of our synonym-based reordering model. Experiments on the Chinese-Mongolian dataset show that our synonym-based reordering model achieves significant improvement over baseline SMT system.

AB Parallel sentences are crucial for training machine translation systems, but they are not always parallel regarding translation quality or parallel granularity. The reasons of non-parallel are from two aspects: one is the automatic sentence alignment, which will generate non-parallel sentences as noises in the parallel corpus; the other is linguistic difference between two languages, such as one Chinese sentence (with multiple clauses) is parallel to multiple English sentences, which causes difficulty to define the parallel granularity between two languages. We propose methods for attacking these two non-parallel aspects respectively to improve parallel quality of the parallel corpus. The experiments show that the parallel corpus processed by our methods can benefit the training of machine translation system, and improve 1.13 BLEU points over the system that does not use our methods.

TI Machine vs. Radiologist-Based Translations of RadLex: Implications for
   Multi-language Report Interoperability
SO JOURNAL OF DIGITAL IMAGING
AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of translation of RadLex lexicon from English to German performed by Google Translate, using the RadLex ontology as ground truth. The same comparison was also performed for German to English translations. We determined the concordance rate of the Google Translate-rendered translations (for both English to German and German to English translations) to the official German RadLex (translations provided by the German Radiological Society) and English RadLex terms via character-by-character concordance analysis (string matching). Specific term characteristics of term character count and word count were compared between concordant and discordant translations using t-tests. Google Translate-rendered translations originally considered incongruent (2482 English terms and 2500 German terms) were then reviewed by German and English-speaking radiologists to further evaluate clinical utility. Overall success rates of both methods were calculated by adding the percentage of terms marked correct by string comparison to the percentage marked correct during manual review extrapolated to the terms that had been initially marked incorrect during string analysis. 64,632 English and 47,425 German RadLex terms were analyzed. 3507 (5.4%) of the Google Translate-rendered English to German translations were concordant with the official German RadLex terms when evaluated via character-by-character concordance. 3288 (6.9%) of the Google Translate-rendered German to English translations matched the corresponding English RadLex terms. Human review of a random sample of non-concordant machine translations revealed that 95.5% of such English to German translations were understandable, whereas 43.9% of such German to English translations were understandable. Combining both string matching and human review resulted in an overall Google Translate success rate of 95.7% for English to German translations and 47.8% for German to English translations. For certain radiologic text translation tasks, Google Translate may be a useful tool for translating multi-language radiology reports into a common language for natural language processing and subsequent labeling of datasets for machine learning. Indeed, string matching analysis alone is an incomplete method for evaluating machine translation. However, when human review of automated translation is also incorporated, measured performance improves. Additional evaluation using longer text samples and full imaging reports is needed. An apparent discordance between English to German versus German to English translation suggests that the direction of translation affects accuracy.

TI Searching Better Architectures for Neural Machine Translation
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Neural architecture search (NAS) has played important roles in the evolution of neural architectures. However, no much attention has been paid to improve neural machine translation (NMT) through NAS approaches. In this work, we propose a gradient-based NAS algorithm for NMT, which automatically discovers architectures with better performances. Compared with previous NAS work, we jointly search the network operations (e.g., LSTM, CNN, self-attention etc) as well as dropout rates to ensure better results. We show that with reasonable resources it is possible to discover novel neural network architectures for NMT, which achieve consistently better performances than Transformer [1], the state-of-the-art NMT model, across different tasks. On WMT'14 English-to-German translation, IWSLT'14 German-to-English translation and WMT'18 Finnish-to-English translation tasks, our discovered architectures could obtain 30.1, 36.1 and 26.4 BLEU scores, which are great improvement over Transformer baselines. We also empirically verify that the discovered model on one task can be transferred to other tasks.

AB One key ingredient of neural machine translation is the use of large datasets from different domains and resources (e.g. Europarl, TED talks) These datasets contain documents translated by professional translators using different but consistent translation styles. Despite that, the model is usually trained in a way that neither explicitly captures the variety of translation styles present in the data nor translates new data in different and controllable styles. In this work, we investigate methods to augment the state-of-the-art Transformer model with translator information that is available in part of the training data. We show that our style-augmented translation models are able to capture the style variations of translators and to generate translations with different styles on new data. Indeed, the generated variations differ significantly, up to +4.5 BLEU score difference. Despite that, human evaluation confirms that the translations are of the same quality.

AB In this paper, we propose a new phrase-based translation model based on inter-lingual triggers. The originality of our method is double. First we identify common source. Then we use inter-lingual triggers in order to retrieve their translations. Furthermore, we consider the way of extracting phrase translations as an optimization issue. For that we use simulated annealing algorithm to find out the best phrase translations among all those determined by inter-lingual triggers. The best phrases are those which improve the translation quality in terms of Bleu score. Tests are achieved on the proceedings of the European Parliament corpora. The training is made on a corpus containing 596K parallel sentences (French-English) and tests on a corpus of 1444 sentences. With only 8.1% of the identified source phrases occurring in the test corpus, our system overcomes the baseline model by almost 3 points.

AB Information Present in Different language and Structure gives Rise to language as barrier in information retrieval. Informative Document on queen Elizabeth is been writing by foreign language English which makes its difficult for a Marathi reader to understand and seek History of England, on Similar lines Literature Work on Shivaji is mostly documented in Marathi which makes foreign Historians difficult to gain know, in both case user is at times unknown of facts due to language and may lose interest on information. Vital information on current happing on village and taluka level are been published in newspaper with local language which setback information spread among other Masses. Many Time government documents and forms are been presented in English Language where a lay man from Marathi language background finds difficulty to understand information and even avoid such procedures therefore it highly urges for need of automated Software based Translation system which would assist in cross Domain information Retrieval. Machine Translation assist to translate Information presented in one language to other language. Information can be present in form of text, speech and image translating this information helps for sharing of information and ultimately information gain. A lot of work has been done on Translation of English to Hindi, Tamil Bangla and other foreign languages also.
   Machine Translation is challenging Research Area with numerous issues due to language ambiguity like grammar, Structure and even fluency of use. Numerous Methodologies have been proposed and developed which have uplifts and downfalls also, Although statistical and rule based at core with each having limitations. rule based produce accurate mapped translation and are trainable system but costly, whereas statistical produce fluent translation but lack accuracy and sense. Hybrid is combine approach which integrated approach and helps to optimize translation output.
   The research manuscript we present hybrid machine Translator for English to Marathi language which translated Web pages, text Documents on Agriculture (crops fruits for farmer), Medical reports in Marathi and tourism related information. Proposed System consists of Parallel Multi-Engines which process statistical and rule based Translation for same input document and produce a optimized result by performing statistical over rule based which give fluent language sense outputs. Mapper algorithm is been used in rule based Translation, with Agriculture corpus, medical and tourism corpus for statistical evaluation. Marathi wordnet has been implemented to enhance dictionary and incorporate better translation result
   Currently System has been proposed for text Document which can be extended to speech and voice. Comparative analysis for point view in one dimension of only limited set of Queries is done with Google Translator. Holding hybrid approach as better methodology.
   A Systematic survey of only 10 key articles used in research has been done. This research article is extension of our previous research surveys and partial implementations. And innovative Smeasure has been new parameter proposed and evaluated by our research team.

TI A study on the MT-PE Performances of Korean Language Translator -Focus
   on Chinese students' Korean MT-PE-
SO JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL NETWORK FOR KOREAN LANGUAGE AND CULTURE
AB This study expects that changes in MT in Korean Language and Translation education will also be reflected in the aspects of learning and training of Korean language translation and interpretation. In this study, we look into the types of translation errors of MT-PE in Korean translation and the results of PE performance are then observed in detail. And with the help of this result, the MT-PE ability required by Chinese translation students will be thoroughly studied.
   In the study of PE behaviour, PE is defined as the act of translation process that completes a translator's machine translated work and not a supplementary act to be done after translating. We then divide a translator's PE behaviour into 4 categories and are analyzed in detail. First, we divide the mistranslation or translation error of MT into abandonment of performance and inability to recognise.
   A translator's implementation of PE is then divided into PE success if it makes correction and PE failure if it again reproduces error. In the experiment, 63 MT errors are divided into 4 categories and these 4 categories are furthermore divided into 9 categories and whether the error is still retained or the error has been rectified is thoroughly observed. 7 participants were divided into two groups: translation learner group and translation expert group. The differences between these two groups are examined and their PE ability was tested through experiments. The result of PE performance of the 9 types of error is that the correctness of the final translation is influenced by the difference between mother tongue and Korean language and the participants' understanding of MT-PE.

TI Integration of Speech Recognition and Machine Translation in
   Computer-Assisted Translation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Parallel integration of automatic speech recognition (ASR) models and statistical machine translation (NIT) models is an unexplored research area in comparison to the large amount of works done on integrating them in series, i.e., speech-to-speech translation. Parallel integration of these models is possible when we have access to the speech of a target language text and to its corresponding source language text, like a computer-assisted translation system. To our knowledge, only a few methods for integrating ASR models with MT models in parallel have been studied. In this paper, we systematically study a number of different translation models in the context of the N-best list rescoring. As an alternative to the N-best list rescoring, we use ASR word graphs in order to arrive at a tighter integration of ASR and NIT models. The experiments are carried out on two tasks: English-to-German with an ASR vocabulary size of 17 K words, and Spanish-to-English with an ASR vocabulary of 58 K words. For the best method, the NIT models reduce the ASR word error rate by a relative of 18% and 29% on the 17 K and the 58 K tasks, respectively.

TI Intelligent Recognition English Translation Model Based on Embedded
   Machine Learning and Improved GLR Algorithm
SO MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Most of the popular translation models are based on encoder-decoder architecture and belong to the autoregressive translation model. When autoregressive translation models decode, they generate the current sequence according to the sequence generated before. This process is not parallel. The generalized maximum likelihood ratio detection (GLR) algorithm model cannot effectively guarantee the overlapping and accurate results of English translation detection. To improve the recognition rate of English phrases and meanings, this paper proposes an intelligent model for English translation recognition based on embedded machine learning and an improved GLR algorithm. A corpus of 520000 English phrases is used for training. And we compare and analyze different corpora and compare GLR algorithm with other traditional algorithms. Words and phrases are based on analytic linear structure. The syntactic function of the table corrects the ambiguity between English and Chinese structures in some speech recognition results and finally retains the recognition content. The research shows that the recognition accuracy based on the improved GLR algorithm is more than 96.58%, which is 23% higher than the classical GLR in semantic recognition. Statistical algorithm and dynamic storage algorithm make it more suitable for intelligent translation and provide a new model method for intelligent machine translation.

   Translation Production Process
SO INFORMATICS-BASEL
AB This paper studies the impact of machine translation (MT) on the translation workflow at the Directorate-General for Translation (DGT), focusing on two language pairs and two MT paradigms: English-into-French with statistical MT and English-into-Finnish with neural MT. We collected data from 20 professional translators at DGT while they carried out real translation tasks in normal working conditions. The participants enabled/disabled MT for half of the segments in each document. They filled in a survey at the end of the logging period. We measured the productivity gains (or losses) resulting from the use of MT and examined the relationship between technical effort and temporal effort. The results show that while the usage of MT leads to productivity gains on average, this is not the case for all translators. Moreover, the two technical effort indicators used in this study show weak correlations with post-editing time. The translators' perception of their speed gains was more or less in line with the actual results. Reduction of typing effort is the most frequently mentioned reason why participants preferred working with MT, but also the psychological benefits of not having to start from scratch were often mentioned.

AB This paper addresses the problem of reordering in statistical machine translation (SMT). We describe an elegant and efficient approach to couple reordering (word order monotonization) and decoding, which does not need for any additional model.
   We use linguistically motivated reordering rules to extend a monotonic search graph (with reordering hypotheses). The extended graph is traversed in decoding when a fully-informed decision can be taken (no preprocessing decision about reordering is taken). We also show how the N-gram translation model can be successfully used as reordering model when estimated with reordered source words (to harmonize the source and target word order).
   Experiments are reported on the Euparl task (Spanish-to-English and English-to-Spanish). Results are presented regarding translation accuracy and computational efficiency, showing significant improvements in translation quality for both translation directions at a very low computational cost.

AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems exhibit problematic biases, such as stereotypical gender bias in the translation of occupation terms into languages with grammatical gender. In this paper we describe a new source of bias prevalent in NMT systems, relating to translations of sentences containing person names. To correctly translate such sentences, a NMT system needs to estimate the gender of names. We show that leading systems are particularly poor at this task, especially for female given names. This bias is deeper than given name gender: we show that the translation of terms with ambiguous sentiment can also be affected by person names, and the same holds true for proper nouns denoting race. To mitigate these biases we propose a simple but effective data augmentation method based on randomly switching entities during translation, which effectively eliminates the problem without any effect on translation quality.

TI Role of Morphology Injection in SMT: A Case Study from Indian Language
   Perspective
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB Phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation (PBSMT) is commonly used for automatic translation. However, PBSMT runs into difficulty when either or both of the source and target languages are morphologically rich. Factored models are found to be useful for such cases, as they consider word as a vector of factors. These factors can contain any information about the surface word and use it while translating. The objective of the current work is to handle morphological inflections in Hindi, Marathi, and Malayalam using Factored translation models when translating from English. Statistical MT approaches face the problem of data sparsity when translating to a morphologically rich language. It is very unlikely for a parallel corpus to contain all morphological forms of words. We propose a solution to generate these unseen morphological forms and inject them into the original training corpus. We propose a simple and effective solution based on enriching the input with various morphological forms of words. We observe that morphology injection improves the quality of translation in terms of both adequacy and fluency. We verify this with experiments on three morphologically rich languages when translating from English. From the detailed evaluations, we observed an order of magnitude improvement in translation quality.

AB When dealing with low resource languages such as Myanmar, using additional pseudo parallel data for training machine translation systems is often an effective approach. As a pseudo parallel corpus is generated by back-translating target monolingual texts into the source language, it potentially contains a lot of noise including translation errors and weakly paired sentences and is thus required cleaning. In this paper, we propose a noisy parallel-sentences filtering system called Construct-Extract based on cosine similarity and Siamese BERT-Networks based cross-lingual sentence embeddings. The proposed system filters out noisy sentences by extracting high score sentence pairs from the constructed pseudo parallel data to finally obtain better synthetic parallel data. As part of the proposed system, we also introduce an unsupervised Myanmar sub-word segmenter to improve the quality of current English-Myanmar translation models that are potential to be used as backward systems for back-translation and often suffer from Myanmar word segmentation errors. Experiments show that the proposed Myanmar word segmentation could help the backward system to construct more accurate back-translated pseudo parallel data and using our extracted pseudo parallel corpus led to improve the performance of English-Myanmar translation systems in the two directions.

TI Latent Attribute Based Hierarchical Decoder for Neural Machine
   Translation
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Neural machine translation (NMT) has achieved state-of-the-art performance in many translation tasks. However, because the computational cost increases with the size of the search space for predicting the target words, the translation quality of NMT is constrained by the limited vocabulary. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel dynamic hierarchical decoder for NMT to utilize all of the target words in the training and decoding process. In the proposed model, a target word is represented by two latent attribute vectors rather than a word vector. The model is trained to dynamically put together those words that share similar linguistic attributes. The prediction of a target word is, therefore, turned into the prediction of attribute vectors, where the softmax functions are performed at the attribute level. This greatly reduces the model size and the decoding time. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the NMT baselines in both Chinese-English and English-German translation tasks.

AB This paper describes an original methodology for cross-language paraphrase via intermediate semantic expression in a knowledge representation language called Mental-image Description Language (L-md) and its application to an experimental system for English-Thai translation. This system interprets English text into L-md expression to understand it and interprets the understanding result into Thai text without using any syntactic information of the input English text. That is, the system performs free translation, namely, generates target language texts only from intermediate semantic representations of source language texts. It works as one kind of inter -lingual machine translation system but actually is a subsystem of our natural language understanding system to paraphrase an input text in another language. Some experimental results were evaluated by several native Thai speakers with good knowledge of English, which gave a good perspective to our future work on this system.

AB For humans it is difficult to understand different languages. As in India there are more than 22 official languages it becomes extremely difficult for a human to know all the languages, in this type of cases communication becomes a hindrance, this is where human interpreters might be required. It cannot be assured that human interpreters would be available every time. Due to this Machine Translation (MT) system comes into picture. MT performs replacement of words from one language to another.
   The idea behind this project is to achieve the real-time translation of languages with respect to real-time audio as an input by using NLP. It is done by the computers to learn the languages. The proposed system will take real-time English audio as an input and will translate English into Indian language and will produce audio output in the Indian language. The translation system will make use of OpenNMT. OpenNMT is an open source initiative for NMT and neural sequence modeling. NMT is used for automated translation which helps in learning process for both ends which is used to overcome many weaknesses of previously based translation systems.

AB There are many differences between Chinese and Japanese in history, culture, life, manners and customs, therefore it is natural that there are particular words and special usage of words in two languages. It is necessary to correctly master the meaning of these particular words and then translate accurately between two languages. Because of the complex corresponding relationship in Chinese and Japanese, when building Japanese-Chinese machine translation, it is easy to introduce vagueness. Among the mistakenly translations in existing commercial translation software, most of them are caused by the negative expression in the sentence. In this paper, through analyzing the negative expression ways in Chinese and Japanese languages, we investigated the translation of Japanese-Chinese negative sentences by using the selection rules of Chinese negative words and position rules. The basic Japanese negative expression naide/(sic) has the same meaning with mei/(sic) and bie/(sic) in Chinese. When translating nakute/(sic) into Chinese, according to its negative meaning and grammatical rule, it may be translated into bu/(sic). In the current research, we discussed the general rules which are abstracted from typical examples including naide/(sic) and nakute/(sic).

   In this paper we present the CrowdLang(1) programming framework for engineering complex computation systems incorporating large crowds of networked humans and machines with a library of known interaction patterns. We evaluate CrowdLang by programming a German-to-English translation program incorporating machine translation and a monolingual crowd. The evaluation shows that CrowdLang is able to simply explore a large design space of possible problem-solving programs with the simple variation of the used abstractions. In an experiment involving 1918 different human actors, we show that the resulting translation program significantly outperforms a pure machine translation in terms of adequacy and fluency whilst translating more than 30 pages per hour and approximates the human-translated gold standard to 75%.

We propose a method that uses a semantic category tree and collocation to resolve the ambiguity of query translation. We use the front-end and back-end processors in which domain identifier determines the domain of the retrieved documents, machine translators translate the retrieved documents and tag manager deals with the HTML tags to preserve the layout of the original web document. To obtain a robust translation within the Web environment, we use a hybrid translation engine that combines a pattern-based module with a rule-based translator and includes pre- and post-fail softeners.

AB Mobile online translation (MOT) is a new form of application of machine translation in the age of mobile learning. Nowadays, there are lots of MOT apps in Android app store. Since the techniques used in MOT apps and their functions are different, their features are also different. In order to objectively evaluate MOT apps for selecting suitable translation tools, we have studied a Delphi-based evaluation method. In this paper, firstly, we describe the basic functions and realization mechanisms of MOT tools; and then we analyze 10 factors which should be considered in the evaluation of MOT tools; on the basis of the analyses, we propose the Delphi-based evaluation method with a relatively complete indicator system, and we also determine the weights of every indicator by using Delphi. The experiment results on 6 MOT apps show that the evaluation method is practical and objective for selecting suitable translation tools.

AB We describe an improved strategy to combine the outputs of machine translation on sentence-level balancing the stability and the effectiveness of the combination. The new method alternates the classical MBR-based sentence-level combination with weighted Minimum Bayes Risk (wMBR). During the calculation of the risk, we weight the hypotheses with the performance of the MT system, which is measured by the automatic evaluation metrics on the development data. In experiments, the wMBR-based method stably achieve better results than other sentence-level methods and get the best position in CWMT08 evaluation track outperforming the other word-level and sentence-level combination systems.

TI A Multitask-Based Neural Machine Translation Model with Part-of-Speech
   Tags Integration for Arabic Dialects
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The statistical machine translation for the Arabic language integrates external linguistic resources such as part-of-speech tags. The current research presents a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM)-Conditional Random Fields (CRF) segment-level Arabic Dialect POS tagger model, which will be integrated into the Multitask Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model. The proposed solution for NMT is based on the recurrent neural network encoder-decoder NMT model that has been introduced recently. The study has proposed and developed a unified Multitask NMT model that shares an encoder between the two tasks; Arabic Dialect (AD) to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) translation task and the segment-level POS tagging tasks. A shared layer and an invariant layer are shared between the translation tasks. By training translation tasks and POS tagging task alternately, the proposed model can leverage the characteristic information and improve the translation quality from Arabic dialects to Modern Standard Arabic. The experiments are conducted from Levantine Arabic (LA) to MSA and Maghrebi Arabic (MA) to MSA translation tasks. As an additional linguistic resource, the segment-level part-of-speech tags for Arabic dialects were also exploited. Experiments suggest that translation quality and the performance of POS tagger were improved with the implementation of multitask learning approach.

AB Machine Translation Quality Estimation (QE) aims to build predictive models to assess the quality of machine-generated translations in the absence of reference translations. While state-of-the-art QE models have been shown to achieve good results, they over-rely on features that do not have a causal impact on the quality of a translation. In particular, there appears to be a partial input bias, i.e., a tendency to assign high-quality scores to translations that are fluent and grammatically correct, even though they do not preserve the meaning of the source. We analyse the partial input bias in further detail and evaluate four approaches to use auxiliary tasks for bias mitigation. Two approaches use additional data to inform and support the main task, while the other two are adversarial, actively discouraging the model from learning the bias. We compare the methods with respect to their ability to reduce the partial input bias while maintaining the overall performance. We find that training a multitask architecture with an auxiliary binary classification task that utilises additional augmented data best achieves the desired effects and generalises well to different languages and quality metrics.

AB Beam search optimization (Wiseman and Rush, 2016) resolves many issues in neural machine translation. However, this method lacks principled stopping criteria and does not learn how to stop during training, and the model naturally prefers longer hypotheses during the testing time in practice since they use the raw score instead of the probability-based score. We propose a novel ranking method which enables an optimal beam search stopping criteria. We further introduce a structured prediction loss function which penalizes suboptimal finished candidates produced by beam search during training. Experiments of neural machine translation on both synthetic data and real languages (German!English and Chinese!English) demonstrate our proposed methods lead to better length and BLEU score.

TI Towards Idiodiversity: Retranslating Cybernetics
SO PHILOSOPHY TODAY
AB This article discusses translation as a technique of doing philosophy and introduces the concept of idiodiversity as an alternative to the current model of automated translation machines. The dominant functionalist approach to technology has made these machines the agents of linguistic homogenisation, which constitutes a threat for the diversity of idiomatic open systems this article advocates for. However, as this article argues, the challenge is not merely to accuse automated translation technologies of impoverishing the knowledge of how to translate but, rather, to determine whether these technologies can be reappropriated for the purpose of preservation and revalorisation of translation and, more generally, as a conveyor of noodiversity. This challenge also involves the need to draw attention to the political significance of translation practices and to elaborate an alternative to the mechanistic approaches to translation, typical of computational linguistics and language engineering, through a heterodox approach to cybernetics.

TI Towards Integrated Classification Lexicon for Handling Unknown Words in
   Chinese-Vietnamese Neural Machine Translation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB In Neural Machine Translation (NMT), due to the limitations of the vocabulary, unknown words cannot be translated properly, which brings suboptimal performance of the translation system. For resource-scarce NMT that have small-scale training corpus, the effect is amplified. The traditional approach of amplifying the scale of the corpus is not applicable, because the parallel corpus is difficult to obtain in a resource-scarce setting; however, it is easy to obtain and utilize external knowledge, bilingual lexicon, and other resources. Therefore, we propose classification lexicon approach for processing unknown words in the Chinese-Vietnamese NMT task. Specifically, three types of unknown Chinese-Vietnamese words are classified and their corresponding classification lexicon are constructed by word alignment, Wikipedia extraction, and rule-based methods, respectively. After translation, the unknown words are restored by lexicon for post-processing. Experiment results on Chinese-Vietnamese, English-Vietnamese, and Mongolian-Chinese translations show that our approach significantly improves the accuracy and the performance of NMT especially in a resource-scarce setting.

TI Improving neural machine translation using gated state network and focal

SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
AB The currently predominant token-to-token attention mechanism has demonstrated its ability to capture word dependencies in neural machine translation. This mechanism treats a sequence as bag-of-words tokens and compute the similarity between tokens without considering their intrinsic interactions. In this paper, we argue that this attention mechanism may miss opportunity of take advantage of the state information through multiple time steps. Thus, we propose a Gated State Network which manipulates the state information flow with sequential characteristics. We also incorporate a Focal Adaptive Attention Network which utilizes a Gaussian distribution to concentrate the attention distribution to a predicted focal position and its neighborhood. Experimental results on WMT'14 English-German and WMT'17 Chinese-English translation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB In this paper, we address the problem of learning better word representations for neural machine translation (NMT). We propose a novel approach to NMT model training based on coarse-to-fine learning paradigm, which is able to infer better NMT model parameters for a wide range of less-frequent words in the vocabulary. To this end, our proposed method first groups source and target words into a set of hierarchical clusters, then a sequence of NMT models are learned based on it with growing cluster granularity. Each subsequent model inherits model parameters from its previous one and refines them with finer-grained word-cluster mapping. Experimental results on public data sets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms baseline attention-based NMT model on Chinese-English and English-French translation tasks.

SO IEEJ TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING
AB The identification of terms in scientific and patent documents is a crucial issue for applications like information retrieval, text categorization, and also for machine translation. This paper describes a method to improve Chinese-Japanese statistical machine translation of patents by re-tokenizing the training corpus with aligned bilingual multi-word terms. We automatically extract multi-word terms from monolingual corpora by combining statistical and linguistic filtering methods. An automatic alignment method is used to identify corresponding terms. The most promising bilingual multi-word terms are extracted by setting some threshold on translation probabilities and further filtering by considering the components of the bilingual multi-word terms in characters as well as the ratio of their lengths in words. We also use kanji (Japanese)-hanzi (Chinese) character conversion to confirm and extract more promising bilingual multi-word terms. We obtain a high quality of correspondence with 93% in bilingual term extraction and a significant improvement of 1.5 BLEU score in a translation experiment.

The Keynote Lecture will discuss opportunities and challenges of this computational technology. In particular, the focus will be made on identification of language pair phenomena and their applications to building holistic language model which is a novel tool for processing machine translation, supporting professional translations, evaluation of translingual systems efficiency and also for improving the process of teaching foreign languages regardless of the level of students' proficiency. Some components incorporated to machine translation systems rely specifically on language-pair phenomena like for example language recognizer, or word deliminer. Nowadays, declarative programming is becoming widely used just for describing language pair phenomena by graphical formalism. Translation irreversibility represents a unique language and system independent asymmetrical translation innovative technology, which will be presented during the Keynote lecture.

This special issue focuses on views and visions of translation technology teaching (TTT), an increasingly important aspect of translation pedagogy. The first contribution is a bibliometric study of TTT publications both in English and Chinese, revealing the state of the art of TTT by presenting different research methods and focuses in different academic communities. Next, Sanchez Ramos demonstrates how machine translation and post-editing have been taught to improve the efficiency of public service interpreting and translation. Kodura describes an online course in translation technology on the basis of action research methodology. Lu Sha et al. examine the positive effects of anonymous online peer feedback in a computer-assisted translation (CAT) course. Finally, the last two empirical studies construct a Knowing-Acting Translation Curriculum (KATC) and a competence framework for interpreting technology, highlighting trainees' technological competence. These six articles not only present ways to teach translation technology, but also underline the need of developing higher-order technological competence in the process of educating human translators with a global vision.

SO FOREIGN LANGUAGE ANNALS
AB This article addresses a key pedagogical issue of our time: the widespread yet generally unwelcome presence of machine translation (MT) in the language classroom. Studies have repeatedly shown that L2 students consult the most widely used translation tool, Google Translate (GT), in spite of the fact that its use is frowned upon by second language (L2) instructors. Even so, academic honesty violations are not always reported, nor is there a consensus on whether the use of MT constitutes a form of cheating. Recognizing the omnipresence of GT in L2 student work, this article examines current research on the use of MT, highlights the strengths and limitations of this technology, explores 21st-century pedagogical solutions designed to harness the capabilities of both MT and alternative technologies, and suggests venues for future research with the goal of ensuring learners' academic growth in line with ACTFL's Can-Do Statements for Intercultural Communication.

AB Dynamic binary translation technology always chooses basic blocks as the unit of translation and execution, so when context switches are frequently occurring between translation and execution, current states of source machine (such as temporary variable) must be saved in some place for reusing purpose.
   In traditional dynamic binary translation technology, the source machines' states are always mapped onto target machines by using their available resources. Usually, mapping source registers onto target memory is such a convenient and easy method that almost all binary translators select the strategy without taking the fact that target registers may be fewer than source registers into account, thus leads to large numbers of nonsensical load/store operations when context switches are occurring.
   While mapping source registers directly onto target registers is an intuitively good optimization approach, this approach hardly gets any performance improvement in some translators such as QEMU. This paper has a study on the QEMU's register mapping mechanism, and proposes an improved translating mechanism. A new direction of register optimization is put forward as well.

AB An 'unknown' is defined as a word for which there is no entry in the dictionary used by the translation system. In general, a text may contain several unknowns. These words may be names, acronyms, abbreviations, terminology or foreign words. It is a common practice in India to mix the words of English in Hindi and other Indian languages and vice-versa. However, the grammatical rules in construction of gender, number, verb-normalization or forms, conform to that for the language used irrespective of their origin. This gives rise to a frequent encounter of unknown words in day-to-day communication. A machine translation system has to provide mechanism for handling such unknowns. Spelling mistakes is yet another source that contributes to the unknowns. In this paper we describe a strategy being adopted in our system for machine aided translation from English to Hindi. No attempt has been made to expand the vocabulary by deriving their meaning. Instead, once an unknown is identified, a transliteration in Hindi with appropriate suffixes or appendage is used to substitute for their meaning. We use predictive parsing and a number of heuristics to identify the type of unknown.

AB Through the development of neural machine translation, the quality of machine translation systems has been improved significantly. By exploiting advancements in deep learning, systems are now able to better approximate the complex mapping from source sentences to target sentences. But with this ability, new challenges also arise. An example is the translation of partial sentences in low-latency speech translation. Since the model has only seen complete sentences in training, it will always try to generate a complete sentence, though the input may only be a partial sentence. We show that NMT systems can be adapted to scenarios where no task-specific training data is available. Furthermore, this is possible without losing performance on the original training data. We achieve this by creating artificial data and by using multi-task learning. After adaptation, we are able to reduce the number of corrections displayed during incremental output construction by 45%, without a decrease in translation quality.

Specifically, we describe techniques to retain the prominence patterns of the source language utterance through the translation pipeline and impose this information during speech synthesis in the target language. We first present an analysis of word focus across languages to motivate the problem of transfer. We then propose an approach for training an appropriate transfer function for intonation on a parallel speech corpus in the two languages within which the translation is carried out. We present our analysis and experiments on English <-> Portuguese and English <-> German language pairs and evaluate the proposed transformation techniques through objective measures.

TI Context-based Translation for the Out of Vocabulary Words Applied to
   Hindi-English Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval
SO IETE TECHNICAL REVIEW
AB Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR) provides flexibility to users to query in their regional (source) languages regardless the target documents languages. CLIR uses trending translation techniques Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) and Neural Machine Translation (NMT). SMT and NMT achieve good results for foreign languages but not for Indian languages due to non-absoluteness of the parallel corpus. Source language user queries may contain the Out Of Vocabulary (OOV) words which are not present in the parallel corpus such words may be skipped without performing translation by SMT. In this paper, a context-based translation algorithm is proposed to translate the OOV words by utilizing two unlabeled & unrelated large raw corpora (in source and target language) and a small bi-lingual parallel corpus. Since SMT performs better than NMT for Hindi to English translation as per the literature, therefore, experimental results are evaluated for FIRE datasets against baseline SMT. The proposed algorithm improves evaluation measures, Recall up to 6.04% (0.8785) for FIRE 2010 and up to 3.96% (0.7365) for FIRE 2011, & Mean Average Precision (MAP) up to 14.37% (0.3239) for FIRE 2010 and up to 5.46% (0.1988) for FIRE 2011, in comparison to the baseline SMT which achieves 0.8284 and 0.7084 Recall for FIRE 2010 and 2011, & 0.2832 and 0.1885 MAP for FIRE 2010 and 2011. An analysis for the number of OOV words shows that the proposed algorithm reduces the number of OOV more effectively, up to 0.81% for FIRE 2010 and 1.73% for FIRE 2011.

AB This paper investigates hybrid representational unit in statistical machine translation from Classical to Modern Chinese where the basic unit of Modern Chinese is mixture of Chinese characters and words while characters unit for Classical Chinese. We explore several approaches to hybrid the characters and words in SMT. the best method achieves gains of 0.33 BLEU points or 1.2% relative over the best SMT baseline system which is modeled by different representational granularities. Further more, we find changing distortion limit in SMT has a relatively small effect on enhancing the quality of our hybrid character-words unit system.

AB Synchronous processing between different languages is critical to meet the demands of today's increasingly globalized environment. Unfortunately, it is still not a substantive industry, and this hi - tech industry is not only highly knowledge & technology intensive but also highly capital & management intensive. Aiming at the problems existing in the industrialization process of China's machine translation, this paper tries to discuss the international capital operation strategy of China language information processing and machine (with the assistance of manpower) translation industry, in terms of financing and capital operation, management and evaluation, market segmentation and internationalization. Focuses are also put on the developing mode.

AB This paper proposes a variation of synchronous grammar based on the formalism of context-free grammar by generalizing the first component of productions that models the source text, named Constraint-based Synchronous Grammar (CSG). Unlike other synchronous grammars, CSG allows multiple target productions to be associated to a single source production rule, which can be used to guide a parser to infer different possible translational equivalences for a recognized input string according to the feature constraints of symbols in the pattern. Furthermore, CSG is augmented with independent rewriting that allows expressing discontinuous constituents in the inference rules. It turns out that such grammar is more expressive to model the translational equivalences of parallel texts for machine translation, and in this paper, we propose the use of CSG as a basis for building a machine translation (MT) system for Portuguese to Chinese translation.

The studies carried out to compare the morphological and syntactic rules of the Kazakh and Turkish languages prove their closeness by structure. In this respect, we can assume that taking into account sentiment in machine translation for these combinations of languages will give a good result at preserving the text meaning.

AB Named Entity (NE) Translation is a challenging problem in Machine Translation (MT). Most of the training bi-text corpora for MT lack enough samples of NEs to cover the wide variety of contexts NEs can appear in. In this paper, we present a technique to translate NEs based on their NE types in addition to a phrase-based translation model. Our NE translation model is based on a syntax-based system similar to [1]; but we produce syntax-based rules with non-terminals as NE types instead of general non-terminals. Such class-based rules allow us to better generalize the context NEs. We show that our proposed method obtains an improvement of 0.66 BLEU score absolute as well as 0.26% in F-1-measure over the baseline of phrase-based model in NE test set.

TI Evaluating the effectiveness of machine translation of audio
   description: the results of two pilot studies in the English-Dutch
   language pair
SO TRADUMATICA-TRADUCCIO I TECNOLOGIES DE LA INFORMACIO I LA COMUNICACIO
AB The field of translation is undergoing various profound changes. On the one hand it is being thoroughly reshaped by the advent and constant improvement of new technologies. On the other hand, new forms of translation are starting to see the light of day in the wake of social and legal developments that require that products and content that are created, are accessible for everybody. One of these new forms of translation, is audio description (AD), a service that is aimed at making audiovisual content accessible to people with sight loss. New legislation requires that this content is accessible by 2025, which constitutes a tremendous task given the limited number of people that are at present trained as audio describers. A possible solution would be to use machine translation to translate existing audio descriptions into different languages. Since AD is characterized by short sentences and simple, concrete language, it could be a good candidate for machine translation. In the present study, we want to test this hypothesis for the English-Dutch language pair. Three 30 minute AD excerpts of different Dutch movies that were originally audio described in English, were translated into Dutch using DeepL. The translations were analysed using the harmonized DQF-MQM error typology and taking into account the specific multimodal nature of the source text and the intersemiotic dimension of the original audio description process. The analysis showed that the MT output had a relatively high error rate, particularly in the categories of Accuracy - mistranslation and Fluency - grammar. This seems to indicate that extensive post-editing will be needed, before the text can be used in a professional context.

AB Neural machine translation, which achieves near human-level performance in some languages, strongly relies on the large amounts of parallel sentences, which hinders its applicability to low-resource language pairs. Recent works explore the possibility of unsupervised machine translation with monolingual data only, leading to much lower accuracy compared with the supervised one. Observing that weakly paired bilingual documents are much easier to collect than bilingual sentences, e.g., from Wikipedia, news websites or books, in this paper, we investigate training translation models with weakly paired bilingual documents. Our approach contains two components. 1) We provide a simple approach to mine implicitly bilingual sentence pairs from document pairs which can then be used as supervised training signals. 2) We leverage the topic consistency of two weakly paired documents and learn the sentence translation model by constraining the word distribution-level alignments. We evaluate our method on weakly paired documents from Wikipedia on six tasks, the widely used WMT16 German$English, WMT13 Spanish$English and WMT16 Romanian$English translation tasks. We obtain 24:1/30:3, 28:1/27:6 and 30:1/27:6 BLEU points separately, outperforming previous results by more than 5 BLEU points in each direction and reducing the gap between unsupervised translation and supervised translation up to 50%

TI The Role of Machine Translation Quality Estimation in the Post-Editing
   Workflow
SO INFORMATICS-BASEL
AB As Machine Translation (MT) becomes increasingly ubiquitous, so does its use in professional translation workflows. However, its proliferation in the translation industry has brought about new challenges in the field of Post-Editing (PE). We are now faced with a need to find effective tools to assess the quality of MT systems to avoid underpayments and mistrust by professional translators. In this scenario, one promising field of study is MT Quality Estimation (MTQE), as this aims to determine the quality of an automatic translation and, indirectly, its degree of post-editing difficulty. However, its impact on the translation workflows and the translators' cognitive load is still to be fully explored. We report on the results of an impact study engaging professional translators in PE tasks using MTQE. To assess the translators' cognitive load we measure their productivity both in terms of time and effort (keystrokes) in three different scenarios: translating from scratch, post-editing without using MTQE, and post-editing using MTQE. Our results show that good MTQE information can improve post-editing efficiency and decrease the cognitive load on translators. This is especially true for cases with low MT quality.

AB Although many social media sites now provide machine translation (MT) for foreign language posts, translation of a post may not suffice to support understanding of, and engagement with, that post. We present SenseTrans, a tool that provides emotional and contextual annotations generated by natural language analysis in addition to machine translation. We evaluated SenseTrans in a laboratory experiment in which native English speakers browsed five Facebook profiles in foreign languages. One group used the SenseTrans interface while the other group used MT alone. Participants using SenseTrans reported significantly greater understanding of the posts, and greater willingness to engage with the posts. However, no additional cognitive load was associated with using an interface that provided more information. These results provide promising support for the idea of using computational tools to annotate communication to support multilingual sense making and interaction on social media.

TI ParaMed: a parallel corpus for English-Chinese translation in the

SO BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING
AB Background: Biomedical language translation requires multi-lingual fluency as well as relevant domain knowledge. Such requirements make it challenging to train qualified translators and costly to generate high-quality translations. Machine translation represents an effective alternative, but accurate machine translation requires large amounts of in-domain data. While such datasets are abundant in general domains, they are less accessible in the biomedical domain. Chinese and English are two of the most widely spoken languages, yet to our knowledge, a parallel corpus does not exist for this language pair in the biomedical domain.
   Description: We developed an effective pipeline to acquire and process an English-Chinese parallel corpus from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). This corpus consists of about 100,000 sentence pairs and 3,000,000 tokens on each side. We showed that training on out-of-domain data and fine-tuning with as few as 4000 NEJM sentence pairs improve translation quality by 25.3 (13.4) BLEU for en -> zh (zh -> en) directions. Translation quality continues to improve at a slower pace on larger in-domain data subsets, with a total increase of 33.0 (24.3) BLEU for en -> zh (zh -> en) directions on the full dataset.

AB Text correction after automatic speech recognition (ASR) is an important method to improve the speech recognition system. We regard the speech error correction as a translation task-from the language of bad Chinese to the language of good Chinese. We propose a speech recognition error correction algorithm based on neural machine translation (NMT) model. The algorithm is characterized by Chinese Pinyin coding, using a multilayer convolutional encoder-decoder with attention neural network. In the WeChat speech transcription data set we collected, our model substantially outperforms all prior neural approaches on this data set as well as the strong statistical machine translation-based systems. Our analysis shows the superiority of convolutional neural networks in capturing the local context via attention and thereby improving the coverage in speech transcription errors. By boosting multiple modes, using data augmentation and 3-gram language model tricks, our novel algorithm makes the error rate on the test set decreased by 26.2% on average. Our results show that using a multilayer convolutional encoder-decoder with Pinyin feature is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in text correction after speech recognition.

AB After its introduction, the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) quickly became the gold standard for the task of neural machine translation. A major advantage of the Transformer compared to previous architectures is the faster training speed achieved by complete parallelization across timesteps due to the use of attention over recurrent layers. However, this also leads to one of the biggest problems of the Transformer, namely the quadratic time and memory complexity with respect to the input length. In this work we adapt the locality-sensitive hashing approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) to self-attention in the Transformer, we extended it to cross-attention and apply this memory efficient framework to sentence- and document-level machine translation. Our experiments show that the LSH attention scheme for sentence-level comes at the cost of slightly reduced translation quality. For document-level NMT we are able to include much bigger context sizes than what is possible with the baseline Transformer. However, more context does neither improve translation quality nor improve scores on targeted test suites.

AB State-of-the-art multilingual machine translation relies on a shared encoder-decoder. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach based on language-specific encoder-decoders, which can be easily extended to new languages by learning their corresponding modules. To establish a common interlingua representation, we simultaneously train N initial languages. Our experiments show that the proposed approach improves over the shared encoder-decoder for the initial languages and when adding new languages, without the need to retrain the remaining modules. All in all, our work closes the gap between shared and language-specific encoder-decoders, advancing toward modular multilingual machine translation systems that can be flexibly extended in lifelong learning settings.

AB In Chinese patent texts, prepositional phrases(PP) are quite long with complicated structures. The correct identification of PP is very important for sentences parsing and reordering in machine translation. However, existing statistical and rule-based methods perform poorly in identifying these phrases because of their unobvious boundaries and special structures. Therefore, we present a method based on semantic analysis. Chinese prepositions are divided into two categories due to their semantic functions, and more contextual features are employed to identify the phrase boundaries and syntax levels. After integrating into a patent MT system, our method has effectively improved the parsing result of source language.

AB Accurate terminology translation is crucial for ensuring the practicality and reliability of neural machine translation (NMT) systems. To address this, lexically constrained NMT explores various methods to ensure pre-specified words and phrases appear in the translation output. However, in many cases, those methods are studied on general domain corpora, where the terms are mostly uni- and bi-grams (>98%). In this paper, we instead tackle a more challenging setup consisting of domain-specific corpora with much longer n-gram and highly specialized terms. Inspired by the recent success of masked span prediction models, we propose a simple and effective training strategy that achieves consistent improvements on both terminology and sentence-level translation for three domain-specific corpora in two language pairs.

AB Syntactic structure has long been argued to be potentially useful for enforcing accurate word alignment and improving generalization performance of machine translation. Unfortunately, existing wisdom demonstrates its significance by considering only the syntactic structure of source tokens, neglecting the rich structural information from target tokens and the structural similarity between the source and target sentences. In this work, we propose to incorporate the syntactic structure of both source and target tokens into the encoder-decoder framework, tightly correlating the internal logic of word alignment and machine translation for multi-task learning. Particularly, we won't leverage any annotated syntactic graph of the target side during training, so we introduce Dynamic Graph Convolution Networks (DGCN) on observed target tokens to sequentially and simultaneously generate the target tokens and the corresponding syntactic graphs, and further guide the word alignment. On this basis, Hierarchical Graph Random Walks (HGRW) are performed on the syntactic graphs of both source and target sides, for incorporating structured constraints on machine translation outputs. Experiments on four publicly available language pairs verify that our method is highly effective in capturing syntactic structure in different languages, consistently outperforming baselines in alignment accuracy and demonstrating promising results in translation quality.

TI Exploring the use of online machine translation for independent language
   learning
SO RESEARCH IN LEARNING TECHNOLOGY
AB The free availability of online machine translation (OMT) on the Internet via computers, tablets and smartphones makes it convenient for use by language students of all levels. Google Translate has been widely listed as an independent language learning (ILL) resource and we cannot deny its role for ongoing education.
   We are aware of the fact that this developing piece of technology was not designed with language learning in mind and, as a consequence, has limited current abilities depending on the language pair, language direction, genre, etc. However, as educators, we cannot help but wonder how the students use it independently and what pedagogical implications this may have in the language class.
   This study sets to analyse how language learners assess the usefulness of machine translation output and what they think about the use of OMT (in combination with other online language resources) for oral and written comprehension and production (e.g. writing and translation). This will help determining whether its use by language learners can be counterproductive or whether, if used wisely, can assist ILL and help boosting language instant communication.

TI A Bayesian Model of Transliteration and Its Human Evaluation When
   Integrated into a Machine Translation System
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB The contribution of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, we conduct a large-scale real-world evaluation of the effectiveness of integrating an automatic transliteration system with a machine translation system. A human evaluation is usually preferable to an automatic evaluation, and in the case of this evaluation especially so, since the common machine translation evaluation methods are affected by the length of the translations they are evaluating, often being biassed towards translations in terms of their length rather than the information they convey. We evaluate our transliteration system on data collected in field experiments conducted all over Japan. Our results conclusively show that using a transliteration system can improve machine translation quality when translating unknown words. Our second contribution is to propose a novel Bayesian model for unsupervised bilingual character sequence segmentation of corpora for transliteration. The system is based on a Dirichlet process model trained using Bayesian inference through blocked Gibbs sampling implemented using an efficient forward filtering/backward sampling dynamic programming algorithm. The Bayesian approach is able to overcome the overfitting problem inherent in maximum likelihood training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our Bayesian segmentation by using it to build a translation model for a phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) system trained to perform transliteration by monotonic transduction from character sequence to character sequence. The Bayesian segmentation was used to construct a phrase-table and we compared the quality of this phrase-table to one generated in the usual manner by the state-of-the-art GIZA++ word alignment process used in combination with phrase extraction heuristics from the MOSES statistical machine translation system, by using both to perform transliteration generation within an identical framework. In our experiments on English-Japanese data from the NEWS2010 transliteration generation shared task, we used our technique to bilingually co-segment the training corpus. We then derived a phrase-table from the segmentation from the sample at the final iteration of the training procedure, and the resulting phrase-table was used to directly substitute for the phrase-table extracted by using GIZA++/MOSES. The phrase-table resulting from our Bayesian segmentation model was approximately 30% smaller than that produced by the SMT system's training procedure, and gave an increase in transliteration quality measured in terms of both word accuracy and F-score.

TI Adversarial Training for Unknown Word Problems in Neural Machine
   Translation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB Nearly all of the work in neural machine translation (NMT) is limited to a quite restricted vocabulary, crudely treating all other words the same as an < unk > symbol. For the translation of language with abundant morphology, unknown (UNK) words also come from the misunderstanding of the translation model to the morphological changes. In this study, we explore two ways to alleviate the UNK problem in NMT: a new generative adversarial network (added value constraints and semantic enhancement) and a preprocessing technique that mixes morphological noise. The training process is like a win-win game in which the players are three adversarial sub models (generator, filter, and discriminator). In this game, the filter is to emphasize the discriminator's attention to the negative generations that contain noise and improve the training efficiency. Finally, the discriminator cannot easily discriminate the negative samples generated by the generator with filter and human translations. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves over several strong baseline models across various language pairs and the newly emerged Mongolian-Chinese task is state-of-the-art.

AB Noisy or non-standard input text can cause disastrous mistranslations in most modern Machine Translation (MT) systems, and there has been growing research interest in creating noise-robust MT systems. However, as of yet there are no publicly available parallel corpora of with naturally occurring noisy inputs and translations, and thus previous work has resorted to evaluating on synthetically created datasets. In this paper, we propose a benchmark dataset for Machine Translation of Noisy Text (MTNT), consisting of noisy comments on Reddit(1) and professionally sourced translations. We commissioned translations of English comments into French and Japanese, as well as French and Japanese comments into English, on the order of 7k-37k sentences per language pair. We qualitatively and quantitatively examine the types of noise included in this dataset, then demonstrate that existing MT models fail badly on a number of noise-related phenomena, even after performing adaptation on a small training set of in-domain data. This indicates that this dataset can provide an attractive testbed for methods tailored to handling noisy text in MT2.

SO CIRCULO DE LINGUISTICA APLICADA A LA COMUNICACION
AB This paper provides a review of some machine translation (MT) systems, as well as the most common problems we encounter when using machine translation to translate self-contained lexical units out of context. The focus is to identify the limitations of linguistic MT engines and to consider whether it is necessary to incorporate lexicographic data into these systems, to improve their performance. To this end, we will take a practical approach and use Google Translator, Bing Microsoft Translator and DeepL to translate selfcontained lexical units. We will then evaluate their performance by comparing the results with those we would have obtained had we consulted bilingual dictionaries for the same tasks. We will conclude that the quality of the output generated by MT engines is not sufficiently accurate; in general, the lexicographic data found in many bilingual dictionaries online provides more precise and comprehensive lexicographic information to satisfy the user's communicative needs.

TI Post-Editing Machine Translation As an FSL Exercise
SO PORTA LINGUARUM
AB This is the second half of a study on the advisability of having undergraduates perform an exercise in post-editing (PE) on output from machine translation (MT). After a sketch of its chequered history, I take up the various ways in which students could be introduced to MT, and conclude that PE is the most useful, mainly because it makes them aware of MT's limitations and fundamental language properties underlying these limitations. Through a review of the literature on PE practices and challenges, especially psycho-linguistic study by Krings (2001), I highlight crucial differences between professional PE and our pedagogical experiment. An error analysis of the student PE results (English to French) is then compared with analyses of the MT input, student translations of the same text from scratch, and parallel results from the initial, French-to-English experiment. Finally, student comments on the exercise suggest that weaker students especially find it beneficial.

AB This paper investigates an extensive evaluation of combination techniques and presents a cascaded framework for combining multiple Machine Translation (MT) system outputs. A Word Transition Network (WTN) is constructed from an N -best list by aligning the hypotheses against an alignment reference, where the alignment is based on minimising an modified Translation Edit Rate (TER) with word or phrase reordering. The Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding techique is inverstigated for the selection of an appropriate alignment reference. Pairwise word alignment is created by an enhanced statistical alignment algorithm that explicitly models word reordering. Experimental results are presented based on three MT systems of Chinese-English translation outputs. It is shown that worthwhile improvements in translation performance can be obtained using the proposed framework.

AB We propose the use of pre-trained embeddings as features of a regression model for sentence-level quality estimation of machine translation. In our work we combine freely available BERT and LASER multilingual embeddings to train a neural-based regression model. In the second proposed method we use as an input features not only pre-trained embeddings, but also log probability of any machine translation (MT) system. Both methods are applied to several language pairs and are evaluated both as a classical quality estimation system (predicting the HTER score) as well as an MT metric (predicting human judgements of translation quality).

In general, there are still some shortcomings on current MT evaluation methods, mainly characterized by the subjectivity of human evaluation and the incapability of quantitative evaluation. On the other hand, applying the evaluation method of the error type analysis can quantify the evaluation results, but lacks the evaluation for the readability of the translation results.

AB We identify a number of aspects that can boost the performance of Neural Fuzzy Repair (NFR), an easy-to-implement method to integrate translation memory matches and neural machine translation (NMT). We explore various ways of maximising the added value of retrieved matches within the NFR paradigm for eight language combinations, using Transformer NMT systems. In particular, we test the impact of different fuzzy matching techniques, sub-word-level segmentation methods and alignment-based features on overall translation quality. Furthermore, we propose a fuzzy match combination technique that aims to maximise the coverage of source words. This is supplemented with an analysis of how translation quality is affected by input sentence length and fuzzy match score. The results show that applying a combination of the tested modifications leads to a significant increase in estimated translation quality over all baselines for all language combinations.

The experiments were carried out with Brazilian Portuguese (pt), English (en) and Spanish (es) texts in two parallel corpora: pt-en and pt-es. They were designed to investigate the relevance of two factors in the induction process, namely: (1) the coverage of linguistic resources used when preprocessing the training corpora and (2) the maximum length threshold (for transfer rules) used in the induction process. From these experiments, it is possible to conclude that both factors have an influence in the automatic learning of bilingual resources.

AB The purpose of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of offering a multilingual platform for text-to-sign translation, i.e., a solution where a machine translates digital contents in several spoken languages to several sign languages in scenarios such as Digital TV, Web and Cinema. This solution-called OpenSigns-is an open platform that has several common components for generic functionalities originating from the Suite VLibras, including the creation and manipulation of 3D animation models, and interchangeable mechanisms specific for each sign language, such as a text-to-gloss machine translation engine and a signs dictionary for each sign language. Our motivation is that the concentration of efforts and resources around a single solution could provide some state-of-the-art improvement, such as a standard solution for the industry and a greater functional flexibility for common components. In addition, we could share techniques and heuristics between the translation mechanisms, reducing the effort to make a new sign language available on the platform, which may further enhance digital inclusion and accessibility, especially for the poorest countries.

It also proves that systematic solutions to these problems can be found and implemented. The approach defended here for French and English can be applied to other languages or language pairs, and to other linguistic categories, and could thus contribute to the improvement of Machine Translation systems.

AB The task of fake news detection is to distinguish legitimate news articles that describe real facts from those which convey deceiving and fictitious information. As the fake news phenomenon is omnipresent across all languages, it is crucial to be able to efficiently solve this problem for languages other than English. A common approach to this task is supervised classification using features of various complexity. Yet supervised machine learning requires substantial amount of annotated data. For English and a small number of other languages, annotated data availability is much higher, whereas for the vast majority of languages, it is almost scarce. We investigate whether machine translation at its present state could be successfully used as an automated technique for annotated corpora creation and augmentation for fake news detection focusing on the English-Urdu language pair. We train a fake news classifier for Urdu on (1) the manually annotated dataset originally in Urdu and (2) the machine-translated version of an existing annotated fake news dataset originally in English. We show that at the present state of machine translation quality for the English-Urdu language pair, the fully automated data augmentation through machine translation did not provide improvement for fake news detection in Urdu.

TI AI in interpreting: Ethical considerations
SO ACROSS LANGUAGES AND CULTURES
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies have impacted on the language mediation market with the spread of machine translation (MT) and the creation of sub-tasks such as text preparation for translation and post-editing. Up until this time, the impact of machine interpretation on the interpretation profession cannot be felt to the same extent as that of MT on the translation profession. Technological advances, however, have not come to an end and nowadays fully-automated machine interpretation and AI-based computer assisted interpreting (CAI) tools are increasingly common in the interpreting profession. However, the use of AI and big data in interpreting raises several ethical questions in terms of data protection and confidentiality. The earliest references to MT date back to the 1930s. Despite this long history ethical considerations in MT have rarely been discussed in Translation Studies, and to our knowledge, they have not been discussed at all in Interpreting Studies. This article first examines how AI can be used in interpreting as well as the various tools already available, then discusses the ethical considerations raised by the use of AI in general and in interpreting in particular.

AB We report the results of the WMT19 shared task on Quality Estimation, i.e. the task of predicting the quality of the output of machine translation systems given just the source text and the hypothesis translations. The task includes estimation at three granularity levels: word, sentence and document. A novel addition is evaluating sentence-level QE against human judgments: in other words, designing MT metrics that do not need a reference translation. This year we include three language pairs, produced solely by neural machine translation systems. Participating teams from eight institutions submitted a variety of systems to different task variants and language pairs.

AB We propose Thai Sign to Thai Machine Translation (TSTMT), an alternative approach to machine translation which is used for translating from Thai sign language into Thai text. TSTMT performs the translation by recognizing an image sequence of signs as sign words and synthesizing a target sentence from those sign words. TSTMT represents a hybrid of image recognition and natural language processing techniques. This approach is comprised of seven modules which are straight forward and extendable.
   The applications of TSTMT can be used to facilitate learning in deaf people and to help them to communicate with hearing people via their own language. In this paper the idea and initial experiment are presented.

AB Interpreters facilitate multi-lingual meetings but the affordable set of languages is often smaller than what is needed. Automatic simultaneous speech translation can extend the set of provided languages. We investigate if such an automatic system should rather follow the original speaker, or an interpreter to achieve better translation quality at the cost of increased delay.
   To answer the question, we release Europarl Simultaneous Interpreting Corpus (ESIC), 10 hours of recordings and transcripts of European Parliament speeches in English, with simultaneous interpreting into Czech and German. We evaluate quality and latency of speaker-based and interpreter-based spoken translation systems from English to Czech. We study the differences in implicit simplification and summarization of the human interpreter compared to a machine translation system trained to shorten the output to some extent. Finally, we perform human evaluation to measure information loss of each of these approaches.

AB Neural machine translation (NMT) has recently achieved impressive results. A potential problem of the existing NMT algorithm, however, is that the decoding is conducted from left to right, without considering the right context. This paper proposes an two-stage approach to solve the problem. In the first stage, a conventional attention-based NMT system is used to produce a draft translation, and in the second stage, a novel double-attention NMT system is used to refine the translation, by looking at the original input as well as the draft translation. This drafting-and-refinement can obtain the right-context information from the draft, hence producing more consistent translations. We evaluated this approach using two Chinese-English translation tasks, one with 44k pairs and 1M pairs respectively. The experiments showed that our approach achieved positive improvements over the conventional NMT system: the improvements are 2.4 and 0.9 BLEU points on the small-scale and large-scale tasks, respectively.

AB We present a Chinese-English Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system based on dependency tree mappings. We use a state-of-the-art dependency parser to parse the English translation of the Penn Chinese Treebank to make it bilingual and then learn a tree-to-tree dependency mapping model. We also train a phrase-based translation model and collect a bilingual phrase lexicon to bootstrap a treelet translation model. For decoding, we use the same dependency parser on Chinese, using a log-linear framework to integrate the teamed translation model with a variety of dependency tree based probability models, and then find the best English dependency tree by dynamic programming. Finally the English tree is flattened to produce the translation. We evaluate our system on the 863 and NIST 2005 Chinese-English MT test data and find that the dependency-based model significantly outperforms Caravan, our phrase-based SMT system which participated in NIST 2006 and IWSLT 2006.

AB We propose a novel learning approach for statistical machine translation (SMT) that allows to extract supervision signals for structured learning from an extrinsic response to a translation input. We show how to generate responses by grounding SMT in the task of executing a semantic parse of a translated query against a database. Experiments on the GEO-QUERY database show an improvement of about 6 points in F1-score for responsebased learning over learning from references only on returning the correct answer from a semantic parse of a translated query. In general, our approach alleviates the dependency on human reference translations and solves the reachability problem in structured learning for SMT.

AB Multilingual neural machine translation aims at learning a single translation model for multiple languages. These jointly trained models often suffer from performance degradation on rich-resource language pairs. We attribute this degeneration to parameter interference. In this paper, we propose LaSS to jointly train a single unified multilingual MT model. LaSS learns Language Specific Sub-network (LaSS) for each language pair to counter parameter interference. Comprehensive experiments on IWSLT and WMT datasets with various Transformer architectures show that LaSS obtains gains on 36 language pairs by up to 1.2 BLEU. Besides, LaSS shows its strong generalization performance at easy adaptation to new language pairs and zero-shot translation. LaSS boosts zero-shot translation with an average of 8.3 BLEU on 30 language pairs.

AB Reordering poses a major challenge in machine translation (MT) between two languages with significant differences in word order. In this paper, we present a novel reordering approach utilizing sparse features based on dependency word pairs. Each instance of these features captures whether two words, which are related by a dependency link in the source sentence dependency parse tree, follow the same order or are swapped in the translation output. Experiments on Chinese-to-English translation show a statistically significant improvement of 1.21 BLEU point using our approach, compared to a state-of-the-art statistical MT system that incorporates prior reordering approaches.

AB We introduce translation error correction (TEC), the task of automatically correcting human-generated translations. Imperfections in machine translations (MT) have long motivated systems for improving translations post-hoc with automatic post-editing. In contrast, little attention has been devoted to the problem of automatically correcting human translations, despite the intuition that humans make distinct errors that machines would be well-suited to assist with, from typos to inconsistencies in translation conventions. To investigate this, we build and release the ACED corpus with three TEC datasets(1). We show that human errors in TEC exhibit a more diverse range of errors and far fewer translation fluency errors than the MT errors in automatic post-editing datasets, suggesting the need for dedicated TEC models that are specialized to correct human errors. We show that pre-training instead on synthetic errors based on human errors improves TEC F-score by as much as 5.1 points. We conducted a human-in-the-loop user study with nine professional translation editors and found that the assistance of our TEC system led them to produce significantly higher quality revised translations.

AB Neural machine translation models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory networks and the Transformer, are widely used in many translation tasks. Neural machine translation models often use the deep encoder and decoder as multiple layers to capture more semantic information. However, these models leverage the encoder top layer and decoder only when they process a sequence, which omits other layers' useful information. This paper, we propose an approach that includes two strategies. First, we propose a strategy called layer fusion to make full use of all layers. Then, we make the hierarchical interaction between the encoder and the decoder by using the output of each encoder layer as the part input of the corresponding decoder layer. We take the Transformer as an example in this work since it has achieved the best performance. The experimental results on the English and German translation data of WMT14 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and it is also applicable to other models.

AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has become a popular technology in recent years, and the RNN-based encoder-decoder model is its actual translation framework. However, it remains a major challenge for RNNs to handle long-range dependencies. To address this limitation, we propose a gated selfattentive encoder (GSAE) for NMT that aims to directly capture the dependency relationship between any two words of source-side regardless of their distance. The proposed GSAE gains access to a wider context and ensures the better representation in the encoder. We extensively evaluate the proposed model using three language pairs. Experiments on WMT'14 English-German and WMT'14 English-French tasks show that our shallow model achieves BLEU = 26.54 and BLEU = 38.94 respectively, which are comparable with the state-of-the-art deep models. On WMT'17 English-Chinese translation task, our GSAE-NMT outperforms two strong baselines by 1.61 and 1.15 BLEU points, respectively.

It's a present day need in this Information technology era to make available this information to the entire world in their understandable form i.e. in their natural language. Presently machine translation is attempted by many researchers for one to one language translation or for more than one language pair and with this to translate from any to any language requires huge parallel programs and corpus and major issue of huge training and testing period with various complexities like languages in concern exhibit a different structure, not all the words in one language have equivalent words in other languages, different ways in which sentences are put together, words with multiple meanings which results into ambiguity etc. This paper proposes an open frame work for multilingual machine translation with ambiguity resolution.

SO LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
AB This work aims to improve an N-gram-based statistical machine translation system between the Catalan and Spanish languages, trained with an aligned Spanish-Catalan parallel corpus consisting of 1.7 million sentences taken from El Peridico newspaper. Starting from a linguistic error analysis above this baseline system, orthographic, morphological, lexical, semantic and syntactic problems are approached using a set of techniques. The proposed solutions include the development and application of additional statistical techniques, text pre- and post-processing tasks, and rules based on the use of grammatical categories, as well as lexical categorization. The performance of the improved system is clearly increased, as is shown in both human and automatic evaluations of the system, with a gain of about 1.1 points BLEU observed in the Spanish-to-Catalan direction of translation, and a gain of about 0.5 points in the reverse direction. The final system is freely available online as a linguistic resource.

AB Current advances in machine translation (MT) increase the need for translators to switch from traditional translation to post-editing (PE) of machine-translated text, a process that saves time and reduces errors. This affects the design of translation interfaces, as the task changes from mainly generating text to correcting errors within otherwise helpful translation proposals. Since this paradigm shift offers potential for modalities other than mouse and keyboard, we present MMPE, the first prototype to combine traditional input modes with pen, touch, and speech modalities for PE of MT. The results of an evaluation with professional translators suggest that pen and touch interaction are suitable for deletion and reordering tasks, while they are of limited use for longer insertions. On the other hand, speech and multi-modal combinations of select & speech are considered suitable for replacements and insertions but offer less potential for deletion and reordering. Overall, participants were enthusiastic about the new modalities and saw them as good extensions to mouse & keyboard, but not as a complete substitute.

AB For many languages, the lack of sufficient parallel data to train translation models have resulted in using the monolingual data, source and target, through self-learning and back-translation respectively. Most works that implemented the self-learning approach utilized a quality estimation system to ensure that the resulting additional training data is of sufficient quality to improve the model. However, the quality estimation system may not be available for many low resource languages, restricting the implementation of such approach to a very few. This work proposes the utilization of the data selection technique as an alternative to quality estimation. The approach will ensure that the models will learn only from the data that is closer to the domain of the test set, improving the performance of the translation models. While this approach is applicable to many, if not all, languages, we obtained similar and, in some implementations, even better results (+0.53 BLEU) than the self-training approach that was implemented using the quality estimation system on low resource IWSLT'14 English-German dataset. We also showed that the proposed approach can be used to improve the performance of the back-translation approach, gaining +1.79 and +0.23 over standard back-translation and self-learning with quality estimation enhanced back-translation respectively.

AB Multilingual neural machine translation architectures mainly differ in the number of sharing modules and parameters applied among languages. In this paper, and from an algorithmic perspective, we explore whether the chosen architecture, when trained with the same data, influences the level of gender bias. Experiments conducted in three language pairs show that language-specific encoder-decoders exhibit less bias than the shared architecture. We propose two methods for interpreting and studying gender bias in machine translation based on source embeddings and attention. Our analysis shows that, in the language-specific case, the embeddings encode more gender information, and their attention is more diverted. Both behaviors help in mitigating gender bias.

The main contribution of our work is demonstration of machine translation of English to Sanskrit for simple sentences based on PLIL generated by AnglaBharati and Astadhyayi rules. Presently our translation system caters to affirmative, negative, interrogative, imperative, active and passive voice sentences. In our study, we have selected a set of nouns and verbs that represent different semantic categories besides a few adverbs and adjectives. We anticipate using a number of Sanskrit resources on Astadhyayi and morphological synthesis [2].

This extension allows the system to map from per frame acoustic features to word level representations by replacing the traditional encoder in the encoder-decoder architecture with a hierarchical encoder. Furthermore, we show that a system combining lexical and acoustic features significantly outperforms systems using only a single source of features on all measured punctuation marks. The combination of lexical and acoustic features achieves a significant improvement in F-Measure of 1.5 absolute over the purely lexical neural machine translation based system.

   PROCESSING
AB Machine translation (MT) systems have been built using numerous different techniques for bridging the language barriers. These techniques are broadly categorized into approaches like Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) and Neural Machine Translation (NMT). End-to-end NMT systems significantly outperform SMT in translation quality on many language pairs, especially those with the adequate parallel corpus. We report comparative experiments on baseline MT systems for Assamese to other Indo-Aryan languages (in both translation directions) using the traditional Phrase-Based SMT as well as some more successful NMT architectures, namely basic sequence-to-sequence model with attention, Transformer, and finetuned Transformer. The results are evaluated using the most prominent and popular standard automatic metric BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy), as well as other well-known metrics for exploring the performance of different baseline MT systems, since this is the first such work involving Assamese. The evaluation scores are compared for SMT and NMT models for the effectiveness of bi-directional language pairs involving Assamese and other Indo-Aryan languages (Bangla, Gujarati, Hindi, Marathi, Odia, Sinhalese, and Urdu). The highest BLEU scores obtained are for Assamese to Sinhalese for SMT (35.63) and the Assamese to Bangla for NMT systems (seq2seq is 50.92, Transformer is 50.01, and finetuned Transformer is 50.19). We also try to relate the results with the language characteristics, distances, family trees, domains, data sizes, and sentence lengths. We find that the effect of the domain is the most important factor affecting the results for the given data domains and sizes. We compare our results with the only existing MT system for Assamese (Bing Translator) and also with pairs involving Hindi.

TI Decoding Strategies for Improving Low-Resource Machine Translation
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Pre-processing and post-processing are significant aspects of natural language processing (NLP) application software. Pre-processing in neural machine translation (NMT) includes subword tokenization to alleviate the problem of unknown words, parallel corpus filtering that only filters data suitable for training, and data augmentation to ensure that the corpus contains sufficient content. Post-processing includes automatic post editing and the application of various strategies during decoding in the translation process. Most recent NLP researches are based on the Pretrain-Finetuning Approach (PFA). However, when small and medium-sized organizations with insufficient hardware attempt to provide NLP services, throughput and memory problems often occur. These difficulties increase when utilizing PFA to process low-resource languages, as PFA requires large amounts of data, and the data for low-resource languages are often insufficient. Utilizing the current research premise that NMT model performance can be enhanced through various pre-processing and post-processing strategies without changing the model, we applied various decoding strategies to Korean-English NMT, which relies on a low-resource language pair. Through comparative experiments, we proved that translation performance could be enhanced without changes to the model. We experimentally examined how performance changed in response to beam size changes and n-gram blocking, and whether performance was enhanced when a length penalty was applied. The results showed that various decoding strategies enhance the performance and compare well with previous Korean-English NMT approaches. Therefore, the proposed methodology can improve the performance of NMT models, without the use of PFA; this presents a new perspective for improving machine translation performance.

AB Machine translation (MT) enables a group of people who do not share a common language to work together as a team. Previous studies have investigated the characteristics of MT-mediated communication in laboratory settings and suggested various ways to improve it. Yet, few studies have investigated how MT is actually used outside the lab. We still lack an understanding of how MT is used in real-world settings, particularly when people use it in face-to-face situations. In this paper, we report on an ethnographic study of a multilingual children workshop using MT to communicate with each other in real world. We studied how children use various communication methods such as gesture and internet to compensate for the mistranslations of MT. For example, children tried to understand poorly translated messages by reading the alternative translations and used web browsers to search for pictures of unknown objects. Finally, we propose design implementations based on our findings.

AB State-of-the-art neural machine translation models generate a translation from left to right and every step is conditioned on the previously generated tokens. The sequential nature of this generation process causes fundamental latency in inference since we cannot generate multiple tokens in each sentence in parallel. We propose an attention-masking based model, called Disentangled Context (DisCo) transformer, that simultaneously generates all tokens given different contexts. The DisCo transformer is trained to predict every output token given an arbitrary subset of the other reference tokens. We also develop the parallel easy first inference algorithm, which iteratively refines every token in parallel and reduces the number of required iterations. Our extensive experiments on 7 translation directions with varying data sizes demonstrate that our model achieves competitive, if not better, performance compared to the state of the art in non-autoregressive machine translation while significantly reducing decoding time on average.

TI Minimum Bayes-Risk Phrase Table Pruning for Pivot-Based Machine
   Translation in Internet of Things
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Machine translation, which will be used widely in human-computer interaction services to Internet of Things (IoT), is a key technology in artificial intelligence field. This paper presents a minimum Bayes-risk (MBR) phrase table pruning method for pivot-based statistical machine translation (SMT). The SMT system requires a great amount of bilingual data to build a high-performance translation model. For some language pairs, such as Chinese-English, massive bilingual data are available on the web. However, for most language pairs, large-scale bilingual data are hard to obtain. Pivot-based SMT is proposed to solve the data scarcity problem: it introduces a pivot language to bridge the source language and the target language. Therefore, a source-target translation model based on well-trained source-pivot and pivot-target translation models can be derived with the pivot-based approach. However, due to the ambiguities of the pivot language, source and target phrases with different meanings may be wrongly matched. Consequently, the derived source-target phrase table may contain incorrect phrase pairs. To alleviate this problem, we apply the MBR method to prune the phrase table. The MBR pruning method removes the phrase pairs with the lowest risk from the phrase table. Experimental results on Europarl data show that the proposed method can both reduce the size of phrase tables and improve the performance of translations. This study also gives a useful reference to many IoT research field and smart web services.

AB Reproducible benchmarks are crucial in driving progress of machine translation research. However, existing machine translation benchmarks have been mostly limited to high-resource or well-represented languages. Despite an increasing interest in low-resource machine translation, there are no standardized reproducible benchmarks for many African languages, many of which are used by millions of speakers but have less digitized textual data. To tackle these challenges, we propose AFROMT, a standardized, clean, and reproducible machine translation benchmark for eight widely spoken African languages. We also develop a suite of analysis tools for system diagnosis taking into account unique properties of these languages. Furthermore, we explore the newly considered case of low-resource focused pretraining and develop two novel data augmentation-based strategies, leveraging word-level alignment information and pseudo-monolingual data for pretraining multilingual sequence-to-sequence models. We demonstrate significant improvements when pretraining on 11 languages, with gains of up to 2 BLEU points over strong baselines. We also show gains of up to 12 BLEU points over cross-lingual transfer baselines in data-constrained scenarios. All code and pretrained models will be released as further steps towards larger reproducible benchmarks for African languages.(1)

SO LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
AB In this paper, we tackle the problem of domain adaptation of statistical machine translation (SMT) by exploiting domain-specific data acquired by domain-focused crawling of text from the World Wide Web. We design and empirically evaluate a procedure for automatic acquisition of monolingual and parallel text and their exploitation for system training, tuning, and testing in a phrase-based SMT framework. We present a strategy for using such resources depending on their availability and quantity supported by results of a large-scale evaluation carried out for the domains of environment and labour legislation, two language pairs (English-French and English-Greek) and in both directions: into and from English. In general, machine translation systems trained and tuned on a general domain perform poorly on specific domains and we show that such systems can be adapted successfully by retuning model parameters using small amounts of parallel in-domain data, and may be further improved by using additional monolingual and parallel training data for adaptation of language and translation models. The average observed improvement in BLEU achieved is substantial at 15.30 points absolute.

AB Neural machine translation (NMT) has successfully redefined the state of the art in machine translation on several language pairs. One popular framework models the translation process end-to-end using attentional encoder-decoder architecture and treats each word in the vectors of intermediate representation. These embedding vectors are sensitive to the meaning of words and allow semantically similar words to be near each other in the vector spaces and share their statistical power. Unfortunately, the model often maps such similar words too closely, which complicates distinguishing them. Consequently, NMT systems often mistranslate words that seem natural in the context but do not reflect the content of the source sentence. Incorporating auxiliary information usually enhances the discriminability. In this research, we integrate acoustic information within NMT by multi-task learning. Here, our model learns how to embed and translate word sequences based on their acoustic and semantic differences by helping it choose the correct output word based on its meaning and pronunciation. Our experiment results show that our proposed approach provides more significant improvement than the standard text-based transformer NMT model in BLEU score evaluation.

AB Over the last few years two promising research directions in low-resource neural machine translation (NMT) have emerged. The first focuses on utilizing high-resource languages to improve the quality of low-resource languages via multilingual NMT. The second direction employs monolingual data with self-supervision to pre-tram translation models, followed by fine-tuning on small amounts of supervised data. In this work, we join these two lines of research and demonstrate the efficacy of monolingual data with self-supervision in multilingual NMT. We offer three major results: (i) Using monolingual data significantly boosts the translation quality of low resource languages in multilingual models. (ii) Self-supervision improves zero-shot translation quality in multilingual models. (iii) Leveraging monolingual data with self-supervision provides a viable path towards adding new languages to multilingual models, getting up to 33 BLEU on WMT ro-en translation without any parallel data or back-translation.

TI Multi-objective optimisation of real-valued parameters of a hybrid MT
   system using Genetic Algorithms
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS
AB In this paper, an automated method is proposed for optimising the real-valued parameters of a hybrid Machine Translation (MT) system that employs pattern recognition techniques together with extensive monolingual corpora in the target language from which statistical information is extracted. The absence of a parallel corpus prohibits the use of the training techniques traditionally employed in state-of-the-art Statistical Machine Translation systems.
   The proposed approach for fine-tuning the system parameters towards the generation of high-quality translations is based on a Genetic Algorithm and the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm SPEA2. In order to evaluate the translation quality, established MT automatic evaluation criteria are employed, such as BLEU and METEOR. Furthermore, various ways of combining these criteria are explored, in order to exploit each one's characteristics and evaluate the produced translations. The experimental results indicate the effectiveness of this approach, since the translation quality of the evaluation sentence sets used is substantially improved in all studied configurations, when compared to the output of the same system operating with manually-defined parameters. Out of all configurations, the multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, combining several MT evaluation metrics, are found to produce the highest quality translations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB Simultaneous speech translation aims to maintain translation quality while minimizing the delay between reading input and incrementally producing the output. We propose a new general-purpose prediction action which predicts future words in the input to improve quality and minimize delay in simultaneous translation. We train this agent using reinforcement learning with a novel reward function. Our agent with prediction has better translation quality and less delay compared to an agent-based simultaneous translation system without prediction.

AB In this paper, the unknown words processing method in Mongolian-Chinese neural machine translation based on the similarity model and based on the Mongolian-Chinese alignment dictionary are studied. The unknown words processing method based on the similarity model uses the word vector to capture the characteristics of word semantics and grammatical information, calculates the semantic similarity between the unknown words and the words in the vocabulary, and selects the words with the closest semantics to replace all the unknown words. The unknown word processing method based on the Mongolian-Chinese alignment dictionary is to replace the unknown words with the word alignment information. Finally, the original corpus and the new corpus replacing the unknown words are merged and Training model. The final experiment showed that the translation's BLEU value was increased by 0.95 percentage points in the Mongolian-Chinese translation task.

AB Is bias amplified when neural machine translation (NMT) models are optimized for speed and evaluated on generic test sets using BLEU? We investigate architectures and techniques commonly used to speed up decoding in Transformer-based models, such as greedy search, quantization, average attention networks (AANs) and shallow decoder models and show their effect on gendered noun translation. We construct a new gender bias test set, SimpleGEN, based on gendered noun phrases in which there is a single, unambiguous, correct answer. While we find minimal overall BLEU degradation as we apply speed optimizations, we observe that gendered noun translation performance degrades at a much faster rate.

AB This paper proposed a novel reordering model based on the reordering of source language chunks. This model is used as a preprocessing step of phrase-based translation models and could be well integrated with them. At the same time, as a chunk-based model, syntax information could be concerned in the process of reordering while the entire parsing of the source sentence is not required. Two experiments were carried out and the results showed that the proposed model could improve the performance of a phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) system greatly.

AB In its daily use, the Indonesian language is riddled with informality, that is, deviations from the standard in terms of vocabulary, spelling, and word order. On the other hand, current available Indonesian NLP models are typically developed with the standard Indonesian in mind. In this work, we address a style-transfer from informal to formal Indonesian as a low-resource machine translation problem. We build a new dataset of parallel sentences of informal Indonesian and its formal counterpart. We benchmark several strategies to perform style transfer from informal to formal Indonesian. We also explore augmenting the training set with artificial forward-translated data. Since we are dealing with an extremely low-resource setting, we find that a phrase-based machine translation approach outperforms the Transformer-based approach. Alternatively, a pre-trained GPT-2 fined-tuned to this task performed equally well but costs more computational resource. Our findings show a promising step towards leveraging machine translation models for style transfer. Our code and data are available in https://github.com/haryoa/stif-indonesia.

Particular attention is given to consideration of syntactic polysemy and ambiguity, and the mechanisms of polysemous structures presentation are proposed The decisions are worked out on the basis of projecting the functional values through the traditional categorial meanings of language units and structures. The syntactic polysemy is understood as the immediate realization of more than one categorial head meaning within the same language structure. The phenomenon of syntactic polysemy determines the possible multiple transfer scheme for a given language pattern. The system of multivariant transfer rules is designed to be further specified by machine learning methods.

TI Bayesian Word Alignment and Phrase Table Training for Statistical
   Machine Translation
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB In most phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) systems, the translation model relies on word alignment, which serves as a constraint for the subsequent building of a phrase table. Word alignment is usually inferred by GIZA++, which implements all the IBM models and HMM model in the framework of Expectation Maximum (EM). In this paper, we present a fully Bayesian inference for word alignment. Different from the EM approach, the Bayesian inference makes use of all possible parameter values rather than estimating a single parameter value, from which we expect a more robust inference. After inferring the word alignment, current SMT systems usually train the phrase table from Viterbi word alignment, which is prone to learn incorrect phrases due to the word alignment mistakes. To overcome this drawback, a new phrase extraction method is proposed based on multiple Gibbs samples from Bayesian inference for word alignment. Empirical results show promising improvements over baselines in alignment quality as well as the translation performance.

AB We consider the problem of multilingual unsupervised machine translation, translating to and from languages that only have monolingual data by using auxiliary parallel language pairs. For this problem the standard procedure so far to leverage the monolingual data is back-translation, which is computationally costly and hard to tune.
   In this paper we propose instead to use denoising adapters, adapter layers with a denoising objective, on top of pre-trained mBART-50. In addition to the modularity and flexibility of such an approach we show that the resulting translations are on-par with back-translating as measured by BLEU, and furthermore it allows adding unseen languages incrementally.

TI Human Evaluation of English-Irish Transformer-Based NMT
SO INFORMATION
AB In this study, a human evaluation is carried out on how hyperparameter settings impact the quality of Transformer-based Neural Machine Translation (NMT) for the low-resourced English-Irish pair. SentencePiece models using both Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and unigram approaches were appraised. Variations in model architectures included modifying the number of layers, evaluating the optimal number of heads for attention and testing various regularisation techniques. The greatest performance improvement was recorded for a Transformer-optimized model with a 16k BPE subword model. Compared with a baseline Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, a Transformer-optimized model demonstrated a BLEU score improvement of 7.8 points. When benchmarked against Google Translate, our translation engines demonstrated significant improvements. Furthermore, a quantitative fine-grained manual evaluation was conducted which compared the performance of machine translation systems. Using the Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) error taxonomy, a human evaluation of the error types generated by an RNN-based system and a Transformer-based system was explored. Our findings show the best-performing Transformer system significantly reduces both accuracy and fluency errors when compared with an RNN-based model.

TI Research on Cultural Translation Based on Neural Network
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB The translation of pragmatic meaning requires the processing of pragmatic implicit meaning, the translator's responsibility for the readers of the target language to understand the pragmatic meaning, and the domestication and foreignization of cultural images. The way of pragmatic language equivalence is domestication translation to achieve the fluency of language expression. The creation of foreignized translation in order to foster the equitable interchange and dissemination of culture, which is precisely the aim of cultural translation, is the equivalence of the pragmatic meaning of cultural imagery. Neural network (NN) machine translation technology (MTT) simulates the human brain nervous system. Based on deep learning technology, the whole sentence is used as the basic unit of translation, which greatly improves the accuracy of machine translation. This paper selects the relevant texts of Shaanxi's red tourism culture and uses the NN translation system to translate. It helps to improve the accuracy of the text translation of Shaanxi red tourism culture by analyzing the translation and providing a reference direction for further revision by neural translation users and promote the overseas dissemination of red culture. The part of the source language side that generates a vector representation of a dense and continuous sentence from the input corresponds to the encoder.

AB Multi-head attention advances neural machine translation by working out multiple versions of attention in different subspaces, but the neglect of semantic overlapping between subspaces increases the difficulty of translation and consequently hinders the further improvement of translation performance. In this paper, we employ capsule networks to comb the information from the multiple heads of the attention so that similar information can be clustered and unique information can be reserved. To this end, we adopt two routing mechanisms of Dynamic Routing and EM Routing, to fulfill the clustering and separating. We conducted experiments on Chinese-to-English and English-to-German translation tasks and got consistent improvements over the strong Transformer baseline.

AB In this paper, we present the approaches used by our NLP systems to automatically extract templates for example-based machine translation and pun generation. Our translation system is able to extract an average of 73.25% correct translation templates, resulting in a translation quality that has a low word error rate of 18% when the test document contains sentence patterns matching the training set, to a high 85% when the test document is different from the training corpus. Our pun generator is able to extract 69.2% usable templates, resulting in computer-generated puns that received an average score of 2.13 as compared to 2.7 for human-generated puns from user feedback.

TI Research on the Construction of a Bidirectional Neural Network Machine
   Translation Model Fused with Attention Mechanism
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB With the development of deep learning, neural machine translation has also been paid attention and developed by researchers. Especially in the application of encoder-decoder in natural language processing, the translation performance has been significantly improved. In 2014, the attention mechanism was used in neural machine translation, the performance of translation was greatly improved, and the interpretability of the model was increased. This research proposes a research idea of sparsemax combined with AAN machine translation model and conducts multiple ablation experiments for experimental verification. This chapter first studies the problem of insufficient sparse normalization when generating target words in the attention mechanism and studies the neural machine translation model incorporating the sparse normalization calculation method. It solves the problem of inductive bias in the data transfer process of related sub-layers in the model. By combining the strategy of sparse normalization, the similarity value of related word vectors can be obtained more accurately when aligning words, which is more convenient for this chapter. Calculate and analyze the specific principles of the model. In addition, when the model faces a large vocabulary in the decoding stage, too many weights of scattered vocabulary vectors are not conducive to the generation of correct target values. After using the sparse normalization strategy, it can reduce the number of inconveniences. The calculation between related words optimizes the classification accuracy of the target vocabulary. In this chapter, aiming at the waste of the transformer's decoder calculation in the inference stage, the average attention structure is used to replace the attention calculation layer of the first layer of the decoder part of the original model. Each moment is only related to the previous moment, which alleviates the waste of computing resources.

AB One of the weaknesses of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is in handling lowfrequency and ambiguous words, which we refer as troublesome words. To address this problem, we propose a novel memoryenhanced NMT method. First, we investigate different strategies to define and detect the troublesome words. Then, a contextual memory is constructed to memorize which target words should be produced in what situations. Finally, we design a hybrid model to dynamically access the contextual memory so as to correctly translate the troublesome words. The extensive experiments on Chineseto-English and English-to-German translation tasks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the strong baseline models in translation quality, especially in handling troublesome words.

We examine the impact of disfluencies from broadcast conversation data on our hierarchical phrase-based SMT system and implement automatic disfluency removal approaches for cleansing the MT input. We evaluate the efficacy of proposed approaches and investigate the impact of disfluency removal on SMT performance across different disfluency types. We show that for translating Mandarin broadcast conversational transcripts into English, our automatic disfluency removal approaches could produce significant improvement in BLEU and TER.

AB We propose MEE, an approach for automatic Machine Translation (MT) evaluation which leverages the similarity between embeddings of words in candidate and reference sentences to assess translation quality. Unigrams are matched based on their surface forms, root forms and meanings which aids to capture lexical, morphological and semantic equivalence. We perform experiments for MT from English to four Indian Languages (Telugu, Marathi, Bengali and Hindi) on a robust dataset comprising simple and complex sentences with good and bad translations. Further, it is observed that the proposed metric correlates better with human judgements than the existing widely used metrics.

AB A good decoding algorithm is critical to the success of any statistical machine translation system. The decoder's job is to find the translation that is most likely according to set of previously learned parameters (and a formula for combining them). Since the space of possible translations is extremely large, typical decoding algorithms are only able to examine a portion of it, thus risking to miss good solutions. In this paper, we compare the speed and output quality of a traditional stack-based decoding algorithm with two new decoders: a fast greedy decoder and a slow but optimal decoder that treats decoding as an integer-programming optimization problem.

AB Many web applications provide a fully automatic machine translation service, and users can easily access and understand the information they are interested in. However, the services still have inaccurate results when translating technical terms. Therefore, we suggest a new method that collects reliable translations of technical terms between Korean and English. To collect the pairs, we utilize the metadata of Korean scientific papers and make a new statistical model to adapt the metadata characteristics appropriately. The collected Korean-English pairs are evaluated in terms of reliability and compared with the results of Google translator. Through evaluation and comparison, we confirm that this research can produce highly reliable data and improve the translation quality of technical terms.

AB In this paper, we focus on explaining the process of the Korean multiple nominative case construction through using WordNet. Multiple nominative case constructions, in which the nominative case marker -i/-ga is allocated not only to subject but to other syntactic functions, generate much confusion and make the Korean-English Machine Translation, a process mainly depending on the case marker with words, the more difficult process. Also, the predicates in the multiple nominative case constructions can sometimes be ambiguous. To overcome those difficulties, we classified the multiple nominative case constructions into 4 types by argument analysis and then processed them in Korean-English Machine Translation by using WordNet.

AB Directly translating from speech to text using an end-to-end approach is still challenging for many language pairs due to insufficient data. Although pretraining the encoder parameters using the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) task improves the results in low resource settings, attempting to use pretrained parameters from the Neural Machine Translation (NMT) task has been largely unsuccessful in previous works. In this paper, we will show that by using an adversarial regularizer, we can bring the encoder representations of the ASR and NMT tasks closer even though they are in different modalities, and how this helps us effectively use a pretrained NMT decoder for speech translation.

AB In this work, we analyze the robustness of neural machine translation systems towards grammatical perturbations in the source. In particular, we focus on morphological inflection related perturbations. While this has been recently studied for English -> French translation (MORPHEUS) (Tan et al., 2020), it is unclear how this extends to Any -> English translation systems. We propose MORPHEUS-MULTILINGUAL that utilizes UniMorph dictionaries to identify morphological perturbations to source that adversely affect the translation models. Along with an analysis of stateof-the-art pretrained MT systems, we train and analyze systems for 11 language pairs using the multilingual TED corpus (Qi et al., 2018). We also compare this to actual errors of non-native speakers using Grammatical Error Correction datasets. Finally, we present a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the robustness of Any!English translation systems. Code for our work is publicly available.

TI Model and Simulation of Maximum Entropy Phrase Reordering of English
   Text in Language Learning Machine
SO COMPLEXITY
AB This paper proposes a feature extraction algorithm based on the maximum entropy phrase reordering model in statistical machine translation in language learning machines. The algorithm can extract more accurate phrase reordering information, especially the feature information of reversed phrases, which solves the problem of imbalance of feature data during maximum entropy training in the original algorithm, and improves the accuracy of phrase reordering in translation. In the experiment, they were combined with linguistic features such as parts of speech, words, and syntactic features extracted by using the syntax analyzer, and the maximum entropy classifier was used to predict translation errors, and the experimental verification was performed on the Chinese-English translation data set and compared. The experimental results show that different word posterior probabilities have a significant impact on the classification error rate, and the combination of linguistic features based on the word posterior probability can significantly reduce the classification error rate and improve the translation error prediction performance.

AB One use of text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) is as a component of speech-to-speech translation systems. The output of automatic machine translation (MT) can vary widely in quality, however. A synthetic voice that is extremely intelligible on naturally-occurring text may be far less intelligible when asked to render text that is automatically generated. In this paper, we compare the quality of synthesis of naturally-occurring text and its MT counterpart. We find that intelligibility of TTS on MT output is significantly lower than on either naturally-occurring text or semantically unpredictable sentences, and explore the reasons why.

AB This introduction presents an overview of the special issue of Revista Llengua i Dret / Journal of Language and Law on legal translation and interpreting (TI) in the technologized world. Although legal translation technologies are widely available and accepted in many specialized domains, their use in legal contexts has historically been limited by financial, institutional, and textual resources. The lack of availability hampers the development of high-quality technological applications that can support TI professionals working in legal settings. The contributions to this special issue address the availability and use of resources from different perspectives. Several articles investigate the development of NMT systems by leveraging high-quality resources from under-resourced or related languages, while others assess MT systems as potential resources for translation productivity and quality. Contributions also examine the allocation of institutional resources to train translators and interpreters for work in legal settings.

AB The paper introduces a hybrid approach to a very specific field in machine translation - the translation of closely related languages. It mentions previous experiments performed for closely related Scandinavian, Slavic, Turkic and Romanic languages and describes a novel method, a combination of a simple shallow parser of the source language (Czech) combined with a stochastic ranker of (parts of) sentences in the target language (Slovak, Russian, Slovenian). The ranker exploits a simple stochastic model of the target language and its main task is to choose the best translation among those provided by the system. The last section of the paper presents results indicating better translation quality compared to the existing MT system for Czech and Slovak and compares them with the results obtained by the translation from Czech to Russian using the same system.

By comparing the syntactic and semantic affordances of a lexical unit in the source language with those shown by all lexical units evoking the same frame in a target language, the application suggests which of them is the best-fit translation equivalent. The application contributes to the purpose of bringing to scale the development of frame-based multilingual lexical databases. We discuss the current limitations of the application, especially those regarding entity nouns, and propose the use of ontologies and qualia structure as a means of enhancing machine translation for entity nouns.

AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a predominant machine translation technology nowadays because of its end-to-end trainable flexibility. However, NMT still struggles to translate properly in low-resource settings specifically on distant language pairs. One way to overcome this is to use the information from other modalities if available. The idea is that despite differences in languages, both the source and target language speakers see the same thing and the visual representation of both the source and target is the same, which can positively assist the system. Multimodal information can help the NMT system to improve the translation by removing ambiguity on some phrases or words. We participate in the 8th Workshop on Asian Translation (WAT - 2021) for English-Hindi multimodal translation task and achieve 42.47 and 37.50 BLEU points for Evaluation and Challenge subset, respectively.

AB As well-known, there are many syntactic similarities between Japanese and Korean language. These similarities allow us to build Japanese-Korean translation systems without depending too much on sophisticated syntactic analysis and semantic analysis. To further improve translation accuracy, we have been developing a Japanese-Korean translation system using these similarities for several years. However, there still remain some problems with regard to translation of inflected words, processing of multi-translatable words and so on. In this paper, we propose a new method for Japanese-Korean machine translation by using the relationships of two neighboring words. To solve the problems, we investigate the connection rules of auxiliary verb priority. And we design the translation table, which consists of entry tables and connection form tables. For unambiguous words, we can translate a Japanese word to the corresponding Korean word in terms of direct-matching method by consulting the only entry table. Otherwise, we have to evaluate the connection value computed from connection form tables and then we can select the most appropriate target word.

TI English Semantic Recognition Based on an Intelligent Algorithm
SO INFORMATICA-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATICS
AB In the process of translation, semantic barriers have attracted extensive attention from researchers. Taking the translation between Chinese and English as an example, this paper used intelligent algorithms to recognize the semantic role of English, introduced the semantic role labeling, designed a semantic role encoder, integrated the encoder with the transformer model, and tested the translation performance of the system. The experimental results showed that the BLEU-4 score of the combined system was significantly higher than the baseline system and the traditional transformer system. The average BLEU-4 values of the three systems were 35.02, 35.78, and 36.9, respectively, and the score of the combined system was the highest. The specific analysis of several examples also found that the translation results of the combined system were more reliable. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the combined system in machine translation and the importance of semantic recognition in translation.

AB Neural Machine Translation has achieved state-of-the-art performance for several language pairs using a combination of parallel and synthetic data. Synthetic data is often generated by back-translating sentences randomly sampled from monolingual data using a reverse translation model. While backtranslation has been shown to be very effective in many cases, it is not entirely clear why. In this work, we explore different aspects of back-translation, and show that words with high prediction loss during training benefit most from the addition of synthetic data. We introduce several variations of sampling strategies targeting difficult-to-predict words using prediction losses and frequencies of words. In addition, we also target the contexts of difficult words and sample sentences that are similar in context. Experimental results for the WMT news translation task show that our method improves translation quality by up to 1.7 and 1.2 BLEU points over back-translation using random sampling for German NEnglish and English NGerman, respectively.

TI Word-Region Alignment-Guided Multimodal Neural Machine Translation
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB We propose word-region alignment-guided multimodal neural machine translation (MNMT), a novel model for MNMT that links the semantic correlation between textual and visual modalities using word-region alignment (WRA). Existing studies on MNMT have mainly focused on the effect of integrating visual and textual modalities. However, they do not leverage the semantic relevance between the two modalities. We advance the semantic correlation between textual and visual modalities in MNMT by incorporating WRA as a bridge. This proposal has been implemented on two mainstream architectures of neural machine translation (NMT): the recurrent neural network (RNN) and the transformer. Experiments on two public benchmarks, English-German and English-French translation tasks using the Multi30k dataset and English-Japanese translation tasks using the Flickr30kEnt-JP dataset prove that our model has a significant improvement with respect to the competitive baselines across different evaluation metrics and outperforms most of the existing MNMT models. For example, 1.0 BLEU scores are improved for the English-German task and 1.1 BLEU scores are improved for the English-French task on the Multi30k test2016 set; and 0.7 BLEU scores are improved for the English-Japanese task on the Flickr30kEnt-JP test set. Further analysis demonstrates that our model can achieve better translation performance by integrating WRA, leading to better visual information use.

AB Most of the statistical machine translation (SMT) systems suffer from lack of proper understanding about the meaning of input sentence, confusion of semantic roles or semantic ambiguities. In this paper, we propose semantic features for phrase-based SMT (PB-SMT) using source-side semantic roles. The objective of proposed features is to employ predicate-argument information in an English-Persian SMT, which is a sample of low-resource language pairs. Then these features serve to re-rank list of n-best translations produced by the translation system. The first proposed feature tries to preserve the correlation between predicate-argument structures (PAS) among two languages, while the second one aims to preserve the internal cohesion of semantic roles. Both of these features use direct annotation projection to transfer semantic roles from the source to the target language. For extracting the last feature, the Persian Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is used which is trained on Persian semantic annotated data. We create the training data by automatically projecting the annotation from English to Persian using in-house parallel data, filtering out uncertain labels and also by bootstrapping. To our knowledge, this is the largest Persian corpus annotated with the semantic roles. Evaluations show that these features cause an improvement of 0.65 BLEU score over the baseline. Human evaluation of the translation results also shows the positive influence of these features on translation quality. Preliminary results from experiments demonstrate the importance of predicate-argument semantics in machine translation.

AB Data augmentation, which refers to manipulating the inputs (e.g., adding random noise, masking specific parts) to enlarge the dataset, has been widely adopted in machine learning. Most data augmentation techniques operate on a single input, which limits the diversity of the training corpus. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective data augmentation technique for neural machine translation, mixSeq, which operates on multiple inputs and their corresponding targets. Specifically, we randomly select two input sequences, concatenate them together as a longer input as well as their corresponding target sequences as an enlarged target, and train models on the augmented dataset. Experiments on nine machine translation tasks demonstrate that such a simple method boosts the baselines by a non-trivial margin. Our method can be further combined with single-input based data augmentation methods to obtain further improvements.

AB Low-resource machine translation has been a challenging problem to solve, with the lack of data being a big obstacle in producing good quality neural machine translation (NMT) sys-tems. However, recent work on developing large multilingual translation models gives a platform for attempts to create NMT systems for extremely low-resource languages that can achieve rea-sonable and usable quality. We leverage the information in large multilingual translation models by performing cross-lingual transfer learning to extremely low-resource Finno-Ugric languages. Our experiments include seven languages with limited resources that are unseen by the original pre-trained translation model and five high-resource languages that have the potential to help during training, previously seen by the model during training. We report state-of-the-art results on multiple test sets and translation directions as well as analyze the low-resource languages in smaller language groups in order to track the source of our higher translation quality.

AB Pivot translation can be one of the solutions to overcome the problem of unavailable large bilingual corpora for training statistical machine translation models. Nevertheless, the conventional pivot method, which connect source to target phrases via common pivot phrases, lacks some potential connections when pivoting via the surface form of pivot phrases. In this work, we improve the pivot translation method by integrating grammatical and morphological information to connect pivot phrases instead of using only the surface form. Experiments were conducted on several Southeast Asian low-resource language pairs: Indonesian-Vietnamese, Malay-Vietnamese, and Filipino-Vietnamese. By integrating grammatical and morphological information, the proposed method achieved a significant improvement of 0.5 BLEU points. This showed the effectiveness of integrating grammatical and morphological features to pivot translation.

AB The technology, of the information age and the digitized battlefield apply not only, to machine-to-machine communications but support an unprecedented advancement in communication across human language barriers. Modern military, operations, including "peace-keeping," coordination with joint and multinational forces, and operations other than war, often involve the interaction of troops with indigenous peoples where language issues can have a serious impact on mission success. The Audio Voice Translation Guide System (Tongues) is a mobile, networked, speech-to-speech machine translation system that both benefits from and contributes to the digitized battlefield. Machine translation is an advanced research topic and is only beginning to become a realistic option for deployment in a handheld speech-enabled system. The Tongues prototype runs on a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) mobile computing platform, capable of fitting in a cargo pocket, and running a Microsoft Windows Operating System. It supports real time interactive translation of bilingual conversation, within and without the selected tat-get domain, with the highest quality appearing within the target domain. Tongues has a modular architecture, allowing for easy, upgrades to the speech and language engines and multiple conversational domains and languages. The prototype system supports English/Croatian conversation for deployed U.S. Army, chaplains, a domain that includes religious support, humanitarian aid, and operations other than war. The system supports text-entry as well as speech input and provides feedback for verification of translation accuracy The Tongues system can automatically, capture and store textual and audio conversation transcripts in formats that comply with the Joint Technical Architecture - Army (JTA-A). It supports a wide variety of JTA-A compliant means for transferring that information to other information systems. Tongues can run in a stand-alone mode, or it can make a wireless network connection to remote machine translation servers, allowing for in Creased performance and flexibility.

AB The paper proposed that the image annotation task can be thought of as similar to the machine translation problem and apply the example-based machine translation method to this problem. The method is based on the idea of performing automatic annotation by imitating annotation examples of images with similar visual scene. It can make full use of both correlation of annotation words and context of image regions in same image. Given an input image, the most visual similar images are retrieved from the annotated images. The annotation words of the retrieved images can be used as the annotation of the input image. From this view, we can say traditional techniques of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) are more apt to the task of automatic image annotation. As an example-based machine translation method, the judgment of visual similarity between images plays an import role. Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) is chosen as similarity measure for visual features. In order to make the EMD factor the similar regions between images, an enhanced EMD is presented. The approach does not rely on clustering and consequently does not suffer from the granularity issues. Experiment results show that the proposed mechanism outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in annotating a large image collection using the same data set and same feature representations.

The GIRT collection was substantially extended this year and we were able to improve our retrieval results for the query languages German, English and Russian. For the GIRT retrieval experiments, we utilized our previous experiences by combining different translations. thesaurus matching, decompounding for German compounds and a blind feedback algorithm. We find that our thesaurus matching technique compares to conventional machine translation for Russian and German against English retrieval and outperforms machine translation for English to German retrieval.
   With the introduction of a Russian document collection in CLEF 2003. we participated in the CLEF main task with monolingual and bilingual runs for the Russian collection. For bilingual retrieval our approaches were. query translation (for German or English as topic languages) and document translation (for English as the topic language). Document translation significantly underperformed query translation (using the Promt translation system).

AB Machine translation system (MTS) constitutes of functionally heterogeneous modules for processing source language to a given target language. Deploying such an application on a stand-alone system requires much time, knowledge and complications. It even becomes more challenging for a common user to utilize such a complex application. This paper presents a MTS that has been developed using a combination of linguistic rich, rule-based and prominent neural-based approach. The proposed MTS is deployed on the cloud to offer translation as a cloud service and improve the quality of service (QoS) from a stand-alone system. It is developed on TensorFlow and deployed under the cluster of virtual machines in the Amazon web server (EC2). The significance of this paper is to demonstrate management of recurrent changes in term of corpus, domain, algorithm and rules. Further, the paper also compares the MTS as deployed on stand-alone machine and on cloud for different QoS parameters like response time, server load, CPU utilization and throughput. The experimental results assert that in the translation task, with the availability of elastic computing resources in the cloud environment, the job completion time irrespective of its size can be assured to be within a fixed time limit with high accuracy.

AB In past, rule-based and statistical machine translation techniques were employed to solve Urdu transliteration techniques. As mentioned in the literature, Urdu is considered as low-resource language. An impressive effort has been made for Arabic, French and Chinese language transliteration as compared to the Urdu language. Machine translation of Urdu language is a challenging problem. A very minute research work has been conducted toward Urdu transliteration. Factors behind the ignorance of Urdu language in research may be for its morphological complexity, diversity and most importantly due to the lack of reasonable bilingual parallel dataset. Getting a corpus for a language transliteration is the main resource to work on. This paper demonstrates the application of neural machine translation (NMT) for Urdu language transliteration, with the emphasis on contextual coverage of a language, which helps to improve transliteration accuracy. Build a robust NMT model which delivers efficient performance when trained over bilingual parallel corpora. Neural machine translation is an emerging technique depicting impressive performance, better than traditional MT methods in multiple aspects. In this research, we build the NMT model for the Urdu language to improve transliteration quality. An attention-based encoder-decoder system is proposed, and our experiment proves the efficiency of the proposed approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort for Urdu language bidirectional transliteration toward neural machine translation.

AB In this paper we show how to learn rules to improve the performance of a machine translation system. Given a system consisting of two translation functions (one from language A to language B and one from B to A), training text is translated from A to B and back again to A. Using these two translations, differences in knowledge between the two translation functions are identified, and rules are learned to improve the functions. Context-independent rules are learned where the information suggests only a single possible translation for a word. When there are multiple alternate translations for a word, a likelihood ratio test is used to identify words that co-occur with each case significantly. These words are then used as context in context-dependent rules. Applied on the Pan American Health Organization corpus of 20,084 sentences, the learned rules improve the understandability of the translation produced by the SDL International engine on 78% of sentences, with high precision.

AB As a new neural machine translation approach, Non-Autoregressive machine Translation (NAT) has attracted attention recently due to its high efficiency in inference. However, the high efficiency has come at the cost of not capturing the sequential dependency on the target side of translation, which causes NAT to suffer from two kinds of translation errors: 1) repeated translations (due to indistinguishable adjacent decoder hidden states), and 2) incomplete translations (due to incomplete transfer of source side information via the decoder hidden states). In this paper, we propose to address these two problems by improving the quality of decoder hidden representations via two auxiliary regularization terms in the training process of an NAT model. First, to make the hidden states more distinguishable, we regularize the similarity between consecutive hidden states based on the corresponding target tokens. Second, to force the hidden states to contain all the information in the source sentence, we leverage the dual nature of translation tasks (e.g., English to German and German to English) and minimize a backward reconstruction error to ensure that the hidden states of the NAT decoder are able to recover the source side sentence. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets show that both regularization strategies are effective and can alleviate the issues of repeated translations and incomplete translations in NAT models. The accuracy of NAT models is therefore improved significantly over the state-of-the-art NAT models with even better efficiency for inference.

AB Neural machine translation (NMT) has achieved great success due to the ability to generate high-quality sentences. Compared with human translations, one of the drawbacks of current NMT is that translations are not usually faithful to the input, e.g., omitting information or generating unrelated fragments, which inevitably decreases the overall quality, especially for human readers. In this paper, we propose a novel training strategy with a multi-task learning paradigm to build a faithfulness enhanced NMT model (named FENMT). During the NMT training process, we sample a subset from the training set and translate them to get fragments that have been mistranslated. Afterward, the proposed multi-task learning paradigm is employed on both encoder and decoder to guide NMT to correctly translate these fragments. Both automatic and human evaluations verify that our FENMT could improve translation quality by effectively reducing unfaithful translations.

AB The neural revolution in machine translation has made it easier to model larger contexts beyond the sentence-level, which can potentially help resolve some discourse-level ambiguities such as pronominal anaphora, thus enabling better translations. Unfortunately, even when the resulting improvements are seen as substantial by humans, they remain virtually unnoticed by traditional automatic evaluation measures such as BLEU, as only a few words end up being affected. Thus, specialized evaluation measures are needed. With this aim in mind, we contribute an extensive, targeted dataset that can be used as a test suite for pronoun translation, covering multiple source languages and different pronoun errors drawn from real system translations, for English. We further propose an evaluation measure to differentiate good and bad pronoun translations. Finally, we conduct a user study and we report correlation with human judgments.

AB The aim of this research study is to compare the effectiveness of three systems: Google Translator, Bing Translator and Golden Alwafi that are used to translate the corpus sentences from English language to Arabic language and then evaluate these sentences using two automatic evaluation methods viz., BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) which is one of the most popular evaluation method and GTM (General Text Matcher) which is based on Recall, Precision, and F-measure. The scores obtained from the evaluation methods determine which one of these translation systems provides better translation. Higher the score means better translation and highly correlate with human translation. The results of this research study have revealed that Golden Alwafi achieves highest accuracy using BLEU and Google Translator attains highest accuracy with GTM method.

AB This paper describes the system of our team (NHK) for the WAT 2021 Japanese <-> English restricted machine translation task. In this task, the aim is to improve quality while maintaining consistent terminology for scientific paper translation. This task has a unique feature, where some words in a target sentence are given in addition to a source sentence. In this paper, we use a lexically-constrained neural machine translation (NMT), which concatenates the source sentence and constrained words with a special token to input them into the encoder of NMT. The key to the successful lexically-constrained NMT is the way to extract constraints from a target sentence of training data. We propose two extraction methods: proper-noun constraint and mistranslated-word constraint. These two methods consider the importance of words and fallibility of NMT, respectively. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our lexical-constraint method.

We developed these systems in reaction to the escalating Ukrainian refugee crisis caused by the Russian military aggression in Ukraine in the hope that they might be helpful for refugees and public administrations. Now, two months after MT systems were made public, we analyze their usage patterns and statistics. Our findings show that the Latvian-Ukrainian and Lithuanian-Ukrainian systems are integrated into the public services of Baltic states, leading to more than 127 million translated sentences for the Lithuanian-Ukrainian system. Motivated by these findings, we further enhance our MT systems by better Ukrainian toponym translation and publish an improved version of the Lithuanian-Ukrainian system.

An error analysis of the output of an English-to-Russian neural machine translation system shows that 80% of the automatically translated sentences contain an error and that 53% of all translation errors bear on named entities (NE). We therefore focus on named entities and introduce two post-editing techniques for correcting wrongly translated NEs.

AB Recent advances of deep learning have been successful in delivering state-of-the-art performance in medical analysis, However, deep neural networks (DNNs) require a large amount of training data with a high-quality annotation which is not available or expensive in the field of the medical domain. The research of medical domain neural machine translation (NMT) is largely limited due to the lack of parallel sentences that consist of medical domain background knowledge annotations. To this end, we propose a Chinese-Uyghur NMT knowledge-driven dataset, YuQ, which refers to a ground medical domain knowledge graphs. Our corpus 65K parallel sentences from the medical domain 130K utterances. By introduce medical domain glossary knowledge to the training model, we can win the challenge of low translation accuracy in Chinese-Uyghur machine translation professional terms. We provide several benchmark models. Ablation study results show that the models can be enhanced by introducing domain knowledge.

The paper compares query translation-based multilingual retrieval with document translation-based multilingual retrieval where the documents are translated into the query language by translating the document words individually using machine translation systems or statistical translation lexicons derived from parallel texts. The multilingual retrieval results show that document translation-based retrieval is slightly better than the query translation-based retrieval on the CLEF 2003 test collection. Furthermore, combining query translation and document translation in multilingual retrieval achieves even better performance.

In this paper, we bring together these two lines of research and propose quality-aware decoding for NMT, by leveraging recent breakthroughs in reference-free and reference-based MT evaluation through various inference methods like N-best reranking and minimum Bayes risk decoding. We perform an extensive comparison of various possible candidate generation and ranking methods across four datasets and two model classes and find that quality-aware decoding consistently outperforms MAP-based decoding according both to state-of-the-art automatic metrics (COMET and BLEURT) and to human assessments.

TI Finding Better Subwords for Tibetan Neural Machine Translation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB Subword segmentation plays an important role in Tibetan neural machine translation (NMT). The structure of Tibetan words consists of two levels. First, words consist of a sequence of syllables, and then a syllable consists of a sequence of characters. According to this special word structure, we propose two methods for Tibetan subword segmentation, namely syllable-based and character-based methods. The former generates subwords based on the Tibetan syllables, and the latter is based on Tibetan characters. In addition, we carry out experiments with these two subword segmentation methods on low-resource Tibetan-to-Chinese NMT, respectively. The experimental results show that both of them can improve translation performance, in which the subword segmentation based on character sequences can achieve better results. Overall, our proposed character-based subword segmentation is more simple and effective. Moreover, it can achieve better experimental results without paying much attention to the linguistic features of Tibetan.

AB The clause is considered as the basic unit of grammar in linguistics, which is a structure between a chunk and a sentence. Clause constituents, therefore, are one important kind of linguistically valid syntactic phrases. This paper adopts the CRFs model to recognise English clause constituents with their syntactic functions, and testifies their effect on machine translation by applying this syntactic information to an English-Chinese PBSMT system, evaluated on a corpus of business domain. Clause constituents are mainly classified into six kinds: subject, predicate, complement, adjunct, residues of predicate, and residues of complement. Results show that our rich-feature CRFs model achieves an F-measure of 93.31%, a precision of 93.26%, and a recall of 93.04%. This syntactic knowledge in the source language is further combined with the NiuTrans phrasal SMT system, which slightly improves the English-Chinese translation accuracy.

AB Machine translation models struggle when translating out-of-domain text, which makes domain adaptation a topic of critical importance. However, most domain adaptation methods focus on fine-tuning or training the entire or part of the model on every new domain, which can be costly. On the other hand, semi-parametric models have been shown to successfully perform domain adaptation by retrieving examples from an in-domain datastore (Khandelwal et al., 2021). A drawback of these retrieval-augmented models, however, is that they tend to be substantially slower. In this paper, we explore several approaches to speed up nearest neighbor machine translation. We adapt the methods recently proposed by He et al. (2021) for language modeling, and introduce a simple but effective caching strategy that avoids performing retrieval when similar contexts have been seen before. Translation quality and runtimes for several domains show the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.(1)

Two challenging topics of speech and language processing were involved: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) of the Spanish News and Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) of the results to the Portuguese language. ASR of broadcast news is based on the AUDIMUS.MEDIA system, a hybrid ANN/HMM system with multiple stream decoding. A 22.08% Word Error Rate (WER) was achieved in a Spanish Broadcast News task, which is comparable to other international state of the art systems. Parallel normalized texts from European Parliament database were used to train the SMT system from Spanish to Portuguese. Preliminary non-exhaustive human evaluation showed a fluency of 3.74 and sufficiency of 4.23.

AB Automatic dubbing aims at seamlessly replacing the speech in a video document with synthetic speech in a different language. The task implies many challenges, one of which is generating translations that not only convey the original content, but also match the duration of the corresponding utterances. In this paper, we focus on the problem of controlling the verbosity of machine translation output, so that subsequent steps of our automatic dubbing pipeline can generate dubs of better quality. We propose new methods to control the verbosity of MT output and compare them against the state of the art with both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations. For our experiments we use a public data set to dub English speeches into French, Italian, German and Spanish. Finally, we report extensive subjective tests that measure the impact of MT verbosity control on the final quality of dubbed video clips.

AB Simultaneous machine translation begins to translate each source sentence before the source speaker is finished speaking, with applications to live and streaming scenarios. Simultaneous systems must carefully schedule their reading of the source sentence to balance quality against latency. We present the first simultaneous translation system to learn an adaptive schedule jointly with a neural machine translation (NMT) model that attends over all source tokens read thus far. We do so by introducing Monotonic Infinite Lookback (MILk) attention, which maintains both a hard, monotonic attention head to schedule the reading of the source sentence, and a soft attention head that extends from the monotonic head back to the beginning of the source. We show that MILk's adaptive schedule allows it to arrive at latency-quality trade-offs that are favorable to those of a recently proposed wait-k strategy for many latency values.

AB In this paper, we present information retrieval as a powerful tool for addressing an imperative problem in the field of statistical machine translation, i.e., improving translation quality when not enough parallel corpora are available. We devise a framework, which uses information retrieval to create a synthetic corpus from the easily available monolingual corpora. We propose an improved unsupervised training approach with a data selection mechanism, which selects only the most appropriate sentences, thus reducing the amount of data, which is less related to the domain in the additional bitext. We also introduce a new method to choose sentences based on their relative similarity/difference from the query sentence. Using the synthetic corpus created by our method, we are able to improve state-of-the-art statistical machine translation systems.

The system is used to transcribe conversational telephone speech (CTS) prior to machine translation for Phase 3 of the program's Activity A. The ASR system is a combination of novel sequence trained ensemble deep neural network acoustic models on speaker adapted features and convolutional neural network models on two kinds of spectro-temporal representations of speech, in conjunction with a variety of class, neural network and n-gram based language models. Acoustic and language models for the recognition system are built on transcribed audio released under the program and further optimized for the final machine translation task as well. The evaluation system has a word error rate of 32.7% on a 2 hour Egyptian Arabic development set for this task.

AB We present a new English-French dataset for the evaluation of Machine Translation (MT) for informal, written bilingual dialogue. The test set contains 144 spontaneous dialogues (5700+ sentences) between native English and French speakers, mediated by one of two neural MT systems in a range of role-play settings. The dialogues are accompanied by fine-grained sentence-level judgments of MT quality, produced by the dialogue participants themselves, as well as by manually normalised versions and reference translations produced a posteriori. The motivation for the corpus is twofold: to provide (i) a unique resource for evaluating MT models, and (ii) a corpus for the analysis of MT-mediated communication. We provide an initial analysis of the corpus to confirm that the participants' judgments reveal perceptible differences in MT quality between the two MT systems used.

A large comparable corpus for Basque-Spanish was prepared, on the basis of independently-produced news by the Basque public broadcaster eitb, and we discuss the impact of various techniques to exploit the original data in order to determine optimal variants of the corpus. In particular, we show that filtering in terms of alignment thresholds and length-difference outliers has a significant impact on translation quality. The impact of tags identifying comparable data in the training datasets is also evaluated, with results indicating that this technique might be useful to help the models discriminate noisy information, in the form of informational imbalance between aligned sentences. The final corpus was prepared according to the experimental results and is made available to the scientific community for research purposes.

AB Recent text simplification approaches regard the task as a monolingual text-to-text generation inspired by machine translation. In particular, the transformer-based translation model outperform previous methods. Although machine translation approaches need a large-scale parallel corpus, parallel corpora for text simplification are very small compared to machine translation tasks. Therefore, we attempt a simple approach which fine-tunes the pre-trained language model for text simplification with a small parallel corpus. Specifically, we conduct experiments with the following two models: transformer-based encoder-decoder model and a language model that receives a joint input of original and simplified sentences, called TransformerLM. Thus, we show that TransformerLM, which is a simple text generation model, substantially outperforms a strong baseline. In addition, we show that fine-tuned TransformerLM with only 3,000 supervised examples can achieve performance comparable to a strong baseline trained by all supervised data.

AB The performance of Machine Translation (MT) systems varies significantly with inputs of diverging features such as topics, genres, and surface properties. Though there are many MT evaluation metrics that generally correlate with human judgments, they are not directly useful in identifying specific shortcomings of MT systems. In this demo, we present a benchmarking interface that enables improved evaluation of specific MT systems in isolation or multiple MT systems collectively by quantitatively evaluating their performance on many tasks across multiple domains and evaluation metrics. Further, it facilitates effective debugging and error analysis of MT output via the use of dynamic filters that help users hone in on problem sentences with specific properties, such as genre, topic, sentence length, etc. The interface can be extended to include additional filters such as lexical, morphological, and syntactic features. Aside from helping debug MT output, it can also help in identifying problems in reference translations and evaluation metrics.

It is grounded on a two-hour interaction involving a family of Albanian asylum seekers newly arrived in France and a French general practitioner. To reach mutual comprehension, participants rely on the mediation of a lay interpreter (one of the family's children) who translates for the doctor and the other family members. In this interaction, English is used as a lingua franca, while machine translation is conducted between French and Albanian. The analysis will focus on the interactional work that participants accomplish in order to: (1) propose or solicit the use of Google Translate and make the computer accessible to all participants; (2) detect and repair misunderstandings caused by an unsuitable translation.

The experimental results show that our method improves the performance of both word alignment and translation quality significantly. As compared to baseline systems, we achieve absolute improvements of 2.40 BLEU score on a phrase-based SMT system and 1.76 BLEU score on a parsing-based SMT system.

We argue that, just as in CBR, the overall power of an EBMT system is its ability to adapt examples retrieved to suit the new problem translation. Here we describe a technique whereby reusability is a function of the abstract "adaptability" information stored in the cases. This information is exploited during both the adaptation and retrieval stages.

AB The computer translation task is ambiguous and before starting the process it occurs many difficulties and questions to be solved. The simple texts on general topics can be fast translated by using the modern machine translation systems based on cloud exchange algorithms. In this regard it should be noted that the main problem exists by translation of specialized texts including terms, abbreviations and linguistics items related to the particular sublanguage. The issue of post-editing can be solved manually, but taking into account the volume of texts, it has been risen a strong demand to automatize the process by development and implementation a professional tool that can proceed the semi-automatic translation of sublanguages. In this regard it was researched the modern computer assisted translation programs, the main mechanism of their functioning, advantages and disadvantages and based on them it was developed the advanced web tool with friendly-user interface based on the main mistakes of the machine translation systems. This program is unique due to the wide range of tools that are aimed to the implementation of practical tasks and without any exaggeration, it can change the idea of computer translation due to the new approach to the interlanguage perception. For realizing not only translation task, but providing a complex professional solution, it was added some additional functions as translation memory (MT), Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and some other features aimed at performing special linguistic tasks. The using of the program and first conducted tests based on preselected multilingual corpora can only prove the practical value of this development. The conducted survey of received feedbacks only maintain and prove the necessity of further continuation of research aimed to creation the advanced computer assisted translation tool that could complete professional linguistic tasks, in particular as the main task to perform the high-quality translation of sublanguages.

AB State-of-the-art (SOTA) neural machine translation (NMT) systems translate texts at sentence level, ignoring context: intra-textual information, like the previous sentence, and extra-textual information, like the gender of the speaker. Because of that, some sentences are translated incorrectly. Personalised NMT (PersNMT) and document-level NMT (DocNMT) incorporate this information into the translation process. Both fields are relatively new and previous work within them is limited. Moreover, there are no readily available robust evaluation metrics for them, which makes it difficult to develop better systems, as well as track global progress and compare different methods. This thesis proposal focuses on PersNMT and DocNMT for the domain of dialogue extracted from TV subtitles in five languages: English, Brazilian Portuguese, German, French and Polish. Three main challenges are addressed: (1) incorporating extra-textual information directly into NMT systems; (2) improving the machine translation of cohesion devices; (3) reliable evaluation for PersNMT and DocNMT.

TI Building and using multimodal comparable corpora for machine translation
SO NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING
AB In recent decades, statistical approaches have significantly advanced the development of machine translation systems. However, the applicability of these methods directly depends on the availability of very large quantities of parallel data. Recent works have demonstrated that a comparable corpus can compensate for the shortage of parallel corpora. In this paper, we propose an alternative to comparable corpora containing text documents as resources for extracting parallel data: a multimodal comparable corpus with audio documents in source language and text document in target language, built from Euronews and TED web sites. The audio is transcribed by an automatic speech recognition system, and translated with a baseline statistical machine translation system. We then use information retrieval in a large text corpus in the target language in order to extract parallel sentences/phrases. We evaluate the quality of the extracted data on an English to French translation task and show significant improvements over a state-of-the-art baseline.

AB Like machine translation between natural languages, good quality dictionary is necessary for automatic translation between Korean and Korean sign language. Korean Sign Language dictionary, which is currently regarded as the most reliable sign language dictionary, contains only 12,000 words including compound words and idiomatic phrases, so it does not provide enough information as a dictionary. In order to solve target word selection problems occurring when Korean is translated into Korean sign language, this study suggests a method of using dictionary definitions in the Korean standard unabridged dictionary along with relational words information of Korean WordNet. When it is impossible to select Korean sign language words for corresponding Korean words due to insufficiency of target words, target words are selected from relational words of Korean WordNet, or main words in dictionary definitions of Korean words are used to translate Korean words into Korean sign language.

TI Generative adversarial training for neural machine translation
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
AB Neural machine translation (NMT) is typically optimized to generate sentences which cover n-grams with ground target as much as possible. However, it is widely acknowledged that n-gram precisions, the manually designed approximate loss function, may mislead the model to generate suboptimal translations. To solve this problem, we train the NMT model to generate human-like translations directly by using the generative adversarial net, which has achieved great success in computer vision. In this paper, we build a conditional sequence generative adversarial net (CSGAN-NMT) which comprises of two adversarial sub models, a generative model (generator) which translates the source sentence into the target sentence as the traditional NMT models do and a discriminative model (discriminator) which discriminates the machine-translated target sentence from the human-translated one. The two sub models play a mini max game and achieve a win-win situation when reaching a Nash Equilibrium. As a variant of the single generator-discriminator model, the multi-CSGAN-NMT which contains multiple discriminators and generators, is also proposed. In the multi-CSGAN-NMT model, each generator is viewed as an agent which can interact with others and even transfer messages. Experiments show that the proposed CSGAN-NMT model obtains substantial improvements than the strong baseline and the improvement of the multi-CSGAN-NMT model is more remarkable.

AB Sparse language vectors from linguistic typology databases and learned embeddings from tasks like multilingual machine translation have been investigated in isolation, without analysing how they could benefit from each other's language characterisation. We propose to fuse both views using singular vector canonical correlation analysis and study what kind of information is induced from each source. By inferring typological features and language phylogenies, we observe that our representations embed typology and strengthen correlations with language relationships. We then take advantage of our multi-view language vector space for multilingual machine translation, where we achieve competitive overall translation accuracy in tasks that require information about language similarities, such as language clustering and ranking candidates for multilingual transfer. With our method, which is also released as a tool, we can easily project and assess new languages without expensive retraining of massive multilingual or ranking models, which are major disadvantages of related approaches.

TI Translating without understanding: What kind of semantics for machine
   translation?
SO LANGAGES
AB The translation activity involves understanding the text to be translated so as to transpose the main ideas as precisely as possible in the target language. It is largely assumed that the first generations of machine translation systems (1950-1965) failed because of the absence of semantic analysis or at least because of weaknesses in their semantic analysis component. Research has then largely focused on text understanding, in order to be able to calculate a relevant semantic representation of the text. Contrary to this approach, the late 1980s and 1990s have seen new kinds of systems based on a purely statistical analysis, with no explicit semantic representation of the textual content. In this article we will investigate the attitude of current systems towards semantics. To what extent do current systems based on large collections of texts (the "big data" approach) integrate semantic information?

AB Many treebanks have been developed in recent years for different languages. But these treebanks usually employ different syntactic tag sets. This forms an obstacle for other researchers to take full advantages of them, especially when they undertake the multilingual research. To address this problem and to facilitate future research in unsupervised induction of syntactic structures, some researchers have developed a universal POS tag set. However, the disaccord problem of the phrase tag sets remains unsolved. Trying to bridge the phrase level tag sets of multilingual treebanks, this paper designs a phrase mapping between the French Treebank and the English Penn Treebank. Furthermore, one of the potential applications of this mapping work is explored in the machine translation evaluation task. This novel evaluation model developed without using reference translations yields promising results as compared to the state-of-the-art evaluation metrics.

After analyzing common types of adverbials, different reordering ideas and formal rules are designed for various adverbials according to semantic and expression features of them, as well as systematic differences of word orders between Chinese and English. Related BLEU evaluation scores have improved efficiently compared with baseline, indicating the reordering method was helpful to improve final translation results.

AB Instead of translating sentences in isolation, document-level machine translation aims to capture discourse dependencies across sentences by considering a document as a whole. In recent years, there have been more interests in modelling larger context for the state-of-the-art neural machine translation (NMT). Although various document-level NMT models have shown significant improvements, there nonetheless exist three main problems: 1) compared with sentence-level translation tasks, the data for training robust document-level models are relatively low-resourced; 2) experiments in previous work are conducted on their own datasets which vary in size, domain and language; 3) proposed approaches are implemented on distinct NMT architectures such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and self-attention networks (SANs). In this paper, we aim to alleviate the low-resource and under-universality problems for document-level NMT. First, we collect a large number of existing document-level corpora, which covers 7 language pairs and 6 domains. In order to address resource sparsity, we construct a novel document parallel corpus in Chinese-Portuguese, which is a non-English-centred and low-resourced language pair. Besides, we implement and evaluate the commonly-cited document-level method on top of the advanced Transformer model with universal settings. Finally, we not only demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of document-level NMT, but also release the preprocessed data, source code and trained models for comparison and reproducibility.

TI SEMANTIC APPROACH FOR BUILDING GENERATED VIRTUAL-PARALLEL CORPORA FROM
   MONOLINGUAL TEXTS
SO POZNAN STUDIES IN CONTEMPORARY LINGUISTICS
AB Several natural languages have undergone a great deal of processing, but the problem of limited textual linguistic resources remains. The manual creation of parallel corpora by humans is rather expensive and time consuming, while the language data required for statistical machine translation (SMT) do not exist in adequate quantities for their statistical information to be used to initiate the research process. On the other hand, applying known approaches to build parallel resources from multiple sources, such as comparable or quasi-comparable corpora, is very complicated and provides rather noisy output, which later needs to be further processed and requires in-domain adaptation. To optimize the performance of comparable corpora mining algorithms, it is essential to use a quality parallel corpus for training of a good data classifier. In this research, we have developed a methodology for generating an accurate parallel corpus (Czech-English, Polish-English) from monolingual resources by calculating the compatibility between the results of three machine translation systems. We have created translations of large, single-language resources by applying multiple translation systems and strictly measuring translation compatibility using rules based on the Levenshtein distance. The results produced by this approach were very favorable. The generated corpora successfully improved the quality of SMT systems and seem to be useful for many other natural language processing tasks.

Not surprisingly, the attractiveness of the MT market has stirred up spectacular innovations, driven by artificial intelligence in the digital technology industry. The commercial stakes of the industry has led to massive investments in the development of automatic translation systems for languages of wider communication and an increased marginalization of minority languages in this avenue. This article reports on the on-going development of a low-tech, rule-based MT system for Ewondo, a Bantu low-resourced language spoken in Cameroon. The project aims to fill the gap in access to MT services in the target minority language community and to generate parallel corpora from and into the Ewondo language.

TI Statistical machine translation based on weighted syntax-semantics
SO SADHANA-ACADEMY PROCEEDINGS IN ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB In this paper, we propose an alternate technique to improve the performance of the statistical machine translation (SMT) system. Here, the phrases are re-weighted in light of linguistic knowledge as both syntactic and semantic information. Syntactic knowledge helps to increase fluency whereas semantic similarity helps to incorporate semantic meaning, which is required for adequacy of translated sentences. The scores of the phrases from the phrase-table are re-balanced by expanding and diminishing the weights of the correct phrases and the incorrect phrases, respectively. Additional knowledge in phrase-table helps in improving overall performance of translation quality. In this work, our proposed methodology achieves an impressive accuracy improvement in terms of BLEU, NIST and RIBES in different domain data. We achieve 58.54 BLEU points, 0.7759 RIBES points and 9.684 NIST points for product domain catalog.

TI Inter-, Intra-, and Extra-Chunk Pre-Ordering for Statistical
   Japanese-to-English Machine Translation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION
   PROCESSING
AB A rule-based pre-ordering approach is proposed for statistical Japanese-to-English machine translation using the dependency structure of source-side sentences. A Japanese sentence is pre-ordered to an English-like order at the morpheme level for a statistical machine translation system during the training and decoding phase to resolve the reordering problem. In this article, extra-chunk pre-ordering of morphemes is proposed, which allows Japanese functional morphemes to move across chunk boundaries. This contrasts with the intra-chunk reordering used in previous approaches, which restricts the reordering of morphemes within a chunk. Linguistically oriented discussions show that correct pre-ordering cannot be realized without extra-chunk movement of morphemes. The proposed approach is compared with five rule-based pre-ordering approaches designed for Japanese-to-English translation and with a language independent statistical preordering approach on a standard patent dataset and on a news dataset obtained by crawling Internet news sites. Two state-of-the-art statistical machine translation systems, one phrase-based and the other hierarchical phrase-based, are used in experiments. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the compared approaches on automatic reordering measures (Kendall's tau, Spearman's rho, fuzzy reordering score, and test set RIBES) and on the automatic translation precision measure of test set BLEU score.

AB Word alignment plays a critical role in statistical machine translation systems. The famous word alignment system, IBM models series, currently operates on only surface forms of words regardless of their linguistic features. This deficiency usually leads to many data sparseness problems. Therefore, we present an extension that enables the integration of morphological analysis into the traditional IBM models. Experiments on English-Vietnamese tasks show that the new model produces better results not only in word alignment but also in final translation performance.

AB Nowadays, the main methods to evaluate the quality of target texts which are translated by machine translation system include BLUE, TER and METEOR However, based on the frequency of words recurrence, edit distance of translation version and reference version as well as linguistic knowledge, such methods have limitations on deciding the perplexity of Chinese sentences. It is found that grammatical structure of sentence has certain regularity, meanwhile, semantics also has certain collocation rule, so through matching we can judge whether the usage(s) of grammar and semantics accord with the standard usages. Therefore, we figure out the perplexity of Chinese sentences through analyzing the syntax and semantic of Chinese sentences and its main components on the basis of syntactic analysis. According to the experiment, the accuracy of syntax and semantic analysis is 4% higher than BLEU which gets the perplexity by improved weighting target text.

AB In this paper, we present a multilingual machine translation system for closed captions for digital television. To cope with frequent appearance of unregistered words and the articles of multiple domains as in TV news program, we propose a Dynamic Dictionary Adaptation method. We adopted live resources of multilingual Named Entities and their translingual equivalences from Web sites of daily news, providing multilingual daily news in Chinese, English, Japanese and Korean. We also utilize Dynamic Domain Identification for automatic dictionary stacking. With these integrated approaches, we obtained average translation quality enhancement of 0.5 in Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for Korean-to-Chinese. We also had 0.5 and 0.1 average enhancement for Korean-English and Korean-Japanese, respectively. The average enhancement is 0.37, which means almost a third level up to the next higher MOS scale.

AB The goal of translation is to preserve the original text meaning. However, lexical-based machine translation (MT) evaluation metrics count the similar terms in MT output with the human translated reference rather than measuring the similarity in meaning. In this paper, we developed an MT evaluation metric to assess the output of MT systems, semantically. Inspiring by the dependency grammar, we consider to what extent the headword and its dependents contribute in preserving the meaning of the original input text. Our experimental results show that this metric is significantly better correlated with human judgment.

AB We propose a novel reordering model for phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) that uses a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model to predicate reorderings of neighbor blocks (phrase pairs). The model provides content-dependent, hierarchical phrasal reordering with generalization based on features automatically learned from a real-world bitext. We present an algorithm to extract all reordering events of neighbor blocks from bilingual data. In our experiments on Chinese-to-English translation, this MaxEnt-based reordering model obtains significant improvements in BLEU score on the NIST MT-05 and IWSLT-04 tasks.

AB The first pattern recognition approaches to machine translation were based on single-word models. However, these models present an important deficiency; they do not take contextual information into account for the translation decision. The phrase-based approach consists in translating a multiword source sequence into a multiword target sequence, instead of a single source word into a single target word. We present different methods to train the parameters of this kind of model. In the evaluation phase of this approach, we obtained interesting results in comparison with other statistical models.

TI Friend or foe? Google Translate in language for academic purposes
SO ENGLISH FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES
AB A recent development in digital technology, machine translation (MT), is improving in its ability to translate with grammatical and lexical accuracy, and is also becoming increasingly available for students of language for academic purposes. Given the acceptance of other digital technology for teaching and learning, it seems likely that machine translation will become a tool students will rely on to complete their assignments in a second language. This would have implications for the community of practice of academic language teaching. In this study students were asked to submit an essay in their first language and this was then translated into English through a web-based translation engine. The resulting English text was analysed for grammatical error. The analysis found that the translation engine was far from able to produce error-free text - however, judging in relation to international testing standards, the level of accuracy is approaching the minimum needed for university admission at many institutions. Thus, this paper sets out to argue, based on the assumption that MT will continue to improve, that this technology will have a profound influence on the teaching of Languages for Academic Purposes, and with imaginative use, will allow this influence to be positive for both the students and their instructors.

We stood first in three of the five sub-tasks which were assigned to us for the main shared task. We carried out neural machine translation for the following five language pairs: Kannada to Tamil, Kannada to Telugu, Kannada to Malayalam, Kannada to Sanskrit, and Kannada to Tulu. The datasets for each of the five language pairs were used to train various translation models, including Seq2Seq models such as LSTM, bidirectional LSTM, Conv2Seq, and training state-of-the-art as transformers from scratch, and fine-tuning already pre-trained models. For some models involving monolingual corpora, we implemented backtranslation as well. These models' accuracy was later tested with a part of the same dataset using BLEU score as an evaluation metric.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on NMT for this specific domain. We propose a domain-specific NMT system by introducing a domain flag to indicate the target-side domain. By training the NMT model on the data from both the IPO corpus and the general domain corpus, we can expand the vocabulary while capturing the common writing styles and sentence structures. Our experimental results show that the proposed NMT system can achieve a significant improvement on translating the IPO documents. More significantly, through a blind assessment by a translator expert, our system outperforms two mainstream commercial tools, the Google translator and SDL Trado for some IPO documents.

AB It is generally accepted that the performance of a statistical machine translation (SMT) system depends significantly on the concordance between the domain of training and test data. During the last years several methods have been proposed in order to deal with out-of-domain words. Less to no attention has been paid however to text genre within the same domain. In this paper we demonstrate that the style of the training corpus may influence the quality of the translation output even when the domain of the training and test data remains al-most unchanged, but the text genre changes. We use as training data the JRC-Acquis and as test data the Europarl corpus. We include also experiments with an out-of-domain test data, as comparison for the variation of performance of the SMT system.

TI Predicting the Linguistic Accessibility of Chinese Health Translations:
   Machine Learning Algorithm Development
SO JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS
AB Background: Linguistic accessibility has an important impact on the reception and utilization of translated health resources among multicultural and multilingual populations. Linguistic understandability of health translation has been understudied.
   Objective: Our study aimed to develop novel machine learning models for the study of the linguistic accessibility of health translations comparing Chinese translations of the World Health Organization health materials with original Chinese health resources developed by the Chinese health authorities.
   Methods: Using natural language processing tools for the assessment of the readability of Chinese materials, we explored and compared the readability of Chinese health translations from the World Health Organization with original Chinese materials from the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
   Results: A pairwise adjusted t test showed that the following 3 new machine learning models achieved statistically significant improvement over the baseline logistic regression in terms of area under the curve: C5.0 decision tree (95% CI -0.249 to -0.152; P<0.001), random forest (95% CI 0.139-0.239; P<0.001) and extreme gradient boosting tree (95% CI 0.099-0.193; P<0.001). There was, however, no significant difference between C5.0 decision tree and random forest (P=0.513). The extreme gradient boosting tree was the best model, achieving statistically significant improvement over the C5.0 model (P=0.003) and the random forest model (P=0.006) at an adjusted Bonferroni P value at 0.008.
   Conclusions: The development of machine learning algorithms significantly improved the accuracy and reliability of current approaches to the evaluation of the linguistic accessibility of Chinese health information, especially Chinese health translations in relation to original health resources. Although the new algorithms developed were based on Chinese health resources, they can be adapted for other languages to advance current research in accessible health translation, communication, and promotion.

In most of the literature of Hindi and Urdu, a noun marked with se is assigned instrumental or ablative case. So it is called instrumental and ablative case marker. But a close look at its distribution shows that apart from instrumental and ablative case function, it denotes other functions also and in each of these types, it is translated differently in Tamil.

TI A Novel Approach by Injecting CCG Supertags into an Arabic-English
   Factored Translation Machine
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB This study addresses the integration and incorporation of rich additional information into the phrase-based approach, aptly called factored translation, which is an extension of phrase-based statistic machine translation (PBSMT). This approach was proven successful when translating English into a morphologically rich language. PBSMT represents the baseline of this work. We extend the phrase-based translation approach by integrating additional linguistic knowledge, namely part-of-speech (POS) tags, to create a factored model. The main contribution of this study is the creation of a new approach for Arabic-English translation via the injection of the factored model into Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) supertags to form an integrated model (POS + CCG). The system was trained on a freely available multi-UN corpus on Arabic-English language pairs. Moses decoder, which is an open-source factored SMT system, was used to integrate these data into the target language model and the target side of the translation model. Results showed improvements to the BLEU automatic score via various high n-gram language models (LMs). The integration of the featured factors (POS + CCG) of the translation has been successfully tested. Overall, the 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-g LM evaluation with BLEU scores proved that our integrated model performed better than PBSMT. Compared with three other models (PBSMT, POS, and CCG models), the integrated model improved the translation quality by 1.54, 1.29, and 0.21 %, respectively, over the 3-g LM.

TI A Transformer-Based Neural Machine Translation Model for Arabic Dialects
   That Utilizes Subword Units
SO SENSORS
AB Languages that allow free word order, such as Arabic dialects, are of significant difficulty for neural machine translation (NMT) because of many scarce words and the inefficiency of NMT systems to translate these words. Unknown Word (UNK) tokens represent the out-of-vocabulary words for the reason that NMT systems run with vocabulary that has fixed size. Scarce words are encoded completely as sequences of subword pieces employing the Word-Piece Model. This research paper introduces the first Transformer-based neural machine translation model for Arabic vernaculars that employs subword units. The proposed solution is based on the Transformer model that has been presented lately. The use of subword units and shared vocabulary within the Arabic dialect (the source language) and modern standard Arabic (the target language) enhances the behavior of the multi-head attention sublayers for the encoder by obtaining the overall dependencies between words of input sentence for Arabic vernacular. Experiments are carried out from Levantine Arabic vernacular (LEV) to modern standard Arabic (MSA) and Maghrebi Arabic vernacular (MAG) to MSA, Gulf-MSA, Nile-MSA, Iraqi Arabic (IRQ) to MSA translation tasks. Extensive experiments confirm that the suggested model adequately addresses the unknown word issue and boosts the quality of translation from Arabic vernaculars to Modern standard Arabic (MSA).

TI Detecting Source Contextual Barriers for Understanding Neural Machine
   Translation
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB In machine translation evaluation, the traditional wisdom measures model's generalization ability in an average sense, for example by using corpus BLEU. However, the statistics of corpus BLEU cannot provide comprehensive understanding and fine-grained analysis on model's generalization ability. As a remedy, this paper attempts to understand NMT at fine-grained level, by detecting contextual barriers within an unseen input sentence that cause the degradation in model's translation quality. It proposes a principled definition of source contextual barriers as well as its modified version which is tractable in computation and operates at word-level. Based on the modified one, three simple methods are proposed for barrier detection by search-aware risk estimation through counterfactual generation. Extensive analyses are conducted on those detected contextual barrier words on both Zh double left right arrow En NIST benchmarks. Potential usages motivated from barrier words are also discussed.

AB The recently proposed BERT has demonstrated great power in various natural language processing tasks. However, the model does not perform effectively on cross-lingual tasks, especially on machine translation. In this work, we propose three methods to introduce pre-trained BERT into neural machine translation without fine-tuning. Our approach consists of a) a linear-attention aggregation that leverages a parameter matrix to capture the key knowledge of BERT, b) a self-attention aggregation which aims to learn what is vital for input and output, and c) a switch-gate aggregation to dynamically control the balance of the information flowing from the pre-trained BERT or the NMT model. We conduct experiments on several translation benchmarks and substantially improve over 2 BELU points on the IWSLT'14 English - German task with switch-gate aggregation method compared to a strong baseline, while our proposed model also performs remarkably on the other tasks.

AB We study the problem of incremental domain adaptation of a generic neural machine translation model with limited resources (e.g., budget and time) for human translations or model training. In this paper, we propose a novel query strategy for selecting "unlabeled" samples from a new domain based on sentence embeddings for Arabic. We accelerate the finetuning process of the generic model to the target domain. Specifically, our approach estimates the informativeness of instances from the target domain by comparing the distance of their sentence embeddings to embeddings from the generic domain. We perform machine translation experiments (Ar-to-En direction) for comparing a random sampling baseline with our new approach, similar to active learning, using two small update sets for simulating the work of human translators. For the prescribed setting we can save more than 50% of the annotation costs without loss in quality, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

AB Parallel corpus is an essential resource in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research, especially machine language translation. This paper presents the construction process of the Thai language and Isarn dialect bilingual parallel corpus, which includes word segmentation, translation and word alignment, part of speech (POS) tagging, and the parallel corpus design and construction. In the study, source sentences in Thai are segmented into a sequence of words by applying a Conditional Random Field (CRF) approach. We used the example and rule based Thai-Isarn machine translation system as a tool to generate the corresponding target sentence (Isarn dialect). The POS of each word is tagged using Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM). The source and target sentences with their POSs are validated by Isarn native speakers, who are expert in both Thai language and Isarn dialects. Lastly, the validated data were collected into the Thai-Isarn parallel corpus.

AB Word alignment is an important and fundamental task for building a statistical machine translation (SMT) system. However, obtaining word-level alignments in parallel corpora with high accuracy is still a challenge. In this paper, we propose a new method, which is based on constraint approach, to improve the quality of word alignment. Our experiments show that using constraints for the parameter estimation of the IBM models reduces the alignment error rate down to 7.26% and increases the BLEU score to 5%, in the case of translation from English to Vietnamese.

TI Source language classification of indirect translations
SO TARGET-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB One of the major barriers to the systematic study of indirect translation - that is, translations of translations - is the lack of efficient methods to identify these translations. In this article, we use supervised machine learning to examine whether computers can be harnessed to identify indirect translations. Our data consist of a monolingual comparable corpus that includes (1) nontranslated Finnish texts, (2) direct translations from English, French, German, Greek, and Swedish into Finnish, and (3) indirect translations from Greek (the ultimate source language) via English, French, German, and Swedish (mediating languages) into Finnish. We use n-grams of various types and lengths as feature sets and random forests as the statistical classification technique. To maximize the transferability of the method, the feature sets were implemented in accordance with the Universal Dependencies framework. This study confirms that computers can distinguish between translated and nontranslated Finnish, as well as between Finnish translations made from different source languages. Regarding indirect translations, the ultimate source language has a greater impact on the linguistic composition of indirect Finnish translations than their respective mediating languages. Hence, the indirect translations could not be reliably identified. Therefore, our results suggest that the reliable computational identification of indirect translations and their mediating languages requires a way to control for the effect of the ultimate source language.

TI Pre-Trained Word Embedding and Language Model Improve Multimodal Machine
   Translation: A Case Study in Multi30K
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Multimodal machine translation (MMT) is an attractive application of neural machine translation (NMT) that is commonly incorporated with image information. However, the MMT models proposed thus far have only comparable or slightly better performance than their text-only counterparts. One potential cause of this infeasibility is a lack of large-scale data. Most previous studies mitigate this limitation by employing large-scale textual parallel corpora, which are more accessible than multimodal parallel corpora, in various ways. However, these corpora are still available on only a limited scale in low-resource language pairs or domains. In this study, we leveraged monolingual (or multimodal monolingual) corpora, which are available at scale in most languages and domains, to improve MMT models. Our approach follows that of previous unimodal works that use monolingual corpora to train the word embedding or language model and incorporate them into NMT systems. While these methods demonstrated the advantage of using pre-trained representations, there is still room for MMT models to improve. To this end, our system employs debiasing procedures for the word embedding and multimodal extension of the language model (visual-language model, VLM) to make better use of the pre-trained knowledge in the MMT task. The results of evaluations conducted on the de facto MMT dataset for the English-German translation indicate that the improvement obtained using well-tailored word embedding and VLM is approximately +1.84 BLEU and +1.63 BLEU, respectively. The evaluation on multiple language pairs reveals their adoptability across the languages. Beyond the success of our system, we also conducted an extensive analysis on VLM manipulation and showed promising areas for developing better MMT models by exploiting VLM; some benefits brought by either modality are missing, and MMT with VLM generates less fluent translations. Our code is available at https://github.com/toshohirasawa/mmt-with-monolingual-data.

AB English-Manipuri MT is a challenging task because of the limited availability of parallel data and language divergences between English and Manipuri. This work investigates the English-Manipuri MT with different supervised and unsupervised methods of SMT and NMT. In the supervised approach, we have experimented on Phrase-based SMT and Transformer-based NMT. Furthermore, unsupervised methods are also examined, namely Unsupervised NMT(Artetxe et al.), Unsupervised SMT(Lample et al.), XLM(Cross-lingual Language Model Pretraining), and MASS(Masked Sequence to Sequence Pretraining). Common practices for improving low resource Machine Translation like Back-translation and Self-Training are also tried. Detailed error analysis and the challenges faced in the English-Manipuri MT system are also presented in this paper. The paper also explains how a new corpus of 74K parallel English-Manipuri sentences is constructed. This is the largest English-Manipuri parallel corpus reported till date.

We proposed a simple unsupervised metric, and additional supervised metrics which rely on contextual word embeddings to encode the translation and reference sentences. We find that these models rival or surpass all existing metrics in the WMT 2017 sentence-level and system-level tracks, and our trained model has a substantially higher correlation with human judgements than all existing metrics on the WMT 2017 to-English sentence level dataset.

TI Analysis of English Translation Model Based on Artificial Intelligence
   Attention Mechanism
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB The particularity and quantity of English translation terms have a great impact on the quality and e,ect of machine translation and can not meet the requirements of English translation of terms. At the same time, technical exchange and communication in di,erent,elds need the expression of professional terms. In addition, although the neural machine translation model has good translation performance, it is not ideal for target languages with small translation needs and limited corpus resources. In order to solve the problems existing in the English translation model, this paper constructs the transformer model by replacing the cyclic neural network variables and introducing the attention mechanism. The term information is integrated into two pretraining models to improve the learning ability of model language sentence relationship. Maintain the integrity of terminology information by fully completing the training. The experimental results show that, compared with the other three term translation models, the translation model in this paper has the advantage of term information. At the same time, the deep neural network English term translation model can obtain more,ne-grained word relevance. In di,erent corpora, the Bleu score of the model is good, showing obvious translation performance advantages. This study provides a good professional reference value for the translation of English terms.

AB South and North Korea both use the Korean language, but there are some differences in their linguistic aspects, such as vocabulary and spelling rules. Korean NLP research has focused on South Korean only, and existing NLP systems for the Korean language, such as neural machine translation (NMT) models, cannot properly handle North Korean input. Training a model using North Korean data is the most straightforward approach to solving this problem, but there is insufficient data to train NMT models. In this study, we create data for North Korean NMT models using a comparable corpus. First, we manually create evaluation data for automatic alignment and machine translation. Then, we investigate automatic alignment methods suitable for North Korean data. Finally, we verify that a model trained using North Korean bilingual data without human annotation can significantly increase North Korean translation accuracy compared to existing South Korean models in zero-shot settings.

Unlike the popular length normalization and coverage models, our model does not require training nor reranking the limited n-best outputs. Moreover, it is robust to large beam sizes, which is not well studied in previous work. On the Chinese-English and English-German translation tasks, our approach yields +0.4 similar to similar to 1.5 BLEU improvements over the state-of-the-art baselines.

AB Multi-source translation is an approach to exploit multiple inputs (e.g. in two different languages) to increase translation accuracy. In this paper, we examine approaches for multi-source neural machine translation (NMT) using an incomplete multilingual corpus in which some translations are missing. In practice, many multilingual corpora are not complete due to the difficulty to provide translations in all of the relevant languages (for example, in TED talks, most English talks only have subtitles for a small portion of the languages that TED supports). Existing studies on multi-source translation did not explicitly handle such situations. This study focuses on the use of incomplete multilingual corpora in multi-encoder NMT and mixture of NMT experts and examines a very simple implementation where missing source translations are replaced by a special symbol <NULL>. These methods allow us to use incomplete corpora both at training time and test time. In experiments with real incomplete multilingual corpora of TED Talks, the multi-source NMT with the tokens achieved higher translation accuracies measured by BLEU than those by any one-to-one NMT systems.

AB Although it has been always thought that Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) can be useful for Machine Translation, only recently efforts have been made towards integrating both tasks to prove that this assumption is valid, particularly for Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). While different approaches have been proposed and results started to converge in a positive way, it is not clear yet how these applications should be integrated to allow the strengths of both to be exploited. This paper aims to contribute to the recent investigation on the usefulness of WSD for SMT by using n-best reranking to efficiently integrate WSD with SMT. This allows using rich contextual WSD features, which is otherwise not done in current. SMT systems. Experiments with English-Portuguese translation in a syntactically motivated phrase-based SMT system and both symbolic and probabilistic WSD models showed significant improvements in BLEU scores.

AB A transfer based Machine Translation (MT) system is a large complex functional application where the job completion time is proportional to job size. When these applications are deployed on web with increasing translation load web user experience degrades. The end user has to wait unusually longer to get his first visible response. Generic layer 3 load balancing techniques does not help to improve the response time as each job is assigned similar compute resources irrespective of job size.
   This paper presents an engineering approach to deploy MT system on cloud platform using Storm, a distributed computing framework. This scheme, by utilizing the inherent parallelism of a functional application, not only reduces the job completion time considerably but it, also as a web application, gives very good user experience, viz., the first visible response time within an acceptable time limit, and the subsequent responses well before the user finishes perusing the preceding response. Using Storm framework a translation job is split into multiple job partitions and is streamed into the storm cluster such that first job partitions of all jobs are processed before the second partitions, i.e., all nth partitions of all jobs are processed before (n+1)th partitions. Thus machine translation system is able to produce translation output as a continuous stream, sentence by sentence, as soon as each sentence gets translated. The system maintains flow rate of translated sentences stream high enough so that the next translated sentence is produced well before the end user finishes reading the previous sentence, thereby providing very good user experience.
   There is a class of natural language processing (NLP) applications, viz., machine translation systems, text to speech systems, speech recognition systems, etc., that are functional in nature, and this engineering approach would be equally applicable to them as well.

TI ATLASLang NMT: Arabic text language into Arabic sign language neural
   machine translation
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB ATLASLang is a machine translation system from Arabic text language into Arabic sign language (ArSL). The first version of the system (Brour and Benabbou, 2019) is based on two approaches: rule-based Interlingua and example-based approaches. It is a classical machine translation system, its limitations are the linguistic knowledge necessary to develop the rules, also many rules and exceptions required. In the last few years, a neural machine translation has achieved notable results, and several wellknown companies including Google (Wu et al., 2016) and Systran (Crego et al., 2016) have starting to exploit it. In this paper, we present a new version of ATLASLang that is implemented using a feedforward back-propagation Artificial Neural Network. In this version, we have started to translate simple sentences composed from a limited number of words since generally communication with deaf person uses short sentences. We have used the same ATLASLang MTS database of signs and we have utilized morphological characteristics to derive the maximum information from each word in the input of the neural translation system. The two versions of the system are compared using n-gram BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002), and the results demonstrate that neuron network approaches outperform the other classical approaches.

AB Modern large-scale automation systems integrate thousands to hundreds of thousands of physical sensors and actuators. Demands for more flexible reconfiguration of production systems and optimization across different information models, standards and legacy systems challenge current system interoperability concepts. Automatic semantic translation across information models and standards is an increasingly important problem that needs to be addressed to fulfill these demands in a cost-efficient manner under constraints of human capacity and resources in relation to timing requirements and system complexity. Here we define a translator-based operational interoperability model for interacting cyber-physical systems in mathematical terms, which includes system identification and ontology-based translation as special cases. We present alternative mathematical definitions of the translator learning task and mappings to similar machine learning tasks and solutions based on recent developments in machine learning. Possibilities to learn translators between artefacts without a common physical context, for example in simulations of digital twins and across layers of the automation pyramid are briefly discussed.

AB While processing customers' feedback for an industrial company, one of the important tasks is the classification of customer inquiries. However, this task can produce a number of difficulties when the text of the message can be composed using a large number of languages. One of the solutions, in this case, is to determine the language of the text and translate it into a base language, for which the classifier will be developed. This paper compares open models for automatic translation of texts. The following models based on the Transformers architecture were selected for comparison: M2M100, mBART, OPUS-MT (Helsinki NLP). A test data set was formed containing texts specific to the subject area. Microsoft Azure Translation was chosen as the reference translation. Translations produced by each model were compared with the reference translation using two metrics: BLEU and METEOR. The possibility of fast fine-tuning of models was also investigated to improve the quality of the translation of texts in the problem area. Among the reviewed models, M2M100 turned out to be the best in terms of translation quality, but it is also the most difficult to fine-tune it.

AB In multilingual collaboration, a paucity of shared language and gaps in the language backgrounds of group members could bring about imbalanced participation, which is likely to hinder problem solving, idea generation and collaborative learning. This paper proposes a model of best balanced communication based on the Quality of Messages among participants using various languages. We describe a method for selecting the languages to be used with machine translators, and how to create the best balanced communication environment. Currently, many studies on machine translators and balancing conversations have been published, but none have attempted to balance asymmetric participation in multilingual groups. Our vision allows machine translation technologies to enhance the communication between humans with different language backgrounds in terms of balancing their participation. We conduct controlled experiments and find the proposed method successfully enables users to interact and communicate with better equality while minimizing the problems that can arise from machine translation usage.

AB This paper describes an approach to enhance statistical machine translation. This approach uses a two-phase decoder system; the first decoder which we call the initial decoder translates from English to Arabic and the second is a post-processing decoder that re-translates the initial's decoder Arabic output to Arabic again to fix some of the translation errors. This new technique showed to be useful when trying to translate corpus from a different context other than the original corpus used in the training of the initial decoder. We recorded a BLEU score enhancement on out-of-context corpus close to 10 BLEU points on UN corpus and 2 BLEU points on TED 2013 corpus.

We follow the strategy of Artetxe et al. (2018b), creating a seed phrase-based system where the phrase table is initialized from cross-lingual embedding mappings trained on monolingual data, followed by a neural machine translation system trained on synthetic parallel data. The synthetic corpus was produced from a monolingual corpus by a tuned PBMT model refined through iterative back-translation. We further focus on the handling of named entities, i.e. the part of vocabulary where the cross-lingual embedding mapping suffers most. Our system reaches a BLEU score of 15.3 on the German-Czech WMT19 shared task.

SO DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY
AB Machine translation is widely used in people's daily lives and production, occupying an important position. In order to improve the accuracy of the literary intelligent translation, research on literary intelligent translation is based on the improved optimization model. Based on semantic features, the semantic ontology optimization model including an encoder and a decoder is created by machine translation. In order to improve the accuracy of the intelligent translation literature of the semantic ontology optimization model, the conversion layer, including the forward neural network layer, residual connection layer, and normalization layer, is added between the encoder and decoder of the semantic ontology optimization model. An improved optimization model is established, and syntax conversion is realized by using the conversion layer, which completes the intelligent translation of literature. It is found that the BLEU value of using this method to translate literary sentences can reach 17.23 when the number of training steps is set as 8000, and the training time is low. The translation result has a low correlation misalignment rate, which can meet the user's literary translation needs.

AB Computer-Assisted Translation (CAT) is an alternative approach to Machine Translation, that integrates human expertise into the automatic translation process. In this framework, a human translator interacts with a translation system that dynamically offers a list of translations that best completes the part of the sentence already translated. Stochastic finite-state transducer technology is proposed to support this CAT system. The system was assessed on two real tasks of different complexity in several languages.

AB Machine Comprehension (MC) is a novel task of question answering (QA) discipline. MC tests the ability of the machine to read a text and comprehend its meaning. Deep learning in MC manages to build an end-to-end paradigm based on new neural networks to directly compute the deep semantic matching among question, answers, and the corresponding passage. Deep learning gives state-of-the-art performance results for English MC. The MC problem has not been addressed yet for the Arabic language due to the lack of Arabic MC datasets. This paper presents the first Arabic MC dataset that results from the translation of the SQuAD v1.1 dataset and applying a proposed approach that combines partial translation post-editing and semi-supervised learning. We intend to make this dataset publicly available for the research community. Furthermore, we use the resultant dataset to build an end-to-end deep learning Arabic MC models, which showed promising results.

TI Revisiting Multi-Domain Machine Translation
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB When building machine translation systems, one often needs to make the best out of heterogeneous sets of parallel data in training, and to robustly handle inputs from unexpected domains in testing. This multi-domain scenario has attracted a lot of recent work that fall under the general umbrella of transfer learning. In this study, we revisit multi-domain machine translation, with the aim to formulate the motivations for developing such systems and the associated expectations with respect to performance. Our experiments with a large sample of multi-domain systems show that most of these expectations are hardly met and suggest that further work is needed to better analyze the current behaviour of multi-domain systems and to make them fully hold their promises.

The Minimum Phone Error (MPE) training method is employed for building the discriminative ASR acoustic models and a Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based method is used for MT. The experiments are performed on a two-way English/Dialectal-Arabic speech-to-speech (S2S) translation task in the military/medical domain. We demonstrate the relationship between ASR and MT performance measured by BLEU and human judgment for both directions of the translation. Moreover, we question the use of BLEU metric for assessing the MT quality, present our observations and draw some conclusions.

We start by updating previous definitions of comparable corpora and then look at bilingual versions of continuous vector space models. Recently, neural networks have been used to obtain latent context representations with only few dimensions which are often called word embeddings. These promising new techniques cannot only be applied to parallel but also to comparable corpora. Subsequent sections of the paper discuss work specifically targeting at machine translation using comparable corpora, as well as work dealing with the extraction of parallel segments from comparable corpora. Finally, we give an overview on the design and the results of a recent shared task on measuring document comparability across languages.

AB Adopting the regression SVM framework, this paper proposes a linguistically motivated feature engineering strategy to develop an MT evaluation metric with a better correlation with human assessments. In contrast to current practices of "greedy" combination of all available features, six features are suggested according to the human intuition for translation quality. Then the contribution of linguistic features is examined and analyzed via a hill-climbing strategy. Experiments indicate that, compared to either the SVM-ranking model or the previous attempts on exhaustive linguistic features, the regression SVM model with six linguistic information based features generalizes across different datasets better, and augmenting these linguistic features with proper non-linguistic metrics can achieve additional improvements.

Such information is abundantly available but has not been fully utilized in previous work of context based bilingual word embedding models, which only exploit local contextual information through a short window sequence at the word level. To incorporate such information, we define a sentence similarity matching objective which is enforced as a constraint into the original bilingual word embedding objective. They are jointly optimized to better learn the bilingual word embedding. Experimental results show that the proposed model is superior to previous methods on machine translation quality.

In the training phrase, we maximize the distance between the similarity scores of high and low-quality hypotheses. Then, the trained neural network is used to evaluate the new hypotheses in the testing phase. The proposed metric can efficiently incorporate lexical and syntactic metrics as features in the network and thus is able to capture different levels of linguistic information. Experiments on WMT-14 show state-of-the-art performance is achieved in two out of five language pairs on the system-level and one on the segment-level. Comparative results are also achieved in the remaining language pairs.

SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
AB This work explores the application of minimum description length (MDL) inference to estimate the parameters of phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) models. In comparison with current inference techniques that rely on a long decoupled pipeline with multiple heuristic steps, MDL is a well-founded theoretically sound approach whose empirical results are however below those of the heuristically motivated state-of-the-art training pipeline. We identify potential limitations of MDK inference when applied to natural language and propose practical approaches to overcome them when inferring SMT models. The evaluation in a Spanish-to-English translation task demonstrates that MDL inference can be adapted to yield a performance close to the state of the art.

AB The pipeline of most Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation (PB-SMT) systems starts from automatically word aligned parallel corpus. But word appears to be too fine-grained in some cases such as non-compositional phrasal equivalences, where no clear word alignments exist. Using words as inputs to PBSMT pipeline has inborn deficiency. This paper proposes pseudo-word as a new start point for PB-SMT pipeline. Pseudo-word is a kind of basic multi-word expression that characterizes minimal sequence of consecutive words in sense of translation. By casting pseudo-word searching problem into a parsing framework, we search for pseudo-words in a monolingual way and a bilingual synchronous way. Experiments show that pseudo-word significantly outperforms word for PB-SMT model in both travel translation domain and news translation domain.

However, the standard neural machine translation (NMT) models do not explicitly model the hypotactic relationship between clauses, which usually leads to structurally incorrect translations of long and complex sentences. This problem is particularly noticeable on Chinese-to-English translation task of complex sentences due to the grammatical form distinction between English and Chinese. English is rich in grammatical form (e.g. verb morphological changes and subordinating conjunctions) while Chinese is poor in grammatical form. These linguistic phenomena make it a challenge for NMT to learn the hypotactic structure knowledge from Chinese as well as the structure alignment between Chinese and English. To address these issues, we propose to model the hypotactic structure for Chinese-to-English complex sentence translation by introducing hypotactic structure knowledge. Specifically, we annotate and build a hypotactic structure aligned parallel corpus that provides rich hypotactic structure knowledge for NMT. Moreover, we further propose a structureinfused neural framework to combine the hypotactic structure knowledge with the NMT model through two integrating strategies. In particular, we introduce a specific structure-aware loss to encourage the NMT model to better learn the structure knowledge. Experimental results on WMT17, WMT18 and WMT19 Chinese-to-English translation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

TI Machine Translation System Using Deep Learning for English to Urdu
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB Machine translation is an ongoing field of research from the last decades. The main aim of machine translation is to remove the language barrier. Earlier research in this field started with the direct word-to-word replacement of source language by the target language. Later on, with the advancement in computer and communication technology, there was a paradigm shift to data-driven models like statistical and neural machine translation approaches. In this paper, we have used a neural network-based deep learning technique for English to Urdu languages. Parallel corpus sizes of around 30923 sentences are used. The corpus contains sentences from English-Urdu parallel corpus, news, and sentences which are frequently used in day-to-day life. The corpus contains 542810 English tokens and 540924 Urdu tokens, and the proposed system is trained and tested using 70:30 criteria. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed system, several automatic evaluation metrics are used, and the model output is also compared with the output from Google Translator. The proposed model has an average BLEU score of 45.83.

AB Neural machine translation (NMT) is becoming a common resource both for professional translators and for people who need small, occasional translations. The wide use of NMT for professional purposes reshapes the conditions of translation assignments. Moreover, the effects on the target text and language are not well known, although some studies already suggest a stronger influence of the source language on them. On the other hand, since many NMT tools are easily and freely available and even accessible via mobile devices, they are being increasingly used by non-professionals to carry out short translations mostly. These occasional translators use these tools both to understand a text originally written in a language they do not fluently speak (translation into their first language) and to publish a text in the language they do not master (translation into their second language or even into a language in which the user has poor or no knowledge at all). Finally, NMT is also present in everyday digital products even without users being aware of its intervention, for example in specific apps on smart devices. This article proposes a reflection on the effects of NMT in all these scenarios, with a special focus on the effects on the reception of the target text and on the target language standard.

AB We present an integrated phrase segmentation/alignment algorithm (ISA) for Statistical Machine Translation. Without the need of building an initial word-to-word alignment or initially segmenting the monolingual text into phrases as other methods do, this algorithm segments the sentences into phrases and finds their alignments simultaneously. For each sentence pair, ISA builds a two-dimensional matrix to represent a sentence pair where the value of each cell corresponds to the Point-wise Mutual Information (MI) between the source and target words. Based on the similarities of MI values among cells, we identify the aligned phrase pairs. Once all the phrase pairs are found, we know both how to segment one sentence into phrases and also the alignments between the source and target sentences. We use monolingual bigram language models to estimate the Joint probabilities of the identified phrase pairs. The Joint probabilities are then normalized to conditional probabilities, which are used by the decoder. Despite its simplicity, this approach yields phrase-to-phrase translations with significant higher precisions than our baseline system where phrase translations are extracted from the HMM word alignment. When we combine the phrase-to-phrase translations generated by this algorithm with the baseline system, the improvement on translation quality is even larger.

AB This article points out some "loopholes" in the traditional Chinese-English translation theories, and proposes several transcreation theories to countermeasure the "loopholes", illustrating non-equivalences. In particular, the article proposes a novel translation/transcreation theory that incorporates the writing field, in both the source and target languages, into the traditional translation field. This is for the purpose of cultural transmission and integration. In addition, the article illustrates the relationship between translation and writing by dissecting the translation/transcreation process into two processes: understanding and writing. Moreover, it suggests that the transcreation field develop some criteria, such as: fidelity, flexibility and creativity, and that all the science, social science and humanities subareas in the transcreation field are categorized according to these criteria. In order to support the transcreation theories and multidisciplinary translation theories proposed in this article, some typical examples and transcreation techniques that push the envelope of existing transcreation theories are provided. This article may shed new light on the limitations of, and possible solutions to, machine translation. It may also answer questions like: "Is understanding unimportant to machine translation?"

TI Revisiting Negation in Neural Machine Translation
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB In this paper, we evaluate the translation of negation both automatically and manually, in English-German (EN-DE) and EnglishChinese (EN-ZH). We show that the ability of neural machine translation (NMT) models to translate negation has improved with deeper and more advanced networks, although the performance varies between language pairs and translation directions. The accuracy of manual evaluation in EN -> DE, DE -> EN, EN -> ZH, and ZH -> EN is 95.7%, 94.8%, 93.4%, and 91.7%, respectively. In addition, we show that under-translation is the most significant error type in NMT, which contrasts with the more diverse error profile previously observed for statistical machine translation. To better understand the root of the undertranslation of negation, we study the model's information flow and training data. While our information flow analysis does not reveal any deficiencies that could be used to detect or fix the under-translation of negation, we find that negation is often rephrased during training, which could make it more difficult for the model to learn a reliable link between source and target negation. We finally conduct intrinsic analysis and extrinsic probing tasks on negation, showing that NMT models can distinguish negation and non-negation tokens very well and encode a lot of information about negation in hidden states but nevertheless leave room for improvement.

AB Recent studies in the field of Machine Translation (MT) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have shown that existing models amplify biases observed in the training data. The amplification of biases in language technology has mainly been examined with respect to specific phenomena, such as gender bias. In this work, we go beyond the study of gender in MT and investigate how bias amplification might affect language in a broader sense. We hypothesize that the `algorithmic bias', i.e. an exacerbation of frequently observed patterns in combination with a loss of less frequent ones, not only exacerbates societal biases present in current datasets but could also lead to an artificially impoverished language: `machine translationese'. We assess the linguistic richness (on a lexical and morphological level) of translations created by different data-driven MT paradigms - phrase-based statistical (PB-SMT) and neural MT (NMT). Our experiments show that there is a loss of lexical and morphological richness in the translations produced by all investigated MT paradigms for two language pairs (EN$FR and EN$ES).

AB Off-the-shelf pre-trained Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are an increasingly viable service for companies of any size building speech-based products. While these ASR systems are trained on large amounts of data, domain mismatch is still an issue for many such parties that want to use this service as-is leading to not so optimal results for their task. We propose a simple technique to perform domain adaptation for ASR error correction via machine translation. The machine translation model is a strong candidate to learn a mapping from out-of-domain ASR errors to in-domain terms in the corresponding reference files. We use two off-the-shelf ASR systems in this work: Google ASR (commercial) and the ASPIRE model (open-source). We observe 7% absolute improvement in word error rate and 4 point absolute improvement in BLEU score in Google ASR output via our proposed method. We also evaluate ASR error correction via a downstream task of Speaker Diarization that captures speaker style, syntax, structure and semantic improvements we obtain via ASR correction.

AB Speech understanding through concept classification offers a possible way of machine translation in speech-to-speech translation systems and can be used in conjunction with conventional statistical machine translation. While correct concept classification offers the promise of obtaining well-formed target language speech output, the approach does not scale well to large number of concepts. Importantly, it is also critical to know when to accept or reject the classifier. We formulate the speech classification as a MAP estimation problem to derive the understanding model and improve its performance by incorporating dialog context information. Specifically, for a two-way speech translation system, a classification scheme is derived here that utilizes context information from both sides of the conversation through an n-gram dialog model. The method was evaluated using data from an English-Farsi trans-lingual doctor-patient dialog system and its classification and rejection accuracies were compared to those of a baseline system with an understanding model only. The benefit of incorporating context with the proposed dialog model provided a modest improvement in classification accuracy (about 5% relative error reduction) and a significant improvement in the rejection accuracy (up to 31.4% relative reduction in error).

AB Generalised access to the Internet and globalisation has led to increased demand for translation services and a resurgence in the use of machine translation (MT) systems. MT post-editing or the correction of MT output to an acceptable standard is known to be one of the ways to face the huge demand on multilingual communication. Given that the use of translation and MT post-editing are increasing the demand for language-skilled professionals, in this article we aim at evaluating the use of MT post-editing in the foreign language class. For this purpose we make use of computer-aided error analysis (CEA) to extract patterns of error found in translation and MT post-editing into the foreign language. This methodology will provide some insights as to the main difficulties found by the students in post-editing into the foreign language and about the suitability of using raw MT output as input for foreign language written production. Thus, a comparative analysis of error frequency is performed on the results of a group of advanced students of Spanish doing post-editing as compared to another group doing translation in order to gauge the level of difficulty of MT post-editing as opposed to translation into the foreign language.

TI Using metrics from complex networks to evaluate machine translation
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB Establishing metrics to assess machine translation (MT) systems automatically is now crucial owing to the widespread use of MT over the web. In this study we show that such evaluation can be done by modeling text as complex networks. Specifically, we extend our previous work by employing additional metrics of complex networks, whose results were used as input for machine learning methods and allowed MT texts of distinct qualities to be distinguished. Also shown is that the node-to-node mapping between source and target texts (English-Portuguese and Spanish-Portuguese pairs) can be improved by adding further hierarchical levels for the metrics out-degree, in-degree, hierarchical common degree, cluster coefficient, inter-ring degree, intra-ring degree and convergence ratio. The results presented here amount to a proof-of-principle that the possible capturing of a wider context with the hierarchical levels may be combined with machine learning methods to yield an approach for assessing the quality of MT systems.

AB Pre-training method has been proved to significantly improve the performance of low-resource neural machine translation (NMT), while the common pre-training methods (BERT) uses attention mechanism based on Levenshtein distance (LD) to extract language features, which ignored syntax-related information. In this paper, we proposed a machine translation pre-training method with semantic perception which depend on the traditional position-based modeling, we uses semantic role labels (SRL) to annotate sentences with "predicate-argument" structures at the word level, and merge vectorized SRL with word vectors to deepen the model's understanding of deep semantics. In addition, to avoid parameter disaster, we proposed a hierarchical knowledge distillation method to fuse the NMT model and pre-training model to adapt to the output probability distribution of the pre-training model. We validated the method in the LDC En-Zh and CCMT2017 Mongolia-Chinese (Mo-Ch), Uyghur-Chinese (Uy-Ch), Tibetan-Chinese (Ti-Ch) tasks. The results show that compared with baseline, our model achieves significant results, which fully illustrates the generalization of the method.

TI Learning finite-state models for machine translation
SO MACHINE LEARNING
AB In formal language theory, finite-state transducers are well-know models for simple "input-output" mappings between two languages. Even if more powerful, recursive models can be used to account for more complex mappings, it has been argued that the input-output relations underlying most usual natural language pairs can essentially be modeled by finite-state devices. Moreover, the relative simplicity of these mappings has recently led to the development of techniques for learning finite-state transducers from a training set of input-output sentence pairs of the languages considered. In the last years, these techniques have lead to the development of a number of machine translation systems. Under the statistical statement of machine translation, we overview here how modeling, learning and search problems can be solved by using stochastic finite-state transducers. We also review the results achieved by the systems we have developed under this paradigm. As a main conclusion of this review we argue that, as task complexity and training data scarcity increase, those systems which rely more on statistical techniques tend produce the best results.

AB This paper describes and evaluates a grammar- based machine translation system for the Swedish-Danish language pair. Source-language structural analysis, polysemy resolution, syntactic movement rules and targetlanguage agreement are based on Constraint Grammar morphosyntactic tags and dependency trees. Lexical transfer rules exploit dependency links to access contextual information, such as syntactic argument function, semantic type and quantifiers, or to integrate verbal features, e.g. diathesis and auxiliaries. Out-ofvocabulary words are handled by derivational and compound analysis with a combined coverage of 99.3%, as well as systematic morpho-phonemic transliterations for the remaining cases. The system achieved BLEU scores of 0.65-0.8 depending on references and outperformed both STMT and RBMT competitors by a large margin.

AB This paper presents a method to handle difference of Thai and English language in an alignment process for statistical machine translation (SMT). By identification of grammar notations within both texts, the method can analyze a type of the grammatical attribute and differently handle both Thai and English words accordingly based on linguistic knowledge. This method works as a pre-process of a standard co-occurrence alignment, GIZA. An experimental result showed that this method gained 48% higher accuracy result than the widely used conventional alignment. We can conclude that a different grammatical attribute should be pre-process handled since this issue greatly affects the result of bilingual alignment and SMT.

TI Proteins shared by the transcription and translation machines
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB It is becoming increasingly clear that the complex machines involved in transcription and translation, the two major activities leading to gene expression, communicate directly with one another by sharing proteins. For some proteins, such as ribosomal proteins S10 and L4, there is strong evidence of their participation in both processes, and much is known about their role in both activities. The exact roles and interactions of other proteins, such as Nus factors B and G, in both transcription and translation remain a mystery. Although there are not, at present, many examples of such shared proteins, the importance of understanding their behavior and intimate involvement with two major cellular machines is beginning to be appreciated. Studies related to the dual activities of these proteins and searches for more examples of proteins shared between the transcription and translation machines should lead to a better understanding of the communication between these two activities and the purposes it serves.

TI Using Dependency-Based Contextualization for transferring Passive
   Constructions from English to Spanish
SO PROCESAMIENTO DEL LENGUAJE NATURAL
AB We hypothesize that parallel corpora as well as machine translation outputs contain many literal translations that are the result of transferring the constructions of the source language to the target language. When translating passive expressions from English to Spanish, there are several constructions available, however, both automatic and human (if of low quality) translations tend to select the periphrastic structure, which is the literal construction. The objective of this article is to make use of strategies trained on monolingual corpora to translate English passive expressions into Spanish so as to verify whether unsupervised translation with monolingual corpora benefits syntactic diversity. Special attention will be given to the monolingual-based strategy relying on dependency-based contextualization. The results of the experiments carried out show that the methods relying on monolingual corpora tend to offer more non-literal translations (middle-voice) than those trained on parallel corpora.

AB The advent of the World Wide Web and the ensuing growth in the popularity of the Internet have all but removed the significance of geographic borders in information sharing. The barriers that do remain are primarily linguistic and cultural. This has created a huge demand for translation. The dynamic nature of the Internet, and the unreliability of the information to be found there, means that translation needs to be carried out cheaply and quickly. This paper reviews the current state of the art in multilingual information processing in general and machine translation technology in particular The work at Adastral Park to develop an 'Interlingual' machine translation system to assist with authoring multilingual documents is described.

AB This paper introduces the Alibaba NLP team's system for NLPCC 2018 shared task of Chinese Grammatical Error Correction (GEC). Chinese as a Second Language (CSL) learners can use this system to correct grammatical errors in texts they wrote. We proposed a method to combine statistical and neural models for the GEC task. This method consists of two modules: the correction module and the combination module. In the correction module, two statistical models and one neural model generate correction candidates for each input sentence. Those two statistical models are a rule-based model and a statistical machine translation (SMT)-based model. The neural model is a neural machine translation (NMT)-based model. In the combination module, we implemented it in a hierarchical manner. We first combined models at a lower level, which means we trained several models with different configurations and combined them. Then we combined those two statistical models and a neural model at the higher level. Our system reached the second place on the leaderboard released by the official.

AB Conventional Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models benefit from the training with an additional agent, e.g., dual learning, and bidirectional decoding with one agent decoding from left to right and the other decoding in the opposite direction. In this paper, we extend the training framework to the multi-agent scenario by introducing diverse agents in an interactive updating process. At training time, each agent learns advanced knowledge from others, and they work together to improve translation quality. Experimental results on NIST Chinese-English, IWSLT 2014 German-English, WMT 2014 English-German and large-scale Chinese-English translation tasks indicate that our approach achieves absolute improvements over the strong baseline systems and shows competitive performance on all tasks.

AB This paper presents an approximation algorithm for word-replacement under a bi-gram language model. Words replacement is an key step in the decoding part of statistical machine translation. However, the word or phrase replacement step is often done at the same time with the target language generating process in machine translation while our algorithm focus on the special replacement model without the target language generating process. We firstly make a reduction from the famous NP-Complete problem Hamiltonian Path Problem to the word-replacement problem. Then we apply the approximation algorithm for Hamiltonian Path on the word-replacement problem, which gives us a good performance in the designed experiment.

AB Most existing simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) systems are trained and evaluated on offline translation corpora. We argue that SiMT systems should be trained and tested on real interpretation data. To illustrate this argument, we propose an interpretation test set and conduct a realistic evaluation of SiMT trained on offline translations. Our results, on our test set along with 3 existing smaller scale language pairs, highlight the difference of up-to 13.83 BLEU score when SiMT models are evaluated on translation vs interpretation data. In the absence of interpretation training data, we propose a translationto-interpretation (T2I) style transfer method which allows converting existing offline translations into interpretation-style data, leading to up-to 2.8 BLEU improvement. However, the evaluation gap remains notable, calling for constructing large-scale interpretation corpora better suited for evaluating and developing SiMT systems.(1)

AB With the availability of large amounts of multilingual documents, Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) has become an active research area in recent years. However, researchers often face with the problem of inherent ambiguities involved in natural languages. Moreover, this task is even more challenging for processing the Chinese language because word boundaries are not defined in the sentence. This paper presents a Chinese-Portuguese query translation for CLIR based on a Machine Translation (MT) system that parses Constraint Synchronous Grammar (CSG). Unlike traditional transfer-based MT architectures, this model only requires a set of CSG rules for modeling syntactic structures of two languages simultaneously to perform the translation. Moreover, CSG can be used to remove different levels of disambiguation as the parsing processes in order to generate a translation with quality.

We also describe a model for word sense disambiguation (WSD) task inside the NIT system, which uses decision trees automatically learned from a training data set, as its disambiguation formalism. Our evaluations can be divided into two different categories: evaluation on the whole MT system and evaluation on the WSD component. The experiments on the whole MT, shows that this system gets 16% with respect to NIST measure, while the evaluation on WSD using a corpus contains 860 aligned sentences shows that this component disambiguates 81.4% of ambiguous word correctly.

AB Regularization of neural machine translation is still a significant problem, especially in low-resource settings. To mollify this problem, we propose regressing word embeddings (ReWE) as a new regularization technique in a system that is jointly trained to predict the next word in the translation (categorical value) and its word embedding (continuous value). Such a joint training allows the proposed system to learn the distributional properties represented by the word embeddings, empirically improving the generalization to unseen sentences. Experiments over three translation datasets have showed a consistent improvement over a strong baseline, ranging between 0:91 and 2:54 BLEU points, and also a marked improvement over a state-of-the-art system.

The translation module is a part of an adaptable corpus tool and is implemented as a separate microservice. This translation module provides for the linguist and translator the ability to translate texts with conveying their style. The translation module is domain-specific oriented which allows to convey text style better than public cloud translation services. In this research religious and historical texts were analyzed. Neural machine translation method was justified and used. Sequence to sequence Transformer model as a neural network model was chosen. All stages of text processing by the Transformer model which based on the Multi-Head Attention mechanism were analyzed. Software libraries and toolkits for the Sequence to sequence Transformer model were analyzed and chosen. Based on chosen software libraries implemented own Transformer model implementation. Developed model comprises text preprocessing and neural network model implementation. Cost-efficient computer system which comprises hardware and software components for neural network model training was configured. Based on heuristic approach by carrying out computational experiments neural network model hyper-parameters were chosen and justified. Loss function, learning rate, perplexity and BLEU as a key model training criterion were analyzed and applied. Training and test samples of text data sets were prepared. Training and test data sets comprise language pairs of Ukrainian text fragments and their English equivalents. Configured neural network model was trained and tested. Automatic assessment approach of trained model which based on semantic closeness was suggested and tested.

AB The state of the art in machine translation (MT) is governed by neural approaches, which typically provide superior translation accuracy over statistical approaches. However, on the closely related task of word alignment, traditional statistical word alignment models often remain the go-to solution. In this paper, we present an approach to train a Transformer model to produce both accurate translations and alignments. We extract discrete alignments from the attention probabilities learnt during regular neural machine translation model training and leverage them in a multi-task framework to optimize towards translation and alignment objectives. We demonstrate that our approach produces competitive results compared to GIZA++ trained IBM alignment models without sacrificing translation accuracy and outperforms previous attempts on Transformer model based word alignment. Finally, by incorporating IBM model alignments into our multi-task training, we report significantly better alignment accuracies compared to GIZA++ on three publicly available data sets. Our implementation has been open-sourced(1).

   nomenclatures .1. A study of the problem
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND COMPUTER SCIENCES
AB The treatment of errors generated in the transmission of chemical information from humans to machines is examined. Every type of human-machine communication requires a translation subprocess to deal with the various possible representations of knowledge; the present study was designed to consider errors occurring in such a subsystem. Regardless of the model employed, translation of knowledge is performed over several successive stages; at each stage different types of errors may be detected. A method is proposed to classify these errors according to the stage at which they occur, thus facilitating the generalization of the process. An analysis of errors occurring during the translation of inorganic chemical names is also presented. The particular grammatical features of different nomenclatures would require a study of the errors appearing in the human-machine communication process in modem chemistry-oriented systems, a problem which has only been touched upon in the systems proposed to date. Attention here is centered on lexicographic errors, since that stage of the translation process is completely independent of the model employed and might thus be useful in a more general sense.

AB It is crucial to provide an inter-sentence context in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models for higher-quality translation. With the aim of using a simple approach to incorporate inter-sentence information, we propose mini-batch embedding (MBE) as a way to represent the features of sentences in a mini-batch. We construct a mini-batch by choosing sentences from the same document, and thus the MBE is expected to have contextual information across sentences. Here, we incorporate MBE in an NMT model, and our experiments show that the proposed method consistently outperforms the translation capabilities of strong baselines and improves writing style or terminology to fit the document's context.(1)

AB In this paper, we describe a phrase-based unigram model for statistical machine translation that uses a much simpler set of model parameters than similar phrase-based models. The units of translation are blocks - pairs of phrases. During decoding, we use a block unigram model and a word-based trigram language model. During training, the blocks are learned from source interval projections using an underlying high-precision word alignment. The system performance is significantly increased by applying a novel block extension algorithm using an additional high-recall word alignment. The blocks are further filtered using unigram-count selection criteria. The system has been successfully test on a Chinese-English and an Arabic-English translation task.

AB Machine Translation ( MT) systems do not have real-world knowledge or contextual awareness. MT errors are possible at any level: lexical, grammatical, syntactic, etc., MT systems give 10-70 % accurate output, so human post-editing (HPE) is required for final output. But HPE is very expensive and slow, if we can filter out good translations out of all translations, those can make correct via miner edits then our HPE would be fast and less expensive. We can estimate good quality of a sentence using language model (LM). There are different LMs available. We showed in our experiment that Kneser-Ney smoothing LM is the right choice for measuring MT-Engine-output's quality for the post-editing.

AB Subword regularizations use multiple subword segmentations during training to improve the robustness of neural machine translation models. In previous subword regularizations, we use multiple segmentations in the training process but use only one segmentation in the inference. In this study, we propose an inference strategy to address this discrepancy. The proposed strategy approximates the marginalized likelihood by using multiple segmentations including the most plausible segmentation and several sampled segmentations. Because the proposed strategy aggregates predictions from several segmentations, we can regard it as a single model ensemble that does not require any additional cost for training. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy improves the performance of models trained with subword regularization in low-resource machine translation tasks.

AB This paper proposed a method for recognizing and transforming the elementsub-sentence (ESS) to improve the patent machine translation performance. By analyzing the format of Chinese element sub-sentences, we extracted description features and created the recognition rules. By comparing Chinese and English element sub-sentences, we sumarized the differences between them and correspondence law, and then created the transformation rules based on that. The method was applied to an existing MT system. Experiment showed that the method can effectively recognize and transform element sub-sentences, and further increase the BLUE-3 and BLUE-4 of patent sentence containing ESS by 9.9% and 7.9% respectively.

AB Passive voice is widely used in English while it is less used in Chinese, which is more prevalent in patent documents. The difference requires us to transform the voice in Chinese-English machine translation in order to make the result more smooth and natural. Previous studies in this field are based on statistics, but the effect is not very good. In this paper we propose a strategy to deal with the Chinese-English passive voice transformation from the perspective of semantic. Through analyzing the sentences, a series of transformation rules are summarized. Then we test them in our system. Experiment results show that the transformation rules can achieve an accuracy of 89.1% overall.

TI Deep Learning Methods for Sign Language Translation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ACCESSIBLE COMPUTING
AB Many sign languages are bona fide natural languages with grammatical rules and lexicons hence can benefit from machine translation methods. Similarly, since sign language is a visual-spatial language, it can also benefit from computer vision methods for encoding it. With the advent of deep learning methods in recent years, significant advances have been made in natural language processing (specifically neural machine translation) and in computer vision methods (specifically image and video captioning). Researchers have therefore begun expanding these learning methods to sign language understanding. Sign language interpretation is especially challenging, because it involves a continuous visual-spatial modality where meaning is often derived based on context.
   The focus of this article, therefore, is to examine various deep learning-based methods for encoding sign language as inputs, and to analyze the efficacy of several machine translation methods, over three different sign language datasets. The goal is to determine which combinations are sufficiently robust for sign language translation without any gloss-based information.
   To understand the role of the different input features, we perform ablation studies over the model architectures (input features + neural translation models) for improved continuous sign language translation. These input features include body and finger joints, facial points, as well as vector representations/embeddings from convolutional neural networks. The machine translation models explored include several baseline sequenceto-sequence approaches, more complex and challenging networks using attention, reinforcement learning, and the transformer model. We implement the translation methods over multiple sign languages-German (GSL), American (ASL), and Chinese sign languages (CSL). From our analysis, the transformer model combined with input embeddings from ResNet50 or pose-based landmark features outperformed all the other sequence-to-sequence models by achieving higher BLEU2-BLEU4 scores when applied to the controlled and constrained GSL benchmark dataset. These combinations also showed significant promise on the other less controlled ASL and CSL datasets.

TI Risk management and post-editing competence
SO JOURNAL OF SPECIALISED TRANSLATION
AB Post-editing machine translation has become an important part of the translation industry in recent years. Although some aspects of the post-editing (PE) task are similar to translation from scratch, some considerations concerning the task and competences required of the post-editor differ. In this article, we want to focus on three important aspects of PE. First, we want to relate translation risk management considerations to the PE task. Based on this, we want to introduce a decision model for PE jobs that will help to decide whether a translation job should be done with machine translation (MT) systems, which includes factors like text type, the MT system, the required quality of the final text, turnaround time and life span of the translation. Although these decisions often have to be made by customers or project managers, they also indicate various competences required of a post-editor, which differ to some degree from competences that a translator or reviser needs. Hence, after revising existing translation and revision competence models, we will outline our own post-editing competence model.

AB In Statistical Machine Translation, some complex features are still difficult to integrate during decoding and usually used through the reranking of the k-best hypotheses produced by the decoder. We propose a translation table partitioning method that exploits the result of this reranking to iteratively guide the decoder in order to produce a new k-best list more relevant to some complex features. We report experiments on two translation domains and two translations directions which yield improvements of up to 1.4 BLEU over the reranking baseline using the same set of complex features. On a practical viewpoint, our approach allows SMT system developers to easily integrate complex features into decoding rather than being limited to their use in one-time k-best list reranking.

AB Target word selection is one of the most important and difficult tasks in English-Korean Machine Translation. It effects on the overall translation accuracy of machine translation systems. In this paper, we present a new approach to Korean target word selection for an English noun with translation ambiguities using multiple knowledge such as verb frame patterns, sense vectors based on collocations, statistical Korean local context information and co-occurring POS information. Verb frame patterns constructed with dictionary and corpus play an important role in resolving the sparseness problem of collocation data. Sense vectors are a set of collocation data when an English word having target selection ambiguities is to be translated to specific Korean target word. Statistical Korean Local Context Information is an N-gram information generated using Korean corpus. The co-occurring POS information is a statistically significant POS clue which appears with ambiguous word. To evaluate our approach, we applied the method to Tellus-EK* system, English-Korean automatic translation system currently developed at ETRI [1], [2]. The experiment showed promising results for diverse sentences from web documents.

AB The growing diversity of connected devices leads to complex network deployments, often made up of endpoints that implement incompatible network application protocols. Communication between heterogeneous network protocols was traditionally enabled by hardware translators or gateways. However, such solutions are increasingly unfit to address the security, scalability, and latency requirements of modern software-driven deployments. To address these shortcomings we propose Chuchotage, a protocol translation architecture for secure and scalable machine-to-machine communication. Chuchotage enables in-line TLS interception and confidential protocol translation for software-defined networks. Translation is done in ephemeral, flow-specific Trusted Execution Environments and scales with the number of network flows. Our evaluation of Chuchotage implementing an HTTP to CoAP translation indicates a minimal transmission and translation overhead, allowing its integration with legacy or outdated deployments.

AB Lexical selection is crucial for statistical machine translation. Previous studies separately exploit sentence-level contexts and document-level topics for lexical selection, neglecting their correlations. In this paper, we propose a context-aware topic model for lexical selection, which not only models local contexts and global topics but also captures their correlations. The model uses target-side translations as hidden variables to connect document topics and source-side local contextual words. In order to learn hidden variables and distributions from data, we introduce a Gibbs sampling algorithm for statistical estimation and inference. A new translation probability based on distributions learned by the model is integrated into a translation system for lexical selection. Experiment results on NIST Chinese-English test sets demonstrate that 1) our model significantly outperforms previous lexical selection methods and 2) modeling correlations between local words and global topics can further improve translation quality.

AB Despite impressive empirical successes of neural machine translation (NMT) on standard benchmarks, limited parallel data impedes the application of NMT models to many language pairs. Data augmentation methods such as back-translation make it possible to use monolingual data to help alleviate these issues, but back-translation itself fails in extreme low-resource scenarios, especially for syntactically divergent languages. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective solution, whereby target-language sentences are re-ordered to match the order of the source and used as an additional source of trainingtime supervision. Experiments with simulated low-resource Japanese-to-English, and real low-resource Uyghur-to-English scenarios find significant improvements over other semi-supervised alternatives(1)

AB The statistical machine translation (SMT) component of cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) systems is often regarded as black box that is optimized for translation quality independent from the retrieval task. In recent work [10], SMT has been tuned for retrieval by training a reranker on k-best translations ordered according to their retrieval performance. In this paper we propose a decomposable proxy for retrieval quality that obviates the need for costly intermediate retrieval. Furthermore, we explore the full search space of the SMT decoder by directly optimizing decoder parameters under a retrieval-based objective. Experimental results for patent retrieval show our approach to be a promising alternative to the standard pipeline approach.

TI Towards More Diverse Input Representation for Neural Machine Translation
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Source input information plays a very important role in the Transformer-based translation system. In practice, word embedding and positional embedding of each word are added as the input representation. Then self-attention networks are used to encode the global dependencies in the input representation to generate a source representation. However, this processing on the source representation only adopts a single source feature and excludes richer and more diverse features such as recurrence features, local features, and syntactic features, which results in tedious representation and thereby hinders the further translation performance improvement. In this paper, we introduce a simple and efficient method to encode more diverse source features into the input representation simultaneously, and thereby learning an effective source representation by self-attention networks. In particular, the proposed grouped strategy is only applied to the input representation layer, to keep the diversity of translation information and the efficiency of the self-attention networks at the same time. Experimental results show that our approach improves the translation performance over the state-of-the-art baselines of Transformer in regard to WMT14 English-to-German and NIST Chinese-to-English machine translation tasks.

AB One problem of automatic translation is the evaluation of the result. The result should be as close to a human reference translation as possible, but varying word order or synonyms have to be taken into account for the evaluation of the similarity of both. In the conventional methods, researchers tend to employ many resources such as the synonyms vocabulary, paraphrasing, and text entailment data, etc. To make the evaluation model both accurate and concise, this paper explores the evaluation only using Part-of-Speech information of the words, which means the method is based only on the consilience of the POS strings of the hypothesis translation and reference. In this developed method, the POS also acts as the similar function with the synonyms in addition to its syntactic or morphological behaviour of the lexical item in question. Measures for the similarity between machine translation and human reference are dependent on the language pair since the word order or the number of synonyms may vary, for instance. This new measure solves this problem to a certain extent by introducing weights to different sources of information. The experiment results on English, German and French languages correlate on average better with the human reference than some existing measures, such as BLEU, AMBER and MP4IBM1.

TI Obtaining Parallel Sentences in Low-Resource Language Pairs with Minimal
   Supervision
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB Machine translation relies on parallel sentences, the number of which is an important factor affecting the performance of machine translation systems, especially in low-resource languages. Recent advances in learning cross-lingual word representations from nonparallel data by machine learning make a new possibility for obtaining bilingual sentences with minimal supervision in low-resource languages. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology to obtain parallel sentences via only a small-size bilingual seed lexicon about hundreds of entries. We first obtain bilingual semantic by establishing cross-lingual mapping in monolingual languages via a seed lexicon. Then, we construct a deep learning classifier to extract bilingual parallel sentences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology by harvesting Uyghur-Chinese parallel sentences and constructing a machine translation system. The experiments indicate that our method can obtain large and high-accuracy bilingual parallel sentences in low-resource language pairs.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel recursive recurrent neural network ((RNN)-N-2) to model the end-to-end decoding process for statistical machine translation. (RNN)-N-2 is a combination of recursive neural network and recurrent neural network, and in turn integrates their respective capabilities: (1) new information can be used to generate the next hidden state, like recurrent neural networks, so that language model and translation model can be integrated naturally; (2) a tree structure can be built, as recursive neural networks, so as to generate the translation candidates in a bottom up manner. A semi-supervised training approach is proposed to train the parameters, and the phrase pair embedding is explored to model translation confidence directly. Experiments on a Chinese to English translation task show that our proposed (RNN)-N-2 can outperform the state-of-the-art baseline by about 1.5 points in BLEU.

AB Statistical machine translation (SMT) requires a parallel corpus between the source and target languages. This requirement makes SMT difficult to apply to resource-limited languages that do not have any parallel corpora even to a major language, e.g., English. For such a problem, a novel pivot translation method has been proposed that does not require the source-side parallel corpus, but, uses a word dictionary instead. In this paper, we evaluate the relative translation performance of the dictionary-based method by comparing it with both the standard SMT that uses a direct parallel corpus, and the conventional pivot translation that uses two parallel corpora, by using the Europarl corpus. In addition, we also investigate the edge weighting and lattice pruning methods applied to the word lattice that was used to represent method.

AB Machine-checked proofs of properties of programming languages have gained in importance significantly over the past few years. This paper contributes to this trend by proposing an approach for doing machine-checked soundness proofs for verification condition (VC) generators. Our approach embraces the multi-phase VC generation common in modern program verifiers. Such verifiers split the generation of VCs in two (or even more) phases, using an intermediate verification language as the bridge between the programming language and logic. In our approach, we define a formal operational semantics of the intermediate verification language, and we prove the soundness of two translations separately: (1) the translation of the intermediate verification language to VCs, and (2) the translation of the source programming language to the intermediate language. This paper presents a fully machine checked proof of step (1) for a prototypical intermediate verification language, and then illustrates step (2) for a very small object oriented programming language.

AB When machine translation (MT) knowledge is automatically constructed from bilingual corpora, redundant rules are acquired due to translation variety. These rules increase ambiguity or cause incorrect MT results. To overcome this problem, we constrain the sentences used for knowledge extraction to "the appropriate bilingual sentences for the MT." In this paper, we propose a method using translation literalness to select appropriate sentences or phrases. The translation correspondence rate (TCR) is defined as the literalness measure.
   Based on the TCR, two automatic construction methods are tested. One is to filter the corpus before rule acquisition. The other is to split the acquisition process into two phases, where a bilingual sentence is divided into literal parts and the other parts before different generalizations are applied. The effects are evaluated by the MT quality, and about 4.9% of MT results were improved by the latter method.

TI Empirical Analysis of Parallel Corpora and In-Depth Analysis Using LIWC
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The machine translation system aims to translate source language into target language. Recent studies on MT systems mainly focus on neural machine translation. One factor that significantly affects the performance of NMT is the availability of high-quality parallel corpora. However, high-quality parallel corpora concerning Korean are relatively scarce compared to those associated with other high-resource languages, such as German or Italian. To address this problem, AI Hub recently released seven types of parallel corpora for Korean. In this study, we conduct an in-depth verification of the quality of corresponding parallel corpora through Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) and several relevant experiments. LIWC is a word-counting software program that can analyze corpora in multiple ways and extract linguistic features as a dictionary base. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to use LIWC to analyze parallel corpora in the field of NMT. Our findings suggest the direction of further research toward obtaining the improved quality parallel corpora through our correlation analysis in LIWC and NMT performance.

AB Probabilistic approaches are now widespread in most natural language processing applications and selection of a particular approach usually depends on the task at hand. Targeting speech semantic interpretation in a multilingual context, this paper presents a comparison between the state-of-the-art methods used for machine translation and speech understanding. This comparison justifies our proposition of a unified framework for both tasks based on a discriminative approach. We demonstrate that this framework can be used to perform a joint translation-understanding decoding which allows to combine, in the same process, translation and semantic tagging scores of a sentence. A cascade of finite-state transducers is used to compose the translation and understanding hypothesis graphs (1-bests, word graphs or confusion networks). Not only this proposition is competitive with the state-of-the-art techniques but also its framework is even more attractive as it can be generalized to other components of human machine vocal interfaces (e.g. speech recognizer) so as to allow a richer transmission of information between them.

AB One-shot inference is used in machine translation today. In practice, the output probability distribution is not concentrated since there might be multiple valid translations. Therefore, we propose to use a multi-shot inference mechanism in this paper. We analyze the Markovian property of sequence to sequence (seq2seq) model. Based on a large deviation principle satisfied by guesswork on Markov process, we derive theoretical upper bounds on the accuracy of the seq2seq model with single correct answer under one-shot inference and multi-shot inference. We establish analogous bounds when there are multiple correct answers in translating. We also discuss the extension of the results to translation with distortion tolerance.

AB Dynamic Binary Translation (DBT) is a technique used to allow execution of non-native machine code. It is an extensively explored research topic and lately it is being given much attention due to the increased demand for system virtual machines. This paper describes a DBT process model, which has been succesfully implemented on a 6502 emulator for x86_64 machines. Among other objectives, the model was conceived to allow the use of an existing interpreter core to implement a DBT-enabled one. Our preliminary results indicates that even a DBT scheme with no runtime information optimizations can lead to performance gain, at the same time saving the effort of implementing instruction code by reusing existing interpreter code.

AB Non-autoregressive neural machine translation (NAT) suffers from the multi-modality problem: the source sentence may have multiple correct translations, but the loss function is calculated only according to the reference sentence. Sequence-level knowledge distillation makes the target more deterministic by replacing the target with the output from an autoregressive model. However, the multi-modality problem in the distilled dataset is still nonnegligible. Furthermore, learning from a specific teacher limits the upper bound of the model capability, restricting the potential of NAT models. In this paper, we argue that one reference is not enough and propose diverse distillation with reference selection (DDRS) for NAT. Specifically, we first propose a method called SeedDiv for diverse machine translation, which enables us to generate a dataset containing multiple high-quality reference translations for each source sentence. During the training, we compare the NAT output with all references and select the one that best fits the NAT output to train the model. Experiments on widely-used machine translation benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of DDRS, which achieves 29.82 BLEU with only one decoding pass on WMT14 En-De, improving the state-of-the-art performance for NAT by over 1 BLEU.(1)

TI Analysis of Edit Operations for Post-editing Systems
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS
AB Post-editing has become an important part not only of translation research but also in the global translation industry. While computer-aided translation tools, such as translation memories, are considered to be part of a translator's work, lately, machine translation (MT) systems have also been accepted by human translators. However, many human translators are still adopting the changes brought by translation technologies to the translation industry. This paper introduces a novel approach for seeking suitable pairs of n-grams when recommending n-grams (corresponding n-grams between MT and post-edited MT) based on the type of text (manual or administrative) and MT system used for machine translation. A tool that recommends and speeds up the correction of MT was developed to help the post-editors with their work. It is based on the analysis of words with the same lemmas and analysis of n-gram recommendations. These recommendations are extracted from sequence patterns of the mismatched words (MisMatch) between MT output and post-edited MT output. The paper aims to show the usage of morphological analysis for recommending the post-edit operations. It describes the usage of mismatched words in the n-gram recommendations for the post-edited MT output. The contribution consists of the methodology for seeking suitable pairs of words, n-grams and additionally the importance of taking into account metadata (the type of the text and/or style and MT system) when recommending post-edited operations.

AB Statistical pattern recognition has proved to be an interesting framework for machine translation, and stochastic finite-state transducers are adequate models in many language processing areas such as speech translation, computer-assisted translations, etc. The well-known n-gram language models are widely used in this framework for machine translation. One of the application of these n-gram models is to infer stochastic finite-state transducers. However, only simple dependencies can be modelled, but many translations require to take into account strong context and style dependencies. Mixtures of parametric models allow to increase the description power of the statistical models by modelling subclasses of objects. In this work, we propose the use of n-gram mixtures in GIATI, a procedure to infer stochastic finite-state transducers. N-gram mixtures are expected to model topics or writing styles. We present experimental results showing that translation performance can be improved if enough training data is available.

AB There are many abbreviation and non-standard words in SMS and Twitter messages. They are problematic for text-to-speech (TTS) or language processing techniques for these data. A character-based machine translation (MT) approach was previously used for normalization of non-standard words. In this paper, we propose a two-stage translation method to leverage phonetic information, where non-standard words are first translated to possible pronunciations, which are then translated to standard words. We further combine it with the single-step character-based translation module. Our experiments show that our proposed method significantly outperforms previous results in both n-best coverage and 1-best accuracy.

TI Neural machine translation of low-resource languages using SMT phrase
   pair injection
SO NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING
AB Neural machine translation (NMT) has recently shown promising results on publicly available benchmark datasets and is being rapidly adopted in various production systems. However, it requires high-quality large-scale parallel corpus, and it is not always possible to have sufficiently large corpus as it requires time, money, and professionals. Hence, many existing large-scale parallel corpus are limited to the specific languages and domains. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to improve an NMT system in low-resource scenario without using any additional data. Our approach aims at augmenting the original training data by means of parallel phrases extracted from the original training data itself using a statistical machine translation (SMT) system. Our proposed approach is based on the gated recurrent unit (GRU) and transformer networks. We choose the Hindi-English, Hindi-Bengali datasets for Health, Tourism, and Judicial (only for Hindi-English) domains. We train our NMT models for 10 translation directions, each using only 5-23k parallel sentences. Experiments show the improvements in the range of 1.38-15.36 BiLingual Evaluation Understudy points over the baseline systems. Experiments show that transformer models perform better than GRU models in low-resource scenarios. In addition to that, we also find that our proposed method outperforms SMT-which is known to work better than the neural models in low-resource scenarios-for some translation directions. In order to further show the effectiveness of our proposed model, we also employ our approach to another interesting NMT task, for example, old-to-modern English translation, using a tiny parallel corpus of only 2.7K sentences. For this task, we use publicly available old-modern English text which is approximately 1000 years old. Evaluation for this task shows significant improvement over the baseline NMT.

AB This work extends and evaluates a two-dimensional automatic evaluation metric for machine translation, which is designed to operate at the sentence level. The metric is based on the concepts of adequacy and fluency, aiming at decoupling both semantic and syntactic components of the translation process to provide a more balanced view on translation quality. These two elements are independently evaluated by using continuous space and -gram language modeling frameworks, respectively. Two different implementations are evaluated: a monolingual version that fully operates on the target language side, and a cross-language version that has the main advantage of not requiring reference translations. Both implementations are evaluated by comparing their performance with state-of-the-art automatic metrics over a dataset involving five different European languages.

AB In the face of rapid globalization, the concept of translation performs the most important role in continuing the existence of native languages. Most of the research on Natural Language Processing in Neural Machine Translation has achieved an impressive result through parallel corpus dataset. Low resourced languages confront low performance due to the lack of parallel corpus data. Creating parallel corpus for language pair is more expensive and needs the persons who are expert knowledge for both languages. In this research, we present the availability of developing the translator for Sinhala-Tamil languages pair using monolingual corpus dataset. In this paper, the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) is applied for overcoming the Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) problem in both Sinhala and Tamil languages. Our first part of the research is using monolingual word embedding approach for developing the translation in between Sinhala-Tamil language pair only using monolingual corpora. The second part of the research we use both parallel and monolingual corpus data with transformer architecture. The BLEU score and the synonyms analysis are used to evaluate the approach we suggested.

AB Because of its clarity and its simplified way of writing, controlled language (CL) is being paid increasing attention by NLP (natural language processing) researchers, such as in machine translation. The users of controlled languages are of two types, firstly the authors of documents written in the controlled language and secondly the end-user readers of the documents. As a subset of natural language, controlled language restricts vocabulary, grammar, and style for the purpose of reducing or eliminating both ambiguity and complexity. The use of controlled language can help decrease the complexity of natural language to a certain degree and thus improve the translation quality, especially for the partial or total automatic translation of non-general purpose texts, such as technical documents, manuals, instructions and medical reports. Our focus is on the machine translation of medical protocols applied in the field of zoonosis. In this article we will briefly introduce why controlled language is preferred in our research work, what kind of benefits it will bring to our work and how we could make use of this existing technique to facilitate our translation tool.

AB Neural machine translation is shown to be very successful for translation between many language pairs. The experiments have shown that the quality of NMT largely depends on the amount of training data and parallel corpora with large sizes are unavailable for many language pairs. To be able to use this approach for low resource language pairs, generating parallel data for these languages is of great importance. In this paper we introduce an approach for augmenting the size of the parallel corpus. In our work we generate new parallel sentences by deleting the optional constituents from the source and the target sentences in the base parallel corpus. To detect these optional constituents, we consult the Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) derivation tree of the source sentence. Adjoined words in these trees are good candidates for deletion. To evaluate the proposed method, we conducted our experiments on English-Persian translation task. The results show that augmenting the parallel corpus with adjunct deletion improves the quality of translation 3.2 and 0.8 BLEU points when using the training sets of 1.6M and 3.2M words respectively.

AB Automation of the whole translation process using computers and machine translation systems did not fulfil, so far, the ever-growing needs for translation. On the other hand, Computer-aided translation systems have tackled the translation process by first concentrating on those mechanical tasks performed during the translation, then by gradually automating those intelligent (creative) tasks. This has resulted in useful systems that both increase translator's productivity and guarantee better consistency across translation jobs. This paper describes Sakhr Cat system which has been specifically designed to support document, web page translation and software localization for the Arabic-English language pair.

AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) based on the encoder-decoder architecture is a proposed approach to machine translation, and has achieved promising results comparable to those of traditional approaches such as statistical machine translation. However, a NMT system usually needs a large number of parallel corpora to train the model, which is difficult to get in some specific areas, e.g. symptom and disease terminologies. In this paper, we propose two approaches to make full use of the source-side monolingual data to make up the lack of parallel corpora. The first approach uses part-of-speech of source-side symptom and disease terminologies to get their grammar information. The second approach employs a self-taught learning algorithm to get more synthetic parallel data. The proposed NMT model obtains significant improvements in translating symptom and disease terminologies from Chinese into English. Improvements up to 2.13 BLEU points are gained, compared with the NMT baseline system.

AB We present a derivation of the alignment template model for statistical machine translation and an implementation of the model using weighted finite state transducers. The approach we describe allows us to implement each constituent distribution of the model as a weighted finite state transducer or acceptor. We show that bitext word alignment and translation under the model can be performed with standard FSM operations involving these transducers. One of the benefits of using this framework is that it obviates the need to develop specialized search procedures, even for the generation of lattices or N-Best lists of bitext word alignments and translation hypotheses. We evaluate the implementation of the model on the French-to-English Hansards task and report alignment and translation performance.

AB Lexically constrained neural machine translation (NMT) draws much industrial attention for its practical usage in specific domains. However, current autoregressive approaches suffer from high latency. In this paper, we focus on non-autoregressive translation (NAT) for this problem for its efficiency advantage. We identify that current constrained NAT models, which are based on iterative editing, do not handle low-frequency constraints well. To this end, we propose a plug-in algorithm for this line of work, i.e., Aligned Constrained Training (ACT), which alleviates this problem by familiarizing the model with the source-side context of the constraints. Experiments on the general and domain datasets show that our model improves over the backbone constrained NAT model in constraint preservation and translation quality, especially for rare constraints.

AB Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) aims to enhance translation quality by incorporating information from other modalities (usually images). However, dominant MMT models do not consider that visual features not only provide supplementary information also introduce much noise. In this paper, we propose the visual features filter to solve this issue. Specifically, we adopt a soft-lookup function to select the visual features relevant to the text and then use these visual features as pseudo-words concatenating with a text representation. In addition, our model conducts two-pass decoding. The secondary-pass decoding amounts to polishing which can identify errors in draft translations. The reason is that polishing expands the view in the process of decoding each target token, providing more contextual information. Besides, since most words in draft translations can be copied to final translations, we further equip our model with the copying mechanism to reserve those words that do not need to be corrected. MMT has achieved success in some mainstream languages at present. In order to promote the development of MMT in low-resource languages such as Mongolian, we deploy our model to the Mongolian -> Chinese translation task. We expand Multi30k dataset to synthetic Mongolian and Chinese descriptions. Experiments on synthetic Mongolian and Chinese datasets demonstrate that our model can bring significant improvements.

TI Sentence2SignGesture: a hybrid neural machine translation network for

SO JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING
AB The development of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems has attained prominent position in language translation tasks. However, it faces huge challenges in translating the new words and out-of-vocabularies. This problem is identified as a major drawback of conventional NMT systems in language translation results more copied outputs. In addition to that, it places the risks in understanding multilingual language structures and word relationships. In this paper, we propose novel deep stacked GRU algorithm based NMT System to address the aforementioned challenges and handles multilingual sentences based translation tasks efficiently. We aimed to develop the proposed model for translating the spoken sentences into sign words. The generated sign words (glosses) are mapped with sign gesture images to automate the sign gesture video generation process using deep generative models. The proposed hybrid NMT model has been evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively using different benchmark sign language datasets. The improved BLEU Score shows the outperformance of our model compared with earlier approaches. We also evaluated the proposed model using our self created Indian sign language corpus (ISL-CSLTR). The final result shows the achievement of greater translation results with minimal processing cost.

TI Validation of the Reliability of Machine Translation for a Medical
   Article From Japanese to English Using DeepL Translator
SO CUREUS
AB Background
   The reliability of DeepL Translator (DeepL GmbH, Cologne, Germany) for the translation for medical articles has not been verified yet. In this study, we investigated the accuracy of machine translation from Japanese to English for a medical article using the DeepL Translator.
   Methodology
   The subject of this study was an English-language medical article translated from Japanese, which had already been published. The original Japanese manuscript was translated into English using DeepL Translator. The translated English article was then back-translated into Japanese by three researchers. In turn, three other researchers compared the back-translated Japanese sentences with the original Japanese manuscript and calculated the percentage of sentences that retained the intended meaning.
   Results
   The mean +/- standard deviation of the match rate for the entire article was 94.0 +/- 2.9%. The match rate in the Results section was significantly higher than that in the other sections; while the match rate in the Materials and Methods section was significantly lower than the rate in the other sections. Compound sentences and sentences with an unclear subject and predicate appeared to be significant predictors for mismatched translation.
   Conclusions
   The translation for a medical article from Japanese to English was performed accurately by DeepL Translator.

SO NAUCHNYI DIALOG
AB Some weaknesses of machine translation carried out by means of neural networks ("neural translation") are considered. The relevance of this topic is determined by the significant popularity of the relevant web services among translators, teachers, researchers, students and others who are interested in the introductory or urgent transcoding of the text from one language to another. The results of the experiment are presented: well-known web service "Google Translate" was offered to translate into English several dozens of Russian-language terms and concepts related to philology and pedagogy. Recommendations are given to correct some errors and inaccuracies made by the web service. The authors come to the conclusion that the use of neural translation has led to a significant improvement in the quality of services provided by the web service "Google Translate." It is noted that this service still makes mistakes (semantic and stylistic) when translating the following categories of vocabulary: compound terms and concepts; lexical units and phrases that do not have clear equivalents in the English language; two words with the same English equivalent; abbreviations; author's occasionalisms. It is reported that, according to the authors, such errors are made by other popular web services ("Yandex. Translator," "Translate.ru" etc.)

AB Example-based machine translation (EBMT) is an important branch of machine translation. Sentence similarity measure is certainly one of the most significant problems addressed in EBMT. For EBMT from Chinese to English, the performance of similarity measure of Chinese sentences greatly affects the final translation result of an input Chinese sentence. In this paper, we present an approach to Chinese Sentence Similarity Measure (CSSM) together with word sequence and sentence structure information. The new method in our experiments yields a good efficiency and effectiveness without conducting a complex and deep syntactic analysis of Chinese sentences, which can he applied to an EBMT system for CSSM for a better performance in Chinese-to-English translation.

AB In phrase-based statistical machine translation, the knowledge about phrase translation and phrase reordering is learned from the bilingual corpora. However, words may be poorly aligned in long sentence pairs in practice, which will then do harm to the following steps of the translation, such as phrase extraction, etc. A possible solution to this problem is segmenting long sentence pairs into shorter ones. In this paper, we present an effective approach to segmenting sentences based on the modified IBM Translation Model 1. We find that by taking into account the semantics of some words, as well as the length ratio of source and target sentences, the segmentation result is largely improved. We also discuss the effect of length factor to the segmentation result. Experiments show that our approach can improve the BLEU score of a phrase-based translation system by about 0.5 points.

AB Machine Translation of text is a fundamental problem in machine learning that resists solutions that do not take into account the dependencies between words and sentences. Recurrent Neural Networks have recently delivered outstanding results in learning about sequential dependencies in many languages. Arabic language as a target language has not received enough attention in the recent language model experiments due to its, structural and semantic difficulties. In this paper, we present a Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) Context Modelling using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). This research is based on the state-of-the-art RNN language model by Mikolov. Our preliminary contribution is in integrating and presenting a new hybridization to utilize Recurrent Neural Network sequential word learning dependencies as well as Latent Dirichlet Allocation context and topic classification ability to produce the most accurate language scoring.

AB As a typical low-resource language pair, besides severely limited by the scale of parallel corpus, Chinese-Lao language pair also has considerable linguistic differences, resulting in poor performance of Chinese-Lao neural machine translation (NMT) task. However, compared with the Chinese-Lao language pair, there are considerable cross-lingual similarities between Thai-Lao languages. According to these features, we propose a novel NMT approach. We first train Chinese-Thai and Thai-Lao NMT models wherein Thai is treated as pivot language. Then the transfer learning strategy is used to extract the encoder and decoder respectively from the two trained models. Finally, the encoder and decoder are combined into a new model and then fine-tuned based on a small-scale Chinese-Lao parallel corpus. We argue that the pivot language Thai can deliver more information to Lao decoder via linguistic similarity and help improve the translation quality of the proposed transfer-based approach. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves 9.12 BLEU on Chinese-Lao translation task using a small parallel corpus, compared to the 7.37 BLEU of state-of-the-art Transformer baseline system using back-translation.

AB Bilingual dependency parsing aims to improve parsing performance with the help of bilingual information. While previous work have shown improvements on either or both sides, most of them mainly focus on designing complicated features and rely on golden translations during training and testing. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective translation constrained reranking model to improve Chinese dependency parsing. The reranking model is trained using a max-margin neural network without any manually designed features. Instead of using golden translations for training and testing, we relax the restrictions and use sentences generated by a machine translation system, which dramatically extends the scope of our model. Experiments on the translated portion of the Chinese Treebank show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art monolingual Graph/Transition-based parsers by a large margin (UAS).

AB Attention mechanism has enhanced state-of-the-art Neural Machine Translation (NMT) by focusing on parts of the source sentence when predicting each target word. However we find that most of the attention context vector calculation is directly dependent on the current decoder hidden state. It tends to ignore past translated information, which often leads to over-translation and under-translation. When target sentence is very long, or the words relation inside the sentence are not tight, for example, there are some separators in the sentence, the model can get wrong translation. Aiming to solve these problems, in this paper, we propose a history attention structure that takes advantage of translated information. This architecture easily captures history information, helps model alleviate the memory vanishing problem introduced by long sentences and avoid focusing on one local part. In experiments, we show our history attention with gate improves translation quality.

AB The prevalent approach to neural machine translation relies on bi-directional LSTMs to encode the source sentence. We present a faster and simpler architecture based on a succession of convolutional layers. This allows to encode the source sentence simultaneously compared to recurrent networks for which computation is constrained by temporal dependencies. On WMT'16 EnglishRomanian translation we achieve competitive accuracy to the state-of-the-art and on WMT'15 English-German we outperform several recently published results. Our models obtain almost the same accuracy as a very deep LSTM setup on WMT'14 English-French translation. We speed up CPU decoding by more than two times at the same or higher accuracy as a strong bidirectional LSTM.

First, we propose new features based on neural networks to model various nonlocal translation phenomena. Second, we augment the architectureof the neural network with tensor layers that capture important higher-order interaction among the network units. Third, we apply multitask learning to estimate the neural network parameters jointly. Each of our proposed methods results in significant improvements that are complementary. The overall improvement is +2.7 and +1.8 BLEU points for Arabic-English and Chinese-English translation over a state-of-the-art system that already includes neural network features.

We use an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to re-estimate the parameters of synchronous context-free grammar (SCFG) rules according to the derivation knowledge from parallel corpora based on maximum likelihood principle, rather than using, only the heuristic information. The proposed algorithm produces significantly better BLEU scores than a state-of-the-art formal syntax-based machine translation system on the IWSLT 2006 Chinese to English task.

AB A sentence can be translated into more than one correct sentences. However, most of the existing neural machine translation models only use one of the correct translations as the targets, and the other correct sentences are punished as the incorrect sentences in the training stage. Since most of the correct translations for one sentence share the similar bag-of-words, it is possible to distinguish the correct translations from the incorrect ones by the bag-of-words. In this paper, we propose an approach that uses both the sentences and the bag-of-words as targets in the training stage, in order to encourage the model to generate the potentially correct sentences that are not appeared in the training set. We evaluate our model on a Chinese-English translation dataset, and experiments show our model outperforms the strong baselines by the BLEU score of 4.55.(1)

AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has shown a strong ability to utilize local context to disambiguate the meaning of words. However, it remains a challenge for NMT to leverage broader context information like topics. In this paper, we propose heterogeneous ways of embedding topic information at the sentence level into an NMT model to improve translation performance. Specifically, the topic information can be incorporated as pre-encoder topic embedding, post-encoder topic embedding, and decoder topic embedding to increase the likelihood of selecting target words from the same topic of the source sentence. Experimental results show that NMT models with the proposed topic knowledge embedding outperform the baselines on the English -> German and English -> French translation tasks.(1)

TI Attention With Sparsity Regularization for Neural Machine Translation
   and Summarization
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB ( )The attention mechanism has become the de facto standard component in neural sequence to sequence tasks, such as machine translation and abstractive summarization. It dynamically determines which parts in the input sentence should be focused on when generating each word in the output sequence. Ideally, only few relevant input words should be attended to at each decoding time step and the attention weight distribution should be sparse and sharp. However, previous methods have no good mechanism to control this attention weight distribution. In this paper, we propose a sparse attention model in which a sparsity regularization term is designed to augment the objective function. We explore two kinds of regularizations: L-infinity-norm regularization and minimum entropy regularization, both of which aim to sharpen the attention weight distribution. Extensive experiments on both neural machine translation and abstractive summarization demonstrate that our proposed sparse attention model can substantially outperform t he strong baselines. And the detailed analyses reveal that the final attention distribution indeed becomes sparse and sharp.

AB Despite impressive progress in high-resource settings, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) still struggles in low-resource and out-of-domain scenarios, often failing to match the quality of phrase-based translation. We propose a novel technique that combines back-translation and multilingual NMT to improve performance in these difficult cases. Our technique trains a single model for both directions of a language pair, allowing us to back-translate source or target monolingual data without requiring an auxiliary model. We then continue training on the augmented parallel data, enabling a cycle of improvement for a single model that can incorporate any source, target, or parallel data to improve both translation directions. As a byproduct, these models can reduce training and deployment costs significantly compared to uni-directional models. Extensive experiments show that our technique outperforms standard back-translation in low-resource scenarios, improves quality on cross-domain tasks, and effectively reduces costs across the board.

AB We apply phrase-based and neural models to a core task in interactive machine translation: suggesting how to complete a partial translation. For the phrase-based system, we demonstrate improvements in suggestion quality using novel objective functions, learning techniques, and inference algorithms tailored to this task. Our contributions include new tunable metrics, an improved beam search strategy, an n-best extraction method that increases suggestion diversity, and a tuning procedure for a hierarchical joint model of alignment and translation. The combination of these techniques improves next-word suggestion accuracy dramatically from 28.5% to 41.2% in a large-scale English-German experiment. Our recurrent neural translation system increases accuracy yet further to 53.0%, but inference is two orders of magnitude slower. Manual error analysis shows the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches.

TI A multi-stack RNN-based neural machine translation model for English to
   Pakistan sign language translation
SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
AB Sign languages are gesture-based languages used by the deaf community of the world. Every country has a different sign language and there are more than 200 sign languages in the world. American Sign Language (ASL), British Sign Language (BSL), and German Sign Language (DGS) are well-studied sign languages. Due to their different grammatical structure and word order the deaf people feel difficulty in reading and understanding the written text in natural languages. In order to enhance the cognitive ability of the deaf subjects some translation models have been developed for these languages that translate natural language text into corresponding sign language gestures. Most of the earlier natural to sign language translation models rely on rule-based approaches. Recently, some neural machine translation models have been proposed for ASL, BSL, DGS, and Arabic sign language. However, most of these models have low accuracy scores. This research provides an improved and novel multi-stack RNN-based neural machine translation model for natural to sign language translation. The proposed model is based on encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates attention mechanism and embeddings to improve the quality of results. Rigorous experimentation has been performed to compare the proposed multi-stack RNN-based model with baseline models. The experiments have been conducted using a sizeable translation corpus comprising of nearly 50,000 sentences for Pakistan Sign Language (PSL). The performance of the proposed neural machine translation model for PSL has been evaluated with the help of well-established evaluation measures including Bilingual Evaluation Understudy Score (BLEU), and Word Error Rate (WER). The results show that multi-stacked gated recurrent unit-based RNN model that employs Bahdanau attention mechanism and GloVe embedding performed the best showing the BLEU score of 0.83 and WER 0.17, which outperform the existing translation models. The proposed model has been exposed through a software system that converts the translated sentences into PSL gestures using an avatar. The evaluation of the usability has also been performed to see how effectively the avatar-based output helps compensating the cognitive hearing deficit for the deaf people. The results show that it works well for different granularity levels.

TI Text2Sign: Towards Sign Language Production Using Neural Machine
   Translation and Generative Adversarial Networks
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION
AB We present a novel approach to automatic Sign Language Production using recent developments in Neural Machine Translation (NMT), Generative Adversarial Networks, and motion generation. Our system is capable of producing sign videos from spoken language sentences. Contrary to current approaches that are dependent on heavily annotated data, our approach requires minimal gloss and skeletal level annotations for training. We achieve this by breaking down the task into dedicated sub-processes. We first translate spoken language sentences into sign pose sequences by combining an NMT network with a Motion Graph. The resulting pose information is then used to condition a generative model that produces photo realistic sign language video sequences. This is the first approach to continuous sign video generation that does not use a classical graphical avatar. We evaluate the translation abilities of our approach on the PHOENIX14T Sign Language Translation dataset. We set a baseline for text-to-gloss translation, reporting a BLEU-4 score of 16.34/15.26 on dev/test sets. We further demonstrate the video generation capabilities of our approach for both multi-signer and high-definition settings qualitatively and quantitatively using broadcast quality assessment metrics.

However, DSTM can be used to model a wide class of systems for design, verification and validation purposes. Its main characteristics are the dynamic instantiation of parametric machines and the definition of complex data types. In addition, DSTM allows for recursion and preemptive termination. In this paper we present a translation of DSTM models in Promela that can enable automatic test case generation via model checking and, at least in principle, system verification. We illustrate the main steps of the translation process and the obtained Promela encoding.

AB We introduce AI rationalization, an approach for generating explanations of autonomous system behavior as if a human had performed the behavior. We describe a rationalization technique that uses neural machine translation to translate internal state-action representations of an autonomous agent into natural language. We evaluate our technique in the Frogger game environment, training an autonomous game playing agent to rationalize its action choices using natural language. A natural language training corpus is collected from human players thinking out loud as they play the game. We motivate the use of rationalization as an approach to explanation generation and show the results of two experiments evaluating the effectiveness of rationalization. Results of these evaluations show that neural machine translation is able to accurately generate rationalizations that describe agent behavior, and that rationalizations are more satisfying to humans than other alternative methods of explanation.

We introduce a controlled corpus to measure the intensity of such biases in the two translation directions (from and into English). This corpus also allows us to investigate the information flow in a encoder-decoder architecture and to identify how gender information can be transfered between languages. Considering both probing as well as interventions on the internal representations of the MT system, we show that gender information is encoded in all token representations built by the encoder and the decoder and that there are multiple paths to transfer gender.

TI Document-Level Neural Machine Translation with Associated Memory Network
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB Standard neural machine translation (NMT) is on the assumption that the document-level context is independent. Most existing document-level NMT approaches are satisfied with a smattering sense of global document-level information, while this work focuses on exploiting detailed document-level context in terms of a memory network. The capacity of the memory network that detecting the most relevant part of the current sentence from memory renders a natural solution to model the rich document-level context. In this work, the proposed document-aware memory network is implemented to enhance the Transformer NMT baseline. Experiments on several tasks show that the proposed method significantly improves the NMT performance over strong Transformer baselines and other related studies.

AB This study assesses the potential of topic models coupled with machine translation for comparative communication research across language barriers. From a methodological point of view, the robustness of a combined approach is examined. For this purpose the results of different machine translation services (Google Translate vs. DeepL) as well as methods (full-text vs. term-by-term) are compared. From a substantive point of view, the integratability of the approach into comparative study designs is tested. For this, the online discourses about climate change in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States are compared. First, the results show that the approach is relatively robust and second, that integration in comparative study designs is not a problem. It is concluded that this as well as the relatively moderate costs in terms of time and money makes the strategy to couple topic models with machine translation a valuable addition to the toolbox of comparative communication researchers.

AB While modern machine translation has relied on large parallel corpora, a recent line of work has managed to train Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems from monolingual corpora only (Artetxe et al., 2018c; Lample et al., 2018). Despite the potential of this approach for low-resource settings, existing systems are far behind their supervised counterparts, limiting their practical interest. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach based on phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) that significantly closes the gap with supervised systems. Our method profits from the modular architecture of SMT: we first induce a phrase table from monolingual corpora through cross-lingual embedding mappings, combine it with an n-gram language model, and fine-tune hyperparameters through an unsupervised MERT variant. In addition, iterative backtranslation improves results further, yielding, for instance, 14.08 and 26.22 BLEU points in WMT 2014 English-German and English-French, respectively, an improvement of more than 7-10 BLEU points over previous unsupervised systems, and closing the gap with supervised SMT (Moses trained on Europarl) down to 2-5 BLEU points. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/artetxem/monoses.

AB Multi Lingual Snippet Generation (MLSG) systems provide the users with snippets in multiple languages. But collecting and managing documents in multiple languages in an efficient way is a difficult task and thereby makes this process more complicated. Fortunately, this requirement can be fulfilled in another way by translating the snippets from one language to another with the help of Machine Translation (MT) systems. The resulting system is called Cross Lingual Snippet Generation (CLSG) system. This paper presents the development of a CLSG system by Snippet Translation when documents are available only in one language. We consider the English-Bengali language pair for snippet translation in one direction (English to Bengali). In this work, a major concentration is given towards translating snippets with simpler but excluding deeper MT concepts. In experimental results, an average BLEU score of 14.26 and NIST score of 4.93 are obtained.

AB hi this paper, we introduce a new metric which we call the Semantic Translation Error Rate, or STER, for evaluating the performance of machine translation systems. STER is based on the previously published Translation Error Rate (TER)[1] and METEOR[2] metrics. Specifically, STER extends TER in two ways: first, by incorporating word equivalence measures (WordNet and Porter stemming) standardly used by METEOR, and second, by disallowing alignments of concept words to non-concept words (aka stop words). We show how these features make STER alignments better suited for human-driven analysis than standard TER. We also present experimental results that show that STER is better correlated to human judgments than TER. Finally, we compare STER to METEOR, and illustrate that METEOR scores computed using the STER alignments have similar statistical properties to METEOR scores computed using METEOR alignments.

AB Transliteration of new named entity is important for information retrieval that crosses two or multiple language. Rule-based machine transliteration is not satisfactory, since different information sources have different standards for the transliteration. To build a statistic machine transliteration module, researchers have to curate a transliteration corpus for any given two languages of interest. Since a large amount Of transliteration/translation pairs can be collected from the Web, a large transliteration-training corpus can be curated from these pairs. In this paper we proposed a bi-directional approach to classify transliteration/translation pairs. Our approach combines both forward transliteration and backward transliteration to classify transliteration from translation. An experiment on English and Chinese transliteration is conducted.

This segment of the industry has seen a radical structural transformation that has accompanied a radical transformation in the media environment that supports its work. The emergence of online freelance translation marketplaces has married the logics of standardization, automation, and protocol to casual labor, motivated by incremental profit and lubricated by entrepreneurialism. Customs and practices native to contemporary internet culture generate a freelance translation machine made of equal parts flesh and silicon that manages skilled labor algorithmically. In parallel with the specific case of freelance translation practices, this article develops and deploys a notion of algorithmic culture that accounts for the integration of human cognition in computational processes. Consequently, the possibility emerges that users instrumentalize algorithms even as algorithms instrumentalize users.

AB This paper proposes a solution to solve the Out Of Vocabulary(OOV) problem in a framework built with a transformer-based machine translation algorithm. The translation input is a traditional Korean document written in Chinese characters, and the output is a decoding of modern Korean paragraphs written in Korean alphabet. We used the word2vec algorithm to represent symbolic characters as numeric vectors and used them as input to the converter. Also, to solve the OOV problem, Bi-Directional LSTM + CRF has been used. To show the validity of the data set, the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty were presented as translations prepared by experts. Another source was collected at Kyungpook National University (Diary dataset), which is much smaller than the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty. According to the BLEU score, after learning the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, fine-tune with data collected at Kyungpook National University showed a lower BLEU score than general machine translation in the results of applying CRF When learning only with the dataset collected at Kyungpook National University, it can be seen that a slightly high BLEU score was obtained.

AB Massively multilingual models for neural machine translation (NMT) are theoretically attractive, but often underperform bilingual models and deliver poor zero-shot translations. In this paper, we explore ways to improve them. We argue that multilingual NMT requires stronger modeling capacity to support language pairs with varying typological characteristics, and overcome this bottleneck via language-specific components and deepening NMT architectures. We identify the off-target translation issue (i.e. translating into a wrong target language) as the major source of the inferior zero-shot performance, and propose random online backtranslation to enforce the translation of unseen training language pairs. Experiments on OPUS-100 (a novel multilingual dataset with 100 languages) show that our approach substantially narrows the performance gap with bilingual models in both one-to-many and many-to-many settings, and improves zero-shot performance by similar to 10 BLEU, approaching conventional pivot-based methods.

AB We address the problem of simplifying Portuguese texts at the sentence level by treating it as a "translation task". We use the Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) framework to learn how to translate from complex to simplified sentences. Given a parallel corpus of original and simplified texts, aligned at the sentence level, we train a standard SMT system and evaluate the "translations" produced using both standard SMT metrics like BLEU and manual inspection. Results are promising according to both evaluations, showing that while the model is usually overcautious in producing simplifications, the overall quality of the sentences is not degraded and certain types of simplification operations, mainly lexical, are appropriately captured.

TI Evaluating the English-Turkish parallel treebank for machine translation
SO TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES
AB This study extends our initial efforts in building an English-Turkish parallel treebank corpus for statistical machine translation tasks. We manually generated parallel trees for about 17K sentences selected from the Penn Treebank corpus. English sentences vary in length: 15 to 50 tokens including punctuation. We constrained the translation of trees by (i) reordering of leaf nodes based on suffixation rules in Turkish, and (ii) gloss replacement. We aim to mimic human annotator's behavior in real translation task. In order to fill the morphological and syntactic gap between languages, we do morphological annotation and disambiguation. We also apply our heuristics by creating Nokia English-Turkish Treebank (NTB) to address technical document translation tasks. NTB also includes 8.3K sentences in varying lengths. We validate the corpus both extrinsically and intrinsically, and report our evaluation results regarding perplexity analysis and translation task results. Results prove that our heuristics yield promising results in terms of perplexity and are suitable for translation tasks in terms of BLEU scores.

AB To achieve high translation performance, neural machine translation models usually rely on the beam search algorithm for decoding sentences. The beam search finds good candidate translations by considering multiple hypotheses of translations simultaneously. However, as the algorithm searches in a monotonic left-to-right order, a hypothesis can not be revisited once it is discarded. We found such monotonicity forces the algorithm to sacrifice some decoding paths to explore new paths. As a result, the overall quality of the hypotheses selected by the algorithm is lower than expected. To mitigate this problem, we relax the monotonic constraint of the beam search by maintaining all found hypotheses in a single priority queue and using a universal score function for hypothesis selection. The proposed algorithm allows discarded hypotheses to be recovered in a later step. Despite its simplicity, we show that the proposed decoding algorithm enhances the quality of selected hypotheses and improve the translations even for highperformance models in English-Japanese translation task.

AB Neural machine translation (NMT) models typically operate with a fixed vocabulary, but translation is an open-vocabulary problem. Previous work addresses the translation of out-of-vocabulary words by backing off to a dictionary. In this paper, we introduce a simpler and more effective approach, making the NMT model capable of open-vocabulary translation by encoding rare and unknown words as sequences of subword units. This is based on the intuition that various word classes are translatable via smaller units than words, for instance names (via character copying or transliteration), compounds (via compositional translation), and cognates and loanwords (via phonological and morphological transformations). We discuss the suitability of different word segmentation techniques, including simple character n-gram models and a segmentation based on the byte pair encoding compression algorithm, and empirically show that subword models improve over a back-off dictionary baseline for the WMT 15 translation tasks English-German and English-Russian by up to 1.1 and 1.3 BLEU, respectively.

AB This paper presents an idea. in Example-Based Machine Translation - computing the transfer score for each produced translation. When an EBMT system finds an example in the translation memory, it; tries to modify the sentence in order to produce the best possible translation of the input sentence. The user of the system, however; is unable to judge the quality of the translation. This problem can be solved by providing the user with a percentage score for each translated sentence.
   The idea to base transfer score computation on the similarity between the input sentence and the example is not sufficient. Real-life examples show that the transfer process is as likely to go well with a bad translation memory example as to fail with a good example.
   This paper describes a method of computing transfer score strictly associated with the transfer process. The transfer score is inversely proportional to the number of linguistic operations executed on the example target sentence. The paper ends with an evaluation of the suggested method.

AB Synthesis modeling of a geometric error-based traditional method for large-scale grinding machine tools with six axes is too complicated to perform in a real-time compensator with a built-in position control system, and it is difficult to obtain all of the error elements corresponding to the model. This paper proposed a novel strategy in which a machine may be considered as translation axes and rotary axes, and geometric errors of the translation axes and rotary axis are modeled and the geometric error models of the machine are very simple for real-time error compensation. The volumetric errors of the translation axes are measured using spatial circular curve ball bar test, and every element of the rotary axis is also obtained by a series of considerate ball bar tests. According to the characteristics of a position controller used in the machine, a synthesis error compensation system based on the NUM numerical control system was developed. Error compensation experiments were carried out, and the results show that the accuracy of the machine is improved significantly.

AB We outline a theory of communicating "Abstract State Machines". The state of an Abstract State Machine has two components: a behavioural state and a data state. The behavioural states are shown on a state diagram, whose transitions are labelled with an "event" and a B operation. The firing of a transition is synonymous with the occurrence of its associated event. We use a synchronous model of communication based on shared events which simultaneously change the state of each participating machine. The B operation associated with a transition generally has the form G double right arrow S, where a necessary condition for the transition to fire is that G is true, and where S describes any resulting changes in the data state of the Abstract Machine. The paper includes simple examples, the translation of Abstract State Machines to B Action Systems, the translation of Abstract State Machines into "primitive" Abstract State Machines which have only behavioural state, the parallel combination of high level Abstract State Machines, and short notes on choice and refinement.

TI Critical thinking of a translator: Expanding the practice of using and
   editing machine translation
SO THINKING SKILLS AND CREATIVITY
AB The availability of machine translation allows both non-professionals and professional translators to use its capabilities, who use computer translation as a basis, and then analyze the resulting text and creatively process it in order to bring it as close to the original as possible. The aim of the present research is to study the influence of critical thinking on the quality of machine translation post-editing. The research was conducted at the College of College of Foreign Languages and Zhoukou Normal University and [BLINDED] University. The primary sample of respondents, heterogeneous in terms of age, gender, race, and ethnicity, was formed from 246 professional translators for whom the native language was Chinese. After determining the level of critical thinking using the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Test in the 2011 modification and the Critical Thinking Assessment Test (CAT), two experimental groups of respondents were formed: with high and low levels of critical thinking. These groups were provided with the same standardized texts for translation, using the same set of software tools, and subsequent editing. The translation results were evaluated by 12 experts with over 20 years of experience in translation. Errors were divided into groups: syntactic, lexical, grammatical, stylistic. The number of errors of each type and the average number of detected errors for each translator were estimated. The results obtained were compared using the Student's t-test using the Excel program and an online calculator. As a result of the study, the null hypothesis about no influence of a translator's critical thinking level on translation quality was refuted, and a direct significant correlation between a high level of critical thinking and a smaller number of post-editing errors was shown. It seems important to conduct further research to determine the influence of a translator's critical thinking, language proficiency, and experience on translation quality, since in this study, translators' length of service and the level of language proficiency were not taken into account. The development of critical thinking as a key competence ensures that informed decisions are made that affect the quality of machine translation post-editing. Practical significance of the study is based on the opportunity to use of the proposed technique to study the influence of other types of translation on the formation of critical thinking of the translator. The further research can be based on the determination the influence of critical thinking, language proficiency, and experience of a translator on translation quality, since in this study the length of service and language proficiency of translators were not taken into account.

AB Communication with hearing people society is an important problem for deaf people. Because they are not learned the valid rules of spoken language that hearing people use them. We therefor prepare an efficient corpus and apply it to Moses Machine Translation to simplify these communications. We choose communications between children because they use e-communications more than adults. All of the systems that automatically process sign language corpus rely on appropriate data. So our corpus with a limited set of words and with specific subject is the first Persian corpus containing Persian language, PL, and Persian sign language, PSL, based on the domain of children conversations. At the first step raw data are pre-processed which provides necessary information for translation. These data are statistic information extracted of sentences. After getting important data from initial sentences, the corpus is applied for training of Moses machine translation. Beside on the main goal of this system, we can educate deaf people the valid Persian grammar that is a problem for deaf people in school and society. In this paper we compare our results with the results taken from Moses decoder in other spoken languages that indicate our purpose is applicable in real world.

AB Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a method widely used for image classification. The original formulation of this method does not incorporate contextual information. This study brings a new perspective regarding contextual SVM. The main idea of the presented proposal consists on translates, individually for each pixel using it contextual information, the separation hyperplane originally designed by SVM. A case study using ALOS PALSAR image shows that the proposed method produces better results than traditional SVM.

TI Re-thinking translation quality Revision in the digital age
SO TARGET-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB Editing and revision are regularly incorporated into professional translation projects as a means of quality assurance. Underlying the decision to include these tasks in translation workflows lay implicit assumptions about what constitutes quality. This article examines how quality is operationalized with respect to editing and revision and considers these assumptions. The case is made for incorporating revision into translation quality assessment models and employs the concepts of adequacy, distributed cognition, and salience and their treatment in the research on cognitive translation processes, post-editing, and translation technology - in order to re-think translation quality.

AB Recent work in the field of machine translation (MT) evaluation suggests that sentence level evaluation based on machine learning (ML) can outperform the standard metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE and METEOR. We conducted a comprehensive empirical study on support vector methods for ML-based MT evaluation involving multi-class support vector machines (SVM) and support vector regression (SVR) with different kernel functions. We empathize on a systematic comparison study of multiple feature models obtained with feature selection and feature extraction techniques. Besides finding the conditions yielding the best empirical results, our study supports several unobvious conclusions regarding qualitative and quantitative aspects of feature sets in MT evaluation.

TI Addressing Limited Vocabulary and Long Sentences Constraints in
   English-Arabic Neural Machine Translation
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has attracted growing interest in recent years for its promising performance compared to traditional approaches such as Statistical Machine Translation. However, its application to languages having different structures, like the (English, Arabic) pair that interests us in this work, degrades its performance. Indeed, the limited vocabulary size required by the NMT models decreases the vocabulary coverage rate of the Arabic language, well known by its morphological richness. Likewise, long sentences present an additional challenge to NMT systems because they perform less well for longer sentences than for the shorter ones. In this paper, we provide a series of experiments to mitigate the effects of these constraints. To address the problem of out-of-vocabulary words, we integrated into factored NMT models morphosyntactic features as an output factor, namely stem, lemma, POS, root, and pattern. We have also developed two techniques for segmenting long sentences into smaller sub-sentences. The first uses a list of lexical markers that we have collected as segmentation points, and the second integrates into the NMT model the parallel phrases extracted by an SMT system. The experiments carried out on the English-Arabic pair show that the proposed approaches considerably improve the translation quality compared to the basic NMT system.

The evaluation index system of college English translation teaching quality is constructed, and the evaluation index data are processed by the method of principal component analysis and support vector machine. Based on the processed data, the comprehensive evaluation results of college English translation teaching quality are obtained by using SERVQUAL model. The experimental results show that the maximum evaluation accuracy of the proposed method is 96.3%, the minimum is 94.5%, and the average output time of the evaluation results is 75.2ms, indicating that the proposed method can achieve a rapid and accurate evaluation of the quality of college English translation teaching.

AB Unseen words, also called out-of-vocabulary words (OOVs), are difficult for machine translation. In neural machine translation, byte-pair encoding can be used to represent OOVs, but they are still often incorrectly translated. We improve the translation of OOVs in NMT using easy-to-obtain monolingual data. We look for OOVs in the text to be translated and translate them using simple-to-construct bilingual word embeddings (BWEs). In our MT experiments we take the 5-best candidates, which is motivated by intrinsic mining experiments. Using all five of the proposed target language words as queries we mine target-language sentences. We then back-translate, forcing the back-translation of each of the five proposed target-language OOV-translation-candidates to be the original source-language OOV. We show that by using this synthetic data to finetune our system the translation of OOVs can be dramatically improved. In our experiments we use a system trained on Europarl and mine sentences containing medical terms from monolingual data.

TI A classification approach for detecting cross-lingual biomedical term
   translations
SO NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING
AB Finding translations for technical terms is an important problem in machine translation. In particular, in highly specialized domains such as biology or medicine, it is difficult to find bilingual experts to annotate sufficient cross-lingual texts in order to train machine translation systems. Moreover, new terms are constantly being generated in the biomedical community, which makes it difficult to keep the translation dictionaries up to date for all language pairs of interest. Given a biomedical term in one language (source language), we propose a method for detecting its translations in a different language (target language). Specifically, we train a binary classifier to determine whether two biomedical terms written in two languages are translations. Training such a classifier is often complicated due to the lack of common features between the source and target languages. We propose several feature space concatenation methods to successfully overcome this problem. Moreover, we study the effectiveness of contextual and character n-gram features for detecting term translations. Experiments conducted using a standard dataset for biomedical term translation show that the proposed method outperforms several competitive baseline methods in terms of mean average precision and top-k translation accuracy.

AB Neural machine translation (NMT) encodes the source sentence in a universal way to generate the target sentence word-byword. However, NMT does not consider the importance of word in the sentence meaning, for example, some words (i.e., content words) express more important meaning than others (i.e., function words). To address this limitation, we first utilize word frequency information to distinguish between content and function words in a sentence, and then design a content word-aware NMT to improve translation performance. Empirical results on the WMT14 English-to-German, WMT14 English-to-French, and WMT17 Chinese-to-English translation tasks show that the proposed methods can significantly improve the performance of Transformer-based NMT.

TI Computer-assisted translation using speech recognition
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Current machine translation systems are far from being perfect. However, such systems can be used in computer-assisted translation to increase the productivity of the (human) translation process. The idea is to use a text-to-text translation system to produce portions of target language text that can be accepted or amended by a human translator using text or speech. These user-validated portions are then used by the text-to-text translation system to produce further, hopefully improved suggestions. There are different alternatives of using speech in a computer-assisted translation system: From pure dictated translation to simple determination of acceptable partial translations by reading parts of the suggestions made by the system. In all the cases, information from the text to be translated can be used to constrain the speech decoding search space. While pure dictation seems to be among the most attractive settings, unfortunately perfect speech decoding does not seem possible with the current speech processing technology and human error-correcting would still be required. Therefore, approaches that allow for higher speech recognition accuracy by using increasingly constrained models in the speech recognition process are explored here. All these approaches are presented under the statistical framework. Empirical results support the potential usefulness of using speech within the computer-assisted translation paradigm.

AB We introduce ChrEnTranslate, an online machine translation demonstration system for translation between English and an endangered language Cherokee. It supports both statistical and neural translation models as well as provides quality estimation to inform users of reliability, two user feedback interfaces for experts and common users respectively, example inputs to collect human translations for monolingual data, word alignment visualization, and relevant terms from the CherokeeEnglish dictionary. The quantitative evaluation demonstrates that our backbone translation models achieve state-of-the-art translation performance and our quality estimation well correlates with both BLEU and human judgment. By analyzing 216 pieces of expert feedback, we find that NMT is preferable because it copies less than SMT, and, in general, current models can translate fragments of the source sentence but make major mistakes. When we add these 216 expert-corrected parallel texts into the training set and retrain models, equal or slightly better performance is observed, which demonstrates indicates the potential of human-in-the-loop learning.

AB Document-level neural machine translation has yielded attractive improvements. However, majority of existing methods roughly use all context sentences in a fixed scope. They neglect the fact that different source sentences need different sizes of context. To address this problem, we propose an effective approach to select dynamic context so that the document-level translation model can utilize the more useful selected context sentences to produce better translations. Specifically, we introduce a selection module that is independent of the translation module to score each candidate context sentence. Then, we propose two strategies to explicitly select a variable number of context sentences and feed them into the translation module. We train the two modules end-to-end via reinforcement learning. A novel reward is proposed to encourage the selection and utilization of dynamic context sentences. Experiments demonstrate that our approach can select adaptive context sentences for different source sentences, and significantly improves the performance of document-level translation methods.

AB In this paper, we present a new machine translation (MT) approach using MT engines and sentence partitioning. A multiple engine MT system consists of several MT engines running in parallel, coordinated by a controller. Each engine is implemented using an existing MT technique and has its own characteristics. When translating a sentence, each engine translates it independently. If more than one engine translates the sentence successfully, the controller chooses the best translation according to a combining algorithm implemented using translation statistics. If no engine succeeds in translating the sentence, the controller partitions the sentence, coordinates the engines to translates its constituent simple sentences, and combines the partial translation results into a translation result for the whole input sentence. A complex sentence is partitioned based on conjunctives and punctuation marks such as comma and semicolon. We have developed a multiple engine MT system based on the above approach. The system consists of four independent MT engines. The experiments show that the proposed approach is effective for implementing practical MT systems.

AB Specific-domain bilingual lexicons play an important role for domain adaptation in machine translation. The entries of these types of lexicons are mostly composed of MultiWord Expressions (MWEs). The manual construction of MWEs bilingual lexicons is costly and time-consuming. We often use word alignment approaches to automatically construct bilingual lexicons of MWEs from parallel corpora. We present in this paper a hybrid approach to extract and align MWEs from parallel corpora in a one-step process. We formalize the alignment process as an integer linear programming problem in order to find an approximated optimal solution. This process generates lists of MWEs with their translations, which are then filtered using linguistic patterns for the construction of the bilingual lexicons of MWEs. We evaluate the bilingual lexicons of MWEs produced by this approach using two methods: a manual evaluation of the alignment quality and an evaluation of the impact of this alignment on the translation quality of the phrase-based statistical machine translation system Moses. We experimentally show that the integration of the bilingual MWEs and their linguistic information into the translation model improves the performance of Moses.

We introduce an alternative approach to automatic translation of phrases/sentences that operationalizes this observation. We use a statistical machine translation system to produce alternative translations and a large monolingual corpus to (re)rank these translations. Our results show that this combination yields better translations, especially when translating out-of-domain phrases/sentences. Our approach can be also used to automatically construct parallel corpora from monolingual resources.

TI An Automatic Post Editing With Efficient and Simple Data Generation
   Method
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Automatic post-editing (APE) research considers methods for correcting translation results inferred by machine translation systems. The training of APE models, generally require triplets including a source sentence (src), machine translation sentence (mt), and post-edited sentence (pe). As considerable expert-level human labor is required in creating pe, APE researches have encountered difficulty in constructing suitable dataset for most of language pairs. This has led to the absence of APE data for most of language pairs, such as Korean-English, and imposed limitation to the sustainable researches of APE. Motivated by this problem, we propose a method that can generate APE triplets using only a parallel corpus without human labor. Our proposal comprises three noise generation techniques, including random, part of speech tagging (POS) based, and semantic level noises, and the effectiveness of these methods are verified by the results of quantitative and qualitative experiments on Korean-English APE tasks. As a result of our experiments, we find that POS based noise encourages the best APE performance. The proposed method is influential in that it can obviate expert human labor which was generally required in APE data construction, and enable the sustainable APE researches for the most language pairs where human-edited APE triplets are unavailable.

AB In many practical applications, neural machine translation systems have to deal with the input from automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems which may contain a certain number of errors. This leads to two problems which degrade translation performance. One is the discrepancy between the training and testing data and the other is the translation error caused by the input errors may ruin the whole translation. In this paper, we propose a method to handle the two problems so as to generate robust translation to ASR errors. First, we simulate ASR errors in the training data so that the data distribution in the training and test is consistent. Second, we focus on ASR errors on homophone words and words with similar pronunciation and make use of their pronunciation information to help the translation model to recover from the input errors. Experiments on two Chinese-English data sets show that our method is more robust to input errors and can outperform the strong Transformer baseline significantly.

AB Sign Languages (SLs) are the primary means of communication for at least half a million people in Europe alone. However, the development of SL recognition and translation tools is slowed down by a series of obstacles concerning resource scarcity and standardization issues in the available data. The former challenge relates to the volume of data available for machine learning as well as the time required to collect and process new data. The latter obstacle is linked to the variety of the data, i.e., annotation formats are not unified and vary amongst different resources. The available data formats are often not suitable for machine learning, obstructing the provision of automatic tools based on neural models. In the present paper, we give an overview of these challenges by comparing various SL corpora and SL machine learning datasets. Furthermore, we propose a framework to address the lack of standardization at format level, unify the available resources and facilitate SL research for different languages. Our framework takes ELAN files as inputs and returns textual and visual data ready to train SL recognition and translation models. We present a proof of concept, training neural translation models on the data produced by the proposed framework.

AB Simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) generates translation before reading the entire source sentence and hence it has to trade off between translation quality and latency. To fulfill the requirements of different translation quality and latency in practical applications, the previous methods usually need to train multiple SiMT models for different latency levels, resulting in large computational costs. In this paper, we propose a universal SiMT model with Mixture-of-Experts Wait-k Policy to achieve the best translation quality under arbitrary latency with only one trained model. Specifically, our method employs multi-head attention to accomplish the mixture of experts where each head is treated as a wait-k expert with its own waiting words number, and given a test latency and source inputs, the weights of the experts are accordingly adjusted to produce the best translation. Experiments on three datasets show that our method outperforms all the strong baselines under different latency, including the state-of-the-art adaptive policy.

AB Out of Vocabulary (OOV) is one of the major problems in Machine translation and Cross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR). As time goes on, more Chinese new words appear, these new words and their English translations are not collected in the bilingual dictionary used in the CLIR or machine translation system, so they belong to the OOV name entities. From observation, we know Chinese OOV name entities actually can be categorized into multiple types, so in this paper, we propose and implement an Chinese-English OOV translation mining system, and follow the divide and conquer strategy, we further categorize the Chinese OOV name entities into three types: Foreign word, Chinese name, and Chinese abbreviation, and then deal with them separately. When this system is combined with new word mining system, we can collect new name entities for the bilingual dictionary. From the experiment, we can observe that categorizing the Chinese OOV words helps find translations of OOV words and get a decent result.

TI Reconstructed similarity for faster GANs-based word translation to
   mitigate hubness
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
AB In machine word translation, Nearest Neighbor (NN) retrieval is able to search the best-k translation candidates as linguistic labels of a source query from a unified multilingual semantic feature space. However, NN is polluted by hubs in the high-dimensional feature space. Many proposed approaches remove hubs in the list of translation candidates to relieve this problem. But those approaches to eliminating hubs are flawed because they also have corresponding translations. To address this issue, we propose a novel Reconstructed Similarity (RS) retrieval for the neural machine word translation model to mitigate the hubness problem regardless of whether it is a hub. Different from previous work, RS reduces the impact of hubness pollution in dense and high-dimensional space and allows the hubs to have the same probability as the target candidates without being inappropriately excluded. In addition, RS improves the quality of bilingual dictionaries by measuring the bilateral similarity of the bilingual and monolingual distance of each of the source query embeddings. Additionally, to model the unsupervised machine word translation, we introduce Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) to map the source and target word distribution into a shared semantic space. We also construct a tiny GAN topology for neural machine word translation, which is at least 52 x faster than previous GAN-based models. To further align cross-lingual embedding distributions, we provide orthogonal Procrustes mapping, global-awareness of the transformation matrix and rescaling of the target embeddings as flexible and optional multirefinements. The results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art by nearly 4% in distant languages such as English to Finnish. Compared with a precision@1 of 47.00% from English to Finnish, our model obtains a precision@1 of 47.53% and achieves state-of-the-art results in a fully unsupervised form. Moreover, our model achieves competitive results in the shortest time among GAN-based models, which easily trade offbetween speed and accuracy. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB These days, the improved accuracy of machine translation system enable us conduct intercultural collaboration. Even though machine translation could translate words correctly, we sometimes face trouble in our communications because we think about different images for the same word due to our different backgrounds and culture. To make the machine translation users notice the difference, a previous study proposed a cultural difference detection method based on image feature similarity. However, the proposal have a deficiency about any similarity criteria for judging cultural differences. This paper proposes a method for calculating the criteria for detecting cultural differences. Specifically, a threshold value is used to determine the presence or absence of a cultural difference from the image similarity. An experiment compares the detection results with the results of human determination as to the cultural difference contained in the pair. The experiment changes the threshold value to determine the optimum threshold value. We prepared 1000 concepts and judged the cultural difference by the proposed method. We divided the concepts into 200 and verified them by 5-fold cross validation. As a result, the average threshold value closest to human judgement calculated from validation data was 0.4 and the accuracy for test data was 80.4%.

AB In this study, we think the feature of exhaustively verifying the process model of model checking is effective for Causal Analysis based on Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Process (CAST), and discuss the introduction of the model checking technology in CAST. In particular, we propose a verification model translation method for behavior models which are created in the CAST process. Because the interaction between multiple components is important in CAST, our translation method translates plural related SysML state machine diagrams describing the components behavior to one verification model. The verification model is described in Promela language for SPIN model checker. In order to suppress the cost of the model checking, our translation method has the feature that the verification model to be generated is simple. Furthermore, it has the feature that the correspondence between the related behavior models and the verification model is understandable, and the efficiency of the confirmation of verification result can be improved. In addition, since it has the feature that the communication situation between each state machine is easy to check, it is expected to be utilized for CAST. In this paper, we describe the rules to translate the related SysML state machine diagrams to a simple verification model in Promela.

TI Knowledge Distillation: A Method for Making Neural Machine Translation
   More Efficient
SO INFORMATION
AB Neural machine translation (NMT) systems have greatly improved the quality available from machine translation (MT) compared to statistical machine translation (SMT) systems. However, these state-of-the-art NMT models need much more computing power and data than SMT models, a requirement that is unsustainable in the long run and of very limited benefit in low-resource scenarios. To some extent, model compression-more specifically state-of-the-art knowledge distillation techniques-can remedy this. In this work, we investigate knowledge distillation on a simulated low-resource German-to-English translation task. We show that sequence-level knowledge distillation can be used to train small student models on knowledge distilled from large teacher models. Part of this work examines the influence of hyperparameter tuning on model performance when lowering the number of Transformer heads or limiting the vocabulary size. Interestingly, the accuracy of these student models is higher than that of the teachers in some cases even though the student model training times are shorter in some cases. In a novel contribution, we demonstrate for a specific MT service provider that in the post-deployment phase, distilled student models can reduce emissions, as well as cost purely in monetary terms, by almost 50%.

TI RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN MACHINE TRANSLATION
SO COMPUTERS AND THE HUMANITIES
AB This paper describes developments in the area of machine translation (MT). First, the paper gives an overview of developments in Germany in general; then, special problems are discussed. The system taken as an example is METAL (Machine Translation and Analysis of Natural Language), where recent development work has centered around two main topics. (i) Efforts have been made to make the system really multilingual. The German-to-English prototype had to be expanded, some system components had to be readjusted, and additional problems had to be solved. Currently, analysis and synthesis components for German, English, French, Spanish, and Dutch are under development. All these languages use a common system kernel and a standard interface structure. (ii) The system had to be made user-friendly. This was an even more important task as, up to now, MT systems have not been well accepted by users. METAL tries to be more realistic, and also tries to support the main user interfaces in a much better way than has been done before. This is based on the conviction that there are several parameters which determine the real success of an MT system. It is not just translation quality which is decisive, it is also the integration of an MT system into the whole process of preparing and translating documents.

AB Good performance of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) is usually achieved with huge parallel bilingual training corpora, because the translations of words or phrases are computed basing on bilingual data. However, in case of low-resource language pairs such as English-Bengali, the performance is affected by insufficient amount of bilingual training data. Recently, comparable corpora became widely considered as valuable resources for machine translation. Though very few cases of sub-sentential level parallelism are found between two comparable documents, there are still potential parallel phrases in comparable corpora. Mining parallel data from comparable corpora is a promising approach to collect more parallel training data for SMT. In this paper, we propose an automatic alignment of English-Bengali comparable sentences from comparable documents. We use a novel textual entailment method and distributional semantics for text similarity. Subsequently, we apply template-based phrase extraction technique to aligned parallel phrases from comparable sentence pairs. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by using parallel phrases as additional training examples for an English-Bengali phrase-based SMT system. Our system achieves significant improvement in terms of translation quality over the baseline system.

TI Bagging and Boosting statistical machine translation systems
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB In this article we address the issue of generating diversified translation systems from a single Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) engine for system combination. Unlike traditional approaches, we do not resort to multiple structurally different SMT systems, but instead directly learn a strong SMT system from a single translation engine in a principled way. Our approach is based on Bagging and Boosting which are two instances of the general framework of ensemble learning. The basic idea is that we first generate an ensemble of weak translation systems using a base learning algorithm, and then learn a strong translation system from the ensemble. One of the advantages of our approach is that it can work with any of current SMT systems and make them stronger almost "for free". Beyond this, most system combination methods are directly applicable to the proposed framework for generating the final translation system from the ensemble of weak systems. We evaluate our approach on Chinese-English translation in three state-of-the-art SMT systems, including a phrase-based system, a hierarchical phrase-based system and a syntax-based system. Experimental results on the NIST MT evaluation corpora show that our approach leads to significant improvements in translation accuracy over the baselines. More interestingly, it is observed that our approach is able to improve the existing system combination systems. The biggest improvements are obtained by generating weak systems using Bagging/Boosting, and learning the strong system using a state-of-the-art system combination method. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Transformer-based Neural Machine Translation models have achieved impressive results on many translation tasks. In the meanwhile, some studies prove that extending syntax information can be explicitly incorporated to provide further improvements especially for some low-resource languages. In this paper, we propose RESA: the relation enhanced self-attention for Transformer which can integrate source side dependency syntax. More specifically, dependency parsing produces two kinds of information: dependency heads and relation labels, compared to the previous works only pay attention to dependency heads information, RESA use two methods to integrate relation labels as well: 1) Hard-way that uses a hyper parameter to control the information percentage after mapping relation labels sequence to continuous representations; 2) Gate-way that employs a gate mechanism to mix word information and relation labels information. We evaluate our methods on low-resource Chinese-Tibetan and Chinese-Mongol translation tasks, and the preliminary experimental results show that the proposed model achieves 0.93 and 0.68 BLEU scores gain compared to the baseline model.

TI A Loss-Augmented Approach to Training Syntactic Machine Translation
   Systems
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Current syntactic machine translation (MT) systems implicitly use beam-width unlimited search in learning model parameters (e.g., feature values for each translation rule). However, a limited beam-width has to be adopted in decoding new sentences, and the MT output is in general evaluated by various metrics, such as BLEU and TER. In this paper, we address: 1) the mismatch of adopted beam-widths between training and decoding; and 2) the mismatch of training criteria and MT evaluation metrics. Unlike previous work, we model the two problems in a single training paradigm simultaneously. We design a loss-augmented approach that explicitly considers the limited beam-width and evaluation metric in training, and present a simple but effective method to learn the model. By using beam search and BLEU-related losses, our approach improves a state-of-the-art syntactic MT system by + 1.0 BLEU on Chinese-to-English and English-to-Chinese translation tasks. It even outperforms seven previous training approaches over 0.8 BLEU points. More interestingly, promising improvements are observed when our approach works with TER.

AB This paper demonstrates our machine translation systems for the CCMT 2020, which is composed of four parts. The last three parts report our results in the contest, each respectively focuses on English-Chinese bi-direction translation, Japanese-Chinese-English multi-lingual translation (patent domain), and Chinese minority languages to Mandarin Chinese translation. In each part, we will demonstrate our work on data pre-processing, model training as well as the application of general techniques, such as back-translation, ensemble and reranking. Besides, during our experiments, we surprisingly found that simply applying different Chinese word segmentation tools on low-resource corpora could bring obvious benefit across different tasks, and we will separate an independent section to discuss this finding. Among the 7 directions we participated in, we ranked the first in 6 tasks (For the corpus filtering task, we ranked first in the 500 million words sub-task) and the second for the rest.

AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has drawn much attention due to its promising translation performance recently. However, several studies indicate that NMT often generates fluent but unfaithful translations. In this paper, we propose a method to alleviate this problem by using a phrase table as recommendation memory. The main idea is to add bonus to words worthy of recommendation, so that NMT can make correct predictions. Specifically, we first derive a prefix tree to accommodate all the candidate target phrases by searching the phrase translation table according to the source sentence. Then, we construct a recommendation word set by matching between candidate target phrases and previously translated target words by NMT. After that, we determine the specific bonus value for each recommendable word by using the attention vector and phrase translation probability. Finally, we integrate this bonus value into NMT to improve the translation results. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods obtain remarkable improvements over the strong attention-based NMT.

AB Lectures translation is a case of spoken language translation and there is a lack of publicly available parallel corpora for this purpose. To address this, we examine a framework for parallel corpus mining which is a quick and effective way to mine a parallel corpus from publicly available lectures at Coursera. Our approach determines sentence alignments, relying on machine translation and cosine similarity over continuous-space sentence representations. We also show how to use the resulting corpora in a multistage fine-tuning based domain adaptation for high-quality lectures translation. For Japanese-English lectures translation, we extracted parallel data of approximately 40,000 lines and created development and test sets through manual filtering for benchmarking translation performance. We demonstrate that the mined corpus greatly enhances the quality of translation when used in conjunction with out-of-domain parallel corpora via multistage training. This paper also suggests some guidelines to gather and clean corpora, mine parallel sentences, address noise in the mined data, and create high-quality evaluation splits. For the sake of reproducibility, we have released our code for parallel data creation.

By contrast, general finite-state transduction algorithms have been applied in a variety of tasks. This paper gives a finite-state reconstruction of statistical translation and demonstrates the use of standard tools to compute statistically likely translations. Ours is the first translation algorithm for "fertility/permutation" statistical models to be described in replicable detail.

AB In Statistical Machine Translation from English to Malayalam, an unseen English sentence is translated into its equivalent Malayalam sentence using statistical models. A parallel corpus of English-Malayalam is used in the training phase. Word to word alignments has to be set among the sentence pairs of the source and target language before subjecting them for training. This paper deals with certain techniques which can be adopted for improving the alignment model of SMT. Methods to incorporate the parts of speech information into the bilingual corpus has resulted in eliminating many of the insignificant alignments. Also identifying the name entities and cognates present in the sentence pairs has proved to be advantageous while setting up the alignments. Presence of Malayalam words with predictable translations has also contributed in reducing the insignificant alignments. Moreover, reduction of the unwanted alignments has brought in better training results. Experiments conducted on a sample corpus have generated reasonably good Malayalam translations and the results are verified with F measure, BLEU and WER evaluation metrics.

AB This paper presents a rule based machine translation system which is capable of translating sentences from Sinhala to English and vice versa. This is the first Sinhala to English and English to Sinhala machine translation system which comes with features such as a Sinhalese font translator, which is capable of interpreting Sinhalese words written in English characters (Singlish) to Sinhala characters, and an English grammar and spell checker. An entered sentence to the system will be tokenized and translated according to a rule. When translating Sinhala sentences to English the user input should be in Singlish and when translating English sentences to Sinhala input should be in English. The main objective of this translator is to enable a smooth flow translation of words, sentences and paragraphs to locals as well as foreigners and thereby eliminate the language barrier. A considerable amount of rules, patterns and words of both languages were used to develop this system. With 87% accuracy this pilot machine translation system translated 500 grammatically well-structured Sinhala sentences to English and 150 grammatically well-structured English sentences to Sinhala. The system is capable of translating approximately 70 sentences in one minute.

AB Languages help to unite the world socially, culturally and technologically. Different natives communicate in different languages; there is a tremendous requirement for inter-language information translation process to transfer and share information and ideas. Though Sanskrit is an ancient Indo-European language, a significant amount of work for processing the information is required to explore the full potential of this language to open vistas in computational linguistics and computer science domain. In this paper, we have proposed and presented the machine translation system for translating Sanskrit to the Hindi language. The developed technique uses linguistic features from rule-based feed to train neural machine translation system. The work is novel and applicable to any low-resource language with rich morphology. It is a generic system covering various domains with minimal human intervention. The performance analysis of work is performed on automatic and linguistic measures. The results show that proposed and developed approach outperforms earlier work for this language pair.

AB Machine translation (MT) is currently evaluated in one of two ways: in a monolingual fashion, by comparison with the system output to one or more human reference translations, or in a trained cross-lingual fashion, by building a supervised model to predict quality scores from human-labeled data. In this paper, we propose a more cost-effective, yet well performing unsupervised alternative SentSim: relying on strong pretrained multilingual word and sentence representations, we directly compare the source with the machine translated sentence, thus avoiding the need for both reference translations and labelled training data. The metric builds on state-of-the-art embedding-based approaches - namely BERTScore and Word Mover's Distance - by incorporating a notion of sentence semantic similarity. By doing so, it achieves better correlation with human scores on different datasets. We show that it outperforms these and other metrics in the standard monolingual setting (MT-reference translation), a well as in the source-MT bilingual setting, where it performs on par with glass-box approaches to quality estimation that rely on MT model information.

TI On Eigen-matrix translation method for classification of biological data
SO JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE & COMPLEXITY
AB Driven by the challenge of integrating large amount of experimental data, classification technique emerges as one of the major and popular tools in computational biology and bioinformatics research. Machine learning methods, especially kernel methods with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are very popular and effective tools. In the perspective of kernel matrix, a technique namely Eigenmatrix translation has been introduced for protein data classification. The Eigen-matrix translation strategy has a lot of nice properties which deserve more exploration. This paper investigates the major role of Eigen-matrix translation in classification. The authors propose that its importance lies in the dimension reduction of predictor attributes within the data set. This is very important when the dimension of features is huge. The authors show by numerical experiments on real biological data sets that the proposed framework is crucial and effective in improving classification accuracy. This can therefore serve as a novel perspective for future research in dimension reduction problems.

TI Attacking neural machine translations via hybrid attention learning
SO MACHINE LEARNING
AB Deep-learning based natural language processing (NLP) models are proven vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, there is currently insufficient research that studies attacks to neural machine translations (NMTs) and examines the robustness of deep-learning based NMTs. In this paper, we aim to fill this critical research gap. When generating word-level adversarial examples in NLP attacks, there is a conventional trade-off in existing methods between the attacking performance and the amount of perturbations. Although some literature has studied such a trade-off and successfully generated adversarial examples with a reasonable amount of perturbations, it is still challenging to generate highly successful translation attacks while concealing the changes to the texts. To this end, we propose a novel Hybrid Attentive Attack method to locate language-specific and sequence-focused words, and make semantic-aware substitutions to attack NMTs. We evaluate the effectiveness of our attack strategy by attacking three high-performing translation models. The experimental results show that our method achieves the highest attacking performance compared with other existing attacking strategies.

AB In this paper, we propose two neural machine translation (NMT) systems (French-to-Wolof and Wolof-to-French) based on sequence-to-sequence with attention and Transformer architectures. We trained our models on the parallel French-Wolof corpus (Nguer et al., 2020) of about 83k sentence pairs. Because of the low-resource setting, we experimented with advanced methods for handling data sparsity, including subword segmentation, backtranslation and the copied corpus method. We evaluate the models using BLEU score and find that the transformer outperforms the classic sequence-to-sequence model in all settings, in addition to being less sensitive to noise. In general, the best scores are achieved when training the models on subword-level based units. For such models, using backtranslation proves to be slightly beneficial in low-resource Wolof to high-resource French language translation for the transformer-based models. A slight improvement can also be observed when injecting copied monolingual text in the target language. Moreover, combining the copied method data with backtranslation leads to a slight improvement of the translation quality.

TI Syntax-aware neural machine translation directed by syntactic dependency
   degree
SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
AB There are various ways to incorporate syntax knowledge into neural machine translation (NMT). However, quantifying the dependency syntactic intimacy (DSI) between word pairs in a dependency tree has not being considered to use in attentional and transformer-based NMT. In this paper, we innovatively propose a variant of Tree-LSTM to capture the syntactic dependency degree (SDD) between word pairs in dependency trees. Two syntax-aware distances, including a tuned syntax distance and a rho-dependent distance, are proposed. For attentional NMT, two syntax-aware attentions based on two syntax-aware distances are proposed for attentional NMT, and we also design a dual attention to simultaneously generate global context and dependency syntactic context. For transformer-based NMT, we explicitly incorporate the dependency syntax into self-attention network (SAN) to propose a syntax-aware SAN. Experiments on IWSLT'17 English-German, IWSLT Chinese-English and WMT'15 English-Finnish translation tasks show that our syntax-aware NMT significantly improves translation quality by comparing with baseline methods, even the state-of-the-art transformer-based NMT.

TI Chinese-Naxi machine translation method based on Naxi dependency
   language model
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING AND CYBERNETICS
AB To make use of the syntactic characteristic of Naxi language effectively, in this paper, a Chinese-Naxi machine translation method based on Naxi dependency language model is proposed. The method, firstly, makes dependency parsing on the Chinese sentence, and extracts Chinese-Naxi dependency tree-to-string translation templates. Secondly, it decodes Naxi Sentence by using the templates, and generates n-best candidate sentences. Thirdly, it makes dependency parsing on each of the candidate Naxi sentences, and obtains a node sequence corresponding to the dependency relationships. Finally, it builds a Naxi dependency language model, with the help of the model, calculates and reorders each node from the sequence, and selects the final target sentence. The comparative experiments, on the proposed method, the existing tree-to-string translating method, Bruin and Mo-tse, show that the Chinese-Naxi machine translation method combined with the Naxi dependency language model can improve the translating accuracy effectively, and its BLEU-2 increases by 2 point than without the Naxi dependency language model.

TI Maximum entropy modeling: A suitable framework to learn
   context-dependent lexicon models for statistical machine translation
SO MACHINE LEARNING
AB Current statistical machine translation systems are mainly based on statistical word lexicons. However, these models are usually context-independent, therefore, the disambiguation of the translation of a source word must be carried out using other probabilistic distributions (distortion distributions and statistical language models). One efficient way to add contextual information to the statistical lexicons is based on maximum entropy modeling. In that framework, the context is introduced through feature functions that allow us to automatically learn context-dependent lexicon models.
   In a first approach, maximum entropy modeling is carried out after a process of learning standard statistical models (alignment and lexicon). In a second approach, the maximum entropy modeling is integrated in the expectation-maximization process of learning standard statistical models.
   Experimental results were obtained for two well-known tasks, the French-English Canadian Parliament HANSARDS task and the German-English VERMOBIL task. These results proved that the use of maximum entropy models in both approaches, can help to improve the performance of the statistical translation systems.

TI Parallel subtitle corpora and their applications in machine translation
   and translatology
SO PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATOLOGY
AB SUMAT is a project funded through the EU ICT Policy Support Programme (2011-2014). It involves four subtitling companies (InVision, DDS, Titelbild, VSI) and five technical partners (ALS, ATC, TextShuttle, University of Maribor, Vicomtech).For the SUMAT project, translated subtitles for seven language pairs have been collected. Four subtitling companies have contributed to this effort, which has so far resulted in collections numbering between 200,000 and 2 million subtitles per language pair. This paper describes the process of converting, classifying and aligning the subtitles. Conversion to a common text format and cross-language alignment were automatically done, using specially built converters, whilst classifying the subtitles according to text genre was a manual process, performed by the teams harvesting the subtitles.The resulting subtitle corpora are perfectly suited for various applications. The focus of the SUMAT project is to use them as training material for statistical machine translation systems, and this paper will report on the initial experiences with some of the language pairs. In addition, the parallel corpora may serve as input data for parallel concordancing systems.

AB Despite being the seventh most widely spoken language in the world, Bengali has received much less attention in machine translation literature due to being low in resources. Most publicly available parallel corpora for Bengali are not large enough; and have rather poor quality, mostly because of incorrect sentence alignments resulting from erroneous sentence segmentation, and also because of a high volume of noise present in them. In this work, we build a customized sentence segmenter for Bengali and propose two novel methods for parallel corpus creation on low-resource setups: aligner ensembling and batch filtering. With the segmenter and the two methods combined, we compile a high-quality BengaliEnglish parallel corpus comprising of 2.75 million sentence pairs, more than 2 million of which were not available before. Training on neural models, we achieve an improvement of more than 9 BLEU score over previous approaches to Bengali-English machine translation. We also evaluate on a new test set of 1000 pairs made with extensive quality control. We release the segmenter, parallel corpus, and the evaluation set, thus elevating Bengali from its low-resource status. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever large scale study on Bengali-English machine translation. We believe our study will pave the way for future research on Bengali-English machine translation as well as other low-resource languages.

TI Lattice-Based ASR-MT Interface for Speech Translation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB The usual approach to improve the interface between automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) is to use ASR word lattices for translation. In comparison with the previous research along this line, this paper presents an efficient algorithm for lattice-based search in MT. This algorithm utilizes confusion network information to enable phrase-level reordering, and is also able to process general lattices. The proposed search is not constrained to be monotonic; thus, it is able to perform the same type of reordering given lattice input as any statistical phrase-based search algorithm with a single sentence input. Using the concept described in this paper, we are able to significantly improve speech translation results on several small and large vocabulary tasks. The improvements of the MT quality as measured by BLEU are as high as 5% relative. We also show that the proposed lattice-based translation can outperform state-of-the-art translation of confusion networks and has advantages in terms of translation speed. Furthermore, we propose and evaluate a novel approach that shares the benefits of lattice-based translation with those translation systems which are not designed to process word lattices.

TI Parallel fragments : Measuring their impact on translation performance
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB Lack of parallel corpora have diverted the direction of research towards exploring other arenas to fill in the dearth. Comparable corpora have proved to be a valuable resource in this regard. Interestingly other than the parallel sentences extracted from comparable corpora, parallel phrase fragments have also proved to be beneficial for statistical machine translation. We present a novel approach based on an efficient framework for parallel fragment extraction from comparable corpora. Using the fragments as additional corpus for translation, we are able to obtain an improvement of 0.88 and 0.89 BLEU points on test data for Arabic English and French English systems respectively. We have also conducted a detailed analysis of impact of fragments extracted from related vs non-related corpus. A comparison of impact of parallel fragments vs. parallel sentences is also presented highlighting the significance of parallel segments for statistical machine translation. The article concludes with a crude comparative analysis of our approach with an existing fragment extraction technique at various stages of the fragment extraction pipeline. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although the technology of machine translation (MT) has achieved great progress in recent years, the output generated by MT systems still need human post-editing (PE) to meet the quality requirements of many translation tasks. How to measure the PE effort of an MT output is a key problem in PE study. PE time is a metric that can well reflect the overall PE effort and is widely used in practice. This paper studied the method to automatically predict the PE time. We manually post-edited the English-Chinese NMT output in three domains, with PE time recorded and MT error types annotated. Based on the corpus, we took error types as features and used machine learning models to predict PE time. Since the error types in MT output are unavailable in real PE scenario, we also proposed a prediction method based on the translation quality estimation (QE) framework that can make prediction without error information. Experimental results show that both methods achieve higher correlation with the actual PE time than the baseline method.

CY JUL 14-19, 2019

AB Neural machine translation models are used to automatically generate a document from given source code since this can be regarded as a machine translation task. Source code summarization is one of the components for automatic document generation, which generates a summary in natural language from given source code. This suggests that techniques used in neural machine translation, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), can be used for source code summarization. However, there is a considerable difference between source code and natural language: Source code is essentially structured, having loops and conditional branching, etc. Therefore, there is some obstacle to apply known machine translation models to source code.
   Abstract syntax trees (ASTs) capture these structural properties and play an important role in recent machine learning studies on source code. Tree-LSTM is proposed as a generalization of LSTMs for tree-structured data. However, there is a critical issue when applying it to ASTs: It cannot handle a tree that contains nodes having an arbitrary number of children and their order simultaneously, which ASTs generally have such nodes. To address this issue, we propose an extension of Tree-LSTM, which we call Multi-way Tree-LSTM and apply it for source code summarization. As a result of computational experiments, our proposal achieved better results when compared with several state-of-the-art techniques.

TI MSVD-Turkish: a comprehensive multimodal video dataset for integrated
   vision and language research in Turkish
SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB Automatic generation of video descriptions in natural language, also called video captioning, aims to understand the visual content of the video and produce a natural language sentence depicting the objects and actions in the scene. This challenging integrated vision and language problem, however, has been predominantly addressed for English. The lack of data and the linguistic properties of other languages limit the success of existing approaches for such languages. In this paper we target Turkish, a morphologically rich and agglutinative language that has very different properties compared to English. To do so, we create the first large-scale video captioning dataset for this language by carefully translating the English descriptions of the videos in the MSVD (Microsoft Research Video Description Corpus) dataset into Turkish. In addition to enabling research in video captioning in Turkish, the parallel English-Turkish descriptions also enable the study of the role of video context in (multimodal) machine translation. In our experiments, we build models for both video captioning and multimodal machine translation and investigate the effect of different word segmentation approaches and different neural architectures to better address the properties of Turkish. We hope that the MSVD-Turkish dataset and the results reported in this work will lead to better video captioning and multimodal machine translation models for Turkish and other morphology rich and agglutinative languages.

TI Quantitative fine-grained human evaluation of machine translation
   systems: a case study on English to Croatian
SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB This paper presents a quantitative fine-grained manual evaluation approach to comparing the performance of different machine translation (MT) systems. We build upon the well-established multidimensional quality metrics (MQM) error taxonomy and implement a novel method that assesses whether the differences in performance for MQM error types between different MT systems are statistically significant. We conduct a case study for English-to-Croatian, a language direction that involves translating into a morphologically rich language, for which we compare three MT systems belonging to different paradigms: pure phrase-based, factored phrase-based and neural. First, we design an MQM-compliant error taxonomy tailored to the relevant linguistic phenomena of Slavic languages, which made the annotation process feasible and accurate. Errors in MT outputs were then annotated by two annotators following this taxonomy. Subsequently, we carried out a statistical analysis which showed that the best-performing system (neural) reduces the errors produced by the worst system (pure phrase-based) by more than half (54%). Moreover, we conducted an additional analysis of agreement errors in which we distinguished between short (phrase-level) and long distance (sentence-level) errors. We discovered that phrase-based MT approaches are of limited use for long distance agreement phenomena, for which neural MT was found to be especially effective.

AB Word alignment is a basic and critical process in the Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). The previous work on word alignment mainly focuses on the training process to get the word mapping relation between the source sentences and target sentences. However, the word alignment for combination of SMT system outputs is also important, which aims to find the word correspondence between alternative translation hypotheses of a source language sentence. Unfortunately, it does not attract so much attention in SMT research. In this paper, we propose a novel word alignment approach to effectively address the word alignment between sentences with different valid word orders, which changes the order of the word sequences (called word reordering) of the output hypotheses to make the word order more exactly match the alignment reference. We present experimental results on the IWSLT'2008 challenge tasks with the combination of four state-of-the-art SMT systems outputs. The results show that our approach significantly improves the performance of the system combination.

AB Language model adaptation based on Machine Translation (MT) is a recently proposed approach to improve the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) of spoken translations that does not suffer from a common problem in approaches based on rescoring i.e. errors made during recognition cannot be recovered by the MT system.
   In previous work we presented an efficient implementation for MT-based language model adaptation using a word-based translation model. By omitting renormalization and employing weighted updates, the implementation exhibited virtually no adaptation overhead, enabling its use in a real-time setting.
   In this paper we investigate whether we can improve recognition accuracy without sacrificing the achieved efficiency. More precisely, we investigate the effect of both state-of-the-art phrase-based translation models and named entity probability estimation. We report relative WER reductions of 6.2% over a word-based LM adaptation technique and 25.3% over an unadapted 3-gram baseline on an English-to-Dutch dataset.

AB Technical advances and its increasing availability, mean that Machine Translation (MT) is now widely used for the translation of search queries in multilingual search tasks. A number of free-to-use high -quality online MT systems are now available and, although imperfect in their translation behaviour, are found to produce good performance in Cross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) applications. Users of these MT systems in CLIR tasks generally assume that they all behave similarly in CLIR applications, and the choice of MT system is often made on the basis of convenience. We present a set of experiments which compare the impact of applying two of the best known online systems, Google and Bing translation, for query translation across multiple language pairs and for two very different CUR tasks. Our experiments show that the MT systems perform differently on average for different tasks and language pairs, but more significantly for different individual queries. We examine the differing translation behaviour of these tools and seek to draw conclusions in terms of their suitability for use in different settings.

TI Machine learning predicts translation initiation sites in neurologic
   diseases with nucleotide repeat expansions
SO PLOS ONE
AB A number of neurologic diseases associated with expanded nucleotide repeats, including an inherited form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, have an unconventional form of translation called repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. It has been speculated that the repeat regions in the RNA fold into secondary structures in a length-dependent manner, promoting RAN translation. Repeat protein products are translated, accumulate, and may contribute to disease pathogenesis. Nucleotides that flank the repeat region, especially ones closest to the initiation site, are believed to enhance translation initiation. A machine learning model has been published to help identify ATG and near-cognate translation initiation sites; however, this model has diminished predictive power due to its extensive feature selection and limited training data. Here, we overcome this limitation and increase prediction accuracy by the following: a) capture the effect of nucleotides most critical for translation initiation via feature reduction, b) implement an alternative machine learning algorithm better suited for limited data, c) build comprehensive and balanced training data (via sampling without replacement) that includes previously unavailable sequences, and d) split ATG and near-cognate translation initiation codon data to train two separate models. We also design a supplementary scoring system to provide an additional prognostic assessment of model predictions. The resultant models have high performance, with similar to 85-88% accuracy, exceeding that of the previously published model by >18%. The models presented here are used to identify translation initiation sites in genes associated with a number of neurologic repeat expansion disorders. The results confirm a number of sites of translation initiation upstream of the expanded repeats that have been found experimentally, and predict sites that are not yet established.

AB Speech translation is usually the pipeline task of automatic speech recognition (ASR), translation unit segmentation and machine translation (MT). Segmenting the ASR output to translation units poses a challenge of balancing the translation quality and efficiency for real-time speech translation. In this paper, we firstly propose a parser-based semantic boundary detection method to detect all semantic boundaries based on our definition. To realize the translation of the semantic units, a word-boundary language model is secondly proposed to improve the translation quality. Experiments on English to Chinese and Chinese to English speech translation have shown that the proposed method yields improved translation quality and lower latency, when compared to the conventional punctuated methods.

AB Visual context provides grounding information for multi-modal machine translation (MMT). However, previous MMT models and probing studies on visual features suggest that visual information is less explored in MMT as it is often redundant to textual information. In this paper, we propose an Object-level Visual Context modeling framework (OVC) to efficiently capture and explore visual information for multi-modal machine translation. With detected objects, the proposed OVC encourages MMT to ground translation on desirable visual objects by masking irrelevant objects in the visual modality. We equip the proposed OVC with an additional object-masking loss to achieve this goal. The object-masking loss is estimated according to the similarity between masked objects and the source texts so as to encourage masking source-irrelevant objects. Additionally, in order to generate vision-consistent target words, we further propose a vision-weighted translation loss for OVC. Experiments on MMT datasets demonstrate that the proposed OVC model outperforms state-of-the-art MMT models and analyses show that masking irrelevant objects helps grounding in MMT.(1)

AB Experimental single-cell data often presents an incomplete picture due to its destructive nature: 1) we collect certain experimental measurements of cells but lack measurements under different experimental conditions or data modalities; 2) we collect data of cells at certain time points but lack measurements at other time points; or 3) we collect data of cells under certain perturbations but lack data for other types of perturbations. In this article, we will discuss machine learning approaches to address these types of translation and counterfactual problems. We will begin by giving an overview on single-cell biology applications and the relevant translation problems. Subsequently, we will provide an overview of approaches for multidomain alignment and translation in machine learning, including methods based on generative modeling, optimal transport, and causal inference. The bulk of this article will focus on how these approaches have been tailored and applied to important translation problems in single-cell biology, illustrated through concrete examples from our own work. We end with open problems and a perspective on how biology may not only be uniquely suited to being one of the greatest beneficiaries of machine learning but also one of the greatest sources of inspiration for it.

TI Word-Level Quality Estimation for Korean-English Neural Machine
   Translation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quality estimation (QE) task aims to predict the machine translation (MT) quality well by referring to the source sentence and its MT output. The various applicability of QE proves the importance of QE research, but the enormous human labor to construct the QE dataset remains a challenge. This study proposes three automatic word-level pseudo-QE data construction strategies using a monolingual or parallel corpus and an external machine translator without human labor. We utilize these individual pseudo-QE datasets to finetune multilingual pretrained language models such as cross-lingual language models (XLM), XLM-RoBERTa, and multilingual BART and comparatively analyze the results. Considering the synthetic dataset creation setup, we attempt to validate the objectivity of the QE model by leveraging four test sets translated by external translators from Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Systran. As a result, XLM-R-large shows the best performance among mPLMs. We also verify the reliability of the QE model through the close performance gaps between different test sets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to experiment with word-level Korean-English QE.

AB Transliteration forms an essential part of transcription which converts text from one writing system to another. The need for translating data has become larger than before as the world is getting together through social media. Machine transliteration has emerged as a part of information retrieval and machine translation projects to translate named entities, that are not registered in the dictionary, based on phonemes and graphemes. This paper proposes a machine learning technique that performs transliteration from Tamil to Malayalam, two languages that belong to Dravidian family. Transliteration can be used to supplement machine translation process by handling the issues that can happen due to the presence of named entities.

AB Lexically-constrained sequence decoding allows for explicit positive or negative phrase-based constraints to be placed on target output strings in generation tasks such as machine translation or monolingual text rewriting. We describe vectorized dynamic beam allocation, which extends work in lexically-constrained decoding to work with batching, leading to a five-fold improvement in throughput when working with positive constraints. Faster decoding enables faster exploration of constraint strategies: we illustrate this via data augmentation experiments with a monolingual rewriter applied to the tasks of natural language inference, question answering and machine translation, showing improvements in all three.

AB This paper investigates the possibilities of steganographically embedding information in the "noise" created by automatic translation of natural language documents. Because the inherent redundancy of natural language creates plenty of room for variation in translation, machine translation is ideal for steganographic applications. Also, because there are frequent errors in legitimate automatic text translations, additional errors inserted by an information hiding mechanism are plausibly undetectable and would appear to be part of the normal noise associated with translation. Significantly, it should be extremely difficult for an adversary to determine if inaccuracies in the translation are caused by the use of steganography or by deficiencies of the translation software.

AB We present a hybrid approach to sentence simplification which combines deep semantics and monolingual machine translation to derive simple sentences from complex ones. The approach differs from previous work in two main ways. First, it is semantic based in that it takes as input a deep semantic representation rather than e.g., a sentence or a parse tree. Second, it combines a simplification model for splitting and deletion with a monolingual translation model for phrase substitution and reordering. When compared against current state of the art methods, our model yields significantly simpler output that is both grammatical and meaning preserving.

AB Simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) outputs translation while receiving the streaming source inputs, and hence needs a policy to determine where to start translating. The alignment between target and source words often implies the most informative source word for each target word, and hence provides the unified control over translation quality and latency, but unfortunately the existing SiMT methods do not explicitly model the alignment to perform the control. In this paper, we propose Gaussian Multi-head Attention (GMA) to develop a new SiMT policy by modeling alignment and translation in a unified manner. For SiMT policy, GMA models the aligned source position of each target word, and accordingly waits until its aligned position to start translating. To integrate the learning of alignment into the translation model, a Gaussian distribution centered on predicted aligned position is introduced as an alignment-related prior, which cooperates with translation-related soft attention to determine the final attention. Experiments on En.Vi and De.En tasks show that our method outperforms strong baselines on the trade-off between translation and latency.

AB Statistical models for reordering source words have been used to enhance the hierarchical phrase-based statistical machine translation system. Existing word reordering models learn the reordering for any two source words in a sentence or only for two continuous words. This paper proposes a series of separate sub-models to learn reorderings for word pairs with different distances. Our experiments demonstrate that reordering sub-models for word pairs with distance less than a specific threshold are useful to improve translation quality. Compared with previous work, our method may more effectively and efficiently exploit helpful word reordering information.

TI Making the most of comparable corpora in Neural Machine Translation: a
   case study
SO LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
AB Comparable corpora can benefit the development of Neural Machine Translation models, in particular for under-resourced languages. We present a case study centred on the exploitation of a large comparable corpus for Basque-Spanish, created from independently-produced news by the Basque public broadcaster eitb, where we evaluate the impact of different techniques to exploit the original data, in order to complement parallel datasets for this language pair in both translation directions. Two efficient methods for parallel sentence mining are explored, which identified a common core of approximately half of the total number of aligned sentences, each one uniquely identifying valid parallel sentences not captured by the other method. Filtering the data via identification of length-difference outliers proved highly effective to improve the models, as was the use of tags to discriminate between comparable and parallel data in the training corpora. The use of backtranslated data is also evaluated in this work, with results indicating that alignment-based datasets remain the most beneficial, although complementary backtranslations should also be included to fully exploit the available comparable data. Overall, the results in this work demonstrate that this type of data needs to be carefully analysed prior to its use as training data for Neural Machine Translation, since issues such as information imbalance between source and target data can lead to unoptimal results for a given translation pair.

AB Corpora curated by experts have sustained Natural Language Processing mainly in English, but the expensiveness of corpora creation is a barrier for the development in further languages. Thus, we propose a corpus generation strategy that only requires a machine translation system between English and the target language in both directions, where we filter the best translations by computing automatic translation metrics and the task performance score. By studying Reading Comprehension in Spanish and Word Sense Disambiguation in Portuguese, we identified that a more quality-oriented metric has high potential in the corpora selection without degrading the task performance. We conclude that it is possible to systematise the building of quality corpora using machine translation and automatic metrics, besides some prior effort to clean and process the data.

AB This paper introduces a method which aims at translating Chinese terms into English. Our motivation is providing deep semantic-level information for term translation through analyzing the semantic structure of terms. Using the contextual information in the term and the first sememe of each word in How Net as features, we trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to identify the dependencies among words in a term. Then a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model is trained to mark semantic relations for term dependencies. During translation, the semantic relations within the Chinese terms are identified and three features based on semantic structure are integrated into the phrase-based statistical machine translation system. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves 1.58 BLEU points improvement in comparison with the baseline system.

For all tasks, the final submitted system is based on the Transformer architecture. We focus on improving data filtering and fine-tuning as well as systematically evaluating interesting approaches like unigram language model segmentation and transfer learning. For the De -> En task, none of the tested methods gave a significant improvement over last years winning system and we end up with the same performance, resulting in 39.6% BLEU on newstest2019. In the Zh -> En task, we show 1.3% BLEU improvement over our last year's submission, which we mostly attribute to the splitting of long sentences during translation. We further report results on the Kk -> En task where we gain improvements of 11.1% BLEU over our baseline system. On the same task we present a recent transfer learning approach, which uses half of the free parameters of our submission system and performs on par with it.

AB Modern unsupervised machine translation (MT) systems reach reasonable translation quality under clean and controlled data conditions. As the performance gap between supervised and unsupervised MT narrows, it is interesting to ask whether the different training methods result in systematically different output beyond what is visible via quality metrics like adequacy or BLEU. We compare translations from supervised and unsupervised MT systems of similar quality, finding that unsupervised output is more fluent and more structurally different in comparison to human translation than is supervised MT. We then demonstrate a way to combine the benefits of both methods into a single system which results in improved adequacy and fluency as rated by human evaluators. Our results open the door to interesting discussions about how supervised and unsupervised MT might be different yet mutually-beneficial.

AB The boom in audio-visual content such as movies and TV shows has meant that to increase global accessibility, this content needs to be localised into the target audience's language. Neural Machine Translation (NMT) presents a solution to address this at scale. Despite current NMT models having success on general-purpose text, they fail to generalise to the language nuances of media subtitles, primarily because of training data bias. In this work, we propose PEMS - Portuguese Engine for Machine Subtitling, a custom NMT model for English (en) to Portuguese (pt-pt) translation of TV show and movie subtitles. We conducted a thorough evaluation based on automatic metrics and human evaluation. The PEMS model demonstrates superior performance based on automatic evaluation metrics compared to other state of the art (SOTA) models, both open-source and cloud-based. Human evaluation by two professional translators indicated significant performance gains of post-editing machine translation compared to translating from scratch. Overall the productivity increase for PEMS, compared to translation from scratch, was 40% and 33% for each of the two translators, respectively. In addition, PEMS had fewer edits and higher adequacy and fluency scores compared to other models. The ablation study highlights sources of performance that could be applied to improve NMT in general. Specifically, the results demonstrate the importance of adapting NMT systems to the domain of interest (i.e. media). Most importantly, this work highlights the performance benefits of using NMT models such as PEMS to improving subtitling of content and, ultimately, to increase the proliferation and accessibility of media content, both on the African content and for Portuguese speakers.

AB This paper presents a method for creating interlingual word-to-word or phrase-to-phrase mappings between any two languages using the self-organizing map algorithm. The method can be used as a component in a stastistical machine translation system. The conceptual space created by the self-organizing map serves as a kind of interlingual representation. The specific problems of machine translation are discussed in some detail. The proposed method serves in alleviating two problems. The main problem addressed here is the fact that different languages divide the conceptual space differently. The approach can also help in dealing with lexical ambignity.

AB In SMT system, reordering problem is one of the most important and difficult problems to solve. The problem becomes definitely serious due to the different grammatical pattern between source and target language. The previous research about reordering model in SMT use the distortion-based reordering approach. However, this approach is not suitable for Indonesian-Korean translation. The main reason is because the word order between Indonesian and Korean are mostly reversed. Therefore, in this study, we develop a source-side reordering rules by using POS tag and word alignment information. This technique is promising to solve the reordering problem based on the experimental result. By applying 130 reordering rules in ID KR and 50 reordering rules for KR-ID translation, the quality of translation in term of BLEU score increases 1.25% for ID-KR translation and 0.83% for KR-ID translation. Besides, combining this reordering rules with Korean verb formation rules for ID-KR translation can increase the BLEU score from 38.07 to 49.46 (in 50 simple sentences evaluation).

AB Machine translation for low-resource languages, such as Guarani, is a challenging task due to the lack of data. One way of tackling it is using pretrained word embeddings for model initialization. In this work we try to check if currently available data is enough to train rich embeddings for enhancing MT for Guarani and Spanish, by building a set of word embedding collections and training MT systems using them. We found that the trained vectors are strong enough to slightly improve the performance of some of the translation models and also to speed up the training convergence.

AB An intersemiotic legal translation involves at least two different semiotic codes, of which at least one is not verbal. The authors will draw a distinction between two macro dimensions of legal translation in digital environments. The first can be schematized in one direction from the machine to the user. Intersemiotic translation is applied in the creation of interfaces (creation of buttons, forms, digital procedures) that are conditions of possibility for the fulfillment of certain legal acts (the acceptance of a user agreement, the purchase of a material or digital asset, the request for a particular document to the PA). The second dimension can be schematized in a direction that goes from the user to the machine. In this case, the user plays the role of the translator since he transposes, through the frontend, his contractual intent from natural language to machine language, using tools available to him by the developer. For example, a team of developers can exploit a Content Management Systems (CMS), which exposes two main interfaces, namely those that connect those who develop the interfaces and those who use them. Respectively, a backend that allows configuring the operating environment (user to machine) and, a frontend that exposes the communication interfaces with the end user (machine to user).

AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) generates target words sequentially in the way of predicting the next word conditioned on the context words. At training time, it predicts with the ground truth words as context while at inference it has to generate the entire sequence from scratch. This discrepancy of the fed context leads to error accumulation among the translation. Furthermore, word-level training requires strict matching between the generated sequence and the ground truth sequence which leads to overcorrection over different but reasonable translations. In this paper, we address these issues by sampling context words not only from the ground truth sequence but also from the predicted sequence during training(1). Experimental results on NIST Chinese!English and WMT2014 English -> German translation tasks demonstrate that our method can achieve significant improvements on multiple data sets compared to strong baselines.

AB The problem of machine translation can be viewed as consisting of two subproblems (a) Lexical Selection and (b) Lexical Reordering. We propose stochastic finite-state models for these two subproblems in this paper. Stochastic finite-state models are efficiently learnable from data, effective for decoding and are associated with a calculus for composing models which allows for tight integration of constraints from various levels of language processing. We present a method for learning stochastic finite-state models for lexical choice and lexical reordering that are trained automatically from pairs of source and tar-et utterances. We use this method to develop models for English-Japanese translation and present the performance of these models for translation on speech and text. We also evaluate the efficacy of such a translation model in the context of a call routing task of unconstrained speech utterances.

AB It is well known that Machine Translation (MT) has not approached the quality of human translations. It has also been noted that MT research has largely ignored the work of professionals and researchers in the field of translation, and that MT might benefit from collaboration with this field, in this paper, I look at a specialized type of translation, Simultaneous Interpretation (SI), in the light of possible applications to MT. I survey the research and practice of SI, and note that explanatory analyses of SI do not yet exist. However, descriptive analyses do, arrived at through anecdotal, empirical, and model-based methods. These descriptive analyses include "techniques" humans use for interpreting, and I suggest possible ways MT might use these techniques. I conclude by noting further questions which must be answered before we can fully understand SI, and how it might help MT.

TI Deep Transformer modeling via grouping skip connection for neural
   machine translation
SO KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS
AB Most of the deep neural machine translation (NMT) models are based on a bottom-up feedforward fashion, in which representations in low layers construct or modulate high layers representations. We conjecture that this unidirectional encoding fashion could be a potential issue in building a deep NMT model. In this paper, we propose to build a deeper Transformer encoder by properly organizing encoder layers into multiple groups, which are connected via a grouping skip connection mechanism. Here, each group is further appropriately fed into subsequent groups to build a deep Transformer encoder. In this way, we successfully build a deep Transformer encoder with up to 48 layers. Moreover, we can share the parameters among groups to extend the encoder (virtual) depth even without introducing additional parameters. Detailed experimentation on the large-scale WMT (workshop on machine translation) 2014 English-to-German, English-to-French translation, WMT 2016 English-to German, and WMT 2017 Chinese-to-English tasks demonstrates that our proposed deep Transformer model significantly outperforms the strong Transformer baseline. Furthermore, we carry out linguistic probing tasks to analyze the problems existing in the original Transformer model and explain how our deep Transformer encoder improves the translation quality. One particularly nice property of our approach is that it is incredibly easy to implement. We make our code available on Github https://github.com/liyc7711/deep-nmt. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper describes a machine translation test set of documents from the auditing domain and its use as one of the "test suites" in the WMT19 News Translation Task for translation directions involving Czech, English and German.
   Our evaluation suggests that current MT systems optimized for the general news domain can perform quite well even in the particular domain of audit reports. The detailed manual evaluation however indicates that deep factual knowledge of the domain is necessary. For the naked eye of a non-expert, translations by many systems seem almost perfect and automatic MT evaluation with one reference is practically useless for considering these details.
   Furthermore, we show on a sample document from the domain of agreements that even the best systems completely fail in preserving the semantics of the agreement, namely the identity of the parties.

TI A preordering model based on phrasal dependency tree
SO DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP IN THE HUMANITIES
AB Intelligent machine translation (MT) is becoming an important field of research and development as the need for translations grows. Currently, the word reordering problem is one of the most important issues of MT systems. To tackle this problem, we present a source-side reordering method using phrasal dependency trees, which depict dependency relations between contiguous non-syntactic phrases. Reordering elements are automatically learned from a reordered phrasal dependency tree bank and are utilized to produce a source reordering lattice. The lattice finally is decoded by a monotone phrase-based SMT to translate a source sentence. The approach is evaluated on syntactically divergent language pairs, i.e. English -> Persian and English -> German, using the workshop of machine translation 2007 (WMT07) benchmark. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of translation quality for both translation tasks.

TI AmericasNLI: Machine translation and natural language inference systems
   for Indigenous languages of the Americas
SO FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Little attention has been paid to the development of human language technology for truly low-resource languages-i.e., languages with limited amounts of digitally available text data, such as Indigenous languages. However, it has been shown that pretrained multilingual models are able to perform crosslingual transfer in a zero-shot setting even for low-resource languages which are unseen during pretraining. Yet, prior work evaluating performance on unseen languages has largely been limited to shallow token-level tasks. It remains unclear if zero-shot learning of deeper semantic tasks is possible for unseen languages. To explore this question, we present AmericasNLI, a natural language inference dataset covering 10 Indigenous languages of the Americas. We conduct experiments with pretrained models, exploring zero-shot learning in combination with model adaptation. Furthermore, as AmericasNLI is a multiway parallel dataset, we use it to benchmark the performance of different machine translation models for those languages. Finally, using a standard transformer model, we explore translation-based approaches for natural language inference. We find that the zero-shot performance of pretrained models without adaptation is poor for all languages in AmericasNLI, but model adaptation via continued pretraining results in improvements. All machine translation models are rather weak, but, surprisingly, translation-based approaches to natural language inference outperform all other models on that task.

AB A number of web applications provide completely automated machine translation services, allowing users to easily translate information of interest. However, these services still generate inaccurate results when translating technical terminologies. Therefore, we propose a new method that collects reliable pairs of English-Korean technical terms and translates the given English terminology to Korean. To collect the pairs, we utilize textual big data, such as Korean academic papers, and develop a new statistical model to determine appropriate characteristics. Our method is evaluated in terms of the reliability of English-Korean pairs and the precision of translation. We thus confirm that our method can produce highly reliable data and can positively influence the translation quality of technical terminologies. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This method benefits from the English Sentiwordnet and a thesaurus in one of the target languages. Sentiment information from the English resource is mapped to the target languages by using machine translation and similarity measures based on sentence embeddings. A number of experiments with Scandinavian languages are performed in order to determine the best working sentence embedding algorithm for this task. A careful extrinsic evaluation on several datasets yields state-of-the-art results using a simple rule-based sentiment analysis algorithm.

AB We focused on when and how to reorder the complicated Chinese NPs with two, three, four or five semantic-units and the semantic units were smallest chunks for reordering in Chinese-English Machine Translation. By analyzing clear parallels and striking distinctions between complicated Chinese NPs and their English, we built 17 formalized rules to identify the boundaries of semantic units with the Boundary-Words deduced from semantic features to recognized what to reorder and developed a strategy on how to reorder the internal ordering of complicated Chinese NPs when translated into English. At last, we used a rule-based MT system to test our work, and the experimental results showed that our strategy and rule-based method were very efficient.

AB In this paper, a shallow syntactic parser which based oil extended Context Free Grammar (CFG) and Generalized LR (GLR) algorithm is presented. In developing our Delta latLink English-Chinese machine translation system, we extended CFG to describe the syntactic structure of chunks and designed a corresponding parsing algorithm based on GLR algorithm to implement shallow syntactic parsing. The parser Call automatically recognize the boundaries of chunks and produce their syntactic parsing trees. Results of contrastive experiments show that the shallow syntactic parser is much more efficient in translation correct rate.

TI Bridging the "gApp": improving neural machine translation systems for
   multiword expression detection
SO YEARBOOK OF PHRASEOLOGY
AB The present research introduces the tool gApp, a Python-based text preprocessing system for the automatic identification and conversion of discontinuous multiword expressions (MWEs) into their continuous form in order to enhance neural machine translation (NMT). To this end, an experiment with semi-fixed Verb-Noun Constructions (VNC) will be carried out in order to evaluate to what extent gApp can optimise the performance of the two main free open-source NMT systems-Google Translate and DeepL-under the challenge of MWE discontinuity in the Spanish into English directionality. In the light of our promising results, the study concludes with suggestions on how to further optimise MWE-aware NMT systems.

TI A user study of neural interactive translation prediction
SO MACHINE TRANSLATION
AB Machine translation (MT) on its own is generally not good enough to produce high-quality translations, so it is common to have humans intervening in the translation process to improve MT output. A typical intervention is post-editing (PE), where a human translator corrects errors in the MT output. Another is interactive translation prediction (ITP), which involves an MT system presenting a translator with translation suggestions they can accept or reject, actions the MT system then uses to present them with new, corrected suggestions. Both Macklovitch (2006) and Koehn (2009) found ITP to be an efficient alternative to unassisted translation in terms of processing time. So far, phrase-based statistical ITP has not yet proven to be faster than PE (Koehn 2009; Sanchis-Trilles etal. 2014; Underwood etal. 2014; Green etal. 2014; Alves etal. 2016; Alabau etal. 2016). In this paper we present the results of an empirical study on translation productivity in ITP with an underlying neural MT system (NITP). Our results show that over half of the professional translators in our study translated faster with NITP compared to PE, and most preferred it over PE. We also examine differences between PE and ITP in other translation productivity indicators and translators' reactions to the technology.

TI The ribosomal protein Asc1/RACK1 is required for efficient translation
   of short mRNAs
SO ELIFE
AB Translation is a core cellular process carried out by a highly conserved macromolecular machine, the ribosome. There has been remarkable evolutionary adaptation of this machine through the addition of eukaryote-specific ribosomal proteins whose individual effects on ribosome function are largely unknown. Here we show that eukaryote-specific Asc1/RACK1 is required for efficient translation of mRNAs with short open reading frames that show greater than average translational efficiency in diverse eukaryotes. ASC1 mutants in S. cerevisiae display compromised translation of specific functional groups, including cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, and display cellular phenotypes consistent with their gene-specific translation defects. Asc1-sensitive mRNAs are preferentially associated with the translational 'closed loop' complex comprised of eIF4E, eIF4G, and Pab1, and depletion of eIF4G mimics the translational defects of ASC1 mutants. Together our results reveal a role for Asc1/RACK1 in a length-dependent initiation mechanism optimized for efficient translation of genes with important housekeeping functions.

AB The problem of machine translation can be viewed as consisting of two subproblems (a) Lexical Selection and (b) Lexical Reordering. We propose stochastic finite-state models for these two subproblems in this paper. Stochastic finite-state models are efficiently learnable from data, effective for decoding and are associated with a calculus for composing models which allows for tight integration of constraints from various levels of language processing. We present a method for learning stochastic finite-state models for lexical choice and lexical reordering that are trained automatically from pairs of source and target utterances. We use this method to develop models for English-Japanese translation and present the performance of these models for translation on speech and text. We also evaluate the efficacy of such a translation model in the context of a call routing task of unconstrained speech utterances.

SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & POLITICS
AB This paper proves that automatic translation of multilingual newspaper documents deters neither human nor computer classification of political concepts. We show how theory-driven coding of newspaper text can be automated in several languages by monolingual researchers. Supervised machine learning is successfully applied to text in English from British, Spanish, and German sources. The paper has three main findings. First, results from human coding directly in a foreign language do not differ from coding computer-translated text. Second, humans can code translated text as well as they can code untranslated prose in their mother tongue. Third, machine learning based on translated Spanish and German training sets can reproduce human coding as accurately as a system learning from English training sets.

AB Treebank is an important resource for Natural Language Processing. Most existing treebanks are monolingual, but bilingual treebanks are the important basis of syntactical model in machine translation. In this paper, a bilingual phrase structure Treebank aimed for the application of machine translation was preliminarily constructed, which chose POS tagset and syntactic tagset of U-Penn English Treebank and Chinese Treebank as its tagging system. Chinese- English sentence pairs which were drawn from machine translation evaluation data in the treebank were pre-processed, with POS tagged, phrase structure annotated, and all processed data were proofread. Through the analysis of phrase structures which were modified in the proofreading process, it was found that Chinese functional words usages play an important role in Chinese phrase structure grammar.

AB This paper addresses the need to generate functionally large geometries/objects for layered manufacturing machines. Novelty is found in the translation from an initial shape in CAD to subdivision as interlocking objects that are further subdivided into slicing layers using traditional layered manufacturing software. Translation from an initial shape to individual component geometry is guided by shape rules as a set grammar that generate a 2D drawing of interlocking shapes. Mechanical rules further shape the 3D geometry of each object, resulting in a virtual model that complies with measures of structural stability, assembly, and machine manufacturing. Three models are constructed to illustrate the translation process from the virtual shape to a manufactured artifact. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Neural machine translation has been widely concerned in recent years. The traditional sequential neural network framework of English translation has obvious disadvantages because of its poor ability to capture long-distance information, and the current improved framework, such as the recurrent neural network, still cannot solve this problem very well. In this paper, we propose a hybrid neural network that combines the convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) and introduce the attention mechanism based on the encoder-decoder structure to improve the translation accuracy, especially for long sentences. In the experiment, this model is implemented based on TensorFlow, and the results show that the BLEU value of the proposed method is obviously improved compared with the traditional machine learning model, which proves the effectiveness of our method in English-Chinese translation.

AB We present a document-level neural machine translation model which takes both source and target document context into account using memory networks. We model the problem as a structured prediction problem with interdependencies among the observed and hidden variables, i.e., the source sentences and their unobserved target translations in the document. The resulting structured prediction problem is tackled with a neural translation model equipped with two memory components, one each for the source and target side, to capture the documental interdependencies. We train the model end-to-end, and propose an iterative decoding algorithm based on block coordinate descent. Experimental results of English translations from French, German, and Estonian documents show that our model is effective in exploiting both source and target document context, and statistically significantly outperforms the previous work in terms of BLEU and METEOR.

AB State-of-the-art phrase-based machine translation (MT) systems usually demand large parallel corpora in the step of training. The quality and the quantity of the training data exert a direct influence on the performance of such translation systems. The lack of open-source bilingual corpora for a particular language pair results in lower translation scores reported for such a language pair. This is the case of Chinese-Japanese. In this paper, we propose to build an extension of an initial parallel corpus in the form of quasi-parallel sentences, instead of adding new parallel sentences. The extension of the initial corpus is obtained by using monolingual analogical associations. Our experiments show that the use of such quasi-parallel corpora improves the performance of Chinese-Japanese translation systems.

AB Most neural machine translation (NMT) models are based on the sequential encoder-decoder framework, which makes no use of syntactic information. In this paper, we improve this model by explicitly incorporating source-side syntactic trees. More specifically, we propose (1) a bidirectional tree encoder which learns both sequential and tree structured representations; (2) a tree-coverage model that lets the attention depend on the source-side syntax. Experiments on Chinese-English translation demonstrate that our proposed models outperform the sequential attentional model as well as a stronger baseline with a bottom-up tree encoder and word coverage.(1)

Translation of one sign language to another is a difficult problem that need efficient solution. Processing of signs is different from the processing of words in natural languages. Sign languages use shapes and movements to express meaning. The objective of our research project is to develop a multi-lingual machine translation system for sign languages. As a first step towards achieving this objective we analyzed three sign languages. This paper outlines the current research results.

AB We attempt automatic text simplification with vocabulary restriction on the output side using a machine translation approach based on a simplified corpus that we built. This is the first machine translation approach in Japanese because no Japanese simplification corpus has been created to date. This corpus focuses only on paraphrases of sentence units and phrase units. It is the first time that this type of simplification has been used with such a corpus. This approach makes it possible to simplify better than existing systems do. We also compared models that changed the quantity and quality of the training data and development data. The result shows that data having a medium S-BLEU score between the original sentence and a simple sentence is most effective for automatic text simplification by a machine translation approach.

AB We implemented a neural machine translation system that uses automatic sequence tagging to improve the quality of translation. Instead of operating on unannotated sentence pairs, our system uses pre-trained tagging systems to add linguistic features to source and target sentences. Our proposed neural architecture learns a combined embedding of tokens and tags in the encoder, and simultaneous token and tag prediction in the decoder. Compared to a baseline with unannotated training, this architecture increased the BLEU score of German to English film subtitle translation outputs by 1.61 points using named entity tags; however, the BLEU score decreased by 0.38 points using part-of-speech tags. This demonstrates that certain token-level tag outputs from off-the-shelf tagging systems can improve the output of neural translation systems using our combined embedding and simultaneous decoding extensions.

AB Log-linear model based statistical machine translation systems (SMT) are usually composed of multiple feature functions. Each feature function is assigned a weight as a model parameter. In this paper, we consider that different input source sentences may have discrepant needs for model parameters. To adapt the model to different inputs, we propose a model parameters selection method for log-linear model based SMT systems. The method is mainly based on the characteristics of different feature functions themselves without any assumption on unseen test sets. Experimental results on two language pairs (Zh-En and Ug-Zh) show that our method leads to the improvements up to 2.4 and 2.2 BLEU score respectively, and it also shows the good interpretability of our proposed method.

In this work, the machine translation model is trained on a corpus of parallel Mandarin-Cantonese subtitles and used to translate a large set of Mandarin conversational telephone transcripts to Cantonese, which has limited resources. The translated transcripts are used to train a more robust language model for speech recognition and for keyword search in Cantonese conversational telephone speech. This method enables the keyword search system to detect 1.5 times more out-of-vocabulary words, and achieve 1.7% absolute improvement on actual term-weighted value.

AB Phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation (PBSMT) systems represent the dominant approach in MT today. However, unlike systems in other paradigms, it has proven difficult to date to incorporate syntactic knowledge in order to improve translation quality. This paper improves on recent research which uses 'syntactified' target language phrases, by incorporating supertags as constraints to better resolve parse tree fragments. In addition, we do not impose any sentence-length limit, and using a log-linear decoder, we outperform a state-of-the-art PBSMT system by over 1.3 BLEU points (or 15 1 % relative) on the NIST 2003 Arabic-English test corpus.

TI Modeling workflow to design machine translation applications for public
   health practice
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS
AB Objective: Provide a detailed understanding of the information workflow processes related to translating health promotion materials for limited English proficiency individuals in order to inform the design of context-driven machine translation (MT) tools for public health (PH).
   Materials and methods: We applied a cognitive work analysis framework to investigate the translation information workflow processes of two large health departments in Washington State. Researchers conducted interviews, performed a task analysis, and validated results with PH professionals to model translation workflow and identify functional requirements for a translation system for PH.
   Results: The study resulted in a detailed description of work related to translation of PH materials, an information workflow diagram, and a description of attitudes towards MT technology. We identified a number of themes that hold design implications for incorporating MT in PH translation practice. A PH translation tool prototype was designed based on these findings.
   Discussion: This study underscores the importance of understanding the work context and information workflow for which systems will be designed. Based on themes and translation information workflow processes, we identified key design guidelines for incorporating MT into PH translation work. Primary amongst these is that MT should be followed by human review for translations to be of high quality and for the technology to be adopted into practice.
   Conclusion: The time and costs of creating multilingual health promotion materials are barriers to translation. PH personnel were interested in MT's potential to improve access to low-cost translated PH materials, but expressed concerns about ensuring quality. We outline design considerations and a potential machine translation tool to best fit MT systems into PH practice. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Recent studies have proven that the training of neural machine translation (NMT) can be facilitated by mimicking the learning process of humans. Nevertheless, achievements of such kind of curriculum learning rely on the quality of artificial schedule drawn up with the handcrafted features, e.g. sentence length or word rarity. We ameliorate this procedure with a more flexible manner by proposing self-paced learning, where NMT model is allowed to 1) automatically quantify the learning confidence over training examples; and 2) flexibly govern its learning via regulating the loss in each iteration step. Experimental results over multiple translation tasks demonstrate that the proposed model yields better performance than strong baselines and those models trained with human-designed curricula on both translation quality and convergence speed.(1)

TI Fuzzy-Match Repair Guided by Quality Estimation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Computer-aided translation tools based on translation memories are widely used to assist professional translators. A translation memory (TM) consists of a set of translation units (TU) made up of source- and target-language segment pairs. For the translation of a new source segment s', these tools search the TM and retrieve the TUs (s, t) whose source segments are more similar to s'. The translator then chooses a TU and edit the target segment t to turn it into an adequate translation of s'. Fuzzy-match repair (FMR) techniques can be used to automatically modify the parts oft that need to be edited. We describe a language-independent FMR method that first uses machine translation to generate, given s' and (s, t), a set of candidate fuzzy-match repaired segments, and then chooses the best one by estimating their quality. An evaluation on three different language pairs shows that the selected candidate is a good approximation to the best (oracle) candidate produced and is closer to reference translations than machine-translated segments and unrepaired fuzzy matches (t). In addition, a single quality estimation model trained on a mix of data from all the languages performs well on any of the languages used.

TI The Origin of Prebiotic Information System in the Peptide/RNA World: A
   Simulation Model of the Evolution of Translation and the Genetic Code
SO LIFE-BASEL
AB Information is the currency of life, but the origin of prebiotic information remains a mystery. We propose transitional pathways from the cosmic building blocks of life to the complex prebiotic organic chemistry that led to the origin of information systems. The prebiotic information system, specifically the genetic code, is segregated, linear, and digital, and it appeared before the emergence of DNA. In the peptide/RNA world, lipid membranes randomly encapsulated amino acids, RNA, and peptide molecules, which are drawn from the prebiotic soup, to initiate a molecular symbiosis inside the protocells. This endosymbiosis led to the hierarchical emergence of several requisite components of the translation machine: transfer RNAs (tRNAs), aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS), messenger RNAs (mRNAs), ribosomes, and various enzymes. When assembled in the right order, the translation machine created proteins, a process that transferred information from mRNAs to assemble amino acids into polypeptide chains. This was the beginning of the prebiotic information age. The origin of the genetic code is enigmatic; herein, we propose an evolutionary explanation: the demand for a wide range of protein enzymes over peptides in the prebiotic reactions was the main selective pressure for the origin of information-directed protein synthesis. The molecular basis of the genetic code manifests itself in the interaction of aaRS and their cognate tRNAs. In the beginning, aminoacylated ribozymes used amino acids as a cofactor with the help of bridge peptides as a process for selection between amino acids and their cognate codons/anticodons. This process selects amino acids and RNA species for the next steps. The ribozymes would give rise to pre-tRNA and the bridge peptides to pre-aaRS. Later, variants would appear and evolution would produce different but specific aaRS-tRNA-amino acid combinations. Pre-tRNA designed and built pre-mRNA for the storage of information regarding its cognate amino acid. Each pre-mRNA strand became the storage device for the genetic information that encoded the amino acid sequences in triplet nucleotides. As information appeared in the digital languages of the codon within pre-mRNA and mRNA, and the genetic code for protein synthesis evolved, the prebiotic chemistry then became more organized and directional with the emergence of the translation and genetic code. The genetic code developed in three stages that are coincident with the refinement of the translation machines: the GNC code that was developed by the pre-tRNA/pre-aaRS /pre-mRNA machine, SNS code by the tRNA/aaRS/mRNA machine, and finally the universal genetic code by the tRNA/aaRS/mRNA/ribosome machine. We suggest the coevolution of translation machines and the genetic code. The emergence of the translation machines was the beginning of the Darwinian evolution, an interplay between information and its supporting structure. Our hypothesis provides the logical and incremental steps for the origin of the programmed protein synthesis. In order to better understand the prebiotic information system, we converted letter codons into numerical codons in the Universal Genetic Code Table. We have developed a software, called CATI (Codon-Amino Acid-Translator-Imitator), to translate randomly chosen numerical codons into corresponding amino acids and vice versa. This conversion has granted us insight into how the genetic code might have evolved in the peptide/RNA world.
   There is great potential in the application of numerical codons to bioinformatics, such as barcoding, DNA mining, or DNA fingerprinting.
   We constructed the likely biochemical pathways for the origin of translation and the genetic code using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) software framework, and the translation machinery step-by-step. While using AnyLogic software, we were able to simulate and visualize the entire evolution of the translation machines, amino acids, and the genetic code.

TI WCC-JC: A Web-Crawled Corpus for Japanese-Chinese Neural Machine
   Translation
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Featured Application This research crawled a bilingual Japanese-Chinese corpus of a certain size through websites. As a necessary resource for Japanese-Chinese neural machine translation (NMT), it is beneficial for researchers to promote the progress of Japanese-Chinese language-related natural language processing research. Specifically, topics include comparative analysis of grammar, comparative studies of Chinese and Japanese languages, compilation of dictionaries, etc. This will have great significance and contribution to the cultural exchange and industrial cooperation between China and Japan. It also has important theoretical significance and application value to the industrialization of Japanese-Chinese machine translation. In addition, the application of this research will be of great significance in strengthening civil communication and enhancing mutual understanding between China and Japan, as the current Chinese and Japanese relations are not well perceived by the citizens of both countries. We hope that the construction and pathways of the Japanese-Chinese bilingual corpus in this research will help to solve the problem of language barriers in Japanese-Chinese people-to-people communication and mutual understanding. We offer the WCC-JC as a free download under the premise that it is intended for research purposes only. Currently, there are only a limited number of Japanese-Chinese bilingual corpora of a sufficient amount that can be used as training data for neural machine translation (NMT). In particular, there are few corpora that include spoken language such as daily conversation. In this research, we attempt to construct a Japanese-Chinese bilingual corpus of a certain scale by crawling the subtitle data of movies and TV series from the websites. We calculated the BLEU scores of the constructed WCC-JC (Web Crawled Corpus-Japanese and Chinese) and the other compared corpora. We also manually evaluated the translation results using the translation model trained on the WCC-JC to confirm the quality and effectiveness.

AB The growing pace of information technology demands fast operation for communication and other related applications. After having a successful Machine Translation System [MTS], it has been felt to optimize the performance of Machine Translation for its real-time uses. The considered MTS is Tree Adjoining Grammar [TAG] based system. An approach has been experimented to use File model instead of Database model for fast streaming of grammar into memory and operation. This model provides an efficient and a systematic way of encapsulating language resource with engineering solution to develop the speedy MTS. The computational experiments demonstrate that substantial performance in terms of time and memory has been obtained by using this approach.

We examine their reliability and we determine the metrics which show decreasing reliability of the automatic evaluation of MT output. Besides the traditional measures (Cronbach's alpha and standardized alpha) we use entropy for assessing the reliability of the automatic metrics of MT output. The results were obtained on a dataset covering translation from a low resource language (SK) into English (EN). The main contribution consists of the identification of the redundant automatic MT evaluation metrics.

AB The challenge with language portability of a spoken language understanding module is to be able to reuse the knowledge and the data available in a source language to produce knowledge in the target language.
   In this paper several approaches are proposed, motivated by the availability of the MEDIA French dialogue corpus and its manual translation into Italian.
   The three portability methods investigated are based on statistical machine translation or automatic word alignment techniques and differ in the level of the system development at which the translation is performed.
   The first experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed portability methods in general for a fast and low-cost SLU porting from French to Italian and the best performance are obtained by using translation only at the test level.

AB This article innovatively addresses machine translation from Chinese to Catalan using neural pivot strategies trained without any direct parallel data. The Catalan language is very similar to Spanish from a linguistic point of view, which motivates the use of Spanish as pivot language. Regarding neural architecture, we are using the latest state-of-the-art, which is the Transformer model, only based on attention mechanisms. Additionally, this work provides new resources to the community, which consists of a human-developed gold standard of 4,000 sentences between Catalan and Chinese and all the others United Nations official languages (Arabic, English, French, Russian, and Spanish). Results show that the standard pseudo-corpus or synthetic pivot approach performs better than cascade.

The corpus is constructed as part of the SYSNET3LOc project. It currently contains about 70,000 French-Wolof parallel sentences drawn on various sources from different domains. The paper discusses the data collection procedure, conversion, and alignment of the corpus as well as it's application as training data for neural machine translation. In fact, using this corpus, we were able to create word embedding models for Wolof with relatively good results. Currently, the corpus is being used to develop a neural machine translation model to translate French sentences into Wolof.

AB A machine translation is developed to preserve the existence of Javanese speech levels. The machine translation relies on a phrase-based bi-text alignment to form the language corpora. The edit shifting distance is applied to increase the alignment efficiency. However, improper alignment contributed by recorded impossible pair and insufficient data training is still detected. This paper proposes a new improvement of the developed alignment algorithm based on the impossible pair restriction. The paper compares three situations: the fundamental approach (AL1), the basic algorithm with extended data training (AL2) and improved algorithm with standard data training (AL3). Based on experimental results, AL3 (A=90.5%) is remarkably accurate than AL1 (A=79.6%) and AL2 (A=85.9).

AB In light of the recent breakthroughs in automatic machine translation systems, we propose a novel approach that we term as "Face-to-Face Translation". As today's digital communication becomes increasingly visual, we argue that there is a need for systems that can automatically translate a video of a person speaking in language A into a target language B with realistic lip synchronization. In this work, we create an automatic pipeline for this problem and demonstrate its impact in multiple real-world applications. First, we build a working speech-to-speech translation system by bringing together multiple existing modules from speech and language. We then move towards "Face-to-Face Translation" by incorporating a novel visual module, LipGAN for generating realistic talking faces from the translated audio. Quantitative evaluation of LipGAN on the standard LRW test set shows that it significantly outperforms existing approaches across all standard metrics. We also subject our Face-to-Face Translation pipeline, to multiple human evaluations and show that it can significantly improve the overall user experience for consuming and interacting with multimodal content across languages. Code, models and demo video are made publicly available.

AB Since machine learning models have become a valuable asset for companies, watermarking techniques have been developed to protect the intellectual property of these models and prevent model theft. We observe that current watermarking frameworks solely target image classification tasks, neglecting a considerable part of machine learning techniques. In this paper, we propose to address this lack and study the watermarking process of various machine learning techniques such as machine translation, regression, binary image classification and reinforcement learning models. We adapt current definitions to each specific technique and we evaluate the main characteristics of the watermarking process, in particular the robustness of the models against a rational adversary. We show that watermarking models beyond classification is possible while preserving their overall performance. We further investigate various attacks and discuss the importance of the performance metric in the verification process and its impact on the success of the adversary.

TI Transfer-based Arabic to English Noun Sentence Translation Using Shallow
   Segmentation
SO INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB The quality of machine translation systems decreases considerably when dealing with long sentences. In this paper, a transfer-based system is developed for translating long Arabic noun sentences into English. A simple method used for dividing a long sentence into phrases based on conjunctions, prepositions, and quantifier particles. These particles divide a sentence into phrases. The phrases of a source sentence are translated individually. In the end of translation process, target sentence is constructed by connecting the translated phrases. The system was tested on 100 thesis long titles from the management and economy domain. The results show that the method is very efficient with most of the tested sentences.

AB Although end-to-end neural machine translation (NMT) has achieved remarkable progress in the recent years, the idea of adopting multipass decoding mechanism into conventional NMT is not well explored. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture called adaptive multi-pass decoder, which introduces a flexible multi-pass polishing mechanism to extend the capacity of NMT via reinforcement learning. More specifically, we adopt an extra policy network to automatically choose a suitable and effective number of decoding passes, according to the complexity of source sentences and the quality of the generated translations. Extensive experiments on ChineseEnglish translation demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed adaptive multi-pass decoder upon the conventional NMT with a significant improvement about 1.55 BLEU.

AB In the machine translation (MT) system, how to evaluate the sentence fluency of the translation results is an important research topic. Most of the current methods are based on the similarity of output words compared with the reference translations, which don't specially address the evaluation of the sentence fluency according to the syntactic structure. This paper proposes a statistical approach to the problem, which is based on the n-gram language model and reference-independent. Our approach is a beneficial compensation to the reference-dependent methods and has better robustness than those methods based on the syntactic analysis. The preliminary experimental results indicate that the approach basically reflects the reality of human's judgment.

TI Sites of translation in digital reporting
SO ACCOUNTING AUDITING & ACCOUNTABILITY JOURNAL
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyse the process by which analogue corporate reports produced under a paper paradigm are translated into a machine language as required by digital reporting. The paper uses Austin and Searle's linguistic speech act theory to examine how digitally translating reporting information into atomised data affects the infrastructure and practice of accounting.
   Design/methodology/approach Extensive interview and observation evidence focussed on the IFRS Foundation's digital reporting project is analysed. An interpretive approach is informed by the concepts of L compatibility, illocution and perlocutionary acts which are drawn from speech act theory.
   Findings Two key sites of translation are identified. The first site concerns the translation of accounting standards, principles and practices into taxonomies for digital tagging. Controversies arise over the definition of accounting concepts in a site populated by accounting and IT-orientated experts. The second site of translation is in the routine production and dissemination of digital reports which impacts the L compatibility between preparers and users.
   Originality/value The paper highlights a previously unexplored field of translation in accounting and contributes a unique perspective that demonstrates that machine translation is no longer marginalised but is the primary text with effects on the infrastructure and practice of accounting. It extends speech act theory by applying it to the digital domain and in the context of translation between languages.

AB We present research towards bridging the language gap between migrant workers in Qatar and medical staff. In particular, we present the first steps towards the development of a real-world Hindi-English machine translation system for doctor-patient communication. As this is a low-resource language pair, especially for speech and for the medical domain, our initial focus has been on gathering suitable training data from various sources. We applied a variety of methods ranging from fully automatic extraction from the Web to manual annotation of test data. Moreover, we developed a method for automatically augmenting the training data with synthetically generated variants, which yielded a very sizable improvement of more than 3 BLEU points absolute.

AB The translation divergence is the problem pertained with the Transfer and Interlingua Machine Translation (MT) because it requires a large combination of complex lexical and structural mappings. Divergence makes straight forward transfer from source language to target language impractical. The main aim of the divergence study is to know the source and target language pattern and morphophonemic changes upon translation of a sentence. This will enable the MT system to handle most of the anomalies coming out of divergence problem. For this we need a systematic mapping between the Interlingua representation and the surface syntactic structure that accommodates all of the divergences. In this paper we try to list out different types of divergence occurring among English and Malayalam.

AB This work investigates an alternative model for neural machine translation (NMT) and proposes a novel architecture, where we employ a multi-dimensional long short-term memory (MDLSTM) for translation modeling. In the state-of-the-art methods, source and target sentences are treated as one-dimensional sequences over time, while we view translation as a two-dimensional (2D) mapping using an MDLSTM layer to define the correspondence between source and target words. We extend beyond the current sequence to sequence backbone NMT models to a 2D structure in which the source and target sentences are aligned with each other in a 2D grid. Our proposed topology shows consistent improvements over attention-based sequence to sequence model on two WMT 2017 tasks, German <-> English.

AB Conventional interactive machine translation typically requires a human translator to validate every generated target word, even though most of them are correct in the advanced neural machine translation (NMT) scenario. Previous studies have exploited confidence approaches to address the intensive human involvement issue, which request human guidance only for a few number of words with low confidences. However, such approaches do not take the history of human involvement into account, and optimize the models only for the translation quality while ignoring the cost of human involvement. In response to these pitfalls, we propose a novel interactive NMT model, which explicitly accounts the history of human involvements and particularly is optimized towards two objectives corresponding to the translation quality and the cost of human involvement, respectively. Specifically, the model jointly predicts a target word and a decision on whether to request human guidance, which is based on both the partial translation and the history of human involvements. Since there is no explicit signals on the decisions of requesting human guidance in the bilingual corpus, we optimize the model with the reinforcement learning technique which enables our model to accurately predict when to request human guidance. Simulated and real experiments show that the proposed model can achieve higher translation quality with similar or less human involvement over the confidence-based baseline.

In the process of the English sentence comprehension, English semantic block, which played an important role, was analyzed in detail. On the basis of this, the core content and characteristics of English semantic block were discussed. And with the help of the corresponding processing algorithms, taking verbs and business English as the research object, three kinds of semantic models were summarized. A lexical chunk database model based on English characteristic semantic block processing was proposed. The open test results showed that the matching success rate of the model for the semantic pattern database was about 90%.

TI Data Categorization and Model Weighting Approach for Language Model
   Adaptation in Statistical Machine Translation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB Language model encapsulates semantic, syntactic and pragmatic information about specific task. Intelligent systems especially natural language processing systems can show different results in terms of performance and precision when moving among genres and domains. Therefore researchers have explored different language model adaptation strategies in order to overcome effectiveness issue. There are two main categories in language model adaptation techniques. The first category includes the techniques that based on the data selection where task-oriented corpus can be extracted and used to train and generate models for specific translations. While the second category focuses on developing a weighting criterion to assign the test data to specific model corpus. The purpose of this research is to introduce language model adaptation approach that combines both categories (data selection and weighting criterion) of language model adaptation. This approach applies data selection for specific-task translations by dividing the corpus into smaller and topic-related corpora using clustering process. We investigate the effect of different approaches for clustering the bilingual data on the language model adaptation process in terms of translation quality using the Europarl corpus WMT07 that includes bilingual data for English-Spanish, English-German and English-French. A mixture of language models should assign any given data to the right language model to be used in the translation process using a specific weighting criterion. The proposed language model adaptation has achieved better translation quality compare to the baseline model in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT).

AB One of the Chinese-English machine translation burning problems is how to convert the Chinese aspects to their English correspondents. Chinese progressive aspect marker "ZAI+verb" can have multiple English correspondents besides the English progressive aspect. This paper takes an empirical approach to this unresolved conversion, based on a bilingual parallel corpus. It identifies 10 English translation equivalents of "ZAI+verb", figures out the conversion rates between "ZAI+verb" and its English translation equivalents, and presents 14 conversion rules to define the matching relationships between them. The results implies that the precise degree of Chinese-English machine translation of "ZAI+verb" to progressive aspects in English can be expected to be up to 67%.

The tool, which now implements a new neural classifier, uses state-of-the-art techniques based on pre-trained transformer-based language models fine-tuned on a binary classification task. After that, parallel corpus filtering is performed, discarding the sentences that have lower probability of being mutual translations. Our experiments, based on the training of neural machine translation (NMT) with corpora filtered using Bicleaner AI for two different scenarios, show significant improvements in translation quality compared to the previous version of the tool which implemented a classifier based on Extremely Randomized Trees.

Similarity among source contexts is used to select appropriate translation units. The information is introduced as a novel feature of the phrase-based model and it is used to select the translation units extracted from the training sentence more similar to the sentence to translate. The similarity is computed through a deep autoencoder representation, which allows to obtain effective low-dimensional embedding of data and statistically significant BLEU score improvements on two different tasks (English-to-Spanish and English-to-Hindi).

TI Can machine translation systems be evaluated by the crowd alone
SO NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING
AB Crowd-sourced assessments of machine translation quality allow evaluations to be carried out cheaply and on a large scale. It is essential, however, that the crowd's work be filtered to avoid contamination of results through the inclusion of false assessments. One method is to filter via agreement with experts, but even amongst experts agreement levels may not be high. In this paper, we present a new methodology for crowd-sourcing human assessments of translation quality, which allows individual workers to develop their own individual assessment strategy. Agreement with experts is no longer required, and a worker is deemed reliable if they are consistent relative to their own previous work. Individual translations are assessed in isolation from all others in the form of direct estimates of translation quality. This allows more meaningful statistics to be computed for systems and enables significance to be determined on smaller sets of assessments. We demonstrate the methodology's feasibility in large-scale human evaluation through replication of the human evaluation component of Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation shared translation task for two language pairs, Spanish-to-English and English-to-Spanish. Results for measurement based solely on crowd-sourced assessments show system rankings in line with those of the original evaluation. Comparison of results produced by the relative preference approach and the direct estimate method described here demonstrate that the direct estimate method has a substantially increased ability to identify significant differences between translation systems.

AB We present a novel framework for machine translation evaluation using neural networks in a pairwise setting, where the goal is to select the better translation from a pair of hypotheses, given the reference translation. In this framework, lexical, syntactic and semantic information from the reference and the two hypotheses is compacted into relatively small distributed vector representations, and fed into a multi-layer neural network that models the interaction between each of the hypotheses and the reference, as well as between the two hypotheses. These compact representations are in turn based on word and sentence embeddings, which are learned using neural networks. The framework is flexible, allows for efficient learning and classification, and yields correlation with humans that rivals the state of the art.

The corpus contains 1.49 million parallel segments, of which 694k segments were not previously available in the public domain. The corpus has been pre-processed for machine translation, and we report baseline phrase-based SMT and NMT translation results on this corpus. This corpus has been used in two editions of shared tasks at the Workshop on Asian Language Translation (2016 and 2017). The corpus is freely available for non-commercial research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest publicly available English-Hindi parallel corpus.

AB This paper does not aim at introducing a novel model for document-level neural machine translation. Instead, we head back to the original Transformer model and hope to answer the following question: Is the capacity of current models strong enough for document-level translation? Interestingly, we observe that the original Transformer with appropriate training techniques can achieve strong results for document translation, even with a length of 2000 words. We evaluate this model and several recent approaches on nine document-level datasets and two sentence-level datasets across six languages. Experiments show that document-level Transformer models outperforms sentence-level ones and many previous methods in a comprehensive set of metrics, including BLEU, four lexical indices, three newly proposed assistant linguistic indicators, and human evaluation.

TI A preliminary evaluation of, metadata records machine translation
SO ELECTRONIC LIBRARY
AB Purpose - The purpose of this study is to evaluate freely available machine translation (MT) services' performance in translation metadata records.
   Design/methodology/approach - Randomly selected metadata records were translated from English into Chinese using Google, Bing, and SYSTRAN MT systems. These translation were then evaluated using a five point scale for both fluency and adequacy. Missing count (words not translated) and incorrect count (words incorrectly translated) were also recorded.
   Findings - Concerning both fluency and adequacy, Google and Bing's translations of more than 70 percent of test data received scores equal to or greater than three, representative of "non-native Chinese" and "much coverage," respectively. SYSTRAN scored lowest in both measures. However, these differences were not statistically significant. A Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated a strong relationship (r = 0.86) between fluency and adequacy. Missing count and incorrect count strongly correlated with fluency and adequacy.
   Originality/value - Most existing digital collections can be accessed in English alone. Few digital collections in the USA support multilingual information access (MLIA) that enables users of differing languages to search, browse, recognize and use information in the collections. Human translations in one solution, but it is neither time nor cost effective for most libraries. This study serves as a first step to understand the performance of current MT systems and to design effective and efficient MLIA services for digital collections.

AB The dominant neural machine translation (NMT) models apply unified attentional encoder-decoder neural networks for translation. Traditionally, the NMT decoders adopt recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to perform translation in a left-to-right manner, leaving the target-side contexts generated from right to left unexploded during translation. In this paper, we equip the conventional attentional encoder-decoder NMT framework with a backward decoder, in order to explore bidirectional decoding for NMT. Attending to the hidden state sequence produced by the encoder, our backward decoder first learns to generate the target-side hidden state sequence from right to left. Then, the forward decoder performs translation in the forward direction, while in each translation prediction timestep, it simultaneously applies two attention models to consider the source-side and reverse target-side hidden states, respectively. With this new architecture, our model is able to fully exploit source- and target-side contexts to improve translation quality altogether. Experimental results on NISI Chinese-English and WMT English-German translation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves substantial improvements over the conventional NMT by 3.14 and 1.38 BLEU points, respectively.

AB Sign language, the main mode of communication for the Deaf, is different from the written language in terms of both vocabulary and grammar. Lacking a proper written form, information retrieval from this visual language is a challenging task. Keyword search for sign language will benefit greatly from the use of written language text queries by (i) creating a middle ground for information retrieval, (ii) enabling the people outside of the Deaf community to learn sign language and (iii) making vast amount of parallel corpora between sign language and the written language available for research. In this work, we propose a cross-lingual keyword search paradigm for sign language based on neural machine translation, and analyze the effects of different decoding strategies on retrieval performance.

AB There are several well-known approaches to parsing Arabic text in preparation for indexing and retrieval. Techniques such as stemming and stopping have been shown to improve search results on written newswire dispatches, but few comparisons are available on other data sources. In this paper, we apply several alternative stemming and stopping approaches to Arabic text automatically extracted from the audio soundtrack of news video footage, and compare these with approaches that rely on machine translation of the underlying text. Using the TRECVID video collection and queries, we show that normalisation, stopword-removal, and light stemming increase retrieval precision, but that heavy stemming and trigrams have a negative effect. We also show that the choice of machine translation engine plays a major role in retrieval effectiveness.

TI Machine-Learning-Based Hybrid Method for the Multilevel Fast Multipole
   Algorithm
SO IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS
AB In this letter, a hybrid translation computation method for the multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA) is proposed based on machine learning. The hybrid method combines both generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and artificial neural network (ANN) to replace the traditional translation procedure during the solving process of the MLFMA. Based on the data corresponding to every one of the interaction list boxes at each level, the hybrid neural network is trained. Comparing with the previous machine learning method in this field, the proposed model is more general, and with lower complexity since it inherits the accuracy of the GRNN as well as the efficiency of the ANN. To the best of our knowledge, it is for the first time that the ANN is integrated into the MLFMA. Numerical examples are benchmarked to illustrate the reliability and capability, thus making it possible to solve similar problems during the fast inhomogeneous plane wave algorithm solving process in the multilayered medium.

TI Application of Convolutional Neural Network Based on Deep Learning in
   College English Translation Teaching Management
SO MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB With the increased demand for English translators in recent years, more scholars and researchers have begun to focus on college English translation education. The demand for computers to perform automatic natural language translation is at an all-time high, presenting another potential for machine translation (MT) research. Although neural machine translation (NMT) technology has advanced significantly, it still has several flaws. The reply NN-based MT technology is not optimal in the field of long sentence translation, and there are situations such as missing translation and overtranslation. So this paper proposes college English translation based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). This paper proposes that CNNs have stronger feature extraction and information processing capabilities than other deep NNs. It successfully solves the situation of missing translation and overtranslation, lowering the quality of college English translation instruction. The experimental results of this research reveal that when the length of an English sentence grows longer, the translation accuracy based on the reply NN drops to 47.9%, while the translation accuracy based on the CNN is 89.7%. It can be seen that college English translation based on CNN can be integrated into English translation teaching as an innovation of traditional teaching methods, so as to create a learning environment for students and enhance learning effects. MT based on CNN has greatly improved students' performance, which is conducive to improving the quality of college English translation teaching.

AB This paper addresses the question: In neural dialog systems, why do sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) neural networks generate short and meaningless replies for open-domain response generation? We conjecture that in a dialog system, due to the randomness of spoken language, there may be multiple equally plausible replies for one utterance, causing the deficiency of a Seq2Seq model. To evaluate our conjecture, we propose a systematic way to mimic the dialog scenario in machine translation systems with both real datasets and toy datasets generated elaborately. Experimental results show that we manage to reproduce the phenomenon of generating short and meaningless sentences in the translation setting.

AB In the IBM LMT machine translation system, derivational morphological rules recognize and analyze words that are not found in its source lexicons, and generate default transfers for these unlisted words. Unfound words with no inflectional or derivational affixes are by default nouns. These rules are now expanded to provide lexical coverage of a particular set of words created on the fly in emails by bilingual Spanish-English speakers. What characterizes the approach is the generation of additional default parts of speech, and the use of morphological, semantic, and syntactic features from both source and target lexicons for analysis and transfer. A built-in rule-based strategy to handle language borrowing and code-mixing allows for the recognition of words with variable and unpredictable frequency of occurrence, which would remain otherwise unfound, thus affecting the accuracy of parsing and the quality of translation output.

TI Innovative System for Analyzing English Translation Software Based on
   IoT Big Data
SO MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB With the continuous expansion and deepening of international exchanges and cooperation, language differences have become the biggest obstacle to exchanges and cooperation. At present, English translation software is the translation between natural languages made by humans on the basis of computers. As an important technical means to break through language barriers, machine translation is a software that uses computers to process spoken or written language. This paper aims to study the innovative system of English translation software, using the Internet of Things and big data algorithms to analyze some loopholes and deficiencies in the innovative system, and provide some data research for the system update. This paper proposes to analyze the innovative system of translation software based on the big data of the Internet of Things (IoT). Among them, the big data of the Internet of Things chooses the dynamic frame time slot ALOHA algorithm and the lower limit estimation algorithm. Its application in system analysis is very innovative. The system consists of a translation engine and a machine dictionary, which solves the basic problem of insufficient translation database of current translations, and plays a role in helping the English translation software innovation system to improve the accuracy of translations. The experimental results of this paper show that the translation system's translation software achieves 61.3% of the A-target fluent translations, and 22.7% of the B-targets can translate the original text. It can be seen that English translation software has important research significance.

TI Concept recognition as a machine translation problem

CT 5th Workshop on BioNLP Open Shared Tasks
CY NOV 04, 2019
CL Hong Kong, HONG KONG
AB Background: Automated assignment of specific ontology concepts to mentions in text is a critical task in biomedical natural language processing, and the subject of many open shared tasks. Although the current state of the art involves the use of neural network language models as a post-processing step, the very large number of ontology classes to be recognized and the limited amount of gold-standard training data has impeded the creation of end-to-end systems based entirely on machine learning. Recently, Hailu et al. recast the concept recognition problem as a type of machine translation and demonstrated that sequence-to-sequence machine learning models have the potential to outperform multi-class classification approaches.
   Methods: We systematically characterize the factors that contribute to the accuracy and efficiency of several approaches to sequence-to-sequence machine learning through extensive studies of alternative methods and hyperparameter selections. We not only identify the best-performing systems and parameters across a wide variety of ontologies but also provide insights into the widely varying resource requirements and hyperparameter robustness of alternative approaches. Analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of such systems suggest promising avenues for future improvements as well as design choices that can increase computational efficiency with small costs in performance.
   Results: Bidirectional encoder representations from transformers for biomedical text mining (BioBERT) for span detection along with the open-source toolkit for neural machine translation (OpenNMT) for concept normalization achieve state-of-the-art performance for most ontologies annotated in the CRAFT Corpus. This approach uses substantially fewer computational resources, including hardware, memory, and time than several alternative approaches.
   Conclusions: Machine translation is a promising avenue for fully machine-learning-based concept recognition that achieves state-of-the-art results on the CRAFT Corpus, evaluated via a direct comparison to previous results from the 2019 CRAFT shared task. Experiments illuminating the reasons for the surprisingly good performance of sequence-to-sequence methods targeting ontology identifiers suggest that further progress may be possible by mapping to alternative target concept representations.

AB In order to improve the performance of statistical machine translation between Chinese and minority languages, most of which are under-resourced languages with different word order and rich morphology, the paper proposes a method which incorporates syntactic information of the source-side and morphological information of the target-side to simultaneously reduce the differences of word order and morphology. First, according to the word alignment and the phrase structure trees of source language, reordering rules are extracted automatically to adjust the word order at source side. And then based on Hidden Markov Model, a morphological segmentation method is adopted to obtain morphological information of the target language. In the experiments, we take the Chinese-Mongolian translation as an example. A morpheme-level statistical machine translation system, constructed based on the reordered source side and the segmented target side, achieves 2.1 BLEU points increment over the standard phrase-based system.

Creating consistent and concise privacy notices can be a challenging task for developers. Previous work has attempted to help developers create privacy notices through a questionnaire or predefined templates. In this paper, we propose a novel approach and a framework, called PriGen, that extends these prior work. PriGen uses static analysis to identify Android applications' code segments which process personal information (i.e. permission-requiring code segments) and then leverages a Neural Machine Translation model to translate them into privacy captions. We present the initial analysis of our translation task for similar to 300,000 code segments.

TI Synchronous Inference for Multilingual Neural Machine Translation
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Multilingual neural machine translation allows a single model to translate between multiple language pairs, which greatly reduces the cost of model training and receives much attention recently. Previous studies mainly focus on training stage optimization and improve positive knowledge transfer among languages with different levels of parameter sharing, but ignore the multilingual knowledge transfer during inference although the translation in one language may help the generation of other languages. This work enhances knowledge sharing among multiple target languages in the inference phase. To achieve this, we propose a synchronous inference method that can simultaneously generate translations in multiple languages. During generation, the model that predicts the next word of each language not only based on source sentence and previously predicted segments, but also based on predicted words of other target languages. To maximize the inference stage knowledge sharing, we design a cross-lingual attention module which allows the model to dynamically selects the most relevant information from multiple target languages. The synchronous inference model requires multi-way parallel training data which is scarce. We therefore propose to adopt multi-task learning to incorporate large-scale bilingual data. We evaluate our method on three multilingual translation datasets and prove that the proposed method significantly improve the translation quality and the decoding efficiency compared to strong bilingual and multilingual baselines.

AB A corpus, especially a parallel corpus, which contains both source and target language, is an important resource in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research, particularly in machine translation. A quality corpus can improve the accuracy of the translation results significantly; however, corpus construction is very time consuming, and requires the expertise of linguistic experts. In this paper, we present Thai-Vietnamese parallel corpus construction and the process of building a Thai-Vietnamese parallel corpus. This work focuses on the construction of a semi-automatic word-alignment tool, capable of assisting researchers in the construction of a parallel corpus. The collection and validation within this study was achieved through the use of our development tool. In the first stage, the Vietnamese-Thai parallel corpus, containing 14,771 sentence pairs; was collected, aligned at word level, and validated by linguistic experts. This parallel corpus can be used as a reliable resource for statistical machine translation and other applications.

AB Parallel data are an important part of a reliable Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system. The more of these data are available, the better the quality of the SMT system. However, for some language pairs such as Persian-English, parallel sources of this kind are scarce. In this paper, a bidirectional method is proposed to extract parallel sentences from English and Persian document aligned Wikipedia. Two machine translation systems are employed to translate from Persian to English and the reverse after which an IR system is used to measure the similarity of the translated sentences. Adding the extracted sentences to the training data of the existing SMT systems is shown to improve the quality of the translation. Furthermore, the proposed method slightly outperforms the one-directional approach. The extracted corpus consists of about 200,000 sentences which have been sorted by their degree of similarity calculated by the IR system and is freely available for public access on the Web(1).

AB This paper aims to contribute to an in-depth understanding of computer based word alignment processes in machine translation (MT). The performance of word alignment, based on IBM models and incorporated in GIZA++, has been widely discussed in machine translation literature. The debate has lead towards a general consensus that GIZA++ does not provide sufficiently good results for word alignments. In this paper, we analyse the performance of GIZA++ and Fast Align for the Latvian-English pair against the manually aligned Gold Standard. Experiments showed that Fast Align proved to be approximately 2-3% more accurate and three times faster than GIZA++ in the alignment task. Where it concerns pre-processing, the removal of articles has a small, but positive, influence on alignment quality and machine translation output. We also present a Word Alignment Visualisation tool for analysis and editing of word alignments.

AB Every person speaks or writes their own flavor of their native language, influenced by a number of factors: the content they tend to talk about, their gender, their social status, or their geographical origin. When attempting to perform Machine Translation (MT), these variations have a significant effect on how the system should perform translation, but this is not captured well by standard one-size-fits-all models. In this paper, we propose a simple and parameter-efficient adaptation technique that only requires adapting the bias of the output softmax to each particular user of the MT system, either directly or through a factored approximation. Experiments on TED talks in three languages demonstrate improvements in translation accuracy, and better reflection of speaker traits in the target text.

AB One of the recent tasks for machine translation research has been development of translation capabilities in a time frame as short as 100 days. Such a task requires developers to consider what can be done with relatively small amounts of data in a small time frame. This inherently limits the type and complexity of the effort to be devoted to this task. In this paper we will focus on the kinds of improvements for a Farsi-to-English translation system achieved by means of algorithmic changes, adding raw, domain-unspecific resources, and unsupervised morphological segmentation. The cumulative effect of these measures has been an improvement in BLEU scores of about 25% relative on an internal test set.

AB Polarization among US political parties, media and elites is a widely studied topic. Prominent lines of prior research across multiple disciplines have observed and analyzed growing polarization in social media. In this paper, we present a new methodology that offers a fresh perspective on interpreting polarization through the lens of machine translation. With a novel proposition that two sub-communities are speaking in two different languages, we demonstrate that modern machine translation methods can provide a simple yet powerful and interpretable framework to understand the differences between two (or more) large-scale social media discussion data sets at the granularity of words. Via a substantial corpus of 86.6 million comments by 6 5 million users on over 200,000 news videos hosted by YouTube channels of four prominent US news networks, we demonstrate that simple word-level and phrase-level translation pairs can reveal deep insights into the current political divide - what is black lives matter to one can be all lives matter to the other.

AB The scarcity of large parallel corpora is an important obstacle for neural machine translation. A common solution is to exploit the knowledge of language models (LM) trained on abundant monolingual data. In this work, we propose a novel approach to incorporate a LM as prior in a neural translation model (TM). Specifically, we add a regularization term, which pushes the output distributions of the TM to be probable under the LM prior, while avoiding wrong predictions when the TM "disagrees" with the LM. This objective relates to knowledge distillation, where the LM can be viewed as teaching the TM about the target language. The proposed approach does not compromise decoding speed, because the LM is used only at training time, unlike previous work that requires it during inference. We present an analysis on the effects that different methods have on the distributions of the TM. Results on two low-resource machine translation datasets show clear improvements even with limited monolingual data.

AB Recent advances in neural machine translation (NMT) have pushed the quality of machine translation systems to the point where they are becoming widely adopted for building competitive systems. However, there is still a large number of languages that are yet to reap the benefits of NMT. In this paper, we provide the first large-scale case study of the practical application of MT in the Turkic language family in order to realize the gains of NMT for Turkic languages under high-resource to extremely low-resource scenarios. In addition to presenting an extensive analysis that identifies the bottlenecks towards building competitive systems to ameliorate data scarcity, our study has several key contributions, including, i) a large parallel corpus covering 22 Turkic languages consisting of common public datasets in combination with new datasets of approximately 2 million parallel sentences, ii) bilingual baselines for 26 language pairs, iii) novel high-quality test sets in three different translation domains and iv) human evaluation scores. All of our data, software and models are publicly available.(1)

AB Entity alignment is the task of finding entities in two knowledge bases (KBs) that represent the same real-world object. When facing KBs in different natural languages, conventional cross-lingual entity alignment methods rely on machine translation to eliminate the language barriers. These approaches often suffer from the uneven quality of translations between languages. While recent embedding-based techniques encode entities and relationships in KBs and do not need machine translation for cross-lingual entity alignment, a significant number of attributes remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a joint attribute-preserving embedding model for cross-lingual entity alignment. It jointly embeds the structures of two KBs into a unified vector space and further refines it by leveraging attribute correlations in the KBs. Our experimental results on real-world datasets show that this approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art embedding approaches for cross-lingual entity alignment and could be complemented with methods based on machine translation.

TI A reception study of machine translated subtitles for MOOCs
SO PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATION THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB As access has grown to online courses in the form of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), the language barrier has become an important issue for users worldwide. Machine translation (MT) appears to offer an alternative or complementary solution to existing forms of MOOC translation. Very little attention has been paid, however, to the use and utility of MT for MOOC content. The main goal of this research is to test the impact machine-translated subtitles have on Chinese viewers' reception of MOOC content. We are interested in whether there is any difference between viewers' reception of raw machine-translated subtitles as opposed to fully post-edited machine-translated (PEMT) subtitles and human-translated (HT) subtitles. Based on an eye-tracking experiment conducted at two Chinese universities and survey methods, we show that participants who were offered full PEMT subtitles scored better overall on our reception metrics than those who were offered raw MT subtitles. HT subtitles, on the other hand, did not necessarily lead to better reception as expected; in contrast, the participants who were offered HT subtitles performed the worst in some of our reception metrics.

AB Though early successes of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems are attributed in part to the explicit modelling of the interaction between any two source and target units, e.g., alignment, the recent Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems resort to the attention which partially encodes the interaction for efficiency. In this paper, we employ Joint Representation that fully accounts for each possible interaction. We sidestep the inefficiency issue by refining representations with the proposed efficient attention operation. The resulting Reformer models offer a new Sequence-to-Sequence modelling paradigm besides the Encoder-Decoder framework and outperform the Transformer baseline in either the small scale IWSLT14 German-English, English-German and IWSLT15 Vietnamese-English or the large scale NIST12 Chinese-English translation tasks by about 1 BLEU point. We also propose a systematic model scaling approach, allowing the Reformer model to beat the state-of-the-art Transformer in IWSLT14 German-English and NIST12 Chinese-English with about 50% fewer parameters. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/lyy1994/reformer.

AB In this paper we present research results with gApp, a text-preprocessing system designed for automatically detecting and converting discontinuous multiword expressions (MWEs) into their continuous forms so as to improve the performance of current neural machine translation systems (NMT) (see Hidalgo-Ternero 2021; Hidalgo-Ternero and Corpas Pastor 2020, 2022a, 2022b and 2022c, among others). To test its effectiveness, an experiment with the NMT systems of Google Translate and DeepL has been carried out in the ES>EN/ZH directionalities for the translation of somatisms, i.e., MWEs containing lexemes referring to human or animal body parts (Mellado Blanco 2004). More specifically, we have analysed "Verb Noun Idiomatic Constructions" (VNICs), such as tocar los cojones, tocar los huevos, tocar las narices, and tocar las pelotas. In this regard, some of the unexpected results yielded by the study of these multiword expressions will question the widely accepted conception of phraseological discontinuity as an unequivocal synonym of worse NMT performance.

TI A Reordering Model Using a Source-Side Parse-Tree for Statistical
   Machine Translation
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB This paper presents a reordering model using a source-side parse-tree for phrase-based statistical machine translation. The proposed model is an extension of IST-ITG (imposing source tree on inversion transduction grammar) constraints. In the proposed method, the target-side word order is obtained by rotating nodes of the source-side parse-tree. We modeled the node rotation. monotone or swap, using word alignments based on a training parallel corpus and source-side parse-trees. The model efficiently suppresses erroneous target word orderings, especially global orderings. Furthermore, the proposed method conducts a probabilistic evaluation of target word reorderings. In English-to-Japanese and English-to-Chinese translation experiments, the proposed method resulted in a 0.49-point improvement (29.31 to 29.80) and a 0.33-point improvement (18.60 to 18.93) in word BLEU-4 compared with IST-ITG constraints, respectively. This indicates the validity of the proposed reordering model.

AB Neural machine translation (NMT) is notoriously sensitive to noises, but noises are almost inevitable in practice. One special kind of noise is the homophone noise, where words are replaced by other words with similar pronunciations.(1) We propose to improve the robustness of NMT to homophone noises by 1) jointly embedding both textual and phonetic information of source sentences, and 2) augmenting the training dataset with homophone noises. Interestingly, to achieve better translation quality and more robustness, we found that most (though not all) weights should be put on the phonetic rather than textual information. Experiments show that our method not only significantly improves the robustness of NMT to homophone noises, but also surprisingly improves the translation quality on some clean test sets.

AB This paper presents a kind of target language generation mechanism in Data-Oriented English-Chinese Machine Translation. This mechanism applies the theory of Data-Oriented Parsing used in language analysis traditionally into target language generation equally. Through linearizing the result of source language analysis -- a parse tree, the final translation in target language is generated. To prove the efficiency of the proposed method, the knowledge source is constructed based on the real-world English corpus, and the other real-world English corpus is used as the test set. The experiment result shows that the quality of translation in target language is satisfactory.

TI Deep learning for the monitoring and process control of femtosecond
   laser machining
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-PHOTONICS
AB Whilst advances in lasers now allow the processing of practically any material, further optimisation in precision and efficiency is highly desirable, in particular via the development of real-time detection and feedback systems. Here, we demonstrate the application of neural networks for system monitoring via visual observation of the work-piece during laser processing. Specifically, we show quantification of unintended laser beam modifications, namely translation and rotation, along with real-time closed-loop feedback capable of halting laser processing immediately after machining through a similar to 450 nm thick copper layer. We show that this approach can detect translations in beam position that are smaller than the pixels of the camera used for observation. We also show a method of data augmentation that can be used to significantly reduce the quantity of experimental data needed for training a neural network. Unintentional beam translations and rotations are detected concurrently, hence demonstrating the feasibility for simultaneous identification of many laser machining parameters. Neural networks are an ideal solution, as they require zero understanding of the physical properties of laser machining, and instead are trained directly from experimental data.

AB With the promising progress of deep neural networks, layer aggregation has been used to fuse information across layers in various fields, such as computer vision and machine translation. However, most of the previous methods combine layers in a static fashion in that their aggregation strategy is independent of specific hidden states. Inspired by recent progress on capsule networks, in this paper we propose to use routing-by-agreement strategies to aggregate layers dynamically. Specifically, the algorithm learns the probability of a part (individual layer representations) assigned to a whole (aggregated representations) in an iterative way and combines parts accordingly. We implement our algorithm on top of the state-of-the-art neural machine translation model TRANSFORMER and conduct experiments on the widely-used WMT14 English double right arrow German and WMT17 Chinese double right arrow English translation datasets. Experimental results across language pairs show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the strong baseline model and a representative static aggregation model.

AB Deep Neural Networks(DNNs) outperform previous works in many fields such as in natural language processing. Neural Machine Translation(NMT) also outperforms Statistical Machine Translation(SMT) which has complex features and rules. However, NMT requires a large corpus and a long calculation time. In order to suppress calculation cost, recent researches replaced low frequency words with symbols. However, the symbols make sentences ambiguous and deteriorates translation accuracy. To solve this problem, sub-word units such as Byte Pair Encoding(BPE) and Wordpiece Model(WPM) creating vocabularies in a prespecified vocabulary size has been proposed. Nevertheless, these tokenize methods break words and treat them as symbols. Words as symbols are compatible with neural networks and NMT performance has increased. This result shows that linguistic correctness is not necessarily important in NMT. If that is the case, we wonder to what extent linguistic correctness contributes to NMT accuracy. In this research, we experiment to incorporate linguistic information into sub-word units. Experimentally, we demonstrate that morpheme as linguistic information is a helpful factor for sub-word units.

AB With the rapid growing amount of information available to us, the situations that a user needs to use a retrieval system to perform querying a multilingual document collection are becoming increasingly emerging and common. Thus an important problem is formed, to match the user queries specified in one language against documents in another different language, i.e. Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR). Based on the work in CLIR evaluation task in the 9th Text Retrieval Conference (TREC-9), we have constructed an English-Chinese bi-directional CLIR system. In this system, we adopt English-Chinese bi-directional query translation as the dominant strategy, use English and Chinese queries as translation objects, and utilize English and Chinese machine readable dictionaries as the important knowledge source to acquire correct translations. By combining English and Chinese monolingual IR systems constructed by us, the complete English-Chinese bi-directional CLIR process can be implemented successfully.

AB Most current machine translation models are mainly trained with parallel corpora, and their translation accuracy largely depends on the quality and quantity of the corpora. Although there are billions of parallel sentences for a few language pairs, effectively dealing with most language pairs is difficult due to a lack of publicly available parallel corpora. This paper creates a large parallel corpus for English-Japanese, a language pair for which only limited resources are available, compared to such resource-rich languages as English-German. It introduces a new web-based English-Japanese parallel corpus named JParaCrawl v3.0. Our new corpus contains more than 21 million unique parallel sentence pairs, which is more than twice as many as the previous JParaCrawl v2.0 corpus. Through experiments, we empirically show how our new corpus boosts the accuracy of machine translation models on various domains. The JParaCrawl v3.0 corpus will eventually be publicly available online for research purposes.

TI Statistical machine translation in the translation curriculum:
   overcoming obstacles and empowering translators
SO INTERPRETER AND TRANSLATOR TRAINER
AB In this paper we argue that the time is ripe for translator educators to engage with Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) in more profound ways than they have done to date. We explain the basic principles of SMT and reflect on the role of humans in SMT workflows. Against a background of diverging opinions on the latter, we argue for a holistic approach to the integration of SMT into translator training programmes, one that empowers rather than marginalises translators. We discuss potential barriers to the use of SMT by translators generally and in translator training in particular, and propose some solutions to problems thus identified. More specifically, cloud-based services are proposed as a means of overcoming some of the technical and ethical challenges posed by more advanced uses of SMT in the classroom. Ultimately the paper aims to pave the way for the design and implementation of a new translator-oriented SMT syllabus at our own University and elsewhere.

AB We develop a novel modeling framework for Boltzmann machines, augmenting each hidden unit with a latent transformation assignment variable which describes the selection of the transformed view of the canonical connection weights associated with the unit. This enables the inferences of the model to transform in response to transformed input data in a stable and predictable way, and avoids learning multiple features differing only with respect to the set of transformations. Extending prior work on translation equivariant (convolutional) models, we develop translation and rotation equivariant restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and deep belief nets (DBNs), and demonstrate their effectiveness in learning frequently occurring statistical structure from artificial and natural images.

TI Vision talks: Visual relationship-enhanced transformer for video-guided
   machine translation
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB Video-guided machine translation is a promising task which aims to translate a source language description into a target language utilizing the video information as supplementary context. The majority of existing work utilizes the whole video as the auxiliary information to enhance the translation performance. However, visual information, as a heterogeneous modal with text, introduces noise instead. Toward this end, we propose a novel visual relationship-enhanced transformer by constructing a semantic-visual relational graph as a cross-modal bridge. Specifically, the visual information is regarded as the structured conceptual representation, which builds a bridge between two modalities. Thereafter, graph convolutional network is deployed to capture the relationship among visual semantics. In this way, a transformer with structured multi-modal fusion strategy is allowed to explore the correlations. Finally, the proposed framework is optimized under the scheme of Kullback-Leibler divergence with label smoothing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of our proposed method as compared to other state-of-the-art solutions.

For this purpose four different roles of MT in the language class have been identified: NIT as a bad model, NIT as a good model, NIT as a vocational training tool (especially in the form of translation memories, pre-editing and post-editing), and NIT as a "CALL tool". Subsequently, some of the implications of the use of NIT and of free online NIT for FL learning are outlined and discussed along with practical examples for language teaching purposes. Finally, qualitative data, drawn from our empirical investigation are presented as synthesized findings pertaining to the perceptions of language learners and tutors in relation to the use of NIT and, in particular, free online MT as a language tool.

It has been implemented in the language Occam-2 on a PC/AT hardware platform augmented with a 3-transputer add-on card. Exploitation of parallelism and a good dictionary organization are identified as the two ways of providing an efficient solution. Parallelism in the algorithm for the morphological and phrase-level analyses and in the generation phases of translation have been fully utilized. The performance of the MTS is discussed for various methods of task distribution and the way the dictionary is accessed. The performance studies have also been conducted on the MTS with and without load sharing among the transputers. The results show that the system performance is nearly doubled with the addition of the transputer card and with the transputers working under no-load sharing condition.

TI A MACHINE TRANSLATION SYSTEM FROM HINDI TO SANSKRIT LANGUAGE USING RULE
   BASED APPROACH
SO SCALABLE COMPUTING-PRACTICE AND EXPERIENCE
AB Machine Translation is an area of Natural Language Processing which can replace the laborious task of manual translation. Sanskrit language is among the ancient Indo-Aryan languages. There are numerous works of art and literature in Sanskrit. It has also been a medium for creating treatise of philosophical work as well as works on logic, astronomy and mathematics. On the other hand, Hindi is the most prominent language of India. Moreover,it is among the most widely spoken languages across the world. This paper is an effort to bridge the language barrier between Hindi and Sanskrit language such that any text in Hindi can be translated to Sanskrit. The technique used for achieving the aforesaid objective is rule-based machine translation. The salient linguistic features of the two languages are used to perform the translation. The results are produced in the form of two confusion matrices wherein a total of 50 random sentences and 100 tokens (Hindi words or phrases) were taken for system evaluation. The semantic evaluation of 100 tokens produce an accuracy of 94% while the pragmatic analysis of 50 sentences produce an accuracy of around 86%. Hence, the proposed system can be used to understand the whole translation process and can further be employed as a tool for learning as well as teaching. Further, this application can be embedded in local communication based assisting Internet of Things (IoT) devices like Alexa or Google Assistant.

TI Translating noun compounds using semantic relations
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB Despite having a research history of more than 20 years, English to Hindi machine translation often suffers badly from incorrect translations of noun compounds. The problems envisaged can be of various types, such as, the absence of proper postpositions, inappropriate word order, incorrect semantics. Different existing English to Hindi machine translation systems show their vulnerability, irrespective of the underlying technique. A potential solution to this problem lies in understanding the semantics of the noun compounds. The present paper proposes a scheme based on semantic relations to address this issue. The scheme works in three steps: identification of the noun compounds in a given text, determination of the semantic relationship(s) between them, and finally, selecting the right translation pattern. The scheme provides translation patterns for different semantic relations for 2-word noun compounds first. These patterns are used recursively to find the semantic relations and the translation patterns for 3-word and 4-word noun compounds. Frequency and probability based adjacency and dependency models are used for bracketing (grouping) the constituent words of 3-word and 4-word noun compounds into 2-word noun compounds. The semantic relations and the translation patterns generated for 2-word, 3-word and 4-word noun compounds are evaluated. The proposed scheme is compared with some well-known English to Hindi translators, viz. AnglaMT, Anuvadaksh, Bing, Google, and also with the Moses baseline system. The results obtained, show significant improvement over the Moses baseline system. Also, it performs better than the other online MT systems in terms of recall and precision. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Machine translation (MT) quality is evaluated through comparisons between MT outputs and the human translations (HT). Traditionally, this evaluation relies on form related features (e.g. lexicon and syntax) and ignores the transfer of meaning reflected in HT outputs. Instead, we evaluate the quality of MT outputs through meaning related features (e.g. polarity, subjectivity) with two experiments. In the first experiment, the meaning related features are compared to human rankings individually. In the second experiment, combinations of meaning related features and other quality metrics are utilized to predict the same human rankings. The results of our experiments confirm the benefit of these features in predicting human evaluation of translation quality in addition to traditional metrics which focus mainly on form.

AB Lack of parallel training data influences the rare word problem in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems, particularly for under-resourced languages. Using synthetic parallel training data (data augmentation) is a promising approach to handle the rare word problem. Previously proposed methods for data augmentation do not consider language syntax when generating synthetic training data. This leads to generation of sentences that lower the overall quality of parallel training data. In this paper, we discuss the suitability of using Parts of Speech (POS) tagging and morphological analysis as syntactic features to prune the generated synthetic sentence pairs that do not adhere to language syntax. Our models show an overall 2.16 and 5.00 BLEU score gains over our benchmark Sinhala to Tamil and Tamil to Sinhala translation systems, respectively. Although we focus on Sinhala and Tamil NMT for the domain of official government documents, we believe that these synthetic data pruning techniques can be generalized to any language pair.

AB IA-32 emulation is a good solution to software compatibility for new computer architecture. However, the address translation from guest machine to host machine is one of the most costly process in IA-32 emulation. To reduce the translation overhead, this paper presented a Pre_TLB with a prefetching window which could predict the memory access of guest machine. The prefetching window slides with the current address which causes a Pre_TLB miss. All entries in the prefetching window are translated at the same time so that several times of memory access can be reduced. Experiments showed that Pre_TLB had a good performance both on hit rate and time cost. For the program with conspicuous locality property, Pre_TLB could only obtain an improvement of 2%. However, for the program with little locality property, the hit rate improved by 9%, and the time cost reduced by 20%.

The translation of natural languages for intelligent systems has been one of the most challenging problems in intelligent systems from the very beginning.  It is the responsibility of a translation system to assign the responsibility of task generation ability of the machine to automate a program generation.
   In this paper, the problem of advanced machine translation capabilities is approached by examining the Sinhala natural language.  Sinhalese has not been analyzed using computational linguistics.  Our earlier system on Sinhalese morphology is the first attempt of such a study.  This paper extends it to syntactic and semantic analysis.  We formalize grammar rules for unit, phrase, clause and sentence, and developed a semantically characteristic Sinhalese dictionary, and a conceptual dictionary based on English, Japanese, and Sinhalese.  Syntactic and semantic analyses are implemented on the computer and sound experimental results are obtained.

AB Modern teamwork often happens between subgroups located in different countries. Members of the same subgroup prefer to communicate in their native language for efficiency, which increases the coordination cost between subgroups. The current study extends previous HCI literature that explores the effects of machine translation (MT) on crosslingual teamwork. We investigated whether automated keyword tagging would assist people's comprehension of imperfect MT outputs and, therefore, enhance the quality of communication between subgroups. We conducted an online experiment where twenty teams performed a collaborative task. Each team consisted of two native English speakers and two native Mandarin speakers. We provided MT support that enabled participants to read all subgroups' discussions in English before team meetings, but in two forms: with vs. without automated keyword tagging. We found MT with automated keyword tagging affected people's interaction with the translated materials, but it did not enhance translation comprehensibility in the context of teamwork.

AB In low resource Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), one usually resorts to the Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) technique to learn transform rules to refine grapheme lexicon. To do this, we face two challenges. One is to generate grapheme sequences from the training data as the targets, which is paired with the original transcripts to train SMT models; the other is to effectively prune the learned rules from the translation model. In this paper we further this study. First we propose a simple but effective pruning method; second, to see in which case we are able to learn better rules, different setups with various acoustic and language model combinations are investigated; finally, to examine if the rules in different setups are complementary, lexicons generated via different rule tables are merged in ASR experiments. We report a WER reduction of up to 6.2% with the proposed technique.

AB Morphological segmentation breaks words into morphemes. It is an important issue in natural language processing systems. The paper proposes a morphological segmentation method with hidden markov model method for Mongolian. The method uses sentences which consist of Mongolian words associated with affix sequences to establish a Hidden Markov Model. We identify Mongolian affix in a given word based on this model. When a morpheme is identified as the affix, we can get the stem easily according to Mongolian word and affix. The segmentation error is corrected by applying the vocabulary model of words and affixes, the 1-gram model of affixes and the reverse maximum matching model. In order to further validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method, we use morphemes as pivot language in a chained machine translation system. Experiments show that the precision of the morphological segmentation system achieves 96.24%, and the translation results of the statistical machine translation system is improved significantly.

The filtered parallel corpora range in size from 51 million sentences (Spanish-English) to 154k sentences (Croatian-English), with the unfiltered (raw) corpora being up to 2 times larger. Access to clean, high quality, parallel data in technical domains such as science, engineering, and medicine is needed for training neural machine translation systems for tasks like online dispute resolution and eProcurement. Our evaluation found that the addition of EuroPat data to a generic baseline improved the performance of machine translation systems on in-domain test data in German, Spanish, French, and Polish; and in translating patent data from Croatian to English. The corpus has been released under Creative Commons Zero, and is expected to be widely useful for training high-quality machine translation systems, and particularly for those targeting technical documents such as patents and contracts.

TI Machine Translation Utilizing the Frequent-Item Set Concept
SO SENSORS
AB In this paper, we introduce new concepts in the machine translation paradigm. We treat the corpus as a database of frequent word sets. A translation request triggers association rules joining phrases present in the source language, and phrases present in the target language. It has to be noted that a sequential scan of the corpus for such phrases will increase the response time in an unexpected manner. We introduce the pre-processing of the bilingual corpus through proposing a data structure called Corpus-Trie (CT) that renders a bilingual parallel corpus in a compact data structure representing frequent data items sets. We also present algorithms which utilize the CT to respond to translation requests and explore novel techniques in exhaustive experiments. Experiments were performed on specific language pairs, although the proposed method is not restricted to any specific language. Moreover, the proposed Corpus-Trie can be extended from bilingual corpora to accommodate multi-language corpora. Experiments indicated that the response time of a translation request is logarithmic to the count of unrepeated phrases in the original bilingual corpus (and thus, the Corpus-Trie size). In practical situations, 5-20% of the log of the number of the nodes have to be visited. The experimental results indicate that the BLEU score for the proposed CT system increases with the size of the number of phrases in the CT, for both English-Arabic and English-French translations. The proposed CT system was demonstrated to be better than both Omega-T and Apertium in quality of translation from a corpus size exceeding 1,600,000 phrases for English-Arabic translation, and 300,000 phrases for English-French translation.

AB Machine Translation (MT) has proven to be a useful tool for translating one spoken language to another since the mid-'90s. Ultimately, it has helped to bridge the communication gap between people unaware of each other's languages. A variation of MT, named 'Sign Language Machine Translation (SLMT),' enables the translation of spoken text/speech to Sign Language. It helps reduce the 'hearing' people's difficulties in connecting with the hearing-impaired community. Thus, it can aid in the inclusion of hard-hearing in the rest of society. We have developed a system to translate a simple Marathi language sentence to the equivalent Indian Sign Language representation.
   We have studied the morpho-syntactic characteristics of both languages, and contrastive analysis is discussed here. This study gave us a cue to attempt translation at phrase level from the source language side. We have formulated the rules to extract necessary grammatical knowledge and to utilize it for translation. The detailed approach, experimentation, and results are also addressed in this research work.
   This automated system can be used at public places like banks, post-offices, railway stations for effective short communications. It can be availed as a self-learning tool to learn Indian Sign Language. The system can be used whenever sign language interpreters are not readily available.

TI Domain adaptation for ontology localization
SO JOURNAL OF WEB SEMANTICS
AB Ontology localization is the task of adapting an ontology to a different cultural context, and has been identified as an important task in the context of the Multilingual Semantic Web vision. The key task in ontology localization is translating the lexical layer of an ontology, i.e., its labels, into some foreign language. For this task, we hypothesize that the translation quality can be improved by adapting a machine translation system to the domain of the ontology. To this end, we build on the success of existing statistical machine translation (SMT) approaches, and investigate the impact of different domain adaptation techniques on the task. In particular, we investigate three techniques: (i) enriching a phrase table by domain-specific translation candidates acquired from existing Web resources, (ii) relying on Explicit Semantic Analysis as an additional technique for scoring a certain translation of a given source phrase, as well as (iii) adaptation of the language model by means of weighting n-grams with scores obtained from topic modelling. We present in detail the impact of each of these three techniques on the task of translating ontology labels. We show that these techniques have a generally positive effect on the quality of translation of the ontology and that, in combination, they provide a significant improvement in quality.

AB The application of machine translation (MT) in crisis settings is of increasing interest to humanitarian practitioners. We collaborated with industry and non-profit partners: (1) to develop and test the utility of an MT system trained specifically on crisis-related content in an under-resourced language combination (French-to-Swahili); and (2) to evaluate the extent to which speakers of both French and Swahili without post-editing experience could be mobilized to post-edit the output of this system effectively. Our small study carried out in Kenya found that our system performed well, provided useful output, and was positively evaluated by inexperienced post-editors. We use the study to discuss the feasibility of MT use in crisis settings for low-resource language combinations and make recommendations on data selection and domain consideration for future crisis-related MT development.

AB In this paper, we present the building of various language resources for a multi-engine bi-directional English-Filipino Machine Translation (MT) system. Since linguistics information on Philippine languages are available, but as of yet, the focus has been on theoretical linguistics and little is done on the computational aspects of these languages, attempts are reported here on the manual construction of these language resources such as the grammar, lexicon, morphological information, and the corpora which were literally built from almost non-existent digital forms. Due to the inherent difficulties of manual construction, we also discuss our experiments on various technologies for automatic extraction of these resources to handle the intricacies of the Filipino language, designed with the intention of using them for the MT system. To implement the different MT engines and to ensure the improvement of translation quality, other language tools (such as the morphological analyzer and generator, and the part of speech tagger) were developed.

AB HowNet is a Chinese-English Bilingual common-sense knowledge base, playing an important role in machine translation tasks. However, when facing domain-specific machine translation tasks, HowNet must be supplemented with domain-specific terminologies. In other words, we need to construct domain terminology semantic knowledge base. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically construct domain terminology knowledge base, based on the headword of a terminology. Specifically, the semantic meaning (HowNet DEF) of an unseen terminology is defined as one of the semantic meanings of the headword of the terminology. Headword disambiguation is done by considering the context of headwords and adding domain-specific disambiguation rules to the general disambiguation rules. Experiments on aviation domain show that our proposed method on headword disambiguation achieves 9.4% improvement based on the default disambiguation tools in HowNet. We also find that with our automatically constructed domain terminology knowledge base, HowNet machine translation system achieves better translation quality.

TI Word Sense Based Hindi-Tamil Statistical Machine Translation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
AB Corpus based natural language processing has emerged with great success in recent years. It is not only used for languages like English, French, Spanish, and Hindi but also is widely used for languages like Tamil, Telugu etc. This paper focuses to increase the accuracy of machine translation from Hindi to Tamil by considering the word's sense as well as its part-of-speech. This system works on word by word translation from Hindi to Tamil language which makes use of additional information such as the preceding words, the current word's part of speech and the word's sense itself. For such a translation system, the frequency of words occurring in the corpus, the tagging of the input words and the probability of the preceding word of the tagged words are required. Wordnet is used to identify various synonym for the words specified in the source language. Among these words, the one which is more relevant to the word specified in source language is considered for the translation to target language. The introduction of the additional information such as part-of-speech tag, preceding word information and semantic analysis has greatly improved the accuracy of the system.

AB Science translation is a new branch of learning in China, but its practice can be traced back to about 200 BC. It includes all the practical fields but literary translation. It is the translation activity that mainly conveys science information, especially a thought activity and extra-language activity of the translator's using target language to express the science information of source language so as to pursue the similar information. This paper briefly examines its history chronologically, and explores its gradual movement from practice to theory, from written translation to oral interpretation, from general theory to discipline studies. The history of science translation is composed of human translation and machine translation, but this paper only deals with the former.

TI Neural Machine Translation With GRU-Gated Attention Model
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
AB Neural machine translation (NMT) heavily relies on context vectors generated by an attention network to predict target words. In practice, we observe that the context vectors for different target words are quite similar to one another and translations with such nondiscriminatory context vectors tend to be degenerative. We ascribe this similarity to the invariant source representations that lack dynamics across decoding steps. In this article, we propose a novel gated recurrent unit (GRU)gated attention model (GAtt) for NMT. By updating the source representations with the previous decoder state via a GRU, GAtt enables translation-sensitive source representations that then contribute to discriminative context vectors. We further propose a variant of GAtt by swapping the input order of the source representations and the previous decoder state to the GRU. Experiments on the NIST Chinese-English, WMT14 EnglishGerman, and WMT17 English-German translation tasks show that the two GAtt models achieve significant improvements over the vanilla attention-based NMT. Further analyses on the attention weights and context vectors demonstrate the effectiveness of GAtt in enhancing the discriminating capacity of representations and handling the challenging issue of overtranslation.

AB Bilingual information processing has been being used widely in many tasks such as Natural Language Understanding (NLU), Cross-Domain, Machine Translation (MT) and Bilingual Cognition. There still remain some problematic phenomena for understanding bilingual information processing. In this work, we aim to fully understand both the principles and methods of bilingual information processing by taking advantage of appropriate comparisons. The major idea of our proposed approach is both human and the machine can cooperate or interact with each other according to their characteristics. Concretely, it is composed of the following three steps: First, find issues from the Chinese-English bilingual translation at phrase sentence level alignment. The challenge in Chinese-English translation lies in an inconsistency of the meanings between the Chinese characters and the English words. Then, analyze the problems from the view of interdisciplinary, cross-domain and cross-industry. Finally, address leveraging human-machine to divide the task and coordinate with each other. As a result, not only we discover both parallel dual formalized approach of big and small strings, but also find and validate both the superiority and followed scientific principles of generalized bilingual information processing method.

AB Multimodal machine translation (MMT), which mainly focuses on enhancing text-only translation with visual features, has attracted considerable attention from both computer vision and natural language processing communities. Most current MMT models resort to attention mechanism, global context modeling or multimodal joint representation learning to utilize visual features. However, the attention mechanism lacks sufficient semantic interactions between modalities while the other two provide fixed visual context, which is unsuitable for modeling the observed variability when generating translation. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Dynamic Context-guided Capsule Network (DCCN) for MMT. Specifically, at each timestep of decoding, we first employ the conventional source-target attention to produce a timestep-specific source-side context vector. Next, DCCN takes this vector as input and uses it to guide the iterative extraction of related visual features via a context-guided dynamic routing mechanism. Particularly, we represent the input image with global and regional visual features, we introduce two parallel DCCNs to model multimodal context vectors with visual features at different granularities. Finally, we obtain two multimodal context vectors, which are fused and incorporated into the decoder for the prediction of the target word. Experimental results on the Multi30K dataset of English-to-German and English-to-French translation demonstrate the superiority of DCCN.

AB When translating into morphologically rich languages, statistical MT approaches face the problem of data sparsity. The severity of the sparseness problem will be high when the corpus size of morphologically richer language is less. Even though, we can use factored models to correctly generate morphological forms of words, the problem of data sparseness limits their performance. In this paper, we describe a simple and effective solution which is based on enriching the input corpora with various morphological forms of words. We use this method with the phrase-based and factor-based experiments on two morphologically rich languages: Hindi and Marathi when translating from English. We evaluate the performance of our experiments both in terms of automatic evaluation and subjective evaluation such as adequacy and fluency. We observe that the morphology injection method helps in improving the quality of translation. We further analyze that the morph injection method helps in handling the data sparseness problem to a great level.

AB Most EBMT systems select the best example scored by the similarity between the input sentence and existing examples. However, there is still much matching and mutual-translation information unexplored from examples. This paper introduces log-linear translation model into EBMT in order to adequately incorporate different kinds of features inherited in the translation examples. Instead of designing translation model by human intuition, this paper formally constructs a multi-dimensional feature space to include various features of different aspects. In the experiments, the proposed model shows significantly better result.

To examine the gap between human and machine translators, we created an experiment in which human beings were asked to translate an unknown language into English on the sole basis of a very small bilingual text. Participants performed quite well, and debriefings revealed a number of valuable strategies. We discuss these strategies and apply some of them to a statistical translation system.

AB Non-Autoregressive machine Translation (NAT) models have demonstrated significant inference speedup but suffer from inferior translation accuracy. The common practice to tackle the problem is transferring the Autoregressive machine Translation (AT) knowledge to NAT models, e.g., with knowledge distillation. In this work, we hypothesize and empirically verify that AT and NAT encoders capture different linguistic properties of source sentences. Therefore, we propose to adopt multi-task learning to transfer the AT knowledge to NAT models through encoder sharing. Specifically, we take the AT model as an auxiliary task to enhance NAT model performance. Experimental results on WMT14 English <-> German and WMT16 English <-> Romanian datasets show that the proposed MULTI-TASK NAT achieves significant improvements over the baseline NAT models. Furthermore, the performance on large-scale WMT19 and WMT20 English <-> German datasets confirm the consistency of our proposed method. In addition, experimental results demonstrate that our MULTI-TASK NAT is complementary to knowledge distillation, the standard knowledge transfer method for NAT.(1)

AB kNN-MT, recently proposed by Khandelwal et al. (2020a), successfully combines pretrained neural machine translation (NMT) model with token-level k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) retrieval to improve the translation accuracy. However, the traditional kNN algorithm used in kNN-MT simply retrieves a same number of nearest neighbors for each target token, which may cause prediction errors when the retrieved neighbors include noises. In this paper, we propose Adaptive kNN-MT to dynamically determine the number of k for each target token. We achieve this by introducing a light-weight Meta-k Network, which can be efficiently trained with only a few training samples. On four benchmark machine translation datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method is able to effectively filter out the noises in retrieval results and significantly outperforms the vanilla kNN-MT model. Even more noteworthy is that the Meta-k Network learned on one domain could be directly applied to other domains and obtain consistent improvements, illustrating the generality of our method. Our implementation is open-sourced at https://github. com/zhengxxn/adaptive-knn-mt.

AB This paper presents a fine-grained error comparison of the English-to-Dutch translations of a commercial neural, phrase-based and rule-based machine translation (MT) system. For phrase-based and rule-based machine translation, we make use of the annotated SCATE corpus of MT errors, enriching it with the annotation of neural MT errors and updating the SCATE error taxonomy to fit the neural MT output as well. Neural, in general, outperforms phrase-based and rule-based systems especially for fluency, except for lexical issues. On the accuracy level, the improvements are less obvious. The target sentence does not always contain traces or clues of content being missing (omissions). This has repercussions for quality estimation or gisting operating only on the monolingual level. Mistranslations are part of another well represented error category, comprising a high number of word-sense disambiguation errors and a variety of other mistranslation errors, making it more complex to annotate or post-edit.

TI Listwise Ranking Functions for Statistical Machine Translation
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB Decision rules play an important role in the tuning and decoding steps of statistical machine translation. The traditional decision rule selects the candidate with the greatest potential from a candidate space by examining each candidate individually. However, viewing each candidate as independent imposes a serious limitation on the translation task. We instead view the problem from a ranking perspective that naturally allows the consideration of an entire list of candidates as a whole through the adoption of a listwise ranking function. Our shift from a pointwise to a listwise perspective proves to be a simple yet powerful extension to current modeling that allows arbitrary pairwise functions to be incorporated as features, whose weights can be estimated jointly with traditional ones. We further demonstrate that our formulation encompasses the minimum Bayes risk (MBR) approach, another decision rule that considers restricted listwise information, as a special case. Experiments show that our approach consistently outperforms the baseline and MBR methods across the considered test sets.

AB Bilingual parallel sentence pairs are important resources of machine translation. Due to the limitation of obtaining ways, sentence leveled parallel corpora are not only limited in quantity, but they also concentrate in specific field. So they are difficult to be adapted to genuine application requirements. This paper introduces a Web-based automatic acquisition system of bilingual parallel sentence pairs. The system integrates the advantages of current system and improves its key technologies. We proposes a URL naming method in automatic discovery bilingual network and improves the extraction technology of bilingual parallel sentence pairs. Experimental results show that the methods in this paper greatly improves recalling rate of candidate bilingual network discovery. Its recall rate of obtaining bilingual parallel sentence pairs is 93% as well as accuracy rate is 96%, which proves its effectiveness. In addition, this paper also studies bilingual parallel sentence pairs inside bilingual network and obtains some primary result. Multi-group experiments of statistical machine translation prove that our method can improve the performance of machine translation system so that it can play a part in practical application of online corpora.

TI Linguistic knowledge-based vocabularies for Neural Machine Translation
SO NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING
AB Neural Networks applied to Machine Translation need a finite vocabulary to express textual information as a sequence of discrete tokens. The currently dominant subword vocabularies exploit statistically-discovered common parts of words to achieve the flexibility of character-based vocabularies without delegating the whole learning of word formation to the neural network. However, they trade this for the inability to apply word-level token associations, which limits their use in semantically-rich areas and prevents some transfer learning approaches e.g. cross-lingual pretrained embeddings, and reduces their interpretability. In this work, we propose new hybrid linguistically-grounded vocabulary definition strategies that keep both the advantages of subword vocabularies and the word-level associations, enabling neural networks to profit from the derived benefits. We test the proposed approaches in both morphologically rich and poor languages, showing that, for the former, the quality in the translation of out-of-domain texts is improved with respect to a strong subword baseline.

TI Mapping layperson medical terminology into the Human Phenotype Ontology

SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB In the medical domain there exists a terminological gap between patients and caregivers and the healthcare professionals. This gap may hinder the success of the communication between healthcare consumers and professionals in the field, with negative emotional and clinical consequences. In this work, we build a machine learning-based tool for the automatic translation between the terminology used by laypeople and that of the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). HPO is a structured vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities found in human disease. Our method uses a vector space to represent an HPO-specific embedding as the output space for a neural network model trained on vector representations of layperson versions and other textual descriptors of medical terms. We explored different output embeddings coupled to different neural network architectures for the machine translation stage. We compute a similarity measure to evaluate the ability of the model to assign an HPO term to a layperson input. The best-performing models resulted with a similarity higher than 0.7 for more than 80% of the terms, with a median between 0.98 and 1.

TI THE IMPACT OF RESPONDENTS' MULTILINGUALISM ON HUMAN EVALUATION OF
   MACHINE TRANSLATION QUALITY
SO JEZIKOSLOVLJE
AB This paper presents a study of the impact of multilingualism on the subjective method of evaluating machine translation quality. The subjectivity of this method is usually manifested in the low level of inter-coder agreement. In this preliminary research, two groups of human judges, the first comprised of monolingual and the second of bilingual respondents, evaluated the accuracy and fluency of the same set of machine-translated text segments. The segments have been translated with Google Translate. The monolingual respondents compared the MT-generated output with a human translation and the bilingual respondents with the original text. The aim of this study was to determine how the discrepancies between monolingual and bilingual respondents shape evaluation patterns with respect to the length of the evaluation process, potential deviations in the median evaluation score and the analysis of causes influencing these evaluation discrepancies. The qualitative analysis has shown that bilingual respondents in general give lower scores to output data, but need more time to complete the evaluation process than monolinguals. However, no tendency towards a higher level of inter-coder agreement has been noted in either group of human judges.

In particular, we adopt a pairwise neural network (NN) architecture, which incorporates MTE features, as well as rich syntactic and semantic embeddings, and which efficiently models complex non-linear interactions. The evaluation results show state-of-the-art performance, with sizeable contribution from both the MTE features and from the pairwise NN architecture.

AB This paper presents a method for cross-language question answering. The method combines multiple query translations in order to improve the answering precision. The combination of translations is based on their pertinence to the target document collection rather than on their grammatical correctness. The pertinence is measured by the translation perplexity with respect to the collection language model. Experimental evaluation on question answering demonstrates that the proposed approach outperforms the results obtained by the best translation machine.

AB We describe a system for the manual and automatic classification of errors in machine translation output. The system was designed based on Vilar's et al. (2006) error classification and TAUS error typology (2013) taking into consideration the target language-Slovak. Slovak is an inflectional language with a "rich morphology" and can be categorized as a synthetic language with a loose word order. The system features manual evaluation in the form of post-editing and in the detection and classification of basic errors (Language, Accuracy, Terminology or Style) made by post-editors. Beside the manual classification of errors, based on POS tagging or morphological tag annotation, it also features automatic error detection and classification into morphological errors (incorrect word form), reordering errors (word order), missing words, lexical errors (incorrect words), unknown words and punctuation. The aim of this paper is to propose a framework and design a system for the purpose of determining which error types cause a problem for a given machine translation system, when translating a text of various styles (administrative, scientific and publicistic) into an inflectional language such as Slovak.

TI Extracting Date/Time Expressions in Super-Function Based Japanese
   English Machine Translation
SO ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATIONS IN JAPAN
AB Super-function based machine translation (SFBMT), which is a type of example-based machine translation, has a feature which makes it possible to expand the coverage of examples by changing nouns into variables. However, there have been problems extracting entire date/time expressions containing parts-of-speech other than nouns, because only nouns/numbers were changed into variables. We describe a method of extracting date/time expressions for SFBMT. SFBMT uses noun determination rules to extract nouns and a bilingual dictionary to obtain the correspondence of the extracted nouns between the source and the target languages. In this method, we add a rule to extract date/time expressions and then extract date/time expressions from a Japanese English bilingual corpus. The evaluation results shows that the precision of this method for Japanese sentences is 96.7%, with a recall of 98.2%, and the precision for English sentences is 94.7%, with a recall of 92.7%.

TI A Reverse Positional Encoding Multi-Head Attention-Based Neural Machine
   Translation Model for Arabic Dialects
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Languages with a grammatical structure that have a free order for words, such as Arabic dialects, are considered a challenge for neural machine translation (NMT) models because of the attached suffixes, affixes, and out-of-vocabulary words. This paper presents a new reverse positional encoding mechanism for a multi-head attention (MHA) neural machine translation (MT) model to translate from right-to-left texts such as Arabic dialects (ADs) to modern standard Arabic (MSA). The proposed model depends on an MHA mechanism that has been suggested recently. The utilization of the new reverse positional encoding (RPE) mechanism and the use of sub-word units as an input to the self-attention layer improve this sublayer for the proposed model's encoder by capturing all dependencies between the words in right-to-left texts, such as AD input sentences. Experiments were conducted on Maghrebi Arabic to MSA, Levantine Arabic to MSA, Nile Basin Arabic to MSA, Gulf Arabic to MSA, and Iraqi Arabic to MSA. Experimental analysis proved that the proposed reverse positional encoding MHA NMT model was efficiently able to handle the open grammatical structure issue of Arabic dialect sentences, and the proposed RPE MHA NMT model enhanced the translation quality for right-to-left texts such as Arabic dialects.

AB Transfer learning via pre-training has become an important strategy for the efficient application of NLP methods in domains where only limited training data is available. This paper reports on a focused case study in which we apply transfer learning in the context of neural machine translation (French-Dutch) for cultural heritage metadata (i.e. titles of artistic works). Nowadays, neural machine translation (NMT) is commonly applied at the subword level using byte-pair encoding (BPE), because word-level models struggle with rare and out-of-vocabulary words. Because unseen vocabulary is a significant issue in domain adaptation, BPE seems a better fit for transfer learning across text varieties. We discuss an experiment in which we compare a subword-level to a character-level NMT approach. We pre-trained models on a large, generic corpus and fine-tuned them in a two-stage process: first, on a domain-specific dataset extracted from Wikipedia, and then on our metadata. While our experiments show comparable performance for character-level and BPEbased models on the general dataset, we demonstrate that the character-level approach nevertheless yields major downstream performance gains during the subsequent stages of fine-tuning. We therefore conclude that character-level translation can be beneficial compared to the popular subword-level approach in the cultural heritage domain.

TI Recurrent graph encoder for syntax-aware neural machine translation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING AND CYBERNETICS
AB Self-attention networks (SAN) have achieved promising performance in a variety of NLP tasks, e.g. neural machine translation (NMT), as they can directly build dependencies among words. But it is weaker at learning positional information than recurrent neural networks (RNN). Natural questions arise: (1) Can we design a component with RNN by directly guiding the syntax dependencies for it? (2) Whether such syntax enhanced sequence modeling component benefits existing NMT structures, e.g. RNN-based NMT and Transformer-based NMT. To answer above question, we propose a simple yet effective recurrent graph syntax encoder, dubbed RGSE, to utilize off-the-shelf syntax dependencies and its intrinsic recurrence property, such that RGSE models syntactic dependencies and sequential information (i.e. word order) simultaneously. Experimental studies on various neural machine translation tasks demonstrate that RGSE equipped RNN and Transformer models could gain consistent significant improvements over several strong syntax-aware benchmarks, with minuscule parameters increases. The extensive analysis further illustrates that RGSE does improve the syntactic and semantic preservation ability than SAN, additionally, shows superior robustness to defend syntactic noise than existing syntax-aware NMT models.

As the entire speech-to-speech translation functions are implemented into one terminal, it realizes real-time and location free speech-to-speech translation service for many language pairs. A new noise-suppression technique notably improves speech recognition performance. Corpus-based approaches of recognition, translation, and synthesis enabled wide range coverage of topic varieties and portability to other languages. Currently, we mainly focus on translation between Japanese, English and Chinese.

TI Hierarchical phrase-based translation
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB We present a statistical machine translation model that uses hierarchical phrases-phrases that contain subphrases. The model is formally a synchronous context-free grammar but is learned from a parallel text without any syntactic annotations. Thus it can be seen as combining fundamental ideas from both syntax-based translation and phrase-based translation. We describe our system's training and decoding methods in detail, and evaluate it for translation speed and translation accuracy. Using BLEU as a metric of translation accuracy, we find that our system performs significantly better than the Alignment Template System, a state-of-the-art phrase-based system.

AB Self-attention networks (SAN) have attracted a lot of interests due to their high parallelization and strong performance on a variety of NLP tasks, e.g. machine translation. Due to the lack of recurrence structure such as recurrent neural networks (RNN), SAN is ascribed to be weak at learning positional information of words for sequence modeling. However, neither this speculation has been empirically confirmed, nor explanations for their strong performances on machine translation tasks when "lacking positional information" have been explored. To this end, we propose a novel word reordering detection task to quantify how well the word order information learned by SAN and RNN. Specifically, we randomly move one word to another position, and examine whether a trained model can detect both the original and inserted positions. Experimental results reveal that: 1) SAN trained on word reordering detection indeed has difficulty learning the positional information even with the position embedding; and 2) SAN trained on machine translation learns better positional information than its RNN counterpart, in which position embedding plays a critical role. Although recurrence structure make the model more universally-effective on learning word order, learning objectives matter more in the downstream tasks such as machine translation.

TI A Unified Neural Network for Quality Estimation of Machine Translation
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB The-state-of-the-art neural quality estimation (QE) of machine translation model consists of two sub-networks that are tuned separately, a bidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN) encoder-decoder trained for neural machine translation, called the predictor, and an RNN trained for sentence-level QE tasks, called the estimator. We propose to combine the two sub-networks into a whole neural network, called the unified neural network. When training, the bidirectional RNN encoder-decoder are initialized and pre-trained with the bilingual parallel corpus, and then, the networks are trained jointly to minimize the mean absolute error over the QE training samples. Compared with the predictor and estimator approach, the use of a unified neural network helps to train the parameters of the neural networks that are more suitable for the QE task. Experimental results on the benchmark data set of the WMT17 sentence-level QE shared task show that the proposed unified neural network approach consistently outperforms the predictor and estimator approach and significantly outperforms the other baseline QE approaches.

AB Multilingual chat systems are the need of the hour for organizations who render online conversational services to their customers. This can effectively be facilitated using the robust machine translation (MT) systems. Translating user-generated contents is regarded as one of the challenging tasks for MT. As for translating conversations, it is more challenging since the meaning of any particular utterance in a conversation usually depends on its context. Moreover, chats in conversational systems are usually informal, contain code-mixed (mix of more than one language), and other grammatical inconsistencies.
   In this paper, we use state-of-the-art Transformer models to build our MT systems and to translate conversations between the customer service agents and customers. We propose a novel method which effectively selects contextual information from the source text of conversation to be translated. We also employ a terminology-based pseudo in-domain corpus mining strategy for fine-tuning our translation model. We evaluate our methods on the German-English WMT20 Shared Task on Chat Translation dataset, and obtain 61.1 and 63.9 BLEU points on evaluation test sets for English-to-German and German-to-English, respectively, surpassing the present state-of-the-art MT systems by 0.7 BLEU and 1.5 BLEU points, respectively.

TI Bi-Decoder Augmented Network for Neural Machine Translation
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has become a popular technology in recent years, and the encoder-decoder framework is the mainstream among all the methods. It is obvious that the quality of the semantic representations from encoding is very crucial and can significantly affect the performance of the model. However, existing unidirectional source-to-target architectures may hardly produce a language-independent representation of the text because they rely heavily on the specific relations of the given language pairs. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Bi-Decoder Augmented Network (BiDAN) for the neural machine translation task. Besides the original decoder which generates the target language sequence, we add an auxiliary decoder to generate back the source language sequence at the training time. Since each decoder transforms the representations of the input text into its corresponding language, jointly training with two target ends can make the shared encoder has the potential to produce a language-independent semantic space. We conduct extensive experiments on several NMT benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Sublemma-Based Neural Machine Translation
SO COMPLEXITY
AB Powerful deep learning approach frees us from feature engineering in many artificial intelligence tasks. The approach is able to extract efficient representations from the input data, if the data are large enough. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to collect large and quality data. For tasks in low-resource contexts, such as the Russian -> Vietnamese machine translation, insights into the data can compensate for their humble size. In this study of modelling Russian -> Vietnamese translation, we leverage the input Russian words by decomposing them into not only features but also subfeatures. First, we break down a Russian word into a set of linguistic features: part-of-speech, morphology, dependency labels, and lemma. Second, the lemma feature is further divided into subfeatures labelled with tags corresponding to their positions in the lemma. Being consistent with the source side, Vietnamese target sentences are represented as sequences of subtokens. Sublemma-based neural machine translation proves itself in our experiments on Russian-Vietnamese bilingual data collected from TED talks. Experiment results reveal that the proposed model outperforms the best available Russian -> Vietnamese model by 0.97 BLEU. In addition, automatic machine judgment on the experiment results is verified by human judgment. The proposed sublemma-based model provides an alternative to existing models when we build translation systems from an inflectionally rich language, such as Russian, Czech, or Bulgarian, in low-resource contexts.

AB Translations of user interfaces are an essential part of software development for the World Wide Web. Web pages are translated in three ways: by the developer as part of the normal life cyle, by the community that has a vested interest in the domain, and by machine translation. In this paper, we present an informal evaluation of the quality produced by these three approaches. We discuss the naive notion that language translations can be evaluated by doing to successive translations and evaluating the end result. The rubric used to evaluate the translations is presented.

TI Simplification of English and Bengali Sentences for Improving Quality of
   Machine Translation
SO NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS
AB Training translation systems with complex and compound sentences are generally considered computationally tough and such systems fail to process, the large syntactical information given out by these sentences. This issue subsequently, affects the overall quality of translations. On the other hand, simple sentences are shorter by nature and produce less syntactical information. Therefore, it would be safe to say that training translation systems using simple sentences only, would result in better translation output. However, training a translation system requires a large and quality parallel corpus involving two natural languages. While parallel corpus for various language pairs is abundant, such lexicons for low-resourced languages, consisting of only simple sentences are rare. In such a scenario, the development of such a parallel lexicon is the initial purpose of the present work. Building the same would require differentiating complex and/or compound sentences from the overall corpus and then converting them into simple sentences. Since, the work includes two languages, English and Bengali, different algorithms to accomplish the same, is documented in this paper. Converting complex and compound sentences to simple instances results in fragmenting sentences into two or more segments, which then needs to be aligned to make them semantically similar. Hence, a basic alignment technique has also been proposed to mitigate this problem. After developing the parallel corpus, we needed to check for its effectiveness in solving the quality issues of translation systems discussed earlier. For this, state-of-the-art translation modules like Statistical Machine Translation and Neural Machine Translation, have been trained using the developed corpus as well as with the raw parallel corpus consisting of sentences of mixed complexities. The performance of these translation models has been compared using automated as well as manual evaluation metrics. The results are promising and prove that translation systems do perform better when trained using simple sentence language pairs.

AB This paper proposes verb based machine translation (VBMT), a new approach of machine translation (MT) from English to Bangla (EtoB). For translation, it simplifies any form (i.e. simple, complex, compound, active and passive form) of English sentence into the simplest form of English sentence i.e. subject plus verb plus object. When compared with existing rule based EtoB MT schemes, VBMT doesn't employ exclusive or individual structural rules of various English sentences; it only detects the main verb from any form of English sentence and then transforms it into the simplest form of English sentence. Thus VBMT can translate from EtoB very simply, correctly and efficiently. Rule based EtoB MT is tough because it requires the matching of sentences with the stored rules. Moreover, many existing EtoB MT schemes which deploy rules are almost inefficient to translate complex or complicated sentences because it is difficult to match them with well-established rules of English grammar. VBMT is efficient because after identifying the main verb of any form of English sentence, it binds the remaining parts of speech (POS) as subject and object. VBMT has been successfully implemented for the MT of Assertive, Interrogative, Imperative, Exclamatory, Active-Passive, Simple, Complex, and Compound form of English sentences applicable in both desktop and mobile applications.

TI UPC: An Open Word-Sense Annotated Parallel Corpora for Machine
   Translation Study
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Machine translation (MT) has recently attracted much research on various advanced techniques (i.e., statistical-based and deep learning-based) and achieved great results for popular languages. However, the research on it involving low-resource languages such as Korean often suffer from the lack of openly available bilingual language resources. In this research, we built the open extensive parallel corpora for training MT models, named Ulsan parallel corpora (UPC). Currently, UPC contains two parallel corpora consisting of Korean-English and Korean-Vietnamese datasets. The Korean-English dataset has over 969 thousand sentence pairs, and the Korean-Vietnamese parallel corpus consists of over 412 thousand sentence pairs. Furthermore, the high rate of homographs of Korean causes an ambiguous word issue in MT. To address this problem, we developed a powerful word-sense annotation system based on a combination of sub-word conditional probability and knowledge-based methods, named UTagger. We applied UTagger to UPC and used these corpora to train both statistical-based and deep learning-based neural MT systems. The experimental results demonstrated that using UPC, high-quality MT systems (in terms of the Bi-Lingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) and Translation Error Rate (TER) score) can be built. Both UPC and UTagger are available for free download and usage.

AB Bodo language is a relatively low resource language. Other than the text-book, novels and some print publication of newspaper, there appears to be very few resources available in the public domain. As the technology becomes affordable there is a growing number of active Bodo internet users. It requires a technology that can bring information in their own language. Machine translation appears to be a promising solution for that purpose. In this work we build an English-Bodo Neural Machine Translation by adopting a two layered bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells that can capture the long term dependencies. As very few work has been done on English-Bodo NMT, we make our baseline model which produced a BLEU Score of 11.8. We then gradually overcome the baseline model by introducing several attention mechanism. We achieved a BLEU Score of 16.71 using the approach presented in Bandanu. Furthermore we got a better BLEU score of 17.9 when we introduced beam search with a beam width of 5. We found that the model performs very well despite the few dataset available.

AB Machine translation (MT) between natural languages is an infamously difficult problem in Natural Language Processing that is still very much being researched. This research study explores the efficacy of developing an adaptive translator using Lexical Functional Grammars. The main research objective is building a machine translator generator for multilingual communication, i.e. developing a system whose inputs are linguistic descriptions of a desired source and target language and whose output is a program that translates between the two natural languages. A bidirectional machine translator between English and Hungarian, developed as a proof-of-concept case study, is discussed. The benefits and drawbacks of this approach as generalized to MT systems are also discussed, along with possible areas of future work.

TI Acceptability of machine-translated content: A multi-language evaluation
   by translators and end-users
SO LINGUISTICA ANTVERPIENSIA NEW SERIES-THEMES IN TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB As machine translation (MT) continues to be used increasingly in the translation industry, there is a corresponding increase in the need to understand MT quality and, in particular, its impact on end-users. To date, little work has been carried out to investigate the acceptability of MT output among end-users and, ultimately, how acceptable they find it. This article reports on research conducted to address that gap. End-users of instructional content machine-translated from English into German, Simplified Chinese and Japanese were engaged in a usability experiment. Part of this experiment involved giving feedback on the acceptability of raw machine-translated content and lightly post-edited (PE) versions of the same content. In addition, a quality review was carried out in collaboration with an industry partner and experienced translation quality reviewers. The translation quality-assessment (TQA) results from translators reflect the usability and satisfaction results by end-users insofar as the implementation of light PE both increased the usability and acceptability of the PE instructions and led to satisfaction being reported. Nonetheless, the raw MT content also received good scores, especially for terminology, country standards and spelling.

TI The kinematics solving algorithm of single-axis polishing machine

AB The traditional single-axis polishing machine has simple structure and high processing efficiency, and can efficiently polish optical elements such as flat or spherical surfaces. By introducing an active polishing head to a single-axis machine and changing the manual linear translation axis to a servo motor automatically controlled one, and then a CNC single-axis polishing machine is formed to achieve automatic smoothing processing or annular error correction of the mirror surface. Based on the mechanical structure of the single-axis machine and the geometric relationship between the processing body and the moving body, this manuscript employs the matrix based model method of the serial robot to build the relationship between the coordinates of the linear translation axis and the polishing ring radius of the mirror during the processing. The model is used to build a single-axis machine position calculation algorithm, which establishes the basis for precise position control of single-axis machine.

TI An automatic evaluation metric for Ancient-Modern Chinese translation
SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
AB As a written language used for thousands of years, Ancient Chinese has some special characteristics like complex semantics as polysemy and the one-to-many alignment with Modern Chinese. Thus it may be translated in a large number of fully different but equally correct ways. In the absence of multiple references, reference-dependent evaluations like Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) cannot identify potentially correct translation results. The explore on automatic evaluation of Ancient-Modern Chinese Translation is completely lacking. In this paper, we proposed an automatic evaluation metric for Ancient-Modern Chinese Translation called DTE (Dual-based Translation Evaluation), which can be used to evaluate one-to-many alignment in the absence of multiple references. When using DTE to evaluate, we found that the proper nouns often could not be correctly translated. Hence, we designed a new word segmentation method to improve the translation of proper nouns without increasing the size of the model vocabulary. Experiments show that DTE outperforms several general evaluations in terms of similarity to the evaluation of human experts. Meanwhile, the new word segmentation method promotes the Ancient-Modern Chinese translation models perform better on proper nouns' translation, and get higher scores on both BLEU and DTE.

AB Indian language machine translation performance is hampered due to the lack of large scale multi-lingual sentence aligned corpora and robust benchmarks. Through this paper, we provide and analyse an automated framework to obtain such a corpus for Indian language neural machine translation (NMT) systems. Our pipeline consists of a baseline NMT system, a retrieval module, and an alignment module that is used to work with publicly available websites such as press releases by the government. The main contribution towards this effort is to obtain an incremental method that uses the above pipeline to iteratively improve the size of the corpus as well as improve each of the components of our system. Through our work, we also evaluate the design choices such as the choice of pivoting language and the effect of iterative incremental increase in corpus size. Our work in addition to providing an automated framework also results in generating a relatively larger corpus as compared to existing corpora that are available for Indian languages. This corpus helps us obtain substantially improved results on the publicly availableWAT evaluation benchmark and other standard evaluation benchmarks.

TI Machine translation errors and the translation process: a study across
   different languages
SO JOURNAL OF SPECIALISED TRANSLATION
AB The paper describes an experiment in which two groups of translators annotate Spanish and simplified Chinese MT output of the same English source texts (ST) using an MQM-derived annotation schema. Annotators first fragmented the ST and MT output (i.e. the target text TT) into alignment groups (AGs) and then labelled the AGs with an error code. We investigate the inter-annotator agreement of the AGs and their error annotations. Then, we correlate the average error agreement (i.e. the MT error evidence) with translation process data that we collected during the translation production of the same English texts in previous studies. We find that MT accuracy errors with higher error-evidence scores have an effect on the production and reading durations during post-editing. We also find that that from-scratch translation is more difficult for ST words which have more evident MT accuracy errors. Surprisingly, Spanish MT accuracy errors also correlate with total ST reading time for translations (post-editing and from-scratch translation) into very different languages. We conclude that expressions with MT accuracy issues into one language (English-to-Spanish) are likely to be difficult to translate also into other languages for humans and for computers - while this does not hold for MT fluency errors.

AB As a consequence of the recent advances in artificial intelligence and educational technologies, the education sector is witnessing significant changes and transformations through massive use of intelligent systems with the goal to assist students in their learning experience and teachers in delivering academic knowledge in a better way while reducing burnout and stress. Communication, knowledge acquisition, and learning are now possible anytime and anywhere through modern technologies. However, learning translation is a process that requires continuous effort, enthusiasm, and motivation from both students and instructors. While some universities adopt traditional and outdated approaches to translation instruction, others use more innovative ways. Within this context and in order to foster a student-centered translation learning approach, our work focuses on taking advantage of recent advances in machine learning to develop a chatbot to help language learners, especially translators, develop their skills by having a conversation with a chatbot and getting the appropriate Arabic translations of English sentences under study. A general framework is proposed, and a first prototype is developed using a part of bilingual corpora. Another focus of this study is the preprocessing phase used to create a sentence-based paired dataset to train the machine learning model from bilingual corpora. The preliminary results are promising.

AB Label smoothing and vocabulary sharing are two widely used techniques in neural machine translation models. However, we argue that simply applying both techniques can be conflicting and even leads to sub-optimal performance. When allocating smoothed probability, original label smoothing treats the source-side words that would never appear in the target language equally to the real target-side words, which could bias the translation model. To address this issue, we propose Masked Label Smoothing (MLS), a new mechanism that masks the soft label probability of source-side words to zero. Simple yet effective, MLS manages to better integrate label smoothing with vocabulary sharing. Our extensive experiments show that MLS consistently yields improvement over original label smoothing on different datasets, including bilingual and multilingual translation from both translation quality and model's calibration. Our code is released at PKUnlp-icler.

Our primary contribution is the application of several models of alignments for Sign Language. The model represents probabilistic relationships between properties of words, and relates them to learned underlying causes of structural variability within the domain. We developed a statistical machine translation based on generated translation memory. The model was evaluated on a big parallel corpus containing more than 800 millions of words. IBM Models have been applied to align Sign Language Corpora then we have run experimentation on a big collection of paired data between English and American Sign Language.

TI Analysis of Chinese Machine Translation Training Based on Deep Learning
   Technology
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB With the advent of the information age, people can establish good communication through Internet technology. Mechanical translation has become a key means to solve people's communication problems. However, there are still obstacles to communication between different languages. In order to solve this problem, this paper uses existing neural network technology to the English-Chinese bidirectional machine translation model in the field of marine science and technology. Based on deep learning technology, we collect Chinese and English abstracts and partial full texts of Chinese and English papers with marine science and technology as the key words and build a professional corpus in English and Chinese about marine science and technology. In the Chinese-English bidirectional translation model, the local weight sharing is introduced into the Chinese encoder and the English encoder, and the output of the Chinese encoder sublayer and the English encoder sublayer is fused as the output of the respective encoders, and the performance of the translation model is evaluated using the BLEU parameters. Through the training of the translation model, compared with the transformer model, the BLEU value of the model with local weight sharing and encoder sublayer fusion output is improved by 1.6 and 3.8 in the Chinese-English and English-Chinese translation directions, respectively. The PPL values in the Chinese-English and English-Chinese translation directions decreased by 18.72% and 14.62%, respectively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the language translation model. Experiments show that the research on machine language adaptive technology based on deep learning can more smoothly realize the two-way translation of literature in the field of marine science and technology. Compared with traditional mechanical translation, this paper proposes a translation model based on the deep neural algorithm, which improves the effect of model training by constructing a Chinese-English corpus with the theme of marine science and technology.

AB The data sparsity and the morphological difference between Chinese and Mongolian are the main problems in Mongolian-Chinese statistical machine translation (SMT). In this paper, we propose a novel method to construct morpheme-based translation model by using Mongolian morpheme as the pivot language. First, we train Mongolian-Morpheme SMT and Morpheme-Chinese SMT system, achieving a balance in the morphology of the language pair. Then we construct a new phrase table via these two systems to enrich translation knowledge without any additional bilingual resources, which is suitable for low-resource language pairs. Finally we incorporate this phrase table to our Mongolian-Chinese SMT system in two ways: by using multiple decoding paths and by the combination of two phrase tables. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with a maximum improvement of 1.37 BLEU points increment over baseline.

AB With the increasing availability of images, multimodal machine translation (MMT) is leading a vibrant field. Model structure and multimodal information introduction are the hotspot focused by MMT researchers nowadays. Among the existing models, transformer model has reached the state-of-the-art performance in many translation tasks. However, we observe that the performance of MMT based on transformer is highly unstable since transformer model is sensitive to the fluctuation of hyper-parameters especially the number of layers, the dimension of word embeddings and hidden states, the number of multi-heads. Moreover, different ways of introducing image information also have significant influence on the performance of MMT. In this paper, we exploit some integration strategies which depend on different tasks to make collaborative decisions on the final translation results to enhance the stability of MMT based on transformer. Furthermore, we combine different ways of introducing image information to improve the semantic expression of input. Extensive experiments on Multi30K dataset demonstrate that ensemble learning in MMT which integrates text and image features exactly obtain more stable and better translation performance and the best result yields improvement of 5.12 BLEU points over the strong Transformer baseline set in our experiments.

AB This paper describes a novel approach to handling translation divergences in a Generation-Heavy Hybrid Machine Translation (GHMT) system. The translation divergence problem is usually reserved for Transfer and Interlingual MT because it requires a large combination of complex lexical and structural mappings. A major requirement of these approaches is the accessibility of large amounts of explicit symmetric knowledge for both source and target languages. This limitation renders Transfer and Interlingual approaches ineffective in the face of structurally-divergent language pairs with asymmetric resources. GHMT addresses the more common form of this problem, source-poor/target-rich, by fully exploiting symbolic and statistical target-language resources. This non-interlingual non-transfer approach, is accomplished by using target-language lexical semantics, categorial variations and subcategorization frames to overgenerate multiple lexico-structural variations from a target-glossed syntactic dependency of the source-language sentence. The symbolic overgeneration, which accounts for different possible translation divergences, is constrained by a statistical target-language model.

TI Why do many translators resist post-editing? A sociological analysis
   using Bourdieu's concepts
SO JOURNAL OF SPECIALISED TRANSLATION
AB More and more language service providers (LSPs) are now using a post-edited machine translation (PEMT) production model in addition to, or instead of, the traditional Translation-Editing-Proofreading (TEP) model, in order to cope with the growing demand for translation. As a result, translators are increasingly expected to work as post-editors in the PEMT process, but the reluctance of translators or resistance to this expectation is evident as they feel their professional skills and identities are sidelined by technology (Kelly 2014; Cadwell et al. 2017). This article attempts to provide a theoretical description of the translators' resistance to post-editing work using Bourdieu's concepts: capital, field and habitus. Bourdieu's sociological framework allows us to examine the positions of translators and post-editors in the field of translation and its mechanism of emotional impacts. For this purpose, I draw on qualitative and quantitative data collected in a focus group study with 16 UK translation project managers, a survey of 155 company websites and two training manuals for post-editors. The study will provide industry stakeholders, as well as translation educators, useful conceptualisation tools to understand the current situation surrounding social agency of translators and post-editors.

AB In this work, we customized a neural machine translation system for translation of subtitles in the domain of entertainment. The neural translation model was adapted to the subtitling content and style and extended by a simple, yet effective technique for utilizing intersentence context for short sentences such as dialog turns. The main contribution of the paper is a novel subtitle segmentation algorithm that predicts the end of a subtitle line given the previous word-level context using a recurrent neural network learned from human segmentation decisions. This model is combined with subtitle length and duration constraints established in the subtitling industry. We conducted a thorough human evaluation with two post-editors (English-to-Spanish translation of a documentary and a sitcom). It showed a notable productivity increase of up to 37% as compared to translating from scratch and significant reductions in human translation edit rate in comparison with the post-editing of the baseline non-adapted system without a learned segmentation model.

After a general discussion of the structure of a decoder a particular implementation is discussed which allows for word-to-word and phrase-to-phrase translation. Word reordering is used to improve the translation quality. We analyze the effect of the length of this reordering window on the search space and the translation quality. Results for Chinese-to-English and Arabic-to-English translation tasks are presented.

AB In this paper, we present a substantial step in better understanding the SOTA sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) pretraining for neural machine translation (NMT). We focus on studying the impact of the jointly pretrained decoder, which is the main difference between Seq2Seq pretraining and previous encoderbased pretraining approaches for NMT. By carefully designing experiments on three language pairs, we find that Seq2Seq pretraining is a double-edged sword: On one hand, it helps NMT models to produce more diverse translations and reduce adequacy-related translation errors. On the other hand, the discrepancies between Seq2Seq pretraining and NMT finetuning limit the translation quality (i.e., domain discrepancy) and induce the over-estimation issue (i.e., objective discrepancy). Based on these observations, we further propose simple and effective strategies, named in-domain pretraining and input adaptation to remedy the domain and objective discrepancies, respectively. Experimental results on several language pairs show that our approach can consistently improve both translation performance and model robustness upon Seq2Seq pretraining.

AB Supervised Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems currently achieve impressive translation quality for many language pairs. One of the key features of a correct translation is the ability to perform word sense disambiguation (WSD), i.e., to translate an ambiguous word with its correct sense. Existing evaluation benchmarks on WSD capabilities of translation systems rely heavily on manual work and cover only few language pairs and few word types. We present MuCoW, a multilingual contrastive test suite that covers 16 language pairs with more than 200 000 contrastive sentence pairs, automatically built from word-aligned parallel corpora and the wide-coverage multilingual sense inventory of BabelNet. We evaluate the quality of the ambiguity lexicons and of the resulting test suite on all submissions from 9 language pairs presented in the WMT19 news shared translation task, plus on other 5 language pairs using pretrained NMT models. The MuCoW test suite is available at http://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/MuCoW.

This paper outlines such a translation system that is designed to take advantage of massive corpora (prepared by Google and Kaleido K Translation) and is designed on three key fundamentals. Simplicity - to be simple in design to be portable across different languages pairs, Adaptability - to compensate for the evolution of language, and Multiplicity - to determine a final translation from as many candidate translations as possible. Lastly, the translation direction of Korean to English will be used to provide examples and explanations.

AB Machine translation is a popular test bed for research in neural sequence-to-sequence models but despite much recent research, there is still a lack of understanding of these models. Practitioners report performance degradation with large beams, the under-estimation of rare words and a lack of diversity in the final translations. Our study relates some of these issues to the inherent uncertainty of the task, due to the existence of multiple valid translations for a single source sentence, and to the extrinsic uncertainty caused by noisy training data. We propose tools and metrics to assess how uncertainty in the data is captured by the model distribution and how it affects search strategies that generate translations. Our results show that search works remarkably well but that models tend to spread too much probability mass over the hypothesis space. Next, we propose tools to assess model calibration and show how to easily fix some shortcomings of current models. As part of this study, we release multiple human reference translations for two popular benchmarks.

AB It is acknowledged that neural machine translation(NMT) can be improved by considering context information. Nevertheless, the progress of context-aware NMT has encountered some challenges. Firstly, effectively utilizing valuable information contained in context is still challenging. Moreover, as the number of sentences increases, the parameters of context-aware NMT models will surge, which costs computing power and prevents them from transferring to other translation tasks. Therefore, we propose a hierarchical shallow attention structure for document-level NMT to tackle the problems above. We employ hierarchical encoders to extract both sentence and context information. Then the integration of hierarchical attention is incorporated with the self-attention of the target sentences in the decoding phase. Moreover, we employ shallow attention to reduce model complexity. Assessments of several linguistic phenomena demonstrate that the proposed approach can balance model complexity and translation performance while getting SOTA BLEU scores in several translation tasks.

AB Impressive neural machine translation (NMT) results are achieved in domains with large-scale, high quality bilingual training corpora. However, transferring to a target domain with significant domain shifts but no bilingual training corpora remains largely unexplored. To address the aforementioned setting of unsupervised domain adaptation, we propose a novel adversarial training procedure for NMT to leverage the widespread monolingual data in target domain. Two discriminative networks, namely the domain discriminator and pair discriminator, are introduced to guide the translation model. The domain discriminator evaluates whether the sentences generated by the translation model are indistinguishable from the ones in target domain. The pair discriminator assesses whether the generated sentences are paired with the source-side sentences. The translation model acts as an adversary to the two discriminators, which aims to generate sentences uneasily discriminated by the discriminators. We tested our approach on Chinese-English and English-German translation tasks. Experimental results show that our approaches achieve great success in unsupervised domain adaptation for NMT.

AB Both human and machine translation play a central role in cross-lingual transfer learning: many multilingual datasets have been created through professional translation services, and using machine translation to translate either the test set or the training set is a widely used transfer technique. In this paper, we show that such translation process can introduce subtle artifacts that have a notable impact in existing cross-lingual models. For instance, in natural language inference, translating the premise and the hypothesis independently can reduce the lexical overlap between them, which current models are highly sensitive to. We show that some previous findings in cross-lingual transfer learning need to be reconsidered in the light of this phenomenon. Based on the gained insights, we also improve the state-of-the-art in XNLI for the translate-test and zero-shot approaches by 4.3 and 2.8 points, respectively.
